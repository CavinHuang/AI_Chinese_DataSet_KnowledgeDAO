Given the line the error is on, it looks like you're trying to run an HTML file. Further I'm assuming you ran something like:\nwget http://git.openembedded.org/openembedded/tree/contrib/angstrom/omap3-mkcard.sh\nchmod +x omap3-mkcard.sh\n./omap3-mkcard.sh ...\n\nIf you look at the source of that:\nwget -O- http://git.openembedded.org/openembedded/tree/contrib/angstrom/omap3-mkcard.sh | less\n\n...

If your USB drive doesn't show up, reformat it as FAT32. \n\nA: Installing Ubuntu in a pen drive is a bad choice. However, you can always install Ubuntu on an external hard disk if you don't want Ubuntu in the internal hard disk.\nInstalling Ubuntu on external hard disk is much simple! Just plug in the hard disk. Run Ubuntu setup and choose the external disk while installing. Follow instructions during installation and you're good to go.\nYou need to change the boot order through BIOS, so that whenever you want to boot Ubuntu, you just insert the hard disk and the computer will automatically boot Ubuntu.\nYou can use this hard disk to run Ubuntu on any other computer as well, if it meets the minimum requirements needed to run Ubuntu.\nNote :\n\n\n*\n\n*The only problem arrives in this method is the proprietary drivers that are needed for some hardware like Broadcom, Synaptics, ATI, Nvidia are different for different machines. You can install these drivers the first time you get the problem on your machine. \n\n\nI hope this solves your problem.\n\nA: The answer is yes, of course. You can finish it in this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*assuming you have two usb keys, one of them should be used as the bootable installation source, that means you can write the Ubuntu iso (let's say ubuntu14.04, \"trusty-desktop-amd64.iso\", you can find it from the ftp of ubuntu) to the usb drive by using for example a software named “ultraiso\" or other similar; kindly note, this usb drive could be replaced by a CD of ubuntu iso; another one pen drive is to be installed the ubuntu with; you should make sure that this usb is better in usb3.0 or better in writing speed. (I know some usb3.0  with sli chip could reach more than 150m/s, that should be perfect option. if the writing speed is slow, or with usb2.0 interface, you will be not satisfied with it.)\n\n*after you have prepared the iso installation source and objective pen drive (it could be external hard drive), you can install the system as normal method, just be careful when it come to the partition step, \"installaton type\" named, choose \"something else\" or \"others\", and choose the right objective local disk from \"Device for boot loader installation\" and the upper position with free space, note it with /dev/sdx, x means your pendrive you need to installation. DON'T USE a swap or boot partition, just use / with ext4 format to install. then it goes on...\n\n*if you want to boot from your installed Ubuntu system, do not forget to enable booting from USB in your computer's BIOS setting, or in some computer you can choose the boot media from starting the computer.\n\n*Be clear, an installation like this will update your grub catalogue with your xp system, it means you will find the option to start to xp system when you choose to boot your pen-drive, besides your Ubuntu system. you can disable it by edit /etc/defult/grub, or just unplug the hard disk when your install your Ubuntu system (I mean release it from your computer in hard ware, by disconnect...I guess it is more complicate..)\nGood luck, hope to get your successful feedback!\nI think you should also refer to these two articles:\nHow to install Ubuntu on a usb stick\nHow do I install Ubuntu to a USB key?

Thanks\n\nA: I do not clear solution. But I can help you to find real users.\nFirst solution:\nin /etc/passwd, last column showing default shell/command. In Ubuntu it is usually /bin/bash, but it is not a rule. So you can try:\n\nsudo grep '/bin/bash' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1\n\nAlso usually real users home folder located in /home. You can try:\n\nsudo grep '/home/' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1\n\nOr both of them:\n\nsudo grep -E '/home.*/bin/bash' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1\n\nSecond solution:\nThere is also a file /etc/shadow, where in second column encrypted users passwords.  System programs and daemons do not have passwords, usually. Here you can try:\n\nsudo awk -F: '$2 != \"*\" && $2 !~ /^!/ { print $1, \" - has pwd\" }' /etc/shadow\n\nBut please understand, all this solution not 'clear'. Sometimes users can create there home folders at other places, they can login without passwords and their default shell/command can be any, such as zsh , sh , ksh etc...\n\nA: Another way to do this would be\ngetent passwd | tr \":\" \" \" | awk \"\\$3 >= $(grep UID_MIN /etc/login.defs | cut -d \" \" -f 2) { print \\$1 }\" | sort| uniq|sed -e 's/nobody//g'\n\n", "Q: How to make Terminal settings to default?

It is a great monitoring application which also shows you the niceness of each process running on your box.\n\nA: There is an easier way than using the -o flag.  The -l (lowercase L) flag of the ps command displays the nice values and current priority values of the specified processes.\nps -l PID\n\nps -lu USERNAME\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Blatantly swiped from IBM, https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/com.ibm.aix.performance/display_process_prior_ps.htm\n\nA: The -o flag allows you to specify columns. If you want to see your nice level, this would be in the NI column. So to see all processes with their nice level, do something like:ps ax -o pid,ni,cmdThis will list the process ID, the nice level, and the actual command.\n\n\nExample:\n  $ps ax -o pid,ni,cmd\n  PID  NI CMD\n    1   0 /sbin/init\n    2  -5 [kthreadd]\n    3   - [migration/0]\n    4  -5 [ksoftirqd/0]\n    5   - [watchdog/0]\n    6   - [migration/1]\n    7  -5 [ksoftirqd/1]\n    8   - [watchdog/1]\n\n\nA: You can also use the /proc filesystem. If you want to find the nice level of process 3236, type:\ncat /proc/3236/stat\n\nThe process priority (a positive integer: bigger means higher scheduling priority) and the nice level are fields 18 and 19. Unfortunately, the nice value is printed as an unsigned integer, which means, if it's negative, that it will appear as a large integer near 2^32. For instance, I started process 3236 with the command /bin/nice -n 19 python. This is what /proc/3236/stat looks like:\n3236 (python) R 3230 3226 2145 34816 0 0 0 0 0 0 413750 51571 42 82 1 4294967277 4 0 21169489 267072106496 1718609 18446744073709551615 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe priority and nice values are 1 and 4294967277. 4294967277 is -19 rendered as a 32-bit unsigned integer. /proc is convenient if you want to examine properties of a process in a program.\nHere is the man page for the /proc filesystem.\n", "Q: Image optimization with imageOptim using bash. How to get a summary for a whole batch instead of one image I am using imageOptim to optimize images on my server.\nIt took me quite some time to learn rudimentary bash scripting to able to optimize all images in all my first level directories. My script looks as below and from functional point of view it does exactly what I want:\nfor dir in mydir/*/\ndo\n    sudo jpegoptim --strip-all -t \"$dir\"*.jpg\ndone\n\nThe problem is aesthetic. When I run the script it outputs the following:\nmydir/dir_1/img_1.jpg axb 24bit N JFIF  [OK] 2234 --> 1861 bytes (16.70%), optimized.\n...\nmydir/dir_1/img_16.jpg axb 24bit N JFIF  [OK] 2234 --> 1861 bytes (16.70%), optimized.\nAverage compression (16 files): 7.26% (8k)\nmydir/dir_2/img_1.jpg axb 24bit N JFIF  [OK] 2234 --> 1861 bytes (16.70%), optimized.\n...\nmydir/dir_2/img_6.jpg axb 24bit N JFIF  [OK] 2234 --> 1861 bytes (16.70%), optimized.\nAverage compression (6 files): 7.26% (8k)\n\nIt outputs the line Average compression (6 files): 7.26% (8k) because I asked for a summary with the -t flag. But I do not want to get all information about each individual image. When I try to suppress it with -t -q or -tq or -q -t (I tried them all because I am not sure it it matters) it showed no information at all.\nIdeally I just want to see one number - how much size have I saved.\nBecause this is my first bash script (I struggled for an hour with that loop :-( ), my skills currently are not sufficient to solve my problem.\n\nA: You can try this oneliner using find and perl:\nsudo find . -type d -exec  sh -c \"./jpegoptim --strip-all -t {}/*.jpg\" \\; | perl -e '@a=<>; $a=join(\"\", @a); @b = $a =~ /%\\s+\\((\\d+)k\\)/g; foreach my $n (@b) {$sum = $sum + $n}; print \"Total saved ${sum}k\\n\"'\n\nYou need to copy jpegoptim in the directory where you start the find command of course.\nA bash loop is not really needed, a find can filter directories with -d type.\nThe perl part will just parse for \"% (the saved size per dir k)\" and sum all the values before printing a single line with just the sum.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*find . -type d only returns the directories.\n\n*-exec <command> \\; will start the given command for each directory\n\n*sh -c \"\" is required as we need a shell to interpret the *.jpg wildcard.\n\n*the whole output is piped | to perl\n\n*perl first create an array with stdin (<>, the diamond operator), @a.\n\n*Then joined into a string, $a\n\n*@b = $a =~ /%\\s+\\((\\d+)k\\)/g will put in array @b all the matched strings included in the average compression summary lines using a regular expression\n\n*Finally foreach my $n (@b) {$sum = $sum + $n} sum all arrays values before printing the result\n\n\nA: After hours of improving my basic unix/bash skills I found what I think is an amazing way to do this. It is so simple that I am surprised that I wasted so much time. So here is the code:\ndu -s mydir/\nfor dir in mydir/*/\ndo\n    sudo jpegoptim --strip-all -q \"$dir\"*.jpg\ndone\ndu -s mydir/\n\nThat's it the difference between the first and the second output will give me how much space I have saved in KB. du -s mydir/ will tell me the size of the folder before optimization, the same one in the end - after optimization. \nIf I would be better at bash, I would be able to save the first one in some variable, subtract the second. But even this is good for me.\n", "Q: Libpcap not found in /usr/lib or /lib after apt installation I installed jnetpcap but it showed error that libpcap.so is not found, so I used\nsudo apt-get install libpcap-dev\n\nbut when I grep libpcap in /lib and /usr/lib it is not there, am I missing something?\n\nA: If you need the library file, you don't have to install the development package. libpcap-dev is the package containing the files needed to develop and compile own programs using the functionalities offered by libpcap.\nThe dynamic library, the .so file, is located in a package which doesn't have -dev in its name.\nOn my system, Ubuntu 13.10, it is located in the libpcap0.8 package.\nSo I did \n$ sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8\n\nand then looked if the .so file was well installed and ready to use by the system :\n$ sudo ldconfig -p|grep libpcap\n    libpcap.so.0.8 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcap.so.0.8\n\nPlease note that using ldconfig -p and searching for the library in its output looks more reliable to me because the .so file are not always installed in /lib or /usr/lib as you can see.\nOf course, displaying the list of files provided by the package can show you in which directory the .so file is installed :\n$ dpkg -L libpcap0.8\n\nA last word, if the output of ldconfig -p doesn't show the library in its output, you can regenerate the list of shared libraries by typing :\n$ sudo ldconfig\n\n", "Q: Problems when trying to upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 When I was trying to upgrade my server from ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04 I was facing problems with some packages.

This can be dumped to a file, which after necessary corrections are made, can be fed back to sfdisk. [To OP: Please edit your Question and include the output of sudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda] \nDump a copy of partition table with:\nsudo sfdisk -d /dev/sda > sda-backup.txt\n\nwhich for you would look something like this:\n\n# partition table of /dev/sda\nunit: sectors\n\n/dev/sda1 : start=   616448, size=256825177, Id= 7, bootable\n/dev/sda2 : start=452753408, size= 31457279, Id= 7\n/dev/sda3 : start=484210688, size=  4184064, Id= c\n/dev/sda4 : start=257433598, size=195319810, Id= 5\n/dev/sda5 : start=257433600, size=195319808, Id=83\n\n\n\n*Open the file with root privilege, created in the previous step, using text editor of your choice. In the example I'll use nano.\nsudo nano sda-backup.txt\n\n(sda-backup.txt assuming the file is in the current directory, else repalce it with the file's absolute path.)\nChange the old size of sda1 (256825177) to the corrected size (256817150) so that your new partition table dump would look something like:\n\n# partition table of /dev/sda\nunit: sectors\n\n/dev/sda1 : start=   616448, size=256817150, Id= 7, bootable\n/dev/sda2 : start=452753408, size= 31457279, Id= 7\n/dev/sda3 : start=484210688, size=  4184064, Id= c\n/dev/sda4 : start=257433598, size=195319810, Id= 5\n/dev/sda5 : start=257433600, size=195319808, Id=83\n\n\nSave the file (Ctrl+O for nano) and close the editor (Ctrl+X for nano).\n\n*Feeding back the corrected partition details to the partition table using the sfdisk command:\nsudo sfdisk /dev/sda < sda-backup.txt\n\n\n*Confirm if the problem is resolved by running parted on your disk device:\nsudo parted /dev/sda unit s print\n\n\n*If step 9 confirm that the partition table is fixed, you can then use GParted or other partition editors with the device.\n\nThe GParted documentition also suggests an alternative method, using testdisk to scan the disk device to rebuild the partition table. The testdisk application is included on GParted Live. So if you are not comfortable with the command-line way, you can try the alternative.\nsource\n\nA: Download a currently supported release ( 12.04 or 13.10 ), boot it up, and backup any data you want to save from your current install.  Then use fdisk to delete partitions 5 and 4, and then reinstall.\n\nA: Rusty's suggestion should work, but it's a bit intimidating. The same thing can be done with fdisk a bit more simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch fdisk on the disk by typing sudo fdisk /dev/sda.\n\n*Verify that you're working on the right disk by typing p to see the partition table and verify that it shows the same partitions you've posted.\n\n*Type d and, when prompted for a partition number, type 1.\n\n*Type n to create a new partition. When prompted, enter p for the partition type, 1 for the partition number (actually, I think that fdisk won't prompt for this detail), 616448 for the first sector, and 257433597 (the start point of the extended partition minus 1) for the last sector. (That last-sector value may be the default, in which case you can just hit Enter.)\n\n*Type p to verify that the partitions are correct. They should look just like what you've got now, except that the end point of /dev/sda1 should be one sector before the start of /dev/sda4.\n\n*Type w to save your changes and exit.\n\n\nWhether you follow my procedure or rusty's, be aware that there's a chance that the filesystem within /dev/sda1 thinks that it can use beyond sector 257,433,597. If so, repairing the disk in this way could cause problems on that partition. There's really no way around this problem, and avoding it by not repairing your current problem runs the risk of damaging your partition table in a way that will cause /dev/sda5 to disappear or its contents to be damaged, so fixing the problem is definitely in order. To mitigate the risk of damage to /dev/sda1, though, I recommend you run CHKDSK in Windows (or use its GUI front-ends) to verify that integrity of /dev/sda1. I'm not positive, but I'd expect that CHKDSK would detect a too-small container partition. You might need to do a filesystem resize to fix the problem if the partition is too small for the filesystem -- but do this after resizing the partition to minimize the risk of damaging /dev/sda5. All this is largely precautionary, though; there's a good chance that the filesystem in /dev/sda1 isn't sized to the very end of /dev/sda1, in which case resizing the partition in the way that I and rusty suggest won't cause problems. (We're both telling you to do the same thing; we just differ in the tools used to do the job.)\n\nA: When resizing/moving in GParted there is an additional option \"Align to:\" it lists 3 options: \n\n\n*\n\n*MiB\n\n*Cylinder / choose this one and try again -it worked for me\n\n*None\n\n\nI found it here when I had the same problem.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1980664&p=12319906#post12319906\n\nA: If you've access to any windows machine, simply open partition manager formate it to NTFS.

If you are using Gedit, the correct folder might be ~/.local/share/gedit/styles.)\n\nA: You need to use elevated privileges to modify files you don't own. So, instead of gedit filename, you'd use gksudo gedit filename. Or, instead of nano filename, you'd use sudo nano filename. Similarly, instead of mv, you'd need sudo mv.\nOf course, you should be sure want to modify something that isn't in your home directory.

This has nothing to do with encryption or CSS so installing updated libraries or switching distributions probably won't help.\nIt is also my experience that Disney are notorious for doing this with their recent DVD releases (including almost anything from Pixar).\nThere are a couple of techniques that usually work for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try playing dvdnav:// rather than dvd:// in mplayer. This will show the DVD menus, which you can often navigate to the correct title. If you pass the -quiet option to mplayer it sometimes prints out which titles it it is switching to, which will reveal the correct title once the main feature starts playing.\n\n*Use xine to play the DVD, and navigate the menus to the main feature as above. Once the movie is playing, dragging the playbar backwards and forwards causes the title number to be briefly shown in the status display. You can then use this title number as the argument to mplayer dvd://<titlenum>, or in VLC or your application of choice.\n\n*If all else fails, I reboot into Windows and use Media Player Classic to play the DVD. This has not failed so far, and shows the correct title number in its status display. Much as I hate having to use Windows software to work around a problem in Linux, I have had to resort to this with a couple of particularly stubborn disks.\nIt may be possible to use other software that I haven't tried; the important point is that you must navigate through the DVD menus because only the menus \"know\" which of the DVD titles contains the actual movie.\n\nA: I unchecked \"No Disc Menus\" in VLC. - when you select 'Open Disc' a popup window opens.

There are plenty guides out there who deal with that topic. e.g https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\nI'd recommended for you though to use 64 bit ubuntu, since the i5 core allows you to and the amount of ram you're currently running is enough.\n\nA: if you think you have problem with boot loader then boot from live ubuntu cd and go to termianl by ctlr+alt+T  and just use the command below,\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\nthis help me whenever i have problem after install ubuntu alongside with windows, \nhope this will help you too.

Retrieving the files from the windows drive should be possible. But you will have to re-install windows, if you still want it. Be carefull when you do this 'cause you will have to look out for not deleting the ubuntu files. \nMaybe you have luck if windows installer finds the existing files. \nTo retrieve the files you have to go the filemanager under devices should stand your harddrive under or above computer.

For instance, ctrl+alt+7 will place the window in the top left quarter of the screen, resizing it appropriately. ctrl+alt+8 will place the window in the top half of the screen, maximizing horizontally; similarly, ctrl-alt-4 will place it in the left half, maximizing vertically.\nThis makes it very easy to \"tile\" windows in a non-overlapping fashion and is a huge time-saver for arranging windows.\nSadly, these shortcuts are almost unusable on compact laptops (i.e. without a numpad, so basically everything under 15\" screen size), as they lack a dedicated numpad. Some have an \"overlaid\" numpad, accessible by some arcane key combination, which makes things very cumbersome as the sequence becomes \"enable keypad - place window - disable keypad\". Some others simply lack numpad functionality.\nIs there a way or alternative shortcut for Unity to use on these systems?  I'm thinking something using the Super key which is already used extensively by Unity, but I couldn't find such feature.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install Compiz Config Setting Manager (ccsm):\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Look for Grid → Binding tab\n\n*Set whatever shortcuts you like.

In theory you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the original version of a package (using apt-cache policy and the apt-get install package==version syntax)\n\n*Upgrade with debdelta\nBut that's a silly idea. The sum filesize of the original archive plus all the incremental updates will be far in excess of an updated package. Plus the CPU time required to install it is much higher.\nIf you have a locally centralised copy of packages (like an out-of-date mirror), I can start to appreciate why you might want to do this but again, if there's more than one client computer involved, updating that mirror seems like a better solution.\n\nPurely from a syntax point of view, this is from man debdelta-upgrade:\ndebdelta-upgrade [OPTION]...

I've tried with dosbox and dosemu. Dosbox is supposed to support 127 simultaneous files, and dosemu has the config.sys file in which you can set this limit.

The number of files you can open from a single process it has to do with the number of available file handles, in this case 20 for msdos systems, 5 for stderr, stdin, stdout, stdaux, sdtprn.

I currently have 12.04 and Ubuntu 13.10 installed.\nWhen AMD / ATI tells me that the latest 14.3 Beta driver requires:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xorg/Xserver 7.4 and above (up to 1.15)\n\n*Linux kernel 2.6 or above (up to 3.13)\n\n*glibc version 2.2 or 2.3\n\n*POSIX Shared Memory (/dev/shm) support is required for 3D applications\n\n\n...does this mean that if I had a distro with all those things but later, newer version, that the driver would still run? Ipso facto, if I wanted to try the 12.10 driver with the latest, or more current software, would it still work since the requirements are below what AMD says is required. For instance, if driver A requires X Server 1.13, and I have 1.15, would the driver work, or would I need that specific X Server?\nIs this why people downgrade Xorg?\n\nA: I very recently installed that 14.3 beta driver that ATI provides. This was my system specs and I am using Ubuntu 13.10.\n\n\n*\n\n*X.Org/X Server - 1.14.5\n\n*Kernel 3.11.0\n\n*Eglibc version - 2.17\n\n\nSo that clearly tells you the story. You dont need to be that specific. \nI would suggest that you follow the installer notes and also check the release notes(I suppose you have already) before installing. If anything goes wrong, start a tty session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 then use the command \nsudo aticonfig --uninstall\n\nto uninstall the driver you have. Then reboot with,\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nThis way you can uninstall the driver if you encounter a problem after installing the driver.

The same clickpad seems to be used in the T440 and W540 models as well. I would like to turn off the touchpad but still be able to use the trackpoint. However, the new clickpad notebooks do not have physical mouse buttons. Instead regions on the touchpad must be mapped to the mouse buttons left, middle, right. I.e. simply turning off the touchpad in the ubuntu/unity settings would disable the mouse buttons as well. In other words, I want the touchpad to work as a button only with three regions corresponding to the traditional mouse buttons (scrolling is not important to me).\nThere is a lot of info on the web how to configure the touchpad/trackpoint:\ne.g. thinkwiki or on askubuntu\nbut this information seems to be outdated.\nWhat is the proper (modern) way to make persistent changes to the\ntouchpad/trackpoint configuration in Ubuntu 14.04 (or 13.10)?\nI found this solution and tried it with Ubuntu 14.04 alpha:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"t440 top buttons\"\n    MatchDriver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"60% 0 0 0 40% 60% 0 0\" #Emulate right and midle buttons\n    Option \"Synaptics Area\" \"0 0 0 1\" #disable moving but not buttons\nEndSection\n\nPut the preceding configuration into a file named e.g. 99-carbonx1clickpad.conf and save it in the folder /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nThe effect is that the 3 upper regions of the clickpad are properly mapped but the touchpad movement is not turned off (i.e. the mouse can still be moved around).\nWhy is the movement still turned on?\nIs there some ubuntu specific process that overrides the settings in the xorg.conf.d folder? \nUpdate1:\nSome more research revealed the priorities by which the xorg config is read (if this is still up to date).

I have 16gb ram, I can use \"sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\" to clear the cache, but only until its not filled up or I wont be able to open a terminal. This has happened from 12.04 to 13.10 with the same laptop, didnt happen with the previous laptop with the 12.04. How does Linux manage the in cache memory, how does he know when to delete? i have no idea how to fix this issue.. \n\nA: There is no need to manage, monitor or clear the Linux cache manually during normal operations, and no performance benefit in doing so.\nThe purpose of the cache is to store recently-accessed data from disk so that subsequent attempts to read it complete more quickly. This is why loading a large document is typically much faster the second time around. However, the memory is still considered \"free\" by Linux and can be re-used instantaneously if there is a need for more memory (e.g. you load a new program or document), so clearing the cache does not achieve anything. The drop_caches control is there to help developers with benchmarking and testing, not for ordinary users.\nIt is not possible to say what is causing your slow program loading without more information, but it almost certainly has nothing to do with the cache.

I have a Nvidia graphics card running with Nouveau drivers which I keep disabled (at boot) using bbswitch in Ubuntu 12.04.\nBumblebee always kept the card on, so I uninstalled it, and installed the bbswitch module by downloading the source code and compiling, according to these instructions here \nhttps://wenlong.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/disable-the-nvidia-discrete-graphic-card-in-a-nvidia-optimus-laptop/\nHow can I make sure that a program like a game is run using the Nvidia card? I don't have problems with switching the card ON or OFF using the terminal.\n\nA: I found out by trial that the bbswitch daemon alone can only turn the power on for the card. The driver is not loaded and card is not functional. Installing bumblebee is the solution. If uninstalling bbswitch manually doesn't work (using purge bbswitch-dkms) bumblebee will uninstall it automatically. \nOther things I found out by experience: sometimes bumblebee may not install itself properly or fails to automatically keep the dedicated card switched off, in which case purge bumblebee and reinstall. \nRunning bumblebee with primus is supposed to give better performance than the default virtualgl. Primus is included with bumblebee 3.1 onwards at the time of writing so there's no need to install primus manually. \nIf the command \nprimusrun <<APPLICATION NAME>>\n\ndoesn't work, use \noptirun -b primus <<APPLICATION NAME>>\n\nUseful links:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/02/bumblebee-31-released-with-primus.html\nhttp://techies.ncsu.edu/wiki/bumblebee\nDo your research before installing and using if you are a newbie :)\n", "Q: Why do some processes use swap and others don't? I experience from time to time when I'm working heavily, that my systems (Ubuntu 13.10) freezes. Syslog says, that a process had to be killed to to memory shortage.\nKilled process 4693 (chromium-browse) total-vm:1386284kB, anon-rss:31688kB, file-rss:3424kB\n\nThat happens even if my swap is pretty much empty. I do have 4GB RAM and 4GB Swap partition.\nTop says:\nKiB Mem:   3932056 total,  2828880 used\nKiB Swap:  4079612 total,   332492 used,\n\nSo plenty of room available. But then I found out, that some processes are not using swap at all. They seem to eat all my physical RAM without even considering swapping some pages to disk. I used \"top\"'s SWAP column to verify SWAP usage per process.\nThese are e.g. Chromium web browser and VirtualBox. Others, like Firefox, Netbeans, etc. are swapping.\nSo who \"decides\" what process is swapping and which not? From my understanding, this is done by the kernel, because from application perspective memory is memory without distinguishing between swap and physical RAM. Is that true or do the Chromium developer have the application set to only use physical RAM?\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: I think your \"problem\" is with VirtualBox.\nAccording to the VirtualBox Manual\n\nBase memory\nThis sets the amount of RAM that is allocated and given to the VM when it is running. The specified amount of memory will be requested from the host operating system, so it must be available or made available as free memory on the host when attempting to start the VM and will not be available to the host while the VM is running. \n\nI found similar comments on the VirtualBox forums (although they were not as helpful).\nSee: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=50179\nSo I am guessing the virtualbox kernel module allocates free memory to the guest but is not polite enough to inform the host. Thus when you look at free RAM (with tools such as free -m) you appear to have sufficient memory BUT ... because the kernel module does not inform the host OS, the host can not appropriately manage swap, and your applications then crash doe to a lack of memory (free or swap).\nI would suggest you file a bug report, but, I am guessing it would be closed as \"won't fix\" \nFrom the thread on the VirtualBox forums linked in Tim's comment:\n\nTo answer your question as to if VBox can or can not use swap, no, nothing but the operating system can do that. Swap is not memory that is actually usable. \n\n\nA: The Linux kernel \"decides\" that. It does so with a tunable parameter called swappiness.\n", "Q: Cursors storage location in Ubuntu Where are cursor files (.cur, .ani) as in Windows stored in Ubuntu.

But I would like to do it using bash script.\nNote:: If only 'after' I encounter an 'output' of '2'(or anything) then the process needs to be terminated, I stress this because 'I need to terminate the terminal process for a particular outcome'.\n\nA: a bash shell knows its parent process, so you could do:\n(( number == 2 )) && kill $PPID\n\nref: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Bash-Variables\n\nA: You can use a simple if statement to do that:\n# your file reading code goes here, make sure $output is set\nif [ $output -eq 2 ]; then return; fi\n\n\nA: What you want is to kill the shell from which you run the script. This is a bit tricky as running a script will spawn another shell, and the trivial methods of killing it (kill -9 $$ or  exit) will work on the spawned shell, not the one invoked by the terminal.\nThe only reliable way I found of doing so is to source your script instead of running it. So instead of:\nbash script.sh\n\ndo:\n. script.sh\n\nthis will cause stuff to run in the invoking shell, not the spawned one.\nThe script itself is easy as seen in the other answer:\nwhile true; do sleep 1; number=$RANDOM; echo $number; if [ 2 = 2 ]; then exit; fi; done\n\nActually if you run this as a one-liner in your current shell, it will close the terminal when it sees a value of 2.\nYou didn't say where the random numbers will come from; I used the RANDOM bash built-in which outputs integers in the range 0-32767.\n", "Q: Empty build directory in custom compiled kernel I have a script (found here on github) that custom compiles the 3.8 linux kernel (with Xenomai for real-time).

Than means that if a process has any file \"locked\" or any resource reserved in a kind-of exclusive way, it will not release them for other process to use. When you terminate the process (in a normal way(1)) the system will clean up after it, and the resources will be available again.  \nTo terminate a process you use Ctrl-C. Sometime Ctrl-C will not work; you can try then Ctrl-\\ or, if even this does not work and you need to use Ctrl-Z (it happens), then you have to kill it: \nkill %1 \n\n(the number 1 is the number in brackets you see before the \"stopped\" message).\nYou can even continue the process (with fg %1) or send it to background (with bg %1).

Hold on a second!! So those things are kernels???!! And I had all that in my system and I didn't know??! I didn't install anything!! Or maybe it's the update manager that did this? ... ... ...If it's true then do I need all this?? If no then it should be taking up lots of space of my drive!! And then how do I clean up??\nPlease explain as much details as possible! It seems that there's a lot that I don't understand!\n\nA: The kernel can be updated during a normal update. All the kernels remain on the hard disk and should be able to be booted from the grub menu presented at boot time. I keep the old kernels, there is no harm in doing so.\n\nA: To preface, more information about kernels. At a very high level, the kernel is the actual operating system itself (talks to the hardware, runs applications, etc). You need to have one kernel installed to run Linux.\nThe kernels that you see listed are installed, but they are not being used (except for the one running). There is no harm in keeping multiple versions, and it's usually a good idea to do so in case you hit any issue with the newer version.\nIf you don't like them being on your system, they can be removed with:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nWhich should clear out the unused kernels (along with other unused packages). There's no harm in keeping them, though.\n", "Q: Wifi is connected ,but can't use Internet My laptop shows that its connected but when i launch mozilla it doesn't load. When I use a wired connection it works. Any help?\n\nA: In Firefox edit preferences, go to the network section and set automatic proxy server.

I used Boot Repair, and now my PC is stuck at:\nerror: invalid arch independent ELF magic.\ngrub rescue>\n\nI used Boot Repair, but it looks like my laptop can't detect my USB drive, also I can't access the BIOS. \n\nA: If you can boot from a cd which logically you must've had to do when you installed you can download a supergrub cd which will allow you to boot into your ubuntu installation. From there just run:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: start uget as superuser(administrator) from launcher icon i have recently noticed that, to enable the option \"Shutdown When Downloads Complete\" in uget I have to start it from terminal with\nsudo uget-gtk\n\nIs there a way to always start uget as a superuser(root) by clicking the icon of uget in launcher.\n\nA: We  have fixed this issue for 1.10.5 so in the next release root will no longer be needed but in the meantime...\nYou first need to install \"gksu\" which is a tool to run a gtk app as root.\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You can edit the uGet launcher by opening the .desktop file as root. This file is located at /usr/share/applications/uGet.desktop\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/uGet.desktop\n\n*Another option is to install \"alacarte\" which is a GUI app to edit .desktop files.\nsudo apt-get install alacarte\nBoth of these options will require you to enter your password every time but that is currently unavoidable.\nWe may release a beta version of 1.10.5 at some point for testing, at which time the fix for this will be testable.\n", "Q: Control which network interface is used by default My mainboard hast two ethernet ports\nSo far i have only used one (eth1), which is connected to a router with a dhcp-server.\nHowever, I want to use the other port (eth0) simultaneously to connect to another wlan router. The desktop is supposed to act as a hub, i.e. forward the dhcp services and all packages to the wlan, while still being a client in the network itsself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any tutorial on this topic? (I couldn't find anything useful on google)\n\n\nSo far I am using a static ip setup for the wlan router (eth0).\nAs soon as I simply plug in the cable and connect with the network-manager, the internet connection is lost (even though the network manager shows, that both networks are connected). It appears that by default eth0 is then used for communication.\n\n\n*\n\n*using firefox or any piece of software, (how) can i control which network interface is used individually and by default?\n\n\nA: You can temporarily disable the unwanted interface - ifconfig eth0 down. Otherwise, if you want an interface disabled by default you can add the same command to /etc/rc.local.  I suppose you could also set up xbindkeys to disable interfaces with keystroke as well.\n", "Q: Unable to load page using Express from local machine Im developing a webpage using Express framework in ubuntu.

When I am using Wine or changing its preferences, I often get a pop-up that says, \"The Wine configuration in /home/user/.wine is being updated, please wait...\"  It stays there for a minute or two, and then disappears and whatever I wanted to do happens.  Internet searches for this dialog box have only pulled up bug reports, and never an explanation of what is going on.\nWhat \"configuration\" is Wine updating, and why does it have to do it so often?\n\nA: When you update your system, there may be some updates for the wine package.\nSince the wine programs and directories are set in your home folder, when you first start wine after an update, it updates (copies the new wine files from the installed one to your directory) so it's completely normal.\nIf you look under the wine folder on your $HOME doing this:\nnautilus $HOME/.wine\n\nYou'll see the \"virtual\" hardrive that wine uses to run the windows applications. There is a drive_c folder that acts like a C: device, you can browse it and find a reproduction of a Windows System file structure. When a new version is installed in your Ubuntu, this file structure is updated with the latest versions. There's not much more I can tell you... just think of that directory as a working version of a virtual Windows installation. \n", "Q: Ubuntu phone on galaxy s3 Can I install Ubuntu touch on my phone?\nMy phone is galaxy s3.\n\nA: Simply said.

I have uninstalled all of the programs that work on Linux from my Windows and then reinstalled them on my Ubuntu, giving me 222GB free on my Windows partition, and no free room on my Ubuntu partition. I would like to transfer those 200GB from my Windows partition to my Ubuntu partition, but I cannot figure out how to do it. Here is a screenshot of my Gparted.\n\nI would greatly appreciate help, because I am planning on switching to mainly Ubuntu.\n\nA: You just need to shrink your windows partition ( sda3 ), then expand the extended partition ( sda4 ), followed by your ubuntu partition ( sda5 ) to use the free space.  You will need to boot from the livecd do to this so the partition is not in use.\n\nA: You should start an Ubuntu Live to be safe and from there install and run Gparted, then remove 200 GB from the Windows partition, and add 200 gb to your ubuntu partiion!\n\nA: Boot on windows, open disk manager (http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/ht/disk-management-windows-7.htm), right click the windows partition and select \"shrink\".\nhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg309169.aspx\n", "Q: xkbcomp Command at Startup using .xinitrc How do I install my custom keyboard map and have it start automatically at startup?\nThe following command works when I run it in a terminal:\nxkbcomp -I$HOME/.xkb/ $HOME/.xkb/switch-LALT-LCTL.xkb $DISPLAY\n\nbut when I put this into .xinitrc (linked from .xsession just in case), the command is not run. What am I missing? I've spent hours / days searching and trying other 'solutions' but none of these work for me.\nThanks in advance for any help or ideas you may have.\n\nA: I do not think that .xinitrc is executed by the display manager. Have you tried with .xprofile? It is cited here about a different issue: \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution\nI often use a small zenity command in these kind of files to confirm they are effectively run, like\nzenity --warning --text \"I am in .xprofile and I RUN\\! \" &\n\n\nA: My work around had been to edit the keycodes in /usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev and recompile by removing the .xkm files in /var/lib/xkb/ this was not a sound solution as it would break any other keymapings that involved those keycodes. The correct solution:\nlightdm-session runs settings found in ~/.xmodmap or ~/.Xkbmap. Normally this would be the way to go and indeed settings put here are run and applied. But currently there is a bug where if you are running Gnome (which is the default in Ubuntu 13.10 - ubuntu desktop). It will override any settings made here.\nThe solution then becomes to edit the gnome settings that the gnome keyboard plugin is using to override the ones set by lightdm. In particular, to swap LALT and LCTL (for which there is no simple rule already in place), I followed the directions found here: http://www.itniwo.net/blog/v/404398.html\nThis involves editing (as root) several files in /usr/share/X11/xkb/. The result of this allows for a new option +ctrl(swap_lalt_lctrl) to be added to the keyboard setup using dconf-editor.\nA lot of people on the internet were made angry when their xkb and xmodmap configurations suddenly stopped working after upgrading to 13.10. Too bad millions of dollars of time are being wasted diagnosing and working around this :-(. Somebody smart on the gnome side should write something that would honor any existing xkb settings or at least give warning them that they broke them on purpose (silent overrides are hard to find).\n", "Q: Eclipse missing menus when starting from CLI I'm a new Ubuntu user. Over the past weeks I installed Ubuntu 13.10 and the latest Eclipse Kepler IDE, plus the workbench plugin from Libre Ada for the Gnat system. I'm using Ubuntu either locally on the machine it is installed or through an X11 terminal from my Windows machine.\nToday, after installing all the latest updates Ubuntu reported to me I noticed a strange behavior. When I start Eclipse locally through the command line, none of the top menus show up, Files, Edit, Project, whatever they all just show a thin black bar and nothing else.

I have a cronjob that runs some Python scripts and they generate massive log file. How do I prevent them from getting so big? It'd be perfect if the file was deleted once it hit a certain size. Because every few days, the file is 50MB now but gets much bigger and takes forever to download and analyze a bug on a slow internet connection. I really only want to see that last 1000 lines to see where the script went wrong.\nI know I could code something to do this, but I was just wondering if Linux had something that I didn't know about. I imagine big log files are a common problem. Thank-you.\n\nA: Usually you should only log the activity you care about and should configure the program to be less verbose if possible.\nAs suggested, using logrotate is the usual way of dealing with logfiles. But instead of adding content to /etc/logrotate.conf you should add your own job to /etc/logrotate.d/, otherwise you would have to look at more diffs of configuration files during release upgrades.\nHere is an example I created for a php script:\n/var/log/some-php-app/*.log {\n        daily\n        rotate 10\n        delaycompress\n        compress\n        notifempty\n        missingok\n}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/log/some-php-app/*.log - Is the path where the log file(s) is located and it's name. As you can see, you can also use wildcards to apply the rule to more than one logfile.\n\n*daily - Rotates logfiles daily. Alternatives: hourly, weekly, monthly, yearly, maxsize, maxage\n\n*rotate count - Files are rotated count times before being removed or mailed to the address specified in a mail directive.\n\n*delaycompress - Postpones compression of the previous log file to the next rotation cycle.\n\n*compress - Compresses old versions of log  files with gzip. You can use zless instead of less to view the files.\n\n*notifempty - Does not rotate the log if it is empty.\n\n*missingok - Goes on to the next rotate job without issuing an error message, when the log file is missing.\n\n\nHave a look at the logrotate manpage for more options.\n\nA: You will want to set a size in /etc/logrotate.conf\nThe file exists by default and is ran daily.  The only thing you will need to do is add some additional parameters to logrotate.conf.\n/path/to_big.log {\n        size 1k\n        create 700 user group\n        rotate 1\n}\n\nIn this example we specify the path to our log,the size we want to limit it to, the permissions for the replacement log, and how many copies to keep.  Rotate 1 will keep one copy.\n\nA: If your logs are growing very fast you can't wait for cron to run logrotate once a day as is the default after setting the size limit as mentioned in the previous answer,  you can make a symlink in /etc/cron.hourly to the logrotate cron job  in /etc/cron.daily with this command:\nsudo ln -s /etc/cron.daily/logrotate /etc/cron.hourly/\n\nThe only thing you need to remember, is to be sure and delete the link once the problem that is creating the excessive logs is resolved.  That is if you have something outside of your control creating excessive logs, you need to report a bug about the problem, because it may be affecting others without realizing it.  This kind of bug can cause the root volume to run out of space and then people will see all kinds of problems and never realize that it is because they are running out of space on root. \n", "Q: How to integrate jFrame Menu Bar into Unity Panel?

Instructions are on that page but I'll put them here\n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:danjaredg/jayatana\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install jayatana\n\nYou will need to log out and back in after installing.  The instructions here will install the latest version and will keep up to date, the link I put in my comment above is outdated and must be manually installed so I recommend you use this instead.  \nFrom the page I linked above there is a tab labeled \"wiki\" which has a file \"configuration\".

If I add xxxx::26 in my /etc/network/interfaces, they all start using that. It seems like they just use whatever the highest number is.\nHow do I specify a certain address to be used as the default? In my case, I happen to want to use the lowest address (xxxx::2), but I'd really like to know how to specify a particular one, should the need arise in the future.\n\nA: You can solve this by modifying the default route. Every route in Linux has the option to specify the default source address. If you specify the xxxx::3 address in your route then that one will be used by default:\n/sbin/ip -6 route del default\n/sbin/ip -6 route add default via xxxx::1 src xxxx::3\n\nIf you show the routing table you will see the result:\n/sbin/ip -6 route\ndefault via xxxx::1 dev eth0  src xxxx::222  metric 1024\n\nOne thing to watch out for is that IPv6 addresses are in a tentative state until duplicate address detection has been performed. Linux will refuse to use a tentative address as the default source address. This means that you might need to add a short sleep before adding this route so that the address has time to come out of the tentative state and become usable.\n", "Q: I installed DNS server in my initial Ubuntu server installion how do I uninstall it?

Read the language specification carefully to see what sort of things are undefined or implementation dependent, and avoid them. Neither answer is \"correct\", they are undefined.  Different answers may even be triggered by different optimizations of the same compiler.\n\nIn practice, you should use your compiler warning flags and a static analysis tool like valgrind or Purify to flag these sorts of things.  And until you understand the meaning of terms like \"Lvalue\" and \"Rvalue\", just using an operator precedence table is not really sufficient to understand what's going on with some of the pre/post fix incre/decre operators.\n", "Q: How to turn off baloo in KDE 4.13? I have Kubuntu 14.04 and just installed the newest updates. Looking at the process list I see baloo indexer running.\nI could not find a checkbox in Baloo settings to turn off the indexing.\n\nA: I haven't tried it yet, but apparently, you can also do\n$ cp /usr/share/autostart/baloo_file.desktop ~/.kde/share/autostart/\n$ echo \"Hidden=True\" >> ~/.kde/share/autostart/baloo_file.desktop\n\n(I had my home folder in the \"don't search\" section, probably from nepomuk, and baloo_file was still using 100% of a core.)\n\nA: balooctl\nAs said here and here, just use:\nbalooctl disable\n\nBTW, config is now on ~/.config/baloofilerc instead of on ~/.kde/share/config/baloofilerc.    \n\nA: Adding $HOME to the list of excluded paths did stop the baloo_file_extractor, which was using 100% CPU. However it then started baloo_file_cleaner which was trashing my harddisk.\nMaking sure that it does not autostart, seemed to fix the problems:\nsudo mv /usr/share/autostart/baloo_file.desktop /usr/share/autostart/baloo_file.desktop.orig\n\n\nA: Though there are a few ways to prevent Baloo from indexing, my intention is to prevent Baloo from even running. As per The KDE docs there is no User-accessible way to do that, so I've combined a solution found on the KDE forums with user 's solution to disable the executables:\nsudo mv /usr/bin/baloo_file /usr/bin/baloo_file-orig\nsudo ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/baloo_file\nsudo mv /usr/bin/baloo_file_cleaner /usr/bin/baloo_file_cleaner-orig\nsudo ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/baloo_file_cleaner\nsudo mv /usr/bin/baloo_file_extractor /usr/bin/baloo_file_extractor-orig\nsudo ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/baloo_file_extractor\n\nI then go a step further and ensure that baloo cannot be updated, overriding the above symlinks:\n$ sudo apt-mark hold  baloo libbaloocore4 libbaloofiles4 libbaloopim4 libbaloowidgets4 libbalooxapian4\n$ sudo apt-get remove baloo\n\nFor additional insurance, if the baloo process ever does find its way back is to add the following to ~/.kde/share/config/baloofilerc:\n[Basic Settings]\nIndexing-Enabled=false\n\n\nA: You can make your file manager display hidden files, after which go to $HOME/.kde/share/config/baloofilerc. It is enough to edit it and change the option\nIndexing-Enabled=true \n\nto (or add if there is not such option)\nIndexing-Enabled=false\n\nto disable baloo.\nI know it is way too easy but it did work for me and also for the guy who posted this simple solution on this page.\nDisabling Akonadi server and Nepomuk search plugin can greatly increase performance in a KDE environment.\n\nA: Baloo is responsible for desktop search.\nQuoting one of the Baloo authors:\n\nThere is no explicit “Enable/Disable” button any more. We would like\n  to promote the use of searching and feel that Baloo should never get\n  in the users way. However, we are smart about it and IF you add your\n  HOME directory to the list of “excluded folders”, Baloo will switch\n  itself off since it no longer has anything to index.\n\n\n\nA: From the Gentoo forum: http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7522240.html\nAs of KDE 4.13.0 (Kubuntu Trusty) it is no longer possible to disable Semantic Desktop in the GUI. Though there is a \"Desktop Search\" applet in the System Settings, and you should be able to blacklist your home dir there, doing so has no effect and Baloo (who has taken over from Nepomuk/Strigi) keeps doing its stuff with 100% load and multi-Gigabyte memory use on the CPU core it runs in.\nYou may check the CPU load on your system using 'top':\ntop\n\nCheck the I/O load on your system with 'iotop':\nsudo apt-get install iotop\nsudo iotop\n\nTo permanently disable baloo, symlink it to /bin/true:\nsudo mv /usr/bin/baloo_file_extractor /usr/bin/baloo_file_extractor.orig\nsudo ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/baloo_file_extractor\n\nand\nsudo mv /usr/bin/baloo_file_cleaner /usr/bin/baloo_file_cleaner.orig\nsudo ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/baloo_file_cleaner\n\nThis will prevent it from ever running again. Doing so will lose search functionality of course, but does not seem to have any adverse effects beyond that.\n\nA: To avoid manually editing $HOME/.kde/share/config/baloofilerc, this does the same for you:\nkwriteconfig --file baloofilerc --group 'Basic Settings' --key 'Indexing-Enabled' false\n\n\nA: A post in KDE forums by Aaron Seigo suggests:\nqdbus org.kde.baloo.file /indexer suspend\n\nThe post is located here:\nhttps://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=154&t=120047#p304335\nUse the following to resume:\nqdbus org.kde.baloo.file /indexer resume\n\nUse the following to check is baloo is suspended or not:\nqdbus org.kde.baloo.file /indexer isSuspended\n\nTIP: When I type qdbus org.kde.baloo.file /indexer and press Tab multiple times in Kubuntu 14.04 with bash-completion enabled (usually enabled by default), I get a list of commands for baloo.\n", "Q: Gaming on Ubuntu Ok so I have the 13.10 version and wine 1.6 Just was curious if anyone can help me find out how to run the d2bs Bot for diablo 2 via Wine. any help regarding this matter would be greatly appreciated thanks\n\nA: Software that might help you with that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Crossover\n\n*Gaming on linux\n\n*Virtual machine\n\n", "Q: I accidentaly did sudo apt-get remove python I accidentaly did sudo apt-get remove python command and now terminal look has changed, rhythmbox, ubuntu software center and everything is quite changed.

I have been running into problems with python code which uses RAM very inefficiently, see e.g. here, causing my code to crash. I have increased the swap partition to 8 GB, but crashes still happen. How far can I take it with resizing my swap? 16 GB? 32 GB? At which point will ubuntu be unable to handle it?\nThanks!\n\nA: I don't think it really matters.  However, if you're using multiple memory intensive applications, you can allocate as big a partition as you want for swap.  How much will be used is another question entirely. Depends on the system.\nPersonally I don't see any need for a swap partition size larger than twice the amount of ram, not to exceed 8GB.  Having such a huge swap, the swapping process will be probably much less effective. \n", "Q: What video driver should I download? I'm trying to install the ATI drivers for Ubuntu.

Thank you in advance, and sorry for my English.\n\nA: I suppose you have an E-240 APU and a ATI Radeon 6310 HD graphics card in your laptop as I found from this link by googling about your laptop. In the link to the AMD's support site which you have specified in your description to the question, I selected APU, Mobile APU, E-series APU and x86 in the list boxes respectively according to your laptop specs and the output of your terminal you provided above and then I got this. I recommend that you install the latest beta driver(i.e) 14.3 LINUX Beta V1.0 driver as it is very recent. To do so follow the below steps:- \n\n\n*\n\n*Check the release notes of the driver. It is very important.Though I have done so myself, I suggest you to check it before you install your driver. From what I saw, the driver seems to support the AMD Radeon 6000 HD series going by the release notes of the driver. But under the APU family compatibility the release notes dont seem to mention the E-240 series(which is your APU). So it is a bit suspicious. But I cant find any other driver. I would also suggest that you check if your OS supports all the system requirements specified in the release notes.\n\n*Then you might have to follow the installer notes for installing your driver. \n\n*For further details you may refer to this answer. It states the method to install the driver, what to do if things go wrong and also commands to check your system requirements. It states the method for 13.10 OS.

I have a microserver from hp and got a SSD, which I planned to use for the OS (Ubuntu Server 12.04), while two more harddisk should run in RAID 1. People recommended me that during installation of ubuntu server I should create a mount point pointing to my /home directory, so everything in my /home directory will automatically get backuped within the raid system.\nI would like to use this raid to replace more folders, like for example I plan to install a SVN on the server. Usually those files are physically stored in /var/local/svn or something like that, but those svn files I would prefer to store on the raid system (/home). Should I just install everything I am planning to backup within folders on my /home - directory? That doesn't really sound like the Ubuntu way of handling this.\nI also know, that I could create more partitions to mount more folders, but I am really not sure on how much space I should reserve for each of them, so I would prefer a more simple approach. What is the Ubuntu way of handling this? And can you maybe recommend me more folders of Ubuntu, I might should put on the raid? Are symbolic links the way to go here?\n\nA: Use symbolic links.\nln -s /home/svn/dir /var/local/svn/dirwill make the files that are physically stored in /home/svn/dir accessible as if they were stored in /var/local/svn/dir. When the drive containing /home/svn is mounted, your files will be accessible, otherwise /var/local/svn/dir will appear empty.\n", "Q: Unable to update the system on Ubuntu 12.4 Showing message: \nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?\n\n\nA: Probably you did not use 'sudo' before your command in the terminal. That is why it tries to imply that you are not root.Try this:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen you will be asked for the password. Type it and press enter. Your update will start. Also note that when you type the password the * or the dots that appear normally when you type the password wont appear. Just type it without errors and press enter.\n\nA: You have to be a root in order to update your sources list.\nTo do that you can use a fantastic utility called sudo.\nEasily run the update command using sudo before\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nsudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or\n         another user, as specified by the security policy.  The real and\n         effective uid and gid are set to match those of the target user, as\n         specified in the password database, and the group vector is initialized\n         based on the group database (unless the -P option was specified).\n\n", "Q: Icons missing in gnome-shell, nautilus, totem Last night when I reboot my system, I see that a lot of icons are missing. In gnome shell I don't have anymore the icon for the sound but I can still click on the space. \nI have the relative same issue in nautilus, the previous and next button are missing. I tried to change my DE for Unity or Xfce but the result is similar, many icons missing (but still click-able).\nI searched for answers, I tried some commands written in an archlinux forum like \"gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/gnome/\"  but no luck.\nDoes anyone have ever encountered this issue with Ubuntu? (12.10)\nedit: I read that for arch, in order to repair icons, you must reinstall librsvg. Should I resinstall librsvg2-* ?\nThanks :)\n\nA: I've experienced the same issue (Ubuntu 12.10 - Gnome desktop) after updating librsvg packages to 2.36.3-0ubuntu1.1. \nDowngrading them manually to 2.36.2-0ubuntu1 fixed the issue. You need to downgrade librsvg and librsvg-common.\nHope this helps,\n", "Q: How do I set deault browser to NOT rekonq? I don't like rekonq, and I don't want rekonq, so I uninstalled it. However, now whenever I click on a link in another program (e.g. a pdf) it complains that it can't find rekonq. I want to keep using KDE, but without rekonq - is that possible? How do I change it to NOT try to open rekonq?\nSo far, the only solution I can think of is to make a symlink pointing from \"rekonq\" to the browser I actually want to use. Is this the only option? Surely there must be a setting somewhere that I can change, to make rekonq not the default browser?\n\nA: *\n\n*To solve this, open KDE System Settings or run systemsettings from\nshell.\n\n*Now select Default Applications under Workspace Appreance and\nBehaviour group.\n\n*In the left pane, select Web Browser, and in the Default Component\ngroupbox, change command of the browser to firefox from rekonq.\n\n\nAnother way to do it is remove mime-type from rekonq desktop launcher file if it is still there in the system. Just open the following file with nano/kate or whatever you like and add a # in front of line starting with MimeType.\nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/kde4/rekonq.desktop\n\nPut a # as follows\nIcon=rekonq\nType=Application\nExec=rekonq %u\nX-DocPath=rekonq/index.html\nCategories=Qt;KDE;Network;WebBrowser;\nTerminal=false\n#MimeType=text/html;application/xhtml+xml;application/xml;\nX-DBUS-StartupType=Unique\nX-DBUS-ServiceName=org.kde.rekonq\nInitialPreference=10\n\n", "Q: Access to MS Exchange from Ubuntu Recently, my organization offered us to connect to our MS Exchange account from Android. Since I am using Win XP with VB only to be able to access this account, I thought I could now easily access it straight with Ubuntu.\nI first tried the ExQuilla plugin for Thunderbird, then Evolution with evolution-mapi packages (you have to also install python-samba to have the Mapi connection available), but without success. With Evolution, it tells me that the password was incorrect (which is not true).\nThe parameters I entered were:\n\n\n*\n\n*my full name and email address (user@myorg.org)\n\n*selection of the server type: Exchange MAPI\n\n*server (as given by the IT), without \"https://\"\n\n*user name \"user\" and domain name (as given by the IT)\n\n*checked secure connection\n\n\nI then click on Authenticate.

Neither of the two approaches for Evolution are satisfactory, in my opinion - both libmapi and the ews library have bugs and flaws that make them frustrating to use in the long run.\nAssuming your IT department don't have POP3 or IMAP enabled on the server, your best bet might be to try Outlook Web Access - older versions were pants on non-IE browsers but more recent versions are surprisingly robust.\nProbably not the answer you're looking for though :-D\n", "Q: unable to send email I'm getting an error message:\nmail: cannot send message: Process exited with a non-zero status\n\nCommand\ndate | mail -s \"test\" -r some@myemail.com some@myemail.com\n\nmailutils install via this command\nsudo apt-get install mailutils\n\nI have did the same in another ec2 server, and that server is working fine.\nwhat could be the reason?\nDebug info:\n/usr/sbin/sendmail exited with: 75\ngeneric yields 38=Function not implemented\n\ntry to google this error message, but without any luck\n\nA: I do not use the ec2 server, but had the same error message when trying to send an email, from the command line to my gmail account with ...\necho \"hello\" | mail -s \"test email from CLI\" myusername@gmail.com\nMy problem was finally solved, when I took out the special character in my gmail password.

From http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Oracle-Java-on-Ubuntu-Linux\nType/Copy/Paste: java -version . If you're having \nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.10pre) (7b15~pre1-0lucid1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0-b09, mixed mode)\n\n... you have the wrong vendor version of Java installed for this exercise.\nThis is what I have. I wonder, why is this a wrong vendor? What is this vendor? Why should I use Oracle Java instead?\n\nA: There are currently two Java versions (vendors, if you will) available:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Oracle's (previously Sun) JDK, the closed source Java, with commercial support from Oracle 'n stuffs.\n\n*OpenJDK, the open source Java. Oracle released part of their source and renamed it.\n\n\nIn the days of Java 6, there used to be a big difference between the two of them, OpenJDK running slower and supporting less. However, nowadays, except for the java-web-plugin (which was rewritten by the community and named icedtea-web), they are exactly the same. Neither of the two versions is \"wrong\".\nThere are still people claiming OpenJDK is worse than Oracle's JDK, but it's become a myth.\nI recommend keeping OpenJDK for Java 7, because open source FTW, and because it's supported in the official repositories of Ubuntu (Oracle does not let others redistribute their JDK).  \n", "Q: Samsung ssd 840 pro configuration? I am about to buy an SSD 840 pro from Samsung and I read I needed to do some configuration on ubuntu in order to not reduce its life, and get the optimal performances. What I wanna know is what I need to do, step by step and simple to use my SSD correctly on ubuntu, which i will install on it.\nThank you.\n\nA: What you want to know is How to enable TRIM?\nWhich is fairly easy, simply open your terminal, open the fstab file and add the discard option to the SSD UUID that corresponds to your Samsung SSD. Basically open the terminal and:\nblkid\n\nwhich should show you all HDD/SSD so you can see which one is which:\n\nHere my SSD is sdb which is the one that has the root filesystem with it (the little / you see there at the end of the line that starts with sdb1). I then:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n\nAnd look for the root filesystem (The / \"slash\") marked with the Red circle. I then add the discard option (marked with the blue circle) to the several options shown there. In my case it reads discard,noatime,errors.... since I only needed to add the discard and a comma. Note that the discard is AFTER the ext4, this is because each section or columns is for an specific part of fstab. The 3rd column is for the filesystem type, which is ext4 in this case. The 4th column is for the options, which is were discard is.\nNow save the file by pressing CTRL+X which will show you a message below saying if you want to save the file, press Y and you are done. Now reboot the computer and you are ready.\nSome benchmarks for that particular SSD will help you enjoy that fast drive:\n\n\nNOTE: Gnome Disk has a problem with this SSD when doing a benchmark with Write enable.

This will return an error, but don't worry.\n\n*Look at the error from the previous command. It should list broken package(s). Type sudo dpkg -r PACKAGE_NAME to remove each one.

I burnt an alternate CD and then a DVD to see if this was an individual media error. It was not. It must be an error with the ISO file. \nI want to have the grub option of selecting either windows 8.1 or Ubuntu come up. I am running this from the UEFI selection in Windows 8.1. \nDoes anyone know if this online provided iso file is corrupt. or a better iso file to install, or maybe I should use a different version of ubuntu or kbuntu?\n\nA: Others will come along with better info probably, but here is what I know...\nMake sure the CD Drive laser is clean and dust free, clean the DVD / CD, turn your PC off so it can chill out, boot directly from shutdown into the OS with the burning software (restarts mess with (dual, triple, etc) Linux/Windows partitions. \nTry burning at the slowest speed possible. Use session or disk at once. \nTHEN, make sure your ISO has the correct MD5sum hash #. There should be a file either with your ISO or in the website directory you found it. Compare that number to the ones found here by pasting it into the \"FIND\" box: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes\nI just spent a good day trying figuring out why one of my burned ISO DVD images kept giving me an [ERRNO 5] Input/Output Error. It said there was something wrong with my Hard Disk or DVD but really it was because the ISO didn't have the right \"data integrity\" or what have you, as shown by the inconsistencies between its MD5sum and the official ones on that Ubuntu page.\n\nA: Also, if this is your first time with Ubuntu or any Linux distro, please know that the extra .4 in the title can make all the difference when it comes to hardware / driver compatibility. The extra .4 there means your Ubuntu 12.04 has the same Kernel Stack and Xorg stack as Ubuntu 13.10, those being 3.11 and 1.14 (?) respectively. 12.04.0 has kernel 3.2 and X server 1.11, I believe. \nSo, if you are trying to install a program that requires a kernel no higher than 3.0 or something, you could be screwed.

LDM is conceptually similar to the Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM), but the two are incompatible formats. In any event, you cannot install Ubuntu on the disk in its current state -- at least, not easily. (It might be possible to cobble something together, but even for a Linux guru, that would be a bit of a challenge.)\nThe easiest solution is to convert from LDM to a more conventional partitioning setup. Some commercial Windows tools, such as EaseUS Partition Master and Partition Wizard, are supposed to be able to do this losslessly. The tools that come with Windows can do the conversion, too, but only by starting with a clean set of partitions (thus effectively wiping your data). Of course, if you're willing to back up your data and know how to restore your system to bootability upon restoring it, this may be an acceptable solution. (For that matter, I strongly recommend backing up all your data before attempting to convert the disk in any way; although the conversion is likely to be simple, the consequences of a bug, power failure at an inopportune moment, or other problem could be catastrophic.) Some people have reported success with wiping the partition table and then using TestDisk to create a new set of partitions, but I recommend against this because there's no guarantee that the filesystems in an LDM setup will be contiguous, which is an assumption of TestDisk. Thus, TestDisk will work if that assumption is met, but if it's not, you could end up with corrupted filesystems and at least some lost data.\nAnother option is to buy another disk and install Linux on it. That way, you can leave the Windows LDM configuration alone and let Linux control the new disk.\nFWIW, Windows has a habit of converting from a conventional configuration to LDM whenever you create a setup with more than four partitions on a disk. AFAIK, Windows doesn't warn you about what it's doing -- or if it does, the message seems to leave little impression, because I have yet to see anybody ever mention it. Thus, you should never use the standard Windows partitioning tools to add partitions, particularly if you know you'll be exceeding four partitions, unless you're willing to use an LDM setup. (A common newbie mistake is to use Windows to create a partition for Linux prior to running the Linux installer. This often pushes the partition count over four and creates more work to undo this problem.)\n\nA: Shrink LDM partitions from inside Windows\nThen free space appears and you can install Ubuntu there.\nShown at: https://askubuntu.com/a/521195/52975\nDisable Page File and System Protection to shrink disk fully\nAs shown at: https://superuser.com/questions/1017764/how-to-shrink-a-windows-10-partition/1060508#1060508\nOtherwise, Windows has some unmovable files, and you can't shrink the partition as much as you'd like.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu Server from USB without internet access?

You can do this in Linux using tools like smartctl (text-mode) or GSmartControl (GUI). Unfortunately, the results can be a little hard to interpret, particularly for the text-mode tools, so feel free to post back with the complete results if you need help interpreting them. (Post text-mode output to a pastebin site, if necessary.)\nIf the SMART test shows that you have actual bad sectors, REPLACE THE DISK IMMEDIATELY!! Modern disks can map out a small number of bad sectors automatically, and if the number of bad sectors exceeds this built-in capacity, it indicates a serious problem with the disk. Such problems can get worse with time, often quite quickly and without further warning. Therefore, any disk that has bad sectors that are showing up at the OS level is unsafe for your data.\nIf the SMART test shows that the disk is in good health and has no actual bad sectors, then something else is causing your problem, and you should do some work to better identify that problem.

But does a file dialog exist so that the file can be located and how do I use it?\n\nA: Basically you have two options that will depend on the Ubuntu version you're using (or plan to use).\n\n\n*\n\n*Before 14.04 (Qt version are 5.0.x)\nThe only way to open a file dialog window is to use some C++ code.\nYou'll have to expose a method that is a public slot to access it from your QML application.\nVisit the following links to get a template to start with: \n\n\n*\n\n*Exposing Attributes of C++ Types to QML\n\n*Embedding C++ Objects into QML with Context Properties\nThen your public slot can call the following QFileDialog function: getOpenFileName()\nQString GuiEngine::GetCSVFileName(void)\n{\n    QString prompt = \"Open File\";\n\n    return QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(NULL, \\\n                                        prompt, \\\n                                        \"report.csv\", \\\n                                        tr(\"CSV files (*.csv)\"), \\\n                                        NULL, \\\n                                        QFileDialog::DontUseNativeDialog);\n}\n\nNote: it will only work with the QFileDialog::DontUseNativeDialog option\nas native rendering creates a ghost window in addition to the File dialog (See bug #1214914)\nIt will create a window like the one below:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*14.04 (Qt version 5.2.1)\nIn that case, implementing a FileDialog is much more easy to do as there's no need to write C++ code.\nHere is a minimal example to open a file dialog and exit after the user chooses a file:\nimport QtQuick 2.1\nimport QtQuick.Dialogs 1.0\n\nFileDialog {\n    id: fileDialog\n    title: \"Please choose a file\"\n    onAccepted: {\n        console.log(\"You chose: \" + fileDialog.fileUrls)\n        Qt.quit()\n    }\n    onRejected: {\n        console.log(\"Canceled\")\n        Qt.quit()\n    }\n    Component.onCompleted: visible = true\n}\n\n", "Q: How to check if my software is 32-bit or 64-bit I want to check if my software is 64 bit or 32 bit (not the OS). This software is an executable file, and when I check it, no information is given if it is 64-bit or 32-bit.\nHow do I check if my software is 64-bit or 32-bit?\n\nA: You can use the file command to check out what format has that executable. For example:\nfile /usr/bin/gedit\n/usr/bin/gedit: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x5a388215eb6f60b420fc3b6d68ec52d563071f84, stripped\n\n\nA: This simple command will show you whether the executable file is  32 bit(i386) or 64 bit(amd64) .\nSyntax:\napt-cache show $(dpkg -S /path/to/the/file | awk -F ':' '{print $1 }') | awk '/Architecture:/ {print $2}' -\n\nExample:\n$ apt-cache show $(dpkg -S /usr/bin/gedit | awk -F ':' '{print $1 }') | awk '/Architecture:/ {print $2}' -\namd64\n\nExplanation:\ndpkg -S command grabs the package in which the file actually belongs to.apt-cache show package command will shows the details about the package.From that details, awk grabs only the Architecture part and redirects it to stdout.\nOR\nYou can try this command also,\n$ dpkg -l $(dpkg -S /usr/bin/gedit | awk -F ':' '{print $1 }') | awk '/ii/ {print $4}'\namd64\n\n", "Q: force 'uget' to download from a particular link I'm using uget on Ubuntu 13.10, but the problem is that it doesn't download from some links automatically.\nFor example, I want to download a file from http://d-h.st/ONi : \n\nWhen I click the download button, the download starts in the browser itself... I cant find any way to force download it in uget.\n\nIs there any download manager which can download this file by simply clicking on the download button ? Just like \"Orbit Downloader\" or \"Internet Download Manager\" on Windows ?\nThank you.\n\nA: \nMy personal preference is JDownloader, which does work perfectly fine on your link/file, as the screenshot shows.\n\nJDownloader is a free, open-source download management tool with a huge community of developers that makes downloading as easy and fast as it should be. Users can start, stop or pause downloads, set bandwith limitations, auto-extract archives and much more. It's an easy-to-extend framework that can save hours of your valuable time every day! \n\n\n\n*\n\n*To install, use either Ubuntu Software-Center,\n\n*or follow this link on their homepage\n\n\n\nJDownloader requires Java Runtime Enviroment (jre/jdk) 1.5 or higher. If possible, you should use the latest Java version. \n\nHow to automatically download added links:\nYou have to mark and copy control+c the url of the file you intend to download though, which will then copy it into JD.\nFrom there it autostarts the download, if you checked the option start downloads after adding in Addons -> AddonManager -> Linkgrabber.\n\nA: This issue has nothing to do with the download manager you are using, it applies to the website creating the button without a link and instead creates the button with Javascript.\nThe solution is to use an extension that can catch the download from the link and send it to any download manager you want.\nIf you are a Firefox user than the solution is FlashGot...if you are a Chrome user then there really isn't a solution for that yet. (though the uGet team is working on it)\nFlashGot - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashgot/\nJust install that, it will automatically detect that you are using uGet and it will give you the option to send that download directly to uGet when you click the button.\n\nAlso make sure you are using the latest version of uGet, the Software Center is out of date for 13.10. - http://ugetdm.com/downloads-ubuntu\nPPA is a solution to install a new repo, in this case the official Upstream repo from uGet.\nDEB files are similar to EXE files that Windows uses...just download the DEB file to your desktop, double click it and choose to install.\n", "Q: Put aliases in my dropbox I have drop-box installed successfully on my machine, however, things I want to share I have to copy into it. Large files. If I some well organised directories in my documents, do I really have to drag them into dropbox?\nCan instead make an alias of the files and paste these aliases into my dropbox folder to share them without moving them?\nAny risks involved here? Will the other person wipe them from my system?\n\nA: To add files to your dropbox that are located outside your dropbox folder you can create a hardlink to the file. This creates a link in the filesystem table such that the file appears to be in two places at once, so editing either the file from your dropbox folder or from the original location will change the same file. \nAlso when you create a hardlink instead of a symlink the file will remain on your drive as long as there is at least one reference to the file. So if someone else deletes the file from the dropbox your local copy outside the dropbox folder remains.\nCreating a hardlink is simplest from the commandline, open a terminal and enter ln <target file> <link name>. So if you have a file ~/important.txt and want it to be in your dropbox under a folder shared_folder the complete command is ln ~/important.txt ~/Dropbox/shared_folder/important.txt.\n", "Q: Cannot launch .jnlp file in precise pangolin I'm trying to install Matlab but I can't open the download_agent installed from mathworks.

Of course I did it from tty, and when you try to log in, the system will try to run .profile or .bashrc. tty will log you in, but it will give you an error message, just read that message.

If you never used ubuntu 13.10, I am assuming it is your /dev/sda1. My reasoning\n\n\n*\n\n*Base installation is short of 8GB, if you never used it, the disk usage makes sense\n\n*/dev/sda2 has more of occupied space, which is why you want more space\n\n*If you are not using 13.10, there would be no key (locked) next to the partition name\n\n\nI'm pretty sure /dev/sda1 is 13.10. Otherwise, it would be mounted.\nTo double check, df will show what partitions are mounted. If you are still not sure, boot into 13.10 and see what is mounted with df or gparted.\nWhat you would need to do is format the /dev/sda1 partition to make more space. Unfortunately you will not be able to extend your 12.04 partition to the new free space. What you can do though is mount it when you use 12.04 and it will act as an \"external\" harddrive. If this bothers you, you can mount this automatically via scripts on startup. \nWARNING\nSimply formatting your 13.10 partition will mess up your bootloader because the bootloader is located on the same partition. You need to reinstall the bootloader in the /dev/sda2, or /dev/sda1 (one suggestions is to make a new /boot partition of ~300mb) after formatting it.

Indicator-notifications is not necessary for this solution.\nIn sudo nano /etc/environment add LOG=1. \nReboot. \nYou notifications will now be stored in/home/$USER/.cache/notify-osd.log\nEdit: Global Variables may be a bad idea to change because it is unknown what other programs use that variable.

So I'm trying to figure out how to make Clementine automatically create a playlist of 50 songs from my library when I open it. Is this possible? I'm using the latest ubuntu btw.\n\nA: It is possible, but not without some coding at least for this solution.\nWhat you would do is write a script that would look at your library, pick X songs by filename (i would so this by using ls folder, and the parsing the file locations with a \"random function\" like milliseconds.) When this parsing is complete, it should have stored it as a single string of files seperated by a space.

After that, when I copy a file to the directory, the file was copied, but memory usage as shown in gnome-system-monitor does not increase. Also, I tried reading the copied file from that directory but the speed is still as slow as reading a disk file. What did I do wrong?\nEDIT:\nI was wrong and the ramdisk (with either tmpfs or ramfs) had the files in memory. The free -m command does show this, while the gnome-system-monitor will not show it. Also ramfs popup as a mounted drive in nautilus but tmpfs does not.\nHowever, in my case I need to do chmod on the ramdisk folder before I can copy files in, even if the ramdisk mount folder is in my home directory.\n\nA: The post in question uses tmpfs, which means it uses a combination of ram and swap. You may want to look into ramfs instead as it only uses ram space. I would imagine the command is similar. You could also use ramdisk which creates a virtual device that you can apply a filesystem to and everything.\nSources:\n\n\"tmpfs will use swap space when neccessary\"\n\nsource = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7242484/can-i-over-run-the-tmpfs-size\n\n\"If you compare it to ramfs (which was the template to create tmpfs)\n  you gain swapping and limit checking.\"\n\nsource = www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt\n\n\"The memory used by tmpfs grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and can be swapped out to swap space\"\n\nsource = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs\n\n\"Tmpfs uses swap, where as Ramfs doesn't.\"\n\nsource = What is the difference between tmpfs and ramfs\n\nA: In response to your edit you don't need to chmod to copy files to the ramfs, just use gksu nautilus to open nautilus as root then right click on the ramfs mounted folder and change the user permissions to allow your user full permissions. Then you can happily write files to it as a regular user no sudoing required.\n", "Q: I'm a total noob and need to know if Ubuntu will work properly in my laptop So, as the title says: I'm not very tech savvy, but I tried Ubuntu and loved it!\nThe thing is: I don't know if my laptop can handle Ubuntu or if I need to do something special to make it work properly (like drivers or some other add-on).\nSamsung 300e4a, currently running WIN 7.\n500 GB Hard Drive, 8GB RAM, Intel(R) HD Graphics, Realtek High Definition Audio\n\nA: Install the Universal USB Installer for Windows, and once installed, launch it. Choose the Ubuntu distribution you like, and have the app download it for you onto a USB flash drive. Then, reboot your PC, and choose to boot from the flashdrive. That will start the version of Linux you chose as a LiveUSB, which will be able to use data files (music, video, text, graphics) on your hard drive. When you know which version you like the best, then you can install it from the LiveUSB; if you chose to, you can resize the Windows partition, leaving Windows intact, and install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nThere are many versions so I suggest you try several, and choose the version you like. There are differences in both the desktop environment as well as the apps and utilities they use; suggest you pick the desktop you like (Unity vs Classic GNOME vs KDE vs Xfce vs LXDE) and if there's a different app you find in one distro which you want in another (e.g., a different file manager), you can install it later.  I prefer Xubuntu 13.10 right now on my Lenovo T500 but your mileage will vary.\nJust like you can have both Windows 7 as well as Ubuntu on your machine, you can also add multiple versions of Linux, and choose what you want to run at boot.\n\nA: Try the \"Try ubuntu\" options from a installation CD/USB. If everything works, it can work.\nGrab the version you want here\nBurn it to a CD or make a bootable USB. When booting your computer, interrupt your BIOS and find the option to select a bootable device. Select the USB or CD and you should be able to reach the \"Try Ubuntu\" option.\n", "Q: 12.04 to 13.10 Can it remove encryption? I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my primary computer, and I absentmindedly selected \"encypt home directory\" I read a few methods to de-encrypt it, but they didn't work so well (And seemed overly complicated) If I upgrade from 12.04 to 13.10 will it remove the home directory encryption if I do not select it?\nThanks in advance!!\n ~Nate\n\n\nA: Yes, removing the partition on which the /home folder resides will remove the encryption. If you have a different /home partition, you will need to delete it while installing the new OS, otherwise, if its on the same partition as /, then it will be formatted while you install the new OS.\n", "Q: Steam forgets where game directory is on second HDD I installed steam onto my SSD, but of course that can't hold very many games so I setup a second steam directory on my HDD.\nHowever every single time a I restart my computer steam shows all my games in the directory as being uninstalled. However, when I click install I can navigate to the directory I made, select it, then all my steam games once again appear as installed.\nHow do I fix this.\nUbuntu 13.10\n\nA: When ubuntu starts up it only mounts the partitions that it needs. Because your HDD is a seperate partition, it is not mounted on boot. This means that any program on your Ubuntu installation that uses a directory on your HDD will not be able to find it. For example, My music player's library is on my Windows partition. Unless I mount the windows partition, I will not see my songs.\nYou can automatically mount this on boot. Here is a guide\n", "Q: How to check my home directory is encrypted in Ubuntu 12.04 I am using XUbuntu 12.04 and I want to be sure my home directory is encrypted. I have .ecryptfs in my home directory and other positive signs of encryption and had selected it during installation. But When I boot up computer and login as root in the console 1 without logging into my actual account, and try cd /home/myusername/ I can see all the files? Is this correct behaviour since the home directory will be mounted only when I login as 'myusername' or does root has access to all encrypted home directories?\n\nA: Easy!  Just use the ecryptfs-verify command.\nFor instance:\necryptfs-verify -h\n\nFull disclosure: I am the co-author and co-maintainer of eCryptfs, and happened to write the ecryptfs-verify tool, too ;-)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 blank after login -- images/icons can't be displayed I rebooted my 12.10  (Linux ubuntu 3.2.0-60-generic #91-Ubuntu SMP Wed Feb 19 03:55:18 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux) which has been running fine for many months after a Thunderbird update and found the icons had suddenly changed and a few were missing on the login screen.

I succeeded to install Ubuntu 12.04 on it (intending to dual-boot), but the UEFI refused to recognize it and went to Windows every time. I found a very hackish work-around: every time I want Linux, I go into F2 Setup at startup and disable Secure Boot.\nRecently, after an upgrade on the Windows side, this method has stopped working, it goes to Windows every time regardless of secure boot option. I have spent an hour with the setup to no avail. How can I boot Linux, and how can I continue to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu?\n\nA: It's possible that the Boot Repair utility will fix this problem; however, it's important that you boot this tool in EFI mode. (Running it from a live CD is fine.) Booting it in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is likely to either not work or create a very hackish fix that might create more problems than it solves. To ensure that you've booted in EFI mode, open a Terminal window and look for the directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you either haven't booted in this way or you're using a distribution that's configured strangely.\nFWIW, recent versions of Ubuntu do support Secure Boot, at least well enough to get GRUB booting with Secure Boot active. I can't be positive, but my suspicion is that you actually installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and were switching between that mode and EFI/UEFI mode. If the Boot Repair fix I've suggested works, then you should end up booting both OSes in EFI/UEFI mode, with GRUB to switch between them.\nAnother option is to disable Secure Boot but ensure that your firmware is booting in EFI/UEFI mode. (How to do this depends on your firmware's user interface, so I can't provide specific instructions.) If an EFI-mode version of GRUB is installed, you should then be able to select it from a boot menu and run it; or you can install another boot loader or boot manager. Installing my rEFInd from Windows, along with an EFI filesystem  driver for whatever filesystem holds your Linux kernel, should work pretty well. Using this option with Secure Boot enabled is also possible, but requires extra configuration.\n", "Q: Ubuntu mouse not working well and everything is running slowly on good computer.

I know that installation was successful (i.e. grub runs and boots it) because I can boot from the external drive from public computers (school desktops) where I see the grub menu and simply run from there. \nI can further attest to this as my brother's HP laptop which is just one year newer than mine can boot from the external HD, and I've even been able to boot Windows 7 from the external hd (that's a different story but the same principle I believe.)\nHowever, when I have it connected to my laptop and set the BIOS to boot from the external hard drive, all I get is a black screen followed by nothing else happening - Ubuntu isn't loaded and I have to hard restart my laptop.\nThe only thing I've been able to see is \"GRUB loading.\" when I hold the shift key upon attempting to boot from the external drive.\nSomeone please help! I've been trying to get this to work for a good 2 months with no luck. I can run the liveUSB no problem as well. I initially thought it was a problem with the BIOS but with it being able to boot Windows 7 from that very external drive leads me to believe otherwise. I've even tried running Boot-Repair with no luck, simply causing the GRUB rescue screen to appear as opposed to a black screen.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Your Bios Probably doesn't support grub from external hdd booting.

Recently I am noticing  that whenever I boot alternative OS the time is not the same i.e. When I switch from Ubuntu to Windows, system time in Windows gets delayed by some hours. But if I correct it and boot again to Windows, the time displayed is right one.\nSimilarly, when I boot into Ubuntu, the time is delayed once its corrected its alright the next time.\nI am using Grub bootloader.\n\nA: It's because Ubuntu uses \"UTC\" Rather than \"Local time\" by default, this can be fixed by opening a terminal and running sudo nano /etc/default/rcS and changing UTC=yes to UTC=no \n", "Q: Setting LOG=1 in /etc/environment I asked a question earlier about viewing the history of notify-osd using the indicator-notifications app.\nThe answer was that I needed to add LOG=1 in my /etc/environment file.\nThat sounded suspicious and I didn't do it because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's in the global configuration file.\n\n*You really can't know what else will be logged other than the notifications.\n\n\nI browsed around and saw this question which also highlights the issue. Look specifically at this answer:\n\nSmall warning: this could be a bad idea... LOG=1 in /etc/environment makes it a system wide variable and could break stuff... God knows what reacts on LOG (ofc. they should have made it something like NOTIFYOSDLOG). Maybe for starters I would add it to bashrc for 1 user just to be sure. \n\nMy question is, how will setting LOG=1 in /etc/environment affect the system? Which 'stuff' will be logged? Is this advisable?\nEDIT\nI solved the notification issue and now I'm just asking about the effects of setting LOG=1 in /etc/environment.\nLook at my question above: \"How will setting LOG=1 in /etc/environment affect the system? Which 'stuff' will be logged? Is this advisable?\"\n\nA: You could use something more user-local like ~/.pam_environment or ~/.profile. These are practically the same approach as /etc/environment except they'll only affect your user. They could still affect other applications.\nWhile ~/.profile is similar to other script files, ~/.pam_environment has a bit of a twitchy syntax that needs to be adhered to (or you'll break your login):\nLOG DEFAULT=1\n\n\nThe other approach that may work is changing whatever launches notify-osd to pass the environment variable along directly. In this case, it seems to be part of some cross-platform DBUS cascade controlled from usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service\n[D-BUS Service]\nName=org.freedesktop.Notifications\nExec=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/notify-osd\n\nI wonder if the Exec line could be changed to read:\nExec=LOG=1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/notify-osd\n\nOr if that throws syntax wobblies:\nExec=sh -c \"LOG=1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/notify-osd\"\n\nIf that works it has the obvious advantage of only affecting notify-osd (any anything it launches).\n\nA: The NotifyOSD doc pages quotes: \n\n(Note: logging to this file is enabled when the LOG environment variable is set to 1.)\n\nIn the Environmental Variable doc page, it has a list of common variables where \"LOG\" is not listed. It says:\n\nEach application is free to define and use its own environment variables. Many manual pages include long lists of environment variables that can affect the behaviour of the application they describe. However, the most useful variables are common to many applications.\n\nAfter googling for instances where LOG may be used, nothing comes up. \"NOTIFYOSDLOG\" would have been a more appropriate name. The use of LOG is completely dependent on applications so it's a mystery who does and doesn't use it. Since it isn't in the common variables list, it may be just a poorly named variable.\n", "Q: Two title bars for all windows I have found that I have two title bars for all window screens.\nThe attached images describe the problem, I can minimize or close the window from any title bar.\nNote: the attached screenshots for maximized Windows.\n\n\n\nA: Umm, Well don't worry my friend this is not as unusual as it may seem.

'{print $NF}'\nHELLO\n\nawk splits the input lines into fields by splitting on the character given as -F. In this case, !. $NF is a special variable that means the last field.

The regex is looking for a ! and the shortest string possible (.+?, the ? makes it look for the shortest) up to the end of the line ($). The \\K means : discard what was matched before the \\K. The result is that the ! (which is before the \\K) is discarded and only the HELLO is printed.\n\n*cut\necho 'E..\".J@.@.U~.........v.....!HELLO' | cut -d'!' -f2\n\ncut is a utility that, well, cuts lines. In this case, I am setting the field delimiter to ! and printing the 2nd field, the HELLO.\n\n*perl\n echo 'E..\".J@.@.U~.........v.....!HELLO' | perl -pe 's/.+\\!//'\n\nThe -p means \"print every line after applying the script given with -e to it\". The script itself uses the substitution operator (s/pattern/replacement/) to replace everything up to the last ! (here, since there is no ?, the .+ will match the longest possible string) with nothing, effectively leaving only the HELLO.\n\nA: Based on the structure of the udp packet, you should cut the tcpdump output from a specific location, instead of looking for a certain character, which could also change:\nsudo tcpdump -Aq -i lo udp  port 1234 | cut -c29-\n\nFor example, sending a udp packet with netcat:\necho \"HELLO\" | netcat -4u -w1 localhost 1234\n\nthis is my tcpdump output (in hex and ascii ):\nsudo tcpdump -X -i lo udp port 1234\n\n12:35:10.672236 IP localhost.36898 > localhost.1234: UDP, length 6\n     0x0000:  4500 0022 ab0e 4000 4011 91ba 7f00 0001  E..\"..@.@.......\n     0x0010:  7f00 0001 9022 04d2 000e fe21 4845 4c4c  .....\".....!HELL\n     0x0020:  4f0a                                     O.\n\nbut, sending another string, like:\necho \"HELLOS\" | netcat -4u -w1 localhost 1234\n\nthis is the output:\n12:50:01.987211 IP localhost.45180 > localhost.1234: UDP, length 7\n    0x0000:  4500 0023 3873 4000 4011 0455 7f00 0001  E..#8s@.@..U....\n    0x0010:  7f00 0001 b07c 04d2 000f fe22 4845 4c4c  .....|.....\"HELL\n    0x0020:  4f53 0a                                  OS.\n\nthe character before the string \"HELLOS\" is changed, because the 2 byte preceding the date section are related to the udp checksum, and then change according to the packet sent.\nwhireshark screenshot:\nIP:\n\nUDP packet:\n\nand 2 byte checksum:\n\n", "Q: USB 2.0 1 to 4 port splitter not working This is the output of lsusb -v on ubuntu 12.04\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 0408:2fb1 Quanta Computer, Inc. \nDevice Descriptor:\n  bLength                18\n  bDescriptorType         1\n  bcdUSB               2.00\n  bDeviceClass          239 Miscellaneous Device\n  bDeviceSubClass         2 ?\n  bDeviceProtocol         1 Interface Association\n  bMaxPacketSize0        64\n  idVendor           0x0408 Quanta Computer, Inc.\n  idProduct          0x2fb1 \n  bcdDevice            9.01\n  iManufacturer           3 \n  iProduct                2 \n  iSerial                 0 \n  bNumConfigurations      1\n  Configuration Descriptor:\n    bLength                 9\n    bDescriptorType         2\n    wTotalLength         1457\n    bNumInterfaces          3\n    bConfigurationValue     1\n    iConfiguration          2 \n    bmAttributes         0x80\n      (Bus Powered)\n    MaxPower              250mA\n    ** UNRECOGNIZED:  24 ff 42 49 53 54 00 01 05 02 10 00 00 00 00 00 01 05 d0 07 02 06 d0 07 03 07 d0 07 04 08 d0 07 05 09 d0 07\n\nlsusb -v : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7218456/\nlspci -v : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7218460/\n\nA: If the hub doesn't work on multiple computers and operating systems, that suggests that the computer themselves are not to blame.

I have a netbook running Ubuntu. I edited my /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf by uncommenting these:\nEnable=Source\nSCORouting=PCM\nAutoConnect=true\n\nI tested whether my laptop receives audio by connecting a Nexus phone. I played a song on the phone and there was audio output from laptop speakers.\nAfter this, I did a Bluetooth scan on the TV to see if it detects my laptop as an audio sink. But it failed to show any devises. But my laptop Bluetooth stack sees the TV as a A2DP audio source. As TV is the audio source and it should detect my laptop as an audio sink and it is not happening. I have many Bluetooth devises and TV detects none. So, how can I get my TV to detect my laptop as an A2DP audio sink?\n\nA: Try changing your COD (class of device) in main.conf. \nDuring the Bluetooth discovery process, certain devices may \"see\" your device but will not ennumerate it in their list of available devices because it is not advertising the major or minor class that the remote device is looking for. In this case you would probably want to change your laptop cod to something that traditionally has an audio sink role, such as a speaker or headset so your TV will ennummerate it in its list. See the Bluetooth SIG assigned numbers for reference.\n\nA: The last 3 lines of /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf are commented, just uncomment those lines deleting the hash in front of them, leave like that:\n[A2DP]\nSBCSources=1\nMPEG12Sources=0\n\nThis worked for me, now just connect to your headset and use a2dp. It should shows Bluetooth headset on audio configurations.\n", "Q: How to fix disk that is likely to fail soon?

I'd like to install the newest 64-bit version of TeXstudio on Ubuntu 12.04. Since it's not in one of the default repositories, I need to get it a different way. The TeXstudio homepage has links for Debian 6.0 and 7.0, as well as links for xUbuntu 12.04. This answer suggests downloading the xUbuntu version but doesn't compare it to any other versions or explain why.\nWhich one should I choose, and why? Or is this something that I should ask the developers of the program?\n\nA: \nxUbuntu :\n  The 'x' stands for whatever version. So, in this case, \"xUbuntu\" means \"Ubuntu or Xubuntu or Kubuntu or Lubuntu\". \nWhich one should I choose ? : In my opinion, the best would be to take the xUbuntu way, because it's more likely to have the needed dependencies for Ubuntu. \nShould I ask the developers ? : I don't think it's necessary, for the reasons already given.\n\n\nSo, to install the 2.5.2 version of TeXstudio on Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 (64bits), you should do this : \nwget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jsundermeyer/xUbuntu_12.04/amd64/texstudio_2.5.2_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i texstudio_2.5.2_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nOr, graphically, download this package and install it with the Software Center.\n\nA: There also is a well maintained ppa for installing the most recent version of TeXstudio (currently 2.6.6.):\nppa:blahota/texstudio\n\nThis gives you the advantage to install through your default package management, and to get regular updates. Please read more on PPAs here:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n", "Q: Tri Boot on an iMac I have a 2013 iMac (desktop) which is running OS X Mavericks, Windows 8 and Ubuntu Raring.\nI am using rEFInd to do the initial boot up but there are a few problems with this setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*it takes a long time (maybe 30 seconds) for rEFInd to start up (I understand that this is the fault of some Apple scanning, and not rEFInd).\n\n*rEFInd is unable to launch Windows (it hangs with the windows logo). I must hold alt on startup to select booting off that drive.\n\n*Ubuntu's grub lists all the OSes again, which annoys me... especially since it is unable to launch either OS X or Windows if they are selected.\n\n\nwhich basically feels like I have 3 layers of booters, and if I want to boot into an OS I need to remember which layer to use.\nThe ideal setup would be to just hold the alt key on startup, which would give me a choice of OS to startup. It's not as pretty as rEFInd, but it would be conceptually simpler and (hopefully) avoid the startup wait. But Ubuntu's grub is not in the list: it only has OS X, OS X recovery, WINDOWS and any external drives I have connected.\nHow do I add grub to the Mac boot list, and how do I make it the default? And how can I name the options? I'm actually Quad booting with Debian and I'd need a way to distinguish Linux flavours.\n\nA: First, regarding the 30-second delay, see the rEFInd documentation on this subject. The solution that seems to work best is to create a small (~100MiB) HFS+ partition for rEFInd and install rEFInd to it with the --ownhfs {device_filename} option to install.sh.\nConcerning Windows, please post technical details of your partitions and Windows installation mode. In particular, show the output of both sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda in Ubuntu. (You may need to install gdisk via sudo apt-get install gdisk.) If you have more than one disk, repeat those commands for each of them. Post the results to a pastebin site and provide the URL or edit your question to include the output. In the second case, add four spaces to the start of each line to preserve formatting.\nAnother comment on Windows: Starting with Windows 8, it's become much easier to install Windows in EFI mode. Googling on keywords produces many hits on the subject, but this one looks like a decent tutorial. Using EFI-mode booting for all your OSes will solve any number of problems. Unfortunately, Apple and Microsoft don't seem to be doing much to make it easier.\nConcerning GRUB: It shouldn't be necessary to use GRUB at all. If you install an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your Linux kernel, you can bypass GRUB entirely for booting Linux; rEFInd will show your Linux kernels and enable you to boot them directly.\n", "Q: Downloading music & photos from Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit to Ubuntu 13.10 I am a complete novice and intend remove Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit from my PC and complete clean install Ubuntu 13.10.

I should explain that I am not technical and do not understand the workings of software, I also must apologize for my ignorance on the workings of your software as I am only used to Windows  \n\nA: Backing up your data to a D: partition on the same drive will not prevent the Ubuntu installer to use the whole drive.\n\nTo keep our data safe from accidental deletion we need to make a backup on an external drive before we install Ubuntu.\n\nDo not connect this backup drive while removing Windows and installing Ubuntu.\nOf course you can install Ubuntu on your existing Windows partition withoud deleting your data partition on choosing \"someting else\" during the installation. But this needs some basic understanding of a hard drive partitioning and the following precautions to be taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not choose \"remove Windows and install Ubuntu\" on installation. This will warn yout that it will remove everything from your computer. This warning is serious! \n\n*Choose \"something else\" for a guided partitioning.\n\n*Do not hibernate or \"fast boot\" your Windows before you remove it. Properly shut down Windows on last usage.\n\n*Do not have your Windows partitions encrypted.\n\n*Do not have your data partition on a Windows \"dynamic\" disk. Ubuntu can only access \"basic\"  NTFS formatted disks.\n\n*Do not partition, use or format the data partition when installing. Know exactly on which partition your data are. Don't proceed if unsure.\nStill people succeeded in deleting all their data.

I have disabled the sleep timers in my failsafe.conf file which get make a faster boot up time. Are there any downsides? The only things I could come up with looking around was a this description from this link which complains that the wait time isn't high enough.\n\nI think that [30] is really to small a number. You're only safeguarding against the case where a user had an entry in /etc/network/interfaces that where the device was removed or is not connected. Thats a very rare case. Increasing the timeout to 60 seconds would make it less likely to have a false positive and have rc-sysinit start early. (Ie, the case where a dhcp took 35 seconds).\n\nInside of the failsafe.conf file itself states\n\n# The point here is to wait for 2 minutes before forcibly booting\n# the system. Anything that is in an \"or\" condition with 'started\n# failsafe' in rc-sysinit deserves consideration for mentioning in\n# these messages. currently only static-network-up counts for that.\n\n\nI don't believe rc-sysinit depends on the network.\nWhat purposes does /etc/init/failsafe.conf serve?\n\nA: One purpose for failsafe.conf is to prevents problems like this one with slow DHCP servers: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ifupdown/+bug/838968\nYou shouldn't hack at the sleep timer. The problem is probably that you have an auto [ifname] line in your /etc/network/interfaces file for an interface that doesn't get an address. This frequently happens if you install using a wired connection, and then stop using that wired connection in favor of another one (e.g. wlan). \n", "Q: Accidentally deleted /etc/sudoers file I get the following error while trying to update my repositories, \navinash@avinash-VirtualBox:~$ sudo apt-get update\nsudo: unable to stat /etc/sudoers: No such file or directory\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\nsudo: unable to initialize policy plugin\n\nIt seems like I had accidentally deleted my /etc/sudoers file./etc/sudoers file was actually belongs to sudo package, so i try to reinstall sudo by pkexec but it won't work.\navinash@avinash-VirtualBox:~$ pkexec apt-get install sudo\nReading package lists...

(I have a default set of settings for our servers, like a prompt that is red for root to warn the user and large histories with timestamps)\nThe default Ubuntu .bashrc from /etc/skel sets several settings, which might have made sense to set from somewhere where it would not override settings set by the system owner from /etc/profile.d (Like /etc/bash.bashrc) (If a user edits their .bashrc, it is fine to overwrite settings, the system default files are more annoying)\n\nA: To understand what's going on here, you need to understand a little background information about how shells (bash in this case) are run.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you open a terminal emulator (gnome-terminal for example), you are executing what is known as an interactive, non-login shell. \n\n*When you log into your machine from the command line, via ssh, or run a command such as su - username, you are running an interactive login shell.\n\n*When you log in graphically, you are running something completely different, the details will depend on your system and graphical environment but in general it is the graphical shell that deals with your login. While many graphical shells (including the Ubuntu default) will read /etc/profile not all of them do.\n\n*Finally, when you run a shell script, it is run in a non-interactive, non-login shell.\nNow, the files that bash will read when launched depend on the type of shell it is running as. The following is an excerpt of the INVOCATION section of man bash (emphasis mine):\n\nWhen  bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes  commands  from  the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading\n    that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile,\n   in  that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that\n  exists and is readable.  The --noprofile option may be  used  when  the\n   shell is started to inhibit this behavior.\nWhen an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  bash\n  reads  and  executes  commands  from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if\n  these files exist.  This may be inhibited by using the  --norc  option.\n  The  --rcfile  file option will force bash to read and execute commands\n  from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.\n\nWhat all this means is that you are editing the wrong file. You can test this by dropping to a virtual console using Ctrl+Alt+F2 (return to the GUI with Alt+F7, or F8 depending on your setup)  and logging in there. You will see that your prompt and aliases are available.\nSo, in order to have the setting you want applied to non-login shells, the type you get each time you open a terminal, you should make your changes to ~/.bashrc instead. Alternatively, you can also place your aliases in the file ~/.bash_aliases (however, note that this is an Ubuntu feature and you should not expect it to work on other distributions).\nFor more details on which file should be used for what, see here.\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian (and by extension Ubuntu) also has the default ~/.profile source ~/.bashrc. This means that any changes you make to ~/.bashrc will also be inherited by login shells but i) this is not the case in all Linux/Unix machines and ii) the inverse is not true which is why you should generally always work with ~/.bashrc &co rather than ~/.profile or /etc/profile.\n\n*Also, a general note on usage, changes made to the configuration files in /etc will affect all users. This is usually not what you want to do and should be avoided. You should always use the equivalent files in your home directory (~/).\n\n*The various configuration files are read sequentially. Specifically, for login shells, the order is:\n/etc/profile -> /etc/profile.d/* (in alphabetical order) -> ~/.bash_profile -> ~/.bash_login -> ~/.profile\n\nThis means that any setting in ~/.profile will overwrite anything set in the previous files. \n\nA: in Debian for Terminal session I solved this problem for all user so:\nadded to \nsudo nano /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nblock \nif [ -d /etc/profile.d ]; then\n  for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh; do\n    if [ -r $i ]; then\n      . $i\n    fi\n  done\n  unset i\nfi\n\nfrom\n/etc/profile\n\n\nA: VERSION=\"16.04.3 LTS (Xenial Xerus)\"\nOkay so everyone has assumed that the person here doesn't want /etc/profile.d/somefile.sh for all users, but in my case that's exactly what I wanted.\nSo actually as it turns out with Ubuntu if you use this and you want it to take effect in your graphical shell, all you have to do is set the file and then logout and back in again. All your consoles or anything you launch whether it be xterm type or console type (Or dropping to the shell) will now have that file sourced.\nNo need to use .bashrc etc for all users.  Sorry this just wasn't clear in above answer. Everything they said is true but in reality its mostly not true as everything the windows manager launches will inherit these settings so just re-login and solve your issue and don't bother with .bashrc etc if your intention is to apply it to all users.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu on a PC without an OS I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my dad's old gateway PC.  What does each distro say on their website as to minimum specifications?\n\nA: Get the Ubuntu .iso file you wish to use and from there you can either burn it to a disk, or my preferred method, put it on a flash drive.  Now if you are going to go the second route, you must find a boot downloader such as this one: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nOnce you download it to the usb drive (or disk), put it in the computer you wish to turn into an Ubuntu computer.  From an off state, turn the computer on, but before it shows anything more than the make (yours is gateway), press f2 (It can be different on different motherboards, so if it's not f2, you will have to find it for yourself).\nNow you should be at the bio's section of your computer.  From here, you go to boot options, and set the boot order so that the USB (or disk) boots first, before it boots from the hard drive.\nAfter that, save the options and continue, and it will boot from the USB, at which point you will be given several options to install the OS.  These are fairly self explanatory, so you should be fine, just know, if you say replace OS with Ubuntu, your old OS will be gone from your computer.\nHope that helped.\n\nA: Flying blind here, because you have not specified the model number of the Gateway PC, which CPU (32-bit vs 64-bit) how much RAM and hard drive space it has, which graphic card. Therefore, this is a generic answer.\nSome older PCs won't boot from a USB flash drive, so start with burning a CD or DVD from the downloaded image.\nThere are many versions of Ubuntu Linux so I suggest you try several, and choose the version you like, from those which will run on your old Gateway. There are differences in both the desktop environment as well as the apps and utilities they use; suggest you pick the desktop you like (Unity vs Classic GNOME vs KDE vs Xfce vs LXDE) \nFrom the Lubuntu website: \n\nLubuntu is a flavor of Ubuntu based on the Lightweight X11 Desktop\n  Environment (LXDE), as its default GUI.

Also, I read somewhere (on askubuntu itself, but can't seem to find the link now!) that Ubuntu (11.10 onwards) does not support Wifi channels above 11.\nReference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#Interference_Concerns\n\nA: It solved my problem. But strangely 2 laptops with 12.04 behaved differently with same D-link 2750. One could see the wi-fi router other couldn't. I changed the channel to 10 in place of auto and both could see the router.\n", "Q: How can I toggle the touchpad depending on whether a mouse is connected? I want to have my touchpad disabled automatically when an external mouse is connected and enabled when there is none. I have tried using touchpad-indicator but that fails in cases when the computer has been put to sleep with a mouse connected and awoken with the mouse disconnected.\nI have tried to make the following script into a daemon to solve this issue but I can't get it to work:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -i TID\ndeclare -i MID\nTID=`xinput list | grep -Eo 'Touchpad\\s*id\\=[0-9]{1,2}' | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,2}'`\nMID=`xinput list | grep -Eo 'Mouse\\s*id\\=[0-9]{1,2}' | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,2}'`\nif [ $MID -gt 0 ]\nthen\n    xinput disable $TID\nelse\n    xinput enable $TID\nfi\n\nI tried start-stop-daemon -S -x ./myscript.sh -b\nand setsid ./myscript.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 < /dev/null &\nand nohup ./myscript 0<&- &>/dev/null &\nand even ./myscript.sh &\nAll of these return some 4-digit number, which, I guess, should be PID of the started process but when I launch lxtask there are no processes with this PID, even if I tick \"view all processes\". And, of course, it doesn't work!\n\nA: Okay, I've made an udev rule for it, and it is, like @terdon said, a much cleaner way\nSo, thanks to this guide, I created a \"touchpad_toggle.rules\" file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ (requires root access) and filled it with two lines:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNEL==\"mouse[0-9]*\", ACTION==\"add\", ENV{DISPLAY}=\":0\", ENV{XAUTHORITY}=\"/home/username/.Xauthority\", RUN+=\"/home/username/on.sh\"\nSUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNEL==\"mouse[0-9]*\", ACTION==\"remove\", ENV{DISPLAY}=\":0\", ENV{XAUTHORITY}=\"/home/username/.Xauthority\", RUN+=\"/home/username/off.sh\"\n\nDon't forget to replace \"username\" with your username!\nThe contents of these on and off shell scripts are just castrated version of the script in my question. Example - off.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -i TID\nTID=`xinput list | grep -Eo 'Touchpad\\s*id\\=[0-9]{1,2}' | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,2}'`\nxinput disable $TID\n\nYou'll have to use xinput enable $TID in the on.sh\nAnd don't forget to add the script in my question (or the one @terdon suggested, but without a loop) to session autostart like he told you in his answer.\nThat is it, but I have to add one thing:\nIf you have a Synaptics touchpad (I have Elantech, so it's not suitable for me), you can replace your scripts (paths to which you write after RUN+=) with a simple command /usr/bin/synclient TouchpadOff=0 and 1 respectively\n\nA: The basic script you need is simply:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n## Get the touchpad id. The -P means perl regular expressions (for \\K)\n## the -i makes it case insensitive (better portability) and the -o\n## means print only the matched portion. The \\K discards anything matched\n## before it so this command will print the numeric id only.\nTID=$(xinput list | grep -iPo 'touchpad.*id=\\K\\d+')\n\n## Run every second\nwhile :\ndo\n   ## Disable the touchpad if there is a mouse connected\n   ## and enable it if there is none.\n    xinput list | grep -iq mouse &&  xinput disable \"$TID\" || xinput enable \"$TID\" \n    ## wait one second to avoind spamming your CPU\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nThe script above will toggle the trackpad depending on whether a mouse is connected. When launched, it will run for ever and will check for a mouse every second, disabling or enabling the touchpad accordingly.\nNow, save the script as ~/touchpad.sh, make it executable (chmod +x ~/touchpad.sh) and add it to your GUI session startup programs. You have not specified which desktop environment you are using but since you mentioned lxtask, I will assume you are using LXDE. In any case, here are instructions for both LXDE and Unity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the script to LXDE's autostart files\necho \"@$HOME/touchpad.sh\" >> ~/.config/lxsession/PROFILE/autostart file\n\nMake sure you replace \"PROFILE\" with the actual name of your LXDE profile, you can find out what it is by running ls ~/.config/lxsession/.\n\n*Add the script to Unity's autostart files\nOpen Startup Applications (search in the dashboard for \"Startup\")\n\nClick on \"Add\" and then paste the path to your script in the command field:\n\n", "Q: Problems Burning Ubuntu onto USB - OS X I've followed this guide by Ubuntu.com on how to create a bootable USB of Ubuntu.

I like to remap the keys for the external keyboard so I have adjusted the relevant parts (the section for mac) in xkb/symbols/us and xkb/symbols/de as I type both in German and English. Ultimately I would like to be able to have an English and a German keyboard with remapped keys available when the Apple keyboard is plugged in and a basic English and German keyboard available when the external keyboard is not attached. \nI wanted to use gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources to switch the available keyboards. This works fine for basic keyboards, e.g.\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources \"[('xkb', 'us'),('xkb'),'de')]\"\nprovides the choice between the basic English and German keyboard.  \nThe problem however is this. Running\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources \"[('xkb', 'de(mac)')]\" does not seem to work. So the variant de(mac) for some reason cannot be added like this.

I also tried to use Wine to run it, without succes. I don't know if it is possible at all to install it. \nIs there a way I can use VSO downloader on Ubuntu?\n\nA: VSO Downloader is a Windows program for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. You can download the program from http://www.vso-software.fr/products/downloader/vso-downloader.php using a web browser like Chrome or Firefox. Windows programs don't work on Ubuntu, but you may be able to run it within Wine. \nTo install Wine type in the Terminal sudo apt-get install wine. To install a program in wine just right click on the installer .exe file and choose \"open with wine programs loader\". Typically the archive manager is default for .exe files which is why you can't just double click them. There is no guarantee that the program will work in Wine, and it won't be able to use your Linux web browser so you will also need to install a supported browser in Wine. \nYou should install the browser before you install VSO Downloader so that it will be able to detect it. VSO Downloader supports all the major browsers like Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and even Safari.\n", "Q: How to find the internet data usage of all users and categorized per user in ubuntu?

You can even setup PXE server in a virtual machine too.\nBut I see it just additional work without much benefit, as you can make clones in VM.

It then reads b.txt and prints out any repeated values of column 2:\n$ awk 'NR==FNR {seen[$2]=1; next} seen[$2]==1 {seen[$2]++; print $2}' a.txt b.txt\nabcd\n2dfg\n\nThe awk command can be divided into the two parts.  The first part is:\nNR==FNR {seen[$2]=1; next}\n\nawk first tests whether the total number of records (lines) processed, NR, is the same as the number of records processed in this file, FNR.  This is true only for the first file processed which is a.txt in this case.  Thus, for every line in a.txt, the associative array seen with a key set to the value of the second column, $2, is set to a value of 1.  This will be used to indicate that this value of column-2 was \"seen\" in a.txt.  The following command is next which tells awk to skip the rest of the commands and go get the next record.\nThe second part is:\nseen[$2]==1 {seen[$2]++; print $2}\n\nBecause of the next command in the first part above, this part is only executed by file b.txt.  This part begins with a test: it checks to see if the column-2 value, $2, for this record has been seen before.  If is has been seen before once, then the commands in braces are executed.  The first command in braces, seen[$2]++ increments the value of seen so that we will never process this value of column-2 again.  (Consequently, repeat values of column-2 are ignored.)  The second command simply prints the value of column-2 that had been seen before in a.txt.\nIf we can trust that there are no repeated values for column 2, a simpler script is possible:\n$ awk '{print $2}' a.txt b.txt | sort | uniq -d\n2dfg\nabcd\n\n\nA: The following perl one-liner will do the job:\nperl -lane 'BEGIN{%h}$h{$ARGV.\"\\n\".$F[1]}++;END{foreach(keys(%h)){s/.*\\n//;$f{$_}++};for(keys(%f)){print if$f{$_}>1}}' a.txt b.txt > c.txt\n\n\nA: comm -12 <(awk '{print $2}' a.txt | sort) <(awk '{print $2}' b.txt | sort) > c.txt\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*<(...) is a process substitution. i.e. the output of the commands within the (...) is substituted and used as the two inputs to comm.\n\n*awk '{print $2}' a.txt prints only the second field of each line.\n\n*sort sorts the output ready for input into comm.\n\n*comm compares two sorted files. The -12 flags suppress the lines that are unique to each file, only printing the common lines (see man comm for more details).\n\n", "Q: Debconf got a corrupted perl script. How to reinstall it? I got some power issues at home and got a bunch of files in my computer corrupted. I could fix most of them, but one that's bugging me is a debconf script.

I grep'd the /etc/apt folder instead of the perl scripts and found a PNG disguised as a sources file in sources.list.d. In the end, the problem wasn't the scripts but what they read from :P\nAlso, there was another of those bad PNGs itself in /etc/debconf.conf, which was probably the root of all problems. I found that by using the same method of outputting the buggy file - but in a healthy machine, so I had text strings to grep, found the complete file and copied it on top of that PNG.\n", "Q: No control over USB mic input/output level, or other external devices while mic plugged in I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with a Logitech C920 webcam and a brand new Blue Yeti usb mic. My intent was to run through all the input and output devices and settings while plugged in to my laptop, and have a comparison video between my laptop, webcam and usb mic sound quality.\n The problem, while I have the USB mic plugged in I have no control over input volume, or input device. \nIn sound settings, under \"Record sound from\" I switch from internal microphone, HD webcam microphone and Yeti stereo microphone. Although the input level meter reflects my tapping on each device as I change them, the actual audio is still only coming from the blue yeti mic. I put the Blue Yeti mic on mute, then select other input choices(such as webcam mic) and I get no input. Also the usb mic is running really hot. I have the gain on the hardware down to 1 as well as input volume on sound settings set to very low, yet the audio is really hot.\nIn guvcview, I have input as \"sysdefault\" (there is no yeti option) Changing the input device on guvcview also has no affect on audio quality or actual source. In addition, I have the VU meter showing on my video screen display, and despite the fact that I have the input volume turned way down, the VU meter shows red for peaking. The only way I can get any input from my webcam mic, or laptop is by unplugging the usb mic. The bigger problem is that this usb mic is running really hot and sensitive.\nEDIT 1: So I unplugged the usb mic, changed the input in sound settings to \"HD pro webcam c920\" and changed the input volume slider to \"unamplified\" and have sysdefault selected as input device on guvcview, yet I still get a very hot signal (If I change input from sysdefault to hd pro webcam in guvcview, I get no audio). So in sound settings, changing the input level slider seems to have no affect on actual input volume. It's very loud and distorted regardless of input level settings. So with both the usb mic and the webcam mic, I am getting no control over input signal, and it's very loud.\nEdit 2: I went into PulseAudio with editor:\nsudo gedit /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nAnd scrolled down to:\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nand added:tsched=0\nto the end. So the line will look like:\nload-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nThen I clicked save, and I rebooted system.\nI now have control over volume slider, and input levels. As well as I can now switch devices (laptop mic, yeti mic, webcam mic) while recording video. However, in guvcview, I have to have input selected as \"Pulse\", not Yeti stereo mic or webcam mic. If I select any other input other than \"pulse\", I will have no audio. \n\nA: I was also having issues with my Blue Yeti Pro USB microphone.  I figured out how to get it working again.  Try using QasHctl to manipulate your device.  I have it working now using JACK, pulseaudio, and Bitwig studio.  Your mileage may vary.

The installation went smooth except for the black boot screen.  How do I go about this, as I am lost and awash with information overload.\n\nA: \nI need to edit the kernel of the boot loader.\n\nThis doesn't make sense. What you meant to say was that you need to modify the kernel commandline - or, in other words: you need to give the Linux kernel some extra parameters at boot.\nAll you need to do is edit /etc/default/grub. Open a terminal and execute:\npkexec gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nFind the line that starts \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\". Add nomodeset to the end of whatever is in the quotes (even if there's nothing in the quotes).\nWhen you're done, save and close gedit.

In the first case, it matched specific regular files. However, if it matches directories such as /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu, it'll print out the contents of those directories instead (i.e. it would have expanded to ls /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu).\nYou can verify that the wildcard would have expanded to a directory with ls /usr/include | grep 6.\n\nA: As @Sparhawk explained, what is happening is that you are listing the content of the directories. This will not depend on the *nix you are using, as far as I know, this is the default behavior of GNU ls. Non-GNU implementations may be different but I doubt it.\nWhen you run this command:\nls /usr/include/*6*\n\nThe glob (*6*) is expanded by your shell (bash for example) before calling ls. So, given the following directory structure:\n.\n├── dir1\n│   ├── file1\n│   └── file2\n└── dir2\n    ├── file1\n    └── file2\n\nls d* will be expanded to ls dir1 dir2, and give the results you expect:\ndir1:\nfile1  file2\n\ndir2:\nfile1  file2\n\nThis is how ls deals with multiple target directories by default, it lists each directory found and then the contents of that directory. However, if you run it on a single directory, the name is not printed:\n$ ls d*1\nfile1  file2\n\nSo, since there is only one match for the glob *6* in /usr/include and that match is a directory, you are running ls with a single directory as input and, therefore, it is listing the contents of the directory without including the directory name.\n", "Q: Bash Script Difficulty I'm creating a bash script and I want to create a menu. When I run the code it displays the menu but the problem is when the user enters a choice it keeps re-printing the menu to ask again and again no matter what choice was selected.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndeclare -i choice=1;\n\nwhile ((choice!=5))\n    do\n    echo \"Main Menu:\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(a) Add\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(b) Remove\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(c) Seach\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(d) Display\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(e) Exit\"\n    echo -n \"Please enter your choice:\"\n    read choice\n    case $choice in\n           \"a\"|\"A\")\n            echo \"You entered a\"\n            ;;\n            \"b\"|\"B\")\n            echo \"You entered b\"\n            ;;\n            \"c\"|\"C\")\n            echo \"You entered c\"\n            ;;\n            \"d\"|\"D\")\n            echo \"You entered d\"\n            ;;\n            \"e\"|\"E\")\n            echo \"You entered e\"\n            ((choice=5))\n            ;;\n            *)\n            echo \"invalid answer\"\n            ;;\n\n    esac\ndone\n\n\nA: The first step whenever you are debugging something is to have your script print the various variables it is using. For example, here, if you add an echo $choice before the case statement, you will see that it will print 0 no matter what value you give it.\nThis is because you're using the -i option to declare which does (from help declare):\n  -i    to make NAMEs have the `integer' attribute\n\nSo, you are declaring that variable to be an integer and then are passing it letters (strings) and since bash is expecting an integer, it converts it to a 0. \nThe next issue is that you are running a while loop that will only exit when $choice is 5. Even if the rest of your syntax were OK, that would only happen for choice e. \nHere is a working example of your script. I have removed the declare which is unnecessary. \n#!/bin/bash\n\n## Use another variable to exit the loop\nok=0;\n\nwhile ((ok==0))\n    do\n    echo \"Main Menu:\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(a) Add a contact\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(b) Remove a contact\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(c) Seach contacts\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(d) Display contacts\"\n    echo -e \"\\t(e) Exit\"\n    echo -n \"Please enter your choice:\"\n    read choice\n    case $choice in\n        \"a\"|\"A\")\n        ok=1\n            ;;\n        \"b\"|\"B\")\n        ok=1\n            ;;\n        \"c\"|\"C\")\n        ok=1\n            ;;\n        \"d\"|\"D\")\n            ok=1\n        ;;\n        \"e\"|\"E\")\n            exit\n        ;;\n            *)\n            echo \"invalid answer, please try again\"\n            ;;\n\n    esac\ndone\n\necho \"You entered $choice\"\n\n\nA: Open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install 9menu  \n\n9menu creates X menus from the shell. This is a simple program that allows you to create X menus from the shell, where each menu item will run a command.\nRun the following command to create your menu:\n9menu -label \"Main Menu\" 'Add:echo \"You entered a\"' 'Remove:echo \"You entered b\"' 'Search:echo \"You entered c\"' 'Display:echo \"You entered d\"' 'Exit:echo \"You entered e\"'\n\nIt's all done by this one-line command, and because 9menu displays the menu graphically, there is no need to add an \"invalid answer\" error condition, because the menu entries are selected from the Main Menu window with a mouse click, and there are only five possible entries in the menu that can be selected by clicking them with the mouse.\nI suggest that you make the following improvement to your original menu idea.  Instead of displaying \"You entered e\" when you click Exit, why not use the exit menu item to close the Main Menu window and exit from 9menu? To do it that way use the following command:  \n9menu -label \"Main Menu\" 'Add:echo \"You entered a\"' 'Remove:echo \"You entered b\"' 'Search:echo \"You entered c\"' 'Display:echo \"You entered d\"' exit  \n\n\nA: You can do it using build-in function select:\necho \"Main Menu:\"\necho -e \"\\t(a) Add a contact\"\necho -e \"\\t(b) Remove a contact\"\necho -e \"\\t(c) Seach contacts\"\necho -e \"\\t(d) Display contacts\"\necho -e \"\\t(e) Exit\"\necho \"Please enter your choice:\"\n\nchoices=(\"a\" \"b\" \"c\" \"d\" \"e\" \"Quit\")\nselect choice in \"${choices[@]}\"\ndo\n    case $choice in\n        \"a\")\n            echo \"you chose choice a\"\n            ;;\n        \"b\")\n            echo \"you chose choice b\"\n            ;;\n        \"c\")\n            echo \"you chose choice c\"\n            ;;\n        \"d\")\n            echo \"you chose choice d\"\n            ;;\n        \"e\")\n            echo \"you chose choice e\"\n            ;;\n        \"Quit\")\n            break\n            ;;\n        *) echo invalid option;;\n    esac\ndone\n\nIt is easier to use, and you can read your choices from file.

I have a copy of lubuntu (the \"light\" distribution of ubuntu) on one of my machines.  I received a message that the version that I have is no longer supported and that I must upgrade.  When I pressed okay to start upgrading the message box mentioned referenced a newer version of Ubuntu. I was surprised that this did not mention a that there was a new version of Lubuntu.  I decided to press okay and see what happens.  Nothing happened.  The software would not upgrade to either Lubuntu or Ubuntu.\nQuestion:\nHow do I upgrade Lubuntu?  Or am I stuck having to reinstall for each new version?\n\nA: Lubuntu is different from Ubuntu (although the guts of the two distros are similar).  Lubuntu 12.04 and 13.04 have reached End Of Life.  Lubuntu 12.10 dies next month so the only version that will be supported in a couple of days is Lubuntu 13.10 and the new release 14.04 (next month).  To update a version you must either update in order 12.04 to 12.10 to 13.04 to 13.10 etc, which is time consuming  and apt to cause errors or update from one LTS to the next.  Unfortunately, the new LTS release of Lubuntu 14.04 is the first Lubuntu LTS so you are out of luck there.\nTo see the new available versions you must go to Menu->Preferences->Software & Updates.  Navigate to Updates tab and choose your options and then close the window.  You will then be notified of all new versions if that is your choice.\nIn your case you probably need to back up your data, download the new ISO (14.04) when it is released and do a fresh install.  Do not forget to do an MD5Sum on the ISO after you download it.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\n", "Q: Error on dpkg -L Command Result My dpkg -L * gives me this result: \nPackage `20140123_002246.mp4' is not installed.\n\nPackage `20140123_002246.mpg' is not installed.\n\nPackage `anu' is not installed.\n\nPackage `anu.cpp' is not installed.\n\nPackage `anu.sh' is not installed.\n\nPackage `anu.zip' is not installed.\n\nPackage `aplikasi' is not installed.\n\nPackage `aplikasi.tar.gz' is not installed.\n\nPackage `archives.tar.gz' is not installed.\n\nPackage `compizconfig.png' is not installed.\n\ndpkg-query: error: package name in specifier 'Daurah Tegar di Atas Sunnah di Masa Fitnah - Al Ustadz Muhammad Umar As Sewed - Sesi 1.MP3' is illegal: character ` ' not allowed (only letters, digits and characters `-+._')\n\nIt is abnormal.

To fix it I followed this answer:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/a/114193\nThe steps were:\n\n*\n\n*use sudo dpkg -C to get the list of all the packages that are in an incomplete state of installation.\n\n*Edit the list it provides so that it's only 1 line of just the package names.\n\n*run sudo dpkg --configure [list of packages separated by spaces] on all those packages.\n\n*run sudo dpkg --configure --pending to catch the few packages for which step #3 was insufficient.\n\nHowever, I do wonder if perhaps step #4  is the only step that's\nactually needed, or perhaps sudo dpkg --configure -a && sudo dpkg --configure --pending was the single line that would have done the trick. In any case, the 4 steps above solved the problem for me.\n", "Q: Sudo command broken I upgraded my dedicated server from ubuntu 11.1 to ubuntu 12.04.

I have a text file and I need to get rid of all characters before the equals symbol in each line, for example:\nThe line:\nFile 1515 = foo.txt\n\nneeds to look like this:\n=foo.txt\n\nI tried this sed command:\nsed s/=[^=]*^// everyone.pls\n\nbut it deletes all the characters after the equals symbol.\nHow can I delete the characters before =?\n\nA: To delete everything before the first equal sign:\nsed 's/^[^=]*=/=/' everyone.pls\n\nIf the file everyone.pls looks like:\n$ cat everyone.pls\nFile 1515 = foo.txt\nFile 1516 = foo=.xls\n\nThe the above command produces:\n$ sed 's/^[^=]*=/=/' everyone.pls\n= foo.txt\n= foo=.xls\n\nIn the regex ^[^=]*=/, the leading caret means that the regex has to match starting at the beginning of the line.  The expression [^=]*= matches every character up to and including the first equal sign.   Because we want the equal sign in the output, we need to substitute for all that an equal sign.\n\nA: You can use\nsed 's/.*=/=/g' everyone.pls\n\nto remove the characters before =\n\nA: Here are some other options, these will all delete everything up to the first =.\n\n\n*\n\n*Perl\nperl -pe 's/.+?=/=/' everyone.pls\n\nThe -p switch means \"print every line\" after applying the script passed with -e. \ns/pattern/replacement/ is the substitution operator and the regex means match any character up to the first =: . means any character and + means one or more and ? makes the match non-greedy, it will stop at the  shortest matching string.\n\n*awk\nawk -F= '{$1=\"=\";print;}' everyone.pls \n\nawk is a scripting language that automatically splits its input into fields and makes the fields available as $1,$2...$N. The -F= sets the field separator to = and $1=\"=\" will therefore replace the contents of the line before the first equals sign with an = and print the rest.\n\n*grep\ngrep -o '=.*' everyone.pls \n\nThe -o cause grep to only print the matched portion of the line. So, we search for the first = up until the end of the line.\n\n*bash\nwhile read line; do echo \"=${line#*=}\"; done < everyone.pls\n\nThis is using a while loop to read each line, saving it in the variable $line and then using bash's string manipulation capabilities to modify it. The construct ${variable#pattern} will remove the shortest match of pattern from the end of  $variable.\n\n*Needlessly complex\ncut -d= -f 2- everyone.pls | sed 's/^/=/'  \n\ncut also works on fields, -d= makes it cut on =, -f 2- makes it print everything from the 2nd field to the end of the line and the sed substitution command adds an =.\n\nA: sed 's/.*= */=/' YourFile\n\nin your sample there i s space after = that you remove also, just 'adapt' other reply that don't take it into account but what you ask (until =).\n\nA: Almost right - just ordered your expressions backwards. What you want to do is replace all characters which are not = up to the first character which is = and any following spaces with a single = character.\nLike this:\nsed 's/[^=]*= */=/'\n\nYour expression instead replaces all characters including and following the first = character on a line with a =. \nAnd never mind the initial ^ leftmost anchor -; sed reads input left to right anyway, and so if it reads in an entire input line matching 0 = characters it will do nothing, but for all others it will only apply it's rule up to the leftmost = o a line.\n\nA: You might see the problem the other way round and try to match the part you want to keep:\nsed 's:.*\\(=.*$\\):\\1:' everyone.pls\n\ni.e. match everything but surround the part you are interested in in brackets then you add the first group back with \\1\n", "Q: Copying Files from external Drive Hi I have installed Ubuntu 13.04 with single partition.

I like to get all URLs I visit in the browser live captured on the command-line for piping them to another program. How would I be able to do this?\nThe format should be just one URL per line, nothing else, no tabs, no spaces etc.\nThis is what I have got so far. The tab removal is not working. I have seen a comment replying to someone (at the very bottom) who not had problems with piping it to grep that he should escape it. I not really understand this.\nsudo httpry -F -i eth0 -f host,request-uri | tr -d 't'\n\nAlso even if this works it will not work with https right? Is there another way to do this that includes https? I am willing to use browser plugins for firefox and chromium if they exist. Just want to send all visited URLs to a script.\nMaybe I can parse the browsers historys live and pipe that?\n\nA: Network traffic capturing is possible but messy. There are many applications running on my computer that communicate over HTML and they would fill a log up with their automated API handling and wouldn't reflect what I was visiting.\nAnd as you correctly say, it won't show you HTTPS. The URL is an encrypted part of the request.\nI would target the browser directly. These keep a decent enough history in a SQLite3 database which makes querying them pretty simple once you have the sqlite3 package installed (sudo apt-get install sqlite3). You can simply run:\nsqlite3 ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default/places.sqlite \"select url from moz_places order by last_visit_date desc limit 10;\"\n\nAnd that will output the last 10 URLs you visited.\nChrome has a similar setup and can be queried equally simply:\nsqlite3 ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/History \"select url from urls order by last_visit_time desc limit 10;\"\n\nThis works but I had some database locking issues with Chrome. It seems much more reliable in Firefox. The only way around the database lock I found was to make a copy of the database. This works even when the main DB is locked up and shouldn't cause issues:\ncp ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/History history.tmp\nsqlite3 history.tmp \"select url from urls order by last_visit_time desc limit 10;\"\nrm history.tmp\n\nThis approach might even be advisable for Firefox too. FF doesn't appear to lock (or takes shorter locks) but I'm not sure what would happen if you caught it mid-write.\n\nTo turn this into a live display, it's either something you would need to poll (it's not that involved a SQL query, so that might be fine) or use something like inotifywait to monitor the database file for changes.\n", "Q: How to display the name of file which I am currently editing with vim on terminal title? I am editing multiple files located in the same folder, in multiple tabs, on a single terminal.\npwd(directory in which I am currently working) is displayed on the top of the heading of the terminal, but not the name of the file I am editing. It gets confusing when working with multiple files in the same directory.\nHow to display the name of the current file on the top of the terminal in addition to the pwd.\nI am running vim in a bash shell in gnome-terminal, on 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: The current (accepted) answer doesn't work if you switch files/buffers within one of your vim sessions. The title won't get updated.\nThe following is enough to have automatically updated titles in gnome-terminal also when you switch files by using :e foo.txt, :b0, :b#, etc.\nJust place this in your ~/.vimrc file:\nautocmd BufEnter * let &titlestring = ' ' . expand(\"%:t\")             \nset title\n\nSystem: Ubuntu 14.10, vim 7.4.273, gnome-terminal 3.6.2-0ubunt.\n\nA: Simply add \nset title\n\nto your ~/.vimrc.\nExample title: testfile (~/Documents) - VIM\n\nA: You must to have/create a file named .vimrc in your home directory with the following code inside:\nlet &titlestring = $USER . \"@\" . hostname() . \" \" . expand(\"%:p\")\nif &term == \"screen\"\n  set t_ts=^[k\n  set t_fs=^[\\\nendif\nif &term == \"screen\" || &term == \"xterm\"\n  set title\nendif\n\n\nSource: gnome-terminal does not allow changing the title\n\nA: You can append the name of the file you are editing in a tab in the following manner:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to the Menu on top of the terminal.\nTerminal-> Set Title-> Here you append the name of the file you are currently editing \n\n\ne.g. when you open the terminal , the heading of the terminal shows only \"~\". \npwd shows /home/xxx/\nSuppose at this location, you are editing a file ABC.cpp, you can set title of the tab to\n\"~/ABC.cpp\" by appending \"/ABC.cpp\" in Set Title field.\nSimilarly, you can repeat this for other tabs too.\n\nA: This also changes the window title if you rename a buffer:\nset title\naugroup WindowTitleGroup\n  autocmd!\n  autocmd BufEnter,BufFilePost * let &titlestring = expand('%:t')\naugroup end\n\nPutting the command in a group avoids executing the command multiple times when sourcing vimrc more than once.\nThis works nicely with vim-eunuch that lets you rename a file using :Rename.\n", "Q: How can GIMP 2.8 have two different icons simultaneously?

But none listed a solution.\nWell, there is no issue on Ubuntu kernel (from kernel.ubuntu.com).\nI am wondering which patch fixed this?\n\nA: You did not state which version of ubuntu works for you, so I suppose it is the kernel which come with Saucy (13.10). \nTo see the kernel tree go to http:kernel.ubuntu.com, then choose git web. In the search box  put saucy and you will have a list of saucy kernel-related repository. \nIn https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Dev/KernelGitGuide you see that the official kernel repo for Saucy is ubuntu-saucy.git. Choose this repo in the above list and then you can browse it. \nFor example, putting \"r8169\" in the commit search box you have something like that: \n\nNow you can browse here and see which patch(es) you need. Btw, if you have a launchpad issue, search for it; normally patches that fix some launchpad issue have the launchpad issue referenced in the commit, like this one. \nIf you install git and take a copy of the tree(s) in your computer, git diff  is normally powerful enough to show you what is changed in the directory of the driver from two different versions.

I've been experimenting with streaming via FFMpeg. I love how powerful it is! Currently I have it set up so that it streams my screen and adds an overlay for my webcam. Though, there is one thing that I'd like to be able to do that I just can't quite figure out: Throw up an on-demand splash screen.\nPerhaps this would be better explained via example. Say you're streaming a game or something via Twitch for a long while. Then, you have to step away. You could\n\n\n*\n\n*Just walk away, or\n\n*Throw up a \"Be right back!\" splash screen or something, perhaps with a little music (I've got that part figured out thanks to the awesomeness of Pulseaudio)\n\n\nI figured the best way to accomplish this was via a second overlay that overlays the screen/webcam overlay.\nI attempted to add a third input akin to this: \n ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -f xllgrab -i :0.0+738,0 \\\n        -i ~/splashscreen.png -loop 1 \\\n        -filter_complex \"[0:1][0:0]overlay=0:0[out];[out][2:0]overlay=0:0[final]\" \\\n        -f flv ~/Videos/test.flv \n\nThis requires a newer version of ffmpeg than is in the Saucy repos.\nAnd it worked, as the splash screen was transparent. I thought I'd do something clever and swap in a non-transparent image when I needed the splash screen but either ffmpeg caches the looped image or it ignores it when it suddenly can't find the file for a brief instance.\nThe second way I thought of was perhaps using a named pipe and using another ffmpeg instance to pipe in they overlay splash screen when I need it, but from what I've read, if ffmpeg doesn't find any data in the pipe it will not continue processing the rest of the video, instead it will only put out frames when it can pull from all the input sources.\nIf there are any ffmpeg gurus out there, I'd love to hear some ideas!\n\nA: I have done it! Granted, it required some backflips, but none-the-less it works =D\nHere is the script I used:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#NOTE: The framerate throttling can probably be removed due to the limit in\n#the amount of data that can be written to a pipe before it blocks. My\n#streams are at 1920x1080 and cat only puts 5 frames onto the pipe\n#before it hangs waiting for a program to tread the pipe. I found this odd\n#since my splash screen images were only 8k, whereas the pipe size is 1M.\n#Therefore, it might be highly dependent on the resolution of your splash\n#images. By removing the FPS logic of this script, a higher potential\n#framerate can be achieved by the script if that's necessary.\n\n#This is my third FFMpeg input. My other two are at framerates of\n#10 (screen) and 30 (webcam). My output is 10 FPS. I had originally\n#set this to 10 as well, but it caused FFMpeg to choke and start dropping\n#frames for some reason, so I just added 5 since it's a common denominator\n#of both 10 and 30. +2 may have also worked, but that seemed a little too\n#close for me since even 11 had issues with output framerate, hovering\n#around 9.9 FPS rather than the target 10 FPS.\n\nframerate=15\n\n#Tracks how many frames we've written this second\nfiles_this_second=0\nthis_second=$(date +%s)\n\nwhile [ 1 ]\ndo\n  #Haven't written all the frames for this second\n  if [ $files_this_second -lt $framerate ]\n  then\n    if [ ! -f /file/to/test/to/throw/up/splash ]\n    then\n      #Output the transparent \"splash screen\" (no splash screen)\n      cat /path/to/a/transparent.png\n    else\n      #Output the splash screen\n      cat /path/to/a/splashscreen.png\n    fi\n    files_this_second=$(($files_this_second + 1))\n  else\n    #The second has changed\n    if [ \"$(date +%s)\" != \"$this_second\" ]\n    then\n      this_second=$(date +%s)\n      files_this_second=0\n    fi\n  fi\ndone\n\nI can then feed the output of this script into FFMpeg like so:\nsplash.sh | ffmpeg -f image2pipe -vcodec png -framerate 15 -i - (some other video source and parameters) -filter_complex \"[1:0]setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[video];[0:0]setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[splashscreen];[video][splashscreen]overlay=0:0\" (output format options and file)\n\nThen, I set up a hotkey to run another simple script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -f /file/to/test/to/throw/up/splash ]\nthen\n  rm /file/to/test/to/throw/up/splash\nelse\n  touch /file/to/test/to/throw/up/splash\nfi\n\nWhen I want to throw up the splash screen, I hit the hotkey. When I want to take it down I hit the hotkey again.\nThis is useful for a couple of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A splash screen (as mentioned)\n\n*Blanking the screen when entering passwords or something\n\n\nIt also bypasses the problem of the images getting cached like in my question above, so you'd simply have to replace the image with another to set another splash screen.\nI think it's brilliant! What do you guys think?\nNOTE: I am using a self-compiled version of FFMpeg because the one available in the Saucy repositories is pretty outdated. Also, the image2pipe format is undocumented that I can find.\n", "Q: Can't add applications using sudo apt-get and unofficial ppa: unable to lock directory My terminal shows this error.

GUI programs connect to the display defined by the $DISPLAY environmental variable. The general format of the error is\nCould not open display $DISPLAY\n\nSince, in your case, the error says (null), this means that $DISPLAY is not set. You therefore need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are logging in to a remote machine using something like ssh, you will need to export the $DISPLAY of your local machine and tell the remote computer to display GUI programs there. This can be done with the -X or -Y options of ssh:\nssh -Y root@10.251.56.90\n\nAs explained in man ssh:\n -Y  Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not\n     subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.\n -X  Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host\n     basis in a configuration file.\n\n\n*If this is your local machine, you need to install a graphical environment. If one is already installed, assuming a default Ubuntu setup, you can start it with this command:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\n\n*If you have a graphical environment running but for whatever reason, $DISPLAY is set to null, you can redefine it. The details will depend on your actual situation but in most cases, what you will need (assuming, again, you are on your local machine) is\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\n\nYou can then run your GUI program normally.\n\n*If you do have an X server running but have switched to a tty (for example by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1), you might simply need to return to your graphical environment. This depends on which virtual console your GUI is running but in most cases on Ubuntu that will be 7, so you can get back to it using Alt+F7.\nIf that does not bring you back to your desktop, just cycle through all ttys Alt+Left Arrow or Alt+Right Arrow until you find the right one.\n\n*Another common problem is that you have started an X session as your normal user and are now trying to connect to it as root or another user. To enable this, you need to specify that this user has the right to access your graphical desktop. For example:\nxhost +si:localuser:terdon\n\nThat will allow the local user terdon to connect to the running X server. The command needs to be run by the owner of the X session. Alternatively, to allow anyone to connect:\nxhost +\n\nAnd to revoke permissions:\nxhost -\n\n", "Q: Not able to view a file using crontab cat filename.txt \n\ndisplays the contents of the text file in the same terminal the command is executed.\nBut\nIn Crontab when I type\n* 14 24 3 1 cat filename.txt\n\nnothing gets displayed at the time specified.\n\nA: You can use\nDISPLAY=:0 notify-send `cat filename.txt`\n\nTo display a message on screen. crontab itself doesn't know where to print that file.

E.g. if you want to delete the next three words type Alt+3+Alt+D\n\nA: This \"feature\" doesn't refer to the terminal, but is related to readline arguments in bash.\nFor what is it good for?\n\nYou can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands. Sometimes the\n  argument acts as a repeat count, other times it is the sign of the\n  argument that is significant. If you pass a negative argument to a\n  command which normally acts in a forward direction, that command will\n  act in a backward direction. For example, to kill text back to the\n  start of the line, you might type 'M-- C-k'.\nThe general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type meta\n  digits before the command. If the first 'digit' typed is a minus sign\n  ('-'), then the sign of the argument will be negative. Once you have\n  typed one meta digit to get the argument started, you can type the\n  remainder of the digits, and then the command. For example, to give\n  the C-d command an argument of 10, you could type 'M-1 0 C-d', which\n  will delete the next ten characters on the input line.\n\nMore about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press alt + numeric in bash and you get (arg [numeric]) what is that?\n", "Q: how to connect to mysql server in another system from ubuntu I am using ubuntu, and am programming in android.

So what can i do? please help\n\nA: WAMP is an acronym that stands for Windows Apache MySQL PHP. It is also often referred to as web-stack because the each part \"stacks\" on top of the previous one to create a complete system. The linux equivalent is a LAMP stack (yes, you guessed right! it stands for Linux Apache MySQL PHP). \nA good practice is to install the stack on a virtual machine (if your system has enough resources) to keep things clean and separate. Google for \"LAMP\" and you'll find quite a few alternatives (from bitnami and turnkey to name a few). Of course there is nothing stopping you from installing directly on your active OS.\nOnce you have a web stack installed, you will also need the client development libraries for mysql which are available through Ubuntu repositories.

After having a perfectly fine system running very nicely under the Intel HD built-in graphics I foolishly attempted the horror of installing the NVidia drivers.

So even if used after a pipe, grep -r something will search something in files in all directories from where you run the command.\n\nA: Remove the -r option of your grep command and it will work:\ndevice list | grep 'okay'\n\n-r is for recursive search.\n", "Q: Can't type non-english characters in certain places In certain text fields I can't type non-english characters at all (I type a character, nothing happens).

Key presses in Unity will only produce the English key, or nothing will appear if no key corresponds to the Serbian combo, or another part of the interface will fire if the combo happens to trigger it. Other applications, however, for example, gedit, will correctly use the Serbian layout shown in the menubar; but Unity still only reacts as if the layout is set to English. In addition, this is not affected by changing the font.\nThere are 2 issues:\n\n*\n\n*There is a bug somewhere.\n\n*This answer provides a workaround for the bug.\n\nPlease also note that:\n\n*\n\n*This has nothing to do with input methods. This worked with the default input method set to ibus, fcitx, or none.\n\n\n*This is also not related to settings in xkb-options, such as the Compose Key or the 3rd level chooser (referred to as Alternative Characters Key in Keyboard >> Typing.\n(You don't have either of these set; this point is just for completeness.)\nThe key setting is found in System Settings >> TextEntry.\nThe default setting is Use the same source for all windows. Unfortunately, the default setting seems to always create the problem.\nThe workaround is to switch this to Allow different sources for each window.\n\nThe New windows setting will work with either choice, but use the default choice seems to be less quirky and work correctly more consistently.\nYou shouldn't need to log out and in, but it doesn't hurt. At this point, entry with the Serbian keyboards works in both Chromium and Unity search. Well, most of the time. I discovered that Unity is still sometimes a little quirky, but this is also easily worked around.\nWith New windows use the default source, things worked as expected almost all of the time:\nThat is, you open Unity, the source switches to English, then you use Ctrl+Space to switch the source. Now the source is S1 (latin). Typing  [  correctly produces š and keys that depend on a combination also work correctly in Unity. For example, Right-Alt+a produces æ.\nThe quirk is that sometimes Unity's input source and the input source displayed in the keyboard indicator seem to get out of sync and you get or continue to get the problem as described above.\nThe work around for this quirk is to cycle through the input sources. Press Ctrl+Space until you get back to the source you want.\nThis re-syncs the input sources most of the time. A few times I had to cycle through twice. Another time, I had to cycle through the sources, exit out of Unity and restart Unity.\nThe good news is that once the sources are re-synced they seem to stay correct through the rest of the session.\nBetter yet, as mentioned above, using the setting new windows use default source seems to prevent the quirk from happening in the first place almost all of the time.\nThe frequency of this quirk appears to be:\n\n*\n\n*Under the default setting Use the same source for all windows: Always. It will never work.\n\n*Under the setting Allow different sources -- new use current source: Frequent. Cycling through the input sources and sometimes exiting/restarting Unity is frequently needed.\n\n*Under the setting Allow different sources -- new use default source: Rare. Works as intended most of the time. Cycling through the input sources and sometimes exiting/restarting Unity needed now and then, but not often.\n\nI couldn't find this bug in Launchpad, so you may want to report a new bug against input source switching. (I'm not sure of the exact package to report.) There are similar bugs in Launchpad, but all of the ones I saw were older and were not active.\n\nA: I would suggest that the issue is that in some places the fonts that you use do not have the necessary non-latin characters. Try to check that desktop-wide and in the apps that you use the fonts used have a wide range of covered characters, such as the Liberation or DejaVu font family.\n", "Q: Accidentally Deleted Block Special File (/dev/sdb) I accidentally deleted block special file /dev/sdb trying to wipe my usb thumbdrive.

In Unix, the text we type on terminal window is sent to shell as input. How about GUI and TUI?

In GParted's case it's obviously the GUI for Parted. What really happens is eventually anything running needs to get down to a compiler so that the computer can understand what's happening.

If it is, then I assume that the above command is for 32-bit installed OS.\nHowever I installed a 64-bit OS.\nWhat is the correct parameter for 64-bit software? Is it (amd64-) or (ia-64) or (x86_64-)?\nAny expert help is much appreciated.\n\nA: First of all, apt-cache search does not search for installed packages, it looks for available ones, both installed and not installed. Also, the various search patterns you see are not mutually exclusive, so lines matching any of them will be printed. Finally, the ? after ^(ia32-) means ia32- is optional, the expression will match lines that have it and lines that don't. So, your command will indeed work for 64 and 32 bit systems.\nThe equivalent command to look for installed packages only would be:\ndpkg -l *java* | awk '{print($2)}' | \n    grep -E -e '^(ia32-)?(sun|oracle)-java' -e '^openjdk-' -e '^icedtea' \\\n      -e '^(default|gcj)-j(re|dk)' -e '^gcj-(.*)-j(re|dk)' -e 'java-common'\n\nBut don't use that. In Debian derived systems such as Ubuntu, there is a special tool for this, update-java-alternatives which, when run with the -l option will list installed Java environments:\n update-java-alternatives -l\n\nOn my system, for example, this prints:\njava-1.6.0-openjdk-amd64 1061 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-amd64\njava-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64 1071 /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64\njdk-7-oracle-x64 317 /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-7-oracle-x64\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu boots up with full brightness I have installed Ubuntu 13.10 in my samsung laptop,everytime i boot up the system it starts with full screen brightness which is quite annoying in the night.\nIs there a way to fix this problem so that the brightness remains at a level which i set before shutting down the system ?\n\nA: I am having this same issue, but I am using 14.04.

Are applications layer protocols like dhcp, http, dns, ftp, nfs, smb, etc part of system utilities like ls, cp, chmod, rm, mv, etc?\n\nA: What it Means to Be a Protocol\nA protocol is a rule (or collection of rules) about how information is communicated. An application-layer protocol describes how programs and services communicate on top of underlying protocols of \"lower\" layers. These lower layers--such as the transport layer--describe how communication in general takes place, including how higher-layer communication is packaged.\nThat is a very general summary, and there is more than one layered model of networking. How many layers there are, even, is determined by which model one chooses to use to describe how networking works.\nTogether, the layers compose a suite, such as the Internet protocol suite, that describes how a working system (that we think of as \"a network\") is to function.\nThe key point is that a protocol is a rule or description for how something is supposed to work. Therefore a protocol is not \"part\" of a program in any ordinary sense of \"part.\" However, a program can implement an application layer protocol. This means it is written to carry out the sort of communication specified in the protocol, in a way that complies with the protocol.\n(Sometimes programs are non-compliant, too, varying from the requirements of a protocol. Often this is a shortcoming--sometimes it is intentional, when the protocol doesn't fit the needs of users or developers.)\nPrograms that Implement Application-Layer Protocols\nDHCP is implemented by DHCP servers and DHCP clients. HTTP is implemented by web servers (like Apache), web browsers, crawlers, and (together with other protocols) most download managers. The browsers, crawlers, and download managers are HTTP clients. SMB on Ubuntu is implemented by Samba, which has client and server components.\nApplication-layer protocols rest on top of lower level layers that provide a client-server model. Application-layer protocols use this model; you'll notice I've talked about clients and servers for all the above examples.\nSometimes a program has the same name as a protocol it implemented. For example, most operating systems including Ubuntu have an FTP client called ftp. Note that this is just an FTP client; an FTP server executable is usually called ftpd (d for \"daemon\"). A daemon is a service that runs in the background, and many server programs are daemons. It's common for the daemon that implements protocol \"FooBar\" to be called foobard. For example, web server executables are commonly named httpd.\nCore File Utilities Don't Themselves Implement Application-Layer Protocols\nSo you may be wondering if file utilities like ls, cp, chmod, rm, and mv implement any application-layer protocols. The answer is that they do not.\nUsing any of those file utilities may cause network communication to occur, if they access files or directory information across a network. For example, if you have mounted an NFS (or SMB) share, and you use ls to list the contents of a remote folder, network communication is happening. But those file utilities don't take care of that network communication. Instead, the NFS client (or SMB) client carries out that communication. Typically, a file utility like ls or chmod will work exactly the same as when accessing local files.\n", "Q: Problem with Node.js installation I am very new to Linux so my question may seem stupid however I cannot install Node.js and npm software successfully.

Lets just say I have a bash script named backup.sh, and each time backup.sh executes, it would automatically create a txt file named Execution.txt, and within that txt file, the date and time of the execution of backup.sh would be written there. Does anyone have ideas to do this? I have Googled for some answers, but found nothing. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance. \n\nA: Simply put this inside your backup.sh file:\ndate > Execution.txt\n\nThis will create the file Execution.txt inside the current working directory. The file will contain the current date and time (if it already exists, it will be overwritten). Of course you may specify an absolute path to the file:\ndate > /absolute/path/to/Execution.txt\n\nTo append to the file (instead of overwriting it), use >> instead of >, i.e.,\ndate >> Execution.txt\n\n\nA: If you want to record the date for one event in a script, it's likely you'll want to keep a running log.  The date command can be pressed into service as a simple event logger:\ndate +'%c|Backup started' >> backup.log\n\nThe + option allows you to format the date anyway you chose. The details of date formatting are explained in man date. The above command will append a line to the log that looks something like:\nTue Mar 25 14:49:28 2014|Backup started\n\nThe pipe separator makes parsing the log a bit easier if you add different events:\ndate +\"%c|Backup completed: $?\" >> backup.log\n\n$? is the return status of the last command to be executed, but you can use any variable that might be helpful for debugging later. (Note: you need to use double quotes if you want variables to be interpolated.) Looking at the log, you'd be able to discover a possible failure:\nTue Mar 25 14:49:28 2014|Backup started\nTue Mar 25 14:49:52 2014|Backup completed: 1\n\n\nA: You have to add the following line in your backup.sh script:\ndate >> /path/to/Execution.txt\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*date - print the system date and time\n\n*>> /path/to/Execution.txt redirect the output and appends it to the /path/toExecution.txt file.\n\n", "Q: apt-get says Version was not found but it is there I've added this repository \"ppa:videolan/stable-daily\" using this command:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:videolan/stable-daily\n\nthin I wrote this command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vlc=2.1.2+git20140320+r54512+18+11~ubuntu14.04.1\n\nFinally i got this massage:\nE: Version '2.1.2+git20140320+r54512+18+11~ubuntu14.04.1' for 'vlc' was not found\n\neven though I can see it in the repository page.

This file is not built to be executed alone and can't be.\nYou have to use Minecraft.jar instead. This is the program that takes care of the login and actually calls the launcher.\n\nThe technical reason is the following:\nExecutable Java Archives (.jar files) have to contain a line in their META-INF/MANIFEST.MF that looks like this:\nMain-Class: com.example.MainClass\n\nWithout this line the JVM doesn't know where to start execution.\nNon-executable archives don't have this line in their Manifest, if they have one at all.

I will not boot into the desktop either. Line command is all we got.\nI first only tried to rename the md127 back to md0, but always came back with unable to gain exclusive access, then I tried to add, but always got the busy message. Once I edited the  adadm.conf with md0 instead of the md127 and then rebuilt the kernel, no help, still boots into md127 though the conf had md0. at one point I received an error message that states that the magic is different and they are, though I don't know how that happen, one is aa55 and the other is a mixed number and letter, that seems to be common in the forums I have visited.\nI have researched for days now with no luck, please I need help with this.. thanks. \n\nA: mark this fixed.  what i did..\nfirst i did alot of research, i done a repair on the superblock, however, i don't think this was needed. I edited /dev/mdadm/mdadm.conf to say md0 instead of md127. I failed the drive that was reporting bad, then ran \"update-initramfs -u\" then rebooted, be careful not to boot from the drive that failed. the first time i did this it didn't take for some reason, had to repeat the process. maybe i didnt save the conf file or something.. but if after reboot the cat /proc/mdstat  reports md0 instead of md127 it worked.  after that i just readded the failed drive back to the array with mdadm --manage --add /dev/md0 /dev/sda1  remembering that its the partition that is part of the array not the drive itself. after the add i ran \"cat /proc/mdstat\" agian to see if it was syncing, it was, i waited for the sync to complete.. hours later i rebooted and all fixed..  the problem i was having was i was rebuilding the kernel instead of just doing an update i think..  also as long as \"cat /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf\" is reporting ARRAY /dev/md0 UUID=63621c2f:6fa023e2:e368bf24:bd0fce41 and not ARRAY /dev/md127 UUID=63621c2f:6fa023e2:e368bf24:bd0fce41 ur ready for the \"update-initramfs -u\" and then the reboot and addition of the failed drive.. this may work without failing the drive, but it was just something that i did trying to fix this problem... the md127 seems to be a default md number now any time that the array goes to degraded mode, but it's easier to deal with than thought. although for me it took day's.. check out the link about, wish i would of found that days ago. \n\nA: First, dmraid is for fakeraid; it has nothing to do with mdadm software raid so you shouldn't even have it installed.  Second, you should never try to create an array over top of an existing one; this will destroy the existing array.  Fortunately, mdadm didn't let you do this.\nThe reason it is showing up as md127 instead of md0 is because you don't have the array listed in mdadm.conf.  This isn't really a big deal, but if you do fix mdadm.conf, you then have to run update-initramfs to propagate the changes into the initramfs.\nFinally, it looks like you just need to re-add the first partition to the array with `sudo mdadm /dev/md127 --add /dev/sda1.  Also you seem to have a second partition ( number 5 ) on each disk that is designated for raid, but you aren't using.\n", "Q: Make a disk sleep permanently On my computer I have 3 hard disks with 3 different OSes, but one of those disks it's a little bit old and I want to make it sleep always, because it consumes power and makes noise, but I'm not even using it!\nI tried with the Disk Utility GUI, but it doesn't do anything.\nAlso tried with hdparm.conf, just by adding my device and \"sleep\" on a new entry, it works, it makes sleep the hard disk, but when ubuntu loads up, the disk wakes up again.\nCan I make a \"permanent\" sleep ONLY for this hard disk drive?\nThanks.\n\nA: No, you can't prevent it from starting when you boot up the computer.\n", "Q: Does mv ignore the letter case by default?

I set up the raid and let it build before, then used Samba to set up a share.  I transferred files with my Windows machine over.  I turned everything off and the network link was no longer valid in Windows.  That is when I backtracked and started getting alignment errors.\nThis is my first server, btw. Trying to get this drive shared permanently each time I boot/reboot. \n------- EDIT ---------------\nSo I am still confused if I have selected the correct size for my array.\nAlso, I have tried to add to fstab but I am not sure what (options) to use.\n\nA: You don't need to realign the partitions on the individual disks.  If you want to create partitions in the raid array, then they have a much higher alignment requirement depending on the stripe size of the raid array.  Parted is warning you because you explicitly asked for the partition to start on sector 2048, which is not properly aligned.  Since you are just creating a single partition using 100% of the array, it doesn't make sense to partition the array in the first place, so don't bother.\nIf you do want to subdivide the array, then the best way to do so is with lvm.\n", "Q: LUKS and LVM install: no boot (gave up waiting for root device) I just finished installing 12.04 on my system, configuring it with LUKS and LVM.\nI can open the encrypted position just fine in a recovery disk, but I just can't seem to get it to boot. \nIt waits quite a while for the root partition, then explodes with errors on how it couldn't find the root device:\nALERT! /dev/mapper/vgcryptotop-lvcryptotoproot does not exist.

How do I fix this problem? How can I test my theory?\n\nA: Make sure dm-crypt.ko is in your initramfs. If it's NOT, it won't be able to mount the / filesystem and that's probably why you see the error.\nchroot or just mount the /boot or / filesystem and do a /sbin/lsinitramfs initrd.img-$(uname -r)\nYou should see something like below (from a Debian wheezy box)\n/boot# lsinitramfs initrd.img-`uname -r` | grep dm\n...\nlib/modules/3.2.0-4-amd64/kernel/drivers/md/dm-crypt.ko\n...\n\nIf it's NOT, you may have to chroot into the system from a live CD (e.g. system rescue cd) and regenerate initramfs -> update-initramfs -u -k all.\nBoot and see if it helps, if all good, you should be prompt to input the passphrase for the encryption key.\n", "Q: Auto Indentation not working in Code-blocks 13.12 (svn 9636) I am using 12.04 LTS and for that reason I am not being able to install the latest packages of code-blocks 13.12 directly which we get directly from code-blocks website.

I found one answer that proposes the command\nsudo grep -HrnF '1.2.3.4' /\n\nto find those IP addresses.\nHowever, using this command directly, grep seems to hang. Before it hangs, it outputs some warnings that it cannot access some files inside /proc. Therefore I changed the command to \nsudo grep -HrnFI --devices=skip '1.2.3.4' / > oldips.txt\n\nBut this time it wrote a 29 GB text file until I pressed Ctrl+C. After that I excluded the /proc directory like this:\n sudo grep -HrnFI --devices=skip --exclude-dir=/proc '1.2.3.4' / > oldips.txt\n\nIs this a good way to find an IP address (or text in general) on the whole disk? If not, how would I need to change the command?\n\nA: The likeliest problem is that it will be attempting to enter all the strange files in /sys and /proc and /dev (the first command at least, but /sys will still be an issue). Some of those will be long link chains all of which must be followed and none of which are actually of interest to you.\nA much cleaner approach would be to use find and its exec option. Something like:\nsudo find / -type f -exec grep -Flm 1 '1.2.3.4' {} +\n\nThe above command will find all regular files in / and run grep on them. \n\n\n*\n\n*The -l means \"print the matching file name\", which is easier than printing the line and will probably increase your speed as well. Once you have the matching files, you can grep them at your leisure. \n\n*The -m 1 means \"stop at the first match\", this way large files will not need to be processed all the way through to the end if a match has been found. \n\n*The + at the end means that find will try and combine this into as few commands as possible (another reason why -l is needed, otherwise you won't know where the file came from). This is documented in man find:\n   -exec command ;\n          Execute  command;  true  if 0 status is returned.  All following\n          arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command until\n          an  argument  consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}'\n          is replaced by the current file name being processed  everywhere\n          it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just in arguments\n          where it is alone, as in some versions of find.  Both  of  these\n          constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\\') or quoted to\n          protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the EXAMPLES sec‐\n          tion for examples of the use of the -exec option.  The specified\n          command is run once for each matched file.  The command is  exe‐\n          cuted  in  the starting directory.   There are unavoidable secu‐\n          rity problems surrounding use of the -exec  action;  you  should\n          use the -execdir option instead.\n\n   -exec command {} +\n          This  variant  of the -exec action runs the specified command on\n          the selected files, but the command line is built  by  appending\n          each  selected file name at the end; the total number of invoca‐\n          tions of the command will  be  much  less  than  the  number  of\n          matched  files.   The command line is built in much the same way\n          that xargs builds its command lines.  Only one instance of  `{}'\n          is  allowed  within the command.  The command is executed in the\n          starting directory.\n\nBefore running that however, I would recommend you simply run this:\nsudo find /etc -type f -exec grep -F '1.2.3.4' {} \\;\n\nThe chances are ~90% that any configuration file that sets your IP will be in /etc. Specifically, it will probably be /etc/network/interfaces.\n", "Q: Install PyNSource in Ubuntu 12.04 How can i Install PyNSource in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (the python version is 2.7)\n\nA: You'll have to download it an run it from sources:\nhttp://pynsource.googlecode.com/files/pyNsource-1.61-src.zip\nExtract the zip file and go to the pyNsource-1.61-src folder to change the rungui.sh mode bits:\nchmod +x ./rungui.sh\n\nInstall the following dependencies:\nsudo apt-get install python-configobj python-wxgtk2.8\n\nAn just run the above script to start PyNsource GUI:\n\n", "Q: How to switch to a command-line console I have just upgraded my system but it boots to Low Graphics mode by default.

And, the answers I saw to solve the problem doesn't explain this situation either.\nHow to switch to a command-line console in order to run the commands in Low Graphics mode?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a text-only console by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F3.\n\n*At the login: prompt type your username and press Enter.\n\n*At the Password: prompt type your user password and press Enter.\n\n*Now you are logged in to a text-only virtual console, and you can run terminal commands from the console.

This does not work every time or in all situations, but you may want to try it once anyway.

I have tried the following processes:\n1) Installing via aptitude.  Attempting to install nvidia-current or nvidia-319 results in a single blinking cursor ('_') on a black screen upon boot.  Some more details on this install process.  With the GPU installed I am unable to bring up a virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6 freezes the desktop until I Ctrl+Alt+F7 back in), and therefore I am unable to kill X/lightdm.  Instead I boot into recovery mode when running integrated graphics to run the install.  When I reinstall the GPU, I see the blinking cursor.

Thanks for your time and I will appreciate any advice you can provide.\n\nA: Spent far to many hours trying to install the drivers for a GTX750 card. In my case, my card is too new for the open-source drivers, and the installer on the nvidia website didn't like my system.\nI was also unable to bring up a console - the reason is that without the drivers it cannot recognise the monitor, and tries some weird resolution/refresh combination (1920x1024, 95hz!)\nI found that by enabling \"multiple monitor\" mode in BIOS, ubuntu would use the integrated graphics instead of the GPU card, then I could get to the console and disable X with the graphics card installed.\nThe only place I had luck was at the website smxi.org.\nThere is a script there which I used to download and install the latest nvidia driver (which it pulled from a nvidia FTP repository). It also cleaned up from my previous install attempt. Since then graphics are working well, with no glitches so far (knock on wood).\n", "Q: juju bootstrap in maas fails to retrieve juju tools I installed MAAS, added the Nodes and created the juju but

Why does not Ubuntu have a common CD to install Ubuntu, choosing at time of installation whether to install 32 bit or 64 bit Ubuntu, Like Windows disks.

Even \"ls\" is taking so much time. \nI am using it wireless with two of my linux laptops and connecting to my college wifi network.\n\nA: If\n\n\n*\n\n*you have a very weak wireless signal, or\n\n*the wireless network is under extreme load (this would happen from lots of data being sent between computers on the wireless LAN, but probably not just from Internet access across a wireless AP/router), or\n\n*your wireless network is ad-hoc (which gets slow fast once you have more than two computers communicating)\n\n\n...high latency like this can happen.\nBesides that, and perhaps some other conditions I haven't thought of, this isn't normal--not when SSHing from one local machine to another using the server's local name or IP address. (If you're connecting through the router so it's as though you were connecting over the Internet, but bouncing back to the SSH server, that might be a different story. This will happen if port forwarding or NAT-based DMZ is set up to the SSH server and you access it through its WAN--i.e., Internet-facing--hostname or IP.)\nSo more troubleshooting would be a good idea. You may want to start by expanding your question with details about whether or not anything else is slow over this network.\nOne thing you can try now to increase performance is to use the Blowfish cipher with SSH. So if you're currently running:\nssh hostname\n\nYou'd run this instead:\nssh -c blowfish hostname\n\nBlowfish has a reputation for computational speed, and I've seen speed improvements with it in SSH on some systems... but I don't know if it's actually the fastest (of all sufficiently secure) ciphers supported. Perhaps someone knowledgeable about these matters can post another answer that goes into more detail about cipher choice.\nYou can enable compression too (with the capital -C flag), but I think it probably won't help much, and may even worsen the problem significantly if either of the machines has an old, slow processor or is under very high load.\n\nA: I was running into similar problems on my home network and eventually found this post:\nsudo iw <ADAPTER> set power_save off\n\nDisabling power saving made a world of difference for me, so now I've disabled power management for my wireless adapter at boot.\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit results in 32-bit OS I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-bit on my Dell 8500-XPS.

I want to create a symbolic link from my home directory to Dropbox, excluding Videos. \nThis is what I know:\nln -s /home/pt/ '/home/pt/Dropbox'\n\nWhat should I do? What will happen if I'd like to delete the symbolic link?\n\nA: It would be better if you create symlinks for each file/directory instead.\nmkdir /home/pt/Dropbox/pt\nfor d in /home/pt/*; do ln -s \"$d\" '/home/pt/Dropbox/pt/'; done\n\nThen delete the link Videos and Dropbox\nrm /home/pt/Dropbox/pt/Videos\nrm /home/pt/Dropbox/pt/Dropbox\n\nTo delete every link, use\nrm /home/pt/Dropbox/pt/*\nrmdir /home/pt/Dropbox/pt\n\n\nA: Your question seems to be the XY problem. Furthermore, the question sound like:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to walk from New York to Washington without passing through London.\n\n\nThis because you probably have misunderstood the meaning of a symbolic link:\n\nA symbolic link (also symlink or soft link) is a special type of file\n  that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of\n  an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution. [...]\nA symbolic link contains a text string that is automatically\n  interpreted and followed by the operating system as a path to another\n  file or directory. This other file or directory is called the\n  \"target\". The symbolic link is a second file that exists independently\n  of its target. If a symbolic link is deleted, its target remains unaffected. If a symbolic link points to a target, and sometime later that target is moved, renamed or deleted, the symbolic link is not automatically updated or deleted, but continues to exist and still points to the old target, now a non-existing location or file. Symbolic links pointing to moved or non-existing targets are sometimes called broken, orphaned, dead, or dangling.\n\nSo, if you create /home/pt/Dropbox as a symlink for /home/pt/, this (/home/pt/Dropbox) will be interpreted and followed by the operating system as a path for /home/pt/ directory. Nothing more; it does not matter what files or directories /home/pt/ contain. When you enter in /home/pt/Dropbox actually you enter in /home/pt/.\nNow, I assume that in fact you want to create symlinks in /home/pt/Dropbox directory for each files and folders from /home/pt/ excluding /home/pt/Videos. If so, make sure first that /home/pt/Dropbox directory exists:\nmkdir -p ~/Dropbox\n\nThen create the symlinks (excluding Videos an Dropbox) using the following commands:\ncd ~\nfor file in *; do if [[ ! \"$file\" =~ Video|Dropbox ]]; then ln -s \"$HOME/$file\" \"Dropbox/$file\"; fi; done\n\n", "Q: Associating a keyword to an application in unity launcher I have had this issue with a couple of different applications, but I will use GHex as my example.\nThe Problem\nGHex is a hex editor that I use to investigate files from time to time, I dont use it very often, but occasionally I do...

In the application's desktop file, there will possibly be a line, starting with \nX-GNOME-Keywords=\n\nor \nKeywords=\n\nIf that line already exists, you can simply add keywords to the line, separated by a semicolon. I would however suggest to copy the file first to ~/.local/share/applications and edit the copy.\nIf the line does not exist, add a line in the head section of the file, somewhere between the Name= line and the Actions= line (if that line is present) like:\nKeywords=keyword1;keyword2;`.\n\nAfter you copied and edited the .desktop file, you will have to log out and in before the changes take efect.

I am using \"UbuntuServer13.10\" on my server and \"Windows7-SP1\" On my PC. Now I want to edit, add, delete, rename my files and folders in server using FTP. For this purpose, I installed \"FileZilla 3.7.4.1 win32\" in my PC and then try to connect my server though using it. I added my internal server IP(sftp://192.168.1.99) and my username(Ubuntu username not root) and password and added Port22. After this I was able to see my server files on FileZilla but not able to edit, add, delete, rename my files and folders in server using FileZilla.\nWhen I try to add files then get \"open for write: permission denied\" and when try to delete file get \"permission denied\". Now my main question is that \"How To Edit/Add/Delete/Rename Files/Folders In Ubuntu Server Using FileZilla?\". Waiting for your reply...\n\nA: Have you tried executing the command ls -l on the folder tou want to read/write on? The user you connect with might not have enough rights. This is usually the case when another user has created the files you want to access.\nWhile ls -l lets you check who is the owner of the file/directory you want to access, to change permissions you can use chmod (more info here)\nEDIT:\nIf you want to manage the access right to a specific folder for a single user, you will have to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the folder so that the user is the owner, and thus has all rights on it\n\n*Make sure the owner of the folder allowed the user to access it\n\n\nTo do that, you could for instance change the ownership of the folder and atribute it to the user. That way, you could manage access rights the way you want.\nJuste type in sudo chown -R user /var/www/site1. This recursivelly (thanks to -R) attributes ownership to user.\nFor a bonus, you could chmod 500 /var/www/site1 so that no-one except user (and root, obviously) could read/write on the folder\nNB: \nThe 5 used as an argument for chmod means you grant read & write permission. To grant read, write & execute permission, use 7. To grant none use 0.\nThe first number represent the permission for the owner, the second number represent the permission for the group, and the third represent the permission for the other users. Refer to the link provided if you need more info\nNB2:\nTo check your ownership/permission on a file or a folder, type ls -l /my/folder, and you should get something like this :\n -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 65 Feb 11 15:08 index.html\n     |         |     |\n  permissions  |     |\n             owner   group\n\n\nA: What you are doing is connecting with FTP over SSH (that's what SFTP is). So you are only able to do the operations that your user is permitted to do over SSH - if your user doesn't own or doesn't belong to a group that has write permissions on the files you are trying to edit or the folders you are trying to create files in, you won't be able to do this over SFTP (since you're not allowed to over SSH).\nYou can use ls -alh for example, to check what group those files and folders belong to and, if the group has write permissions over those files and folders, than add your user to that group and you should be good to go (over SFTP also).\n", "Q: Firefox for Ubuntu add-ons I am considering to install Ubunta on my PC. Currently also have firefox for windows installed with a number of add-ons. Are those same add-ons available under Ubuntu?\n\nA: I'm going to say both via the Software Center or the webbrowser,it depends on the add on.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to keep on the outside of the envelope, use the built-in add on manager. Add ons installed this way will be updated frequently, and you will get major version updates.\n\n*If you prefer a bit of stability, use the ones from the repositories. They are (mostly) very heavily tested and pretty much guaranteed to work really well.\nAdd Ons installed from the repositories are not updated between major versions, they only get security and bugfix updates. This is a big plus for stability.\nThe ones provided by canonical are also eligible for canonical's enterprise support, if you're interested in that sort of thing.\nNeedless to say, anything that is operating-system dependent (e.g. ubufox) should be installed from the repositories. The same goes for security-related add ons (even though the only one I can think of is pwdhash). There's no harm (at all) in installing all else via the add on manager.\nHow can I migrate well from my former add-ons without losing all my preferences?\nIf you just remove the items from the software centre, your preferences should be kept.

I am considering to install Ubuntu on my PC. Evernote is an essential, irreplaceable app for me, & I only use the desktop client because all my notes are local. I learned that Evernote for Windows can be installed under Wine & while some people have hit glitches others have reported to have no probs. Assuming a no probs situation, do the updates that the Evernote team put out come through when using EN under Wine?\n\nA: It seems that Evernote auto-update does not work on Wine anymore (at least that's what I can observe in my case, for Evernote 5.8.x - and 5.7.x, as far as I can remember). As you might expect, the solution is to uninstall your current version and install the new one.\nIt looks pretty straightforward, but sometimes you might stumble upon an issue of not being able to install the newest Evernote version after uninstalling the previous one. The error that occurs is basically saying, that you cannot install Evernote because it's already installed for another user and it's only one copy that is allowed to be installed at the same time.\nIf so, after uninstalling current Evernote, run:\ngrep \"with upgrade\" ~/.wine/drive_c/users/YOUR_USERNAME/Temp/EvernoteSetup.log\n\nYou will get a bunch of records like:\n[02/14/2015 14:53:41] Located product {????????-????-????-????-????????????} with upgrade code {????????-????-????-????-????????????}.\n[02/14/2015 15:02:53] No products with upgrade code {XXXXXXXX-????-????-????-????????????} found.\n\nTry to find the most recent one (notice the date information) and copy the ID/string marked XXXXXXXX above (it would look something like EC4A382C).\nThen reverse it (to get e.g. C283A4CE) and find a record in Wine's registry containing that ID/string (you can find Wine's registry in a file /home/YOUR_USERNAME/.wine/system.reg). The record would look like this (notice the C283A4CE string at the end of the path):\n[Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Installer\\\\UpgradeCodes\\\\C283A4CE] 1216443328\n\nThen, you just have to delete it (just that line, nothing more) and save the file. Bare in mind to back up system.reg file to restore it if something go wrong.\nAlthough the solution looks kind of complicated, it works for me every time whenever I cannot update Evernote automatically via auto-update feature. :)\nAlso, you will notice that when trying to download Evernote's installer from official website, you get an information that Evernote is not available for Linux operating system. In such case, change your user-agent information via some user-agent related plugin available for your browser (like User Agent Overrider for Firefox), to pretend that you are on Windows OS.\nMarginal notes: You could notice that for the latest versions of Evernote (especially for 5.8.3 and newer) there is a problem with note titles being invisible. There is a quick and easy fix for that - just issue winetricks -q riched20 command (source).\n\nA: Yes. Evernote will auto-update even under Wine. In fact, checking for and downloading a new version, installing and restarting Evernote happens just as under Windows.\n", "Q: Getting errors when updating the source list Recently I installed Kali and BT5 tools on my Ubuntu 12.04.

But I want to store the output of this command into the array for some processing on each of the index value in the array.\nHow can I store the output of this command into the array?\n\nA: If you just want the numbers at the end of each line:\nnumbers=( $(pdc ... | grep -oP 'okay.+?\\K\\d+$') )\n\nIf you want to store each line into the array\nmapfile -t lines < <(pdc ...)\n\nTo retrieve the data from the arrays:\nfor (( i=0; i<${#numbers[@]}; i++ )); do echo ${numbers[i]}; done\necho\nprintf \"%s\\n\" \"${lines[@]}\"\n\n33\n22\n11\n\n[okay   ]: you are currently listening: 33\n[okay   ]: you are currently listening: 22\n[okay   ]: you are currently listening: 11\n\n\nA: First of all, you don't necessarily need the array, to process the output line by line you can do:\npdc status -a 2>&1 | grep 'okay' | while read line; do somecommand \"$line\"; done\n\nIf you do need the array, Glenn Jackman already gave you the best way to do it but here's another approach:\n#!/bin/bash\nIFS=$'\\n'\narray=($(pdc status -a 2>&1 | grep 'okay'))\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*$IFS=$'\\n' : $IFS is bash's input field separator, setting it to the newline character only (\\n) ensures that your output lines won't be split on whitespace so that you can save each line as a separate array element. Without this, each word of your command's output would be a different element. \nDepending on what you want to do, it might be a good idea to save the old value of $IFS and restore it after the array is read:\noldifs=\"$IFS\"\nIFS=$'\\n'\narray=($(echo -e \"foo bar\\nbaz bar\"))\nIFS=\"$oldifs\"\n\n\n*$(command) : This is called command substitution and allows you to save the output of a command in a variable. There are two ways of doing this:\nvar=$(command)\n\nand \nvar=`command`\n\nOf the two, the $() is better because:\n\n\n*\n\n*It can deal with nested commands:\nvar=$(command1 $(command 2))\n\nFor example var=$(cat $(find ~/))\n\n*It has far fewer issues with quoting and results in cleaner syntax. See here for more.\n\nA: Yet another more intuitive way using readarray builtin (see help -m readarray):\nreadarray -t array <<< \"$(pdc status -a 2>&1 | grep 'okay')\"\n\nNext, to print an array element, let say second element, you can use:\necho \"${array[1]}\"\n\nTo print all array elements on separate lines, you can use:\nprintf -- \"%s\\n\" \"${array[@]}\"\n\n", "Q: iscan doesn't work with Epson WF-3520 I'm trying to use iscan to scan some documents from my printer epson WF-3520.

Their reasoning for blocking me is: \"because of you sending spam\" which I'm not and they told me that if I'm not sending then my OS is probably infected...\nI could use a comprehensive list of tools and guides to check the system (Ubuntu 13.10 14.04 64bit) for any infiltrates/malware/rootkits.\nP.S.\n\n\n*\n\n*I also have Windows 8.1 (64bit) installed just because I also like to\ngame on my home computer... but that's what I only do on\nWindows...when I have time...   \n\n*Wireless is off and even if it's on it's pass protected.\n\n*Scanning of windows didn't reveal anything nor should have since\nthere's windows and games installed there.   \n\n*I can connect to other ports for SMTP but our server uses 25 and that\ncannot change\n\n*I also tested connecting to port 25 from windoze (using thunderbird)\n\n*I use thunderbird for email client on ubuntu and tested a few others \njust to verify that it was not a misconfig of thunderbird.\n\n*Telneting also outputs connection timeout...\nEDIT:\n\nMy ISP still refuses to unblock me...\nMaybe I'll have to open up 587 on the server, since that isn't blocked at the moment (I can still use Gmail)\nEDIT 2:\nI guess today I was connected with another tech from my ISP's support and told me that there isn't a block from them... I was furious!!! I don't know what was the previous tech doing... maybe he is new and was reading from a script..\nSo I tested another ISP via tethering from my phone and I successfully managed to send emails through port 25. Essentially I didn't change anything, only the ISP. Are they kidding me? Maybe the tech-support doesn't know how to interpret what they looking on their screens for my account or could it be something else?\nAnother step I took was to fully reset my router to it's default settings and get another dynamic IP. Still no connection to port 25.\nI'm planning to get a used router from some friend or something to test with another router just to be sure the problem lies with my ISP.\nEDIT 3:\nIt's been awhile since my last update to this question.\nI moved back to my old house (which is in a different part of the country) where I have the same internet provider. The same company!! My settings just work as expected. I can send emails just fine using port 25. I bet the problem was with that nasty ZTE router that the ISP hands out to new customers.\n\nA: It's certainly possible to be infected and part of a botnet in Ubuntu. But it's also really really unlikely.\nYou should be able to ask to your ISP for their records. They will help you find the problem. It's hard to diagnose it from here, but your wireless has a good chance of beign the culprigth. Please check that you are using WPA2 for security and WPS is disabled.\nAfter you resolve your problem and stop sending spam for a while, you can probably talk your ISP into unblocking your ports.\n\nA: It's common practice to block outgoing port 25, as due to spamming concerns it kind of became discouraged for original submission of Email.  It's still used between mail servers.\nThe proper (and typically not blocked) Port for submitting (original) Email is Port 587, the so-called submission port.  Mail providers typically support it, system operators typically do not block it.\n\nA: Many ISPs block ports 25 and 80 for all their consumer accounts. I use a web hosting service that includes email service. they provide me with a smtp server on a non-standard port for outgoing email. It works anywhere. You may well have access to something similar. Think about what services you already have, and investigate them.\n\nA: Is it even possible?\nWhy wouldn't it be? Ubuntu is a really flexible system that shares many problems with most other operating systems:\n\n*\n\n*Software in Ubuntu can be exploited\n\n*You don't need root to run a spam daemon.\n\n*People can crack weak authentication\n\n*Ubuntu users can be convinced into installing/running just about anything\n\n*Once in, hackers can upload/remote-download more software to send spam\n\nLet's just be realistic about security here. A cross-platform Flash exploit could easily translate into a dropper loading and installing a spam daemon that runs itself on login. It doesn't need root.\nDouble-check the ISP's story\n\"But my ISP wouldn't lie to me!\" said nobody ever. Many home ISPs do habitually block port 25 and others force you to use their SMTP servers (that's the only outgoing p25 connection they'll allow).\nBeing a moderator allows me to see your IP and I've checked your home ISP. If you google their name and \"port 25\" or \"smtp\", you'll see a lot of other people in similar situations. And they do have a central SMTP server.\nI know you said this is a new issue but just double check it's not your ISP (or needing the right settings while on your ISP). The workaround at the end should still work for you.\nFinding the problem\nThough possible, I'm still not sure it's the most likely target. If you're anything like me, you're surrounded by internet connected devices and you need to look at them all.\nI would start by asking the ISP for some evidence. Timestamps at the bare minimum but it would be great to see what they're using to make sure it's not an auto-flag gone wrong.\n\n*\n\n*It could be that somebody has flagged a work email with the ISP's abuse department.\n\n\n*You need to know what OS you were using at the time. Both Ubuntu and Windows keep auth logs so compare them against any evidence they can send you.\n\n\n*Log outgoing port 25 activity with something like:\n iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j LOG --log-prefix \"mail connection\"\n\nI'm honestly not sure if that will work if you're being blocked already but it's worth a shot. Various Windows firewalls will offer you various logging alternatives.\n\n\n*Note that any device on your connection could be sending emails, not just your computer. Phones, wifi-enabled toasters, naughty neighbours, etc. Finding whatever is sending this mail could require a network level packet interception and logging. This is all possible but it's a pain in the rear.\n\n\n*Once you've exhausted more likely avenues, take your pick of Linux antivirus software. I can't personally speak for any of them or their detection rates.\nWorking around a block immediately\nIf you need to carry on, the easiest way to carry on sending email is through some sort of obfuscated or encrypted connection. If you have access to a SSH server  (eg at work) that can often be the best method.\nssh -D9100 user@host\n\nThen just alter your email client to use a SOCKS proxy address localhost, port 9100. Your ISP won't be able to interfere with this and I'd be very surprised if whatever's sending the spam could guess the SOCKS configuration.\nWhat's most likely in this case...?\nCheck to see if you can send email through your ISP's SMTP server. I've checked, yours has one. They might be forcing all their users to use it as that's very common. The tech support person might just be confused.\nAsk another user (with another account, on another telephone line) to try connecting to your company's SMTP. This can be done quickly with telnet example.com 25.\n\n*\n\n*If they can't connect, assume this is ISP-wide —not just your account— so it's probably not a security issue... It's just something you'll have top work with or work around.\n\n\n*If they can connect, you're back at square one. There has been something sending email from your network that has triggered your ISP to block you. Virus sweeps, traffic monitoring and paranoia are your best friends here.\n\nA: Many of the other answers focus on someone using your wifi or infecting your machines.  These are possible but they overlook the simplest explanation (Occam's razor...). \nYou are most likely acting as an open relay, which means that anyone in the world can connect to your machine and just ask it nicely to send mail somewhere, and you will do it, no questions asked.  This is frequently why ISPs will block you because it is a simple test for them to do.  They will scan their customer IP block and ask anything on port 25 to relay a test message and if you do, you are a spammer.  It may be the case that no one is actually using your relay, but its mere existence is enough to be blocked.\nTo test if you are an open relay, telnet to your mail server and talk to it.\nThe bold lines are the ones you type.\n% telnet your.mail.server 25\nTrying 1.2.3.4...\nConnected to your.mail.server.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n220 your.mail.server ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)\nhelo geocities.com\n250 your.mail.server\nmail from: the90s@geocities.com\n250 2.1.0 Ok\nrcpt to: someone@gmail.com\n554 5.7.1 <someone@gmail.com>: Relay access denied\n\nThe lines you type are the helo, mail from: and rcpt to: lines.  Make sure you use addresses that are not local to you, both need to be remote hosts.  If you do not get the error 554 relay denied, then you are a misconfigured spam gateway and rightfully blocked.\nThe simplest way to remedy this is to require authentication to send mail through your MTA.  The details to set this up depend on the MTA you are running, a detail which is not present in your question.  \n\nA: Just to ensure you don't have something bad running on your Linux box or network.\nCheck your network yourself\nStart by running this on your Linux machine at home:\nnetstat -ta\n\nThis will list all the tcp connections that are either established or listening (with servers behind them).   If there's anything you don't expect, you should investigate further.\nAnother very useful command that would list all the processes with internet connections they held open is:\nsudo lsof -i\n\n(you will need to have the lsof package installed.)\nNote that the above tests will not cover other devices sharing your internet connection: phone, tablets, internet-enabled gadgets, neighbors pigybacking on your connection etc. as Oli mentioned.  If you have a list of your internal IPs, you may run an external port-scan on each of them, one by one, from your Linux box:\nsudo nmap <internal-ip-address>\n\n(requires the nmap package).  It might reveal ports and services open on various devices that you may not be aware of.\n", "Q: Why there is no nsenter in util-linux?

I want to make this folder accessible as read-only from my wife's Ubuntu user account. I've tried changing permissions using Nautilus but it doesn't let me. There's no end of eye-glazing advice on folder sharing online but I can't find anything that's applicable, everything seems to assume the folder must be in home directory. Is there a relatively simple way to achieve this?\n\nA: 1. Add both users to the same group.\nTo make both users have access to the folder with the same permissions you need to add them to the same user group.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out the group of your user.\nThe easiest way to achieve this is to add the second user to your own user group. Therefore you have to find out your own group. It usually has the same name as your username. You can find it out in a shell by typing the following when logged in as your user:\ngroups\n\nThe output should be something like this:\n<somegroupname> adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n\nThe first entry in place of the <somegroupname> is your primary group, which is the user group by default.\n\n*Add the second user to the group.\nTo add the second user to your user group you type while logged in as root:\nusermod -a -G <group> <user>\n\nIf there was no error, there will be no output.\n\n*Find the UID and GID of your user and group.\nYou will need to sed owner user and owner group the partition should be mounted with identified by their ID. Find the user ID by typing\nid -u\n\nwhile logged in as your user. Find the group ID by executing\nid -g\n\nwhile logged in as your user.\n\n2. Make sure the partition is mounted with the correct umask for your needs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine which umask (Wikipedia has a very detailed explanation, if you are interested) would be appropriate.\nIn short the umask is the reverse mask of the usual unix filesystem permissions, which are basically split up into read, write and execute, in short r, w and x. Those are represented on filesystem level by octal values of r=4, w=2 and x=1. If you want to combine permissions you simply add the values, so a value of 6 (which would look like \"rw-\") would allow a user to read and write to a file, for example.\nThere are three groups of these permissions for each file or directory on your system, the first one regarding the owner user of the file, the second one regarding the owner group and the third one regarding everybody else. If you type ls -l, you can see the permissions of each file in the folder by an output like this:\n-rw-r----- 1 david coworkers 241232 Apr 10 21:17 test.txt\n\nThe permissions in the above line would be split into the first -, which is the bit referencing the type of the file (i. e. directory or link), rw-, r-- and ---, which would allow the user david to read and write to the file and anyone in the group coworkers to read it, while anybody else would not be allowed to do anything with the file.\nHaving that in mind, you will conclude that you primarily want to set the part of the umask regarding the group, because you added your wife to yours and therefore can manage the permissions for both of you by managing the permissions for the group.\nAs I said, the umask is the reverse mask of the permissions - which means you take the number 8 and subtract the value of the permissions you wish to apply, respectively for the user, group and others, i.e. 5 for read and execute. These are the default permissions set for the group and others by most linux distributions - files created with this umask end up with 4-permissions, direcories with 5.\nBasically you want to grant your wife and yourself full access to all files so I would recommend to use a umask like 002 or 003.\n\n*Find out which partition you need to configure / check.\nThere are plenty of commands you can execute to find out which partition or device you will need to check and maybe configure. The output of df, blkid or fdisk -l should help you find the right one. I usually use\ndf -h\n\nwhich should output something like this\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda2       8,0G  6,5G  1,2G  85% /\n/dev/sda3       233G  137G   96G  59% /mnt/data\n\nand\nblkid -t TYPE=ntfs\n\nwhich would result in something like this:\n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"B474E96674E92BB4\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\n\n*Edit your /etc/fstab file.\nOpen the fstab file with an editor while logged in as root like this\nvim /etc/fstab\n\nand find the line regarding the ntfs partition, identified by the UUID, the device name (i.e. /dev/sda3) and/or the mount point (i.e. /mnt/data). Change it to something like the following (using the information you gathered previously):\n# <file system>         <mount point>   <type>  <options>                        <dump>  <pass>\n/dev/sda3               /mnt/data       ntfs    uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0003     0       0\n\nOR\n# <file system>         <mount point>   <type>  <options>                        <dump>  <pass>\nUUID=\"B474E96674E92BB4\" /mnt/data       ntfs    uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=0003     0       0       \n\neither defining the partition by it's device name or it's UUID.\nBe carefull to not delete options that are already set, though of course there should not be any duplicates in the options section of this partition.\n\n*Reboot your PC.\n\nIf I recall correctly, this will be the only option because the unix permissions are not saved to the NTFS structure permanently but the system only remembers them for the time it is mounted. So setting owners, groups and permissions with chown, chgrp and chmod will probably not help on the long run but only for the time until the device will be unmounted once again - which at the latest will be the next time you shutdown your PC.\n\n[EDIT FOR COMPLETENESS]\nAs my first comment suggests, there might be a method to save unix permissions to an ntfs file system, but I cannot verify this for I have not tried it myself. I personally use the way I described above.\n\nA: You can change perrmitions like this\nsudo chmod -R 754 /mypictures\n\n\nchmod command sets the permission of a file or folder. \nchmod command uses three digit code as an argument and the file or folder location.\nIn the example,\n7 – Owner(current user)\n5 – Group(set by owner)\n4 – anyone else\n\nThe fundamental concept:\nExecute is 1, Write is 2 and Read is 4.\n\nSum of these basic ones makes combination of permissions:\n0 – no permission, this person cannot read, write or execute\n1 – execute only\n2 – write only\n3 – execute and write only (1 + 2)\n4 – read only\n5 – execute and read only (1 + 4)\n6 – write and read only (2 + 4)\n7 – execute, write and read (1 + 2 + 4)\n", "Q: Server 13.10, Raid1, LVM, EFI booting on 2nd disk I've read a whole bunch of posts of trying to get your Raid1 to boot up on the second disk if the first one failed.

While this is mostly a curiosity question, I am looking into this in the future...\nIf I were to buy the systems and switch (and such) and clustered them with ubuntu server, would it act as one PC with all the hardware together? or just separate.\nFor instance, If I were to install a desktop environment on the Main machine and look at the specs, would the cpu cores, ram, and disks add up? Or would these systems still act independent with there own hardware.\nalso, when these systems are connected through the switch, can more than one port be used if the system has more than on gigabit port?\nI am asking this as I am already building on a small rack anyway and I am already building a system to render and as file storage.\nstupid question, I know.\n\nA: Clustered systems act as a single server for most applications. Whether the application is available on a single server with failover to another in the cluster depends heavily on the remaining setup of the application and storage, and is a complex set of questions. If the application is compatible with a cluster environment, the storage is shared by the cluster and the application processed do not require specific server identification, generally the cluster acts as a single system.\n\nA: They act as separate machines that have a high speed interconnect and typically run one specialized application designed to take advantage of that interconnect to act more or less as if it were one big machine, for the purposes of that application.  For instance, a web server might appear to clients to be a single web server, but if you were to ssh into one of the machines, no, it would not look like a single unified machine with lots of cores.  It is more like they are running identical copies of the web server so any one machine can handle a web request the same way, and a router sends incoming requests to different machines to balance the load.\n", "Q: Booting from LVM partition I screwed up when I installed my machine awhile back and put the / partition (including /boot) into the LVM.

I do an ls /dev/mapper and eventually (10 minutes or so) the correct LVM partition shows up and I type exit and the machine boots normally.  \nAny way to solve this without having to redo the whole disk?\n\nA: Do you have any space outside of the LVM? (A Windows partition, say?) If so, you could shrink it by a small amount (500MiB should be plenty, but in a pinch, even 100MiB might be OK) and create a /boot partition in that space.

But it gets even cooler with keyboard shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you hit Alt+. or Alt+_, the last argument of the previous command is inserted in the current command, similarly as if you had written !$ at that point.\n\n*It is also possible to hit Alt+Ctrl+y to insert the first argument of the previous command, as if you had written !^ at that point.\n(See the GNU Readline Library or info readline.)\nI tend to prefer the keyboard shortcuts over Bash's history operators, because I can see what I'm inserting before I actually execute the command. However, there does not seem to be a shortcut that enables me to insert all the words of the previous command, i.e., one that does !*'s job. At least I could not find it.\nIs there such a shortcut? If not, is it possible to configure the readline library to add one, and how?\n\nA: If you look at the output of the following command:\nbind -l\n\nor better to:\nbind -l | grep arg\n\nyou can see that doesn't exist any readline function for all arguments like is, for example, yank-last-arg for last argument - which can insert last argument to the previous command (the last word of the previous history entry). So, if such a function doesn't exists, most probably doesn't exist a shortcut to accomplish what you wish.\nLet's try to crate one approached to your request...\nFirst, look for example at the output of the following command:\nbind -p | grep yank-nth-arg\n\nThe output is:\n\"\\e\\C-y\": yank-nth-arg\n\nand can be translated as follow: yank-nth-arg (which insert the first argument to the previous command - with an argument n, insert the nth argument from the previous command) is bound to Alt+Ctrl+y.\nIn the same way can be interpreted any line from the output of bind -p command.\nNow play attention at the following scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you set the following binding:\nbind '\"\\ea\": \"\\e2\\e.\"'\n\nAlt+A will be mapped to Alt+2Alt+. which is mapped to insert the second argument of the previous command. So, after when you press Alt+A, the second argument of the previous command is inserted in the current command.\n\n*If you set:\nbind '\"\\ea\": \"\\e1\\e. \\e2\\e.\"'\n\nAfter when you press Alt+A, the first two arguments of the previous command is inserted in the current command. If the number of the arguments from the previous command is maximum 2, of course all of the previous command is inserted in the current command.\n\n*If you set:\nbind '\"\\ea\": \"\\e1\\e. \\e2\\e. \\e3\\e.\"'\n\nAfter when you press Alt+A, the first three arguments of the previous command is inserted in the current command. If the number of the arguments from the previous command is maximum 3 (as in your case), of course all of the previous command is inserted in the current command.\n\n*And so on.\nFor first 10 arguments, you can use:\nbind '\"\\ea\": \"\\e1\\e. \\e2\\e. \\e3\\e. \\e4\\e. \\e5\\e. \\e6\\e. \\e7\\e. \\e8\\e. \\e9\\e. \\e1\\e0\\e.\"'\n\nAnd I think that this is long enough as far as I don't use too often commands with so many arguments.\nTo make it persistent, add the following line line to your ~/.inputrc file:\n\"\\ea\": \"\\e1\\e. \\e2\\e. \\e3\\e. \\e4\\e. \\e5\\e. \\e6\\e. \\e7\\e. \\e8\\e. \\e9\\e. \\e1\\e0\\e.\"\n\nIn this example I chose Alt+A to insert all arguments (if the number of arguments is not greater than 10) of the previous command, but you can chose any other combination you with by replacing in the previous command the \\ea string.\nResources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Commands For Manipulating The History\n\n*help -m bind\n\n*BASH - How to use arguments from previous command?\n", "Q: ecryptfs-mount-private fails silently on Ubuntu 12.04.4 I have a remote linux server running Ubuntu 12.04.4, which I had someone restart.

As far as which folder it mounts to I believe its under File System [Main] And the subfolder is mnt. But you don't need to know this to access it. All you have to do is, start Nautilus and on the left hand column at the top near where it says File System it should have listed the Name of the Dvd Volume.

Here is where I am stuck: I have an SSD currently that I need to reformat and then partition but am not sure what tool I can use to do that. I have been looking for something similar to FDISK but I'm not sure that I'm even looking for the right thing. I think I should be booting from one of my optical drives to do this, is that right? I think I should then proceed with data-wiping, partition setup, Win7/Ubuntu installations in that order.\nHere are some details on my system and what I figured out so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have the Ubuntu 13.10 Desktop installation disk and a number of Win/Linux utilities however I seem to be missing a program that I can boot from one of my optical drives with.\n\n*My system drive is a 480gb Corsair SSD on and Asus P8Z77.\n\n*Not sure this matters but just in case it is helpful in some way: The SSD drive currently has Windows 7SP1 but it was damaged after an IE10 update that I've rolled back but continue to suffer issues which point to a damaged Win7 installation.\n\n\nA: Disclaimer: I am not a Ubuntu expert!\nHowever, it looks like GParted might be what you are looking for according to this set-up guide:\n\nWe're going to use GParted, the Linux-based uber-tool for all things hard drive. You could grab the Live CD if you felt like it, but since you've already downloaded an Ubuntu installer, you can simply boot a \"live,\" no-risk session of Ubuntu from your CD or USB stick and run GParted from there. Once you're inside Ubuntu, head to the System menu in the upper left when you get to a desktop, then choose the Administration menu and GParted under it.\n\n\nA: Since you want a dual-boot system and your current Windows 7 installation is broken, I would suggest that you first do a clean installation of Windows 7 (see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/installing-reinstalling-windows#1TC=windows-7).\nMake sure that you back up any data files before you do a clean install since they will disappear as part of the process! \nNext, install Ubuntu using the \"side-by-side\" option (this should say something like \"Install them side by side, choosing between them each startup\".)\nThis will effectively partition your hard disk automatically, leaving Windows 7 in one partition and installing Ubuntu in a second partition, and so avoids you having to deal with Gparted.  \"Choosing between them\" is done through a GRUB boot menu that is also created automatically.\nHowever, I would recommend that you find out about Gparted.  It is a really useful tool for resizing disk partitions and creating new ones in the free space that is developed.  For example, you could create a data partition in NTFS format that could be used for all your data files (e.g. Word processing, digital images) by both Windows and Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can't ping machine on LAN from 1 out of 3 Kubuntus I have three Kubuntu systems running, one 12.04 and two 13.10.

So I tried escaping that apostrophe:\nmkdir '\"What\\'s for dinner?\"'\n\nbut it still doesn't work. Any ideas?\nedit: I want to keep the double quotes in the directory name.\n\nA: If you want to create folder with quotes you should escape it using double quotes \" and \\:\nmkdir \"\\\"\\\"\"\n\nWill create folder \"\"\nmkdir \"\\\"\\\"'\"\n\nWill create folder \"\"'\nmkdir \"'\"\n\nWill create folder '\nmkdir \"\\\"What's for dinner?\\\"\"\n\nWill create what you want\n\nA: Inside single quotes, all the characters are taken literally.  However, that also means that you cannot put a single-quote inside single-quotes.  The solution is to have to single-quoted strings with an escaped single-quote between them:\nmkdir '\"What'\\''s for dinner?\"'\n\nIn the above '\"What' is a single-quoted string. It is followed by \\' which is an escaped single-quote.  And, that is followed by the single-quoted string 's for dinner?\"'.\nThe above works well because the rules are simple.\nAnother approach is the $'...' construct.  Using that:\nmkdir $'\"What\\'s for dinner?\"'\n\nThe $'...' form does support many escaped characters including \\' for single-quote.\n\nA: Remove the single quotes from your code like this,\nmkdir \"What's for dinner?\"\n\nThis will create a  directory named What's for dinner?\nUpdate:\nmkdir \"'What's for dinner?'\"\n\nThis will create a  directory named 'What's for dinner?'\nUpdate 1:\nmkdir \"\\\"What's for dinner?\"\\\"\n\nThis will create a  directory named \"What's for dinner?\"\n\nA: Let's say you want to name your directory \n\"\\?$*’KwaMe’*$?\\\"\n\nyou have to type \nmkdir \\\"\\\\\\?\\$\\*\\’\\K\\w\\a\\M\\e\\’\\*\\$\\?\\\\\\\"\\\n\n\nA: You can escape each symbol character with \\ like so :\n$ mkdir What\\'s\\ for\\ dinner\\?\n\n", "Q: My 3954abg wifi card wont connect I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my Lenovo 3000 n100 laptop. Running lspci in a terminal program, I discovered my wifi card is an Intel Pro/Wireless 3954abg.  The wifi card has been recognized, but will not connect.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: First, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, I have better luck with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. After making these changes, reboot the router.\nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly.

I just use this Notebook for coding and other working purposes.\nThanks\n\nA: Installing a \"Beta\" of Ubuntu is a misconception.\nThere are only installation media labeled \"Beta\", but what you are going to install is the development version and it will identify itself as Ubuntu Happy Codename (development branch). Once development phase is completed, it will receive an update of the base-files package which will make it identify itself from there on as Ubuntu 00.00 and will behave like any other installation. This also includes receiving release upgrades depending on the update policy.\nYou can also upgrade an existing installation to a development release at any time. However, you should be aware of what questions are appropriate for \"ubuntu+1\".\nAnd of course be careful when updating the development branch, as \nJo-Erlend Schinstad already said in his answer. Generally it's not particularly dangerous to run the development version on secondary devices during the last weeks of the development process, but when something does go wrong despite all QA effort, it happens when you really have better things you would want to do.\n\nA: Upgrades during development is just normal upgrades. However, if stability is important to you, then I would recommend waiting until it's released. If you do install the development release, then you might want to only upgrade when you have time to fix any issues. I've usually done this on Friday afternoons so that if something breaks, I have the weekend to sort it out. \n", "Q: Cat to named pipe causes hang I'm attempting some streaming with FFMpeg, and I think I have finally found the solution I need to screen blanking. This requires writing PNG's to a named pipe and then having FFMpeg read them as an overlay. However, I seem to be having a weird issue.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmkfifo /tmp/stream_pipe\ncat /path/to/transparent/or/splash/screen.png > stream_pipe\necho \"done!\"\n\nIn this example, echo \"done!\" never actually runs.\nSo, I moved to the terminal and tried the same thing, and sure enough the cat command hangs indefinitely.\nI don't recall ever having issues with catting to named pipes and, indeed, I saw a lot of named pipe references that use just this. What could possibly be going wrong here? Shouldn't cat exit once it has finished writing the file to the pipe? The file being written is just a normal PNG file, so this has really got my puzzled.\nOr is it that cat attempts to close the pipe upon writing perhaps? This would make sense why it would hang since it's not a legitimate file, but I would imagine that cat would know the difference or wouldn't care.\nEDIT: cat $file | echo -n > /tmp/stream_pipe exhibits the same behavior\n\nA: You need to have something reading from the FIFO. \nTry this:\n\n#!/bin/bash \n\nmkfifo /tmp/stream_pipe\ncat /path/to/transparent/or/splash/screen.png > stream_pipe &\ncat stream_pipe\necho \"done!\"\n\nYou should get the contents of the file printed to the screen (same as if you do cat /path/to/transparent/or/splash/screen.png).\n\nA: cat $file >/tmp/stream_pipe didn't work, but I was able to make it work (to some degree) by assigning the pipe to a file descriptor like so:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nexec 3<>/tmp/stream_pipe\ncat /path/to/file.png >&3\n\nI said it works to some degree, because running it stand-alone clogs the pipe and the script appears to hang. This is due to the fact that pipes in Ubuntu have a 1M buffer limit as seen via the command systcl fs.pipe-max-size. Unfortunately, settings this value via sysctl doesn't seem to change it. However, so long as the pipe data is being consumed by another process, there shouldn't be an issue. Any writes to a full pipe will block (it looks like a hang, but it's not) until data is consumed at which point the write will continue.\n", "Q: How to recover a deleted user account I have deleted a user account using the command userdel -r george.\nIt deleted that user with their files.\nI need to restore that user and their files, is it possible?

I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 onto a partition on my hard drive. Now I am not able to boot with XP, only Ubuntu. (on boot up screen, when I choose to boot with XP, it continuously loops back to boot up menu)I would like to backup all my files within XP and totally delete XP OS leaving the complete hard drive for Ubuntu. How do I go about doing this? Where do i begin?\n\nA: You can mount the XP partition within Ubuntu, using a bit of command line magic, and back up your Windows files to a USB disk, without booting into XP if you like.\nBring up a terminal, and run the following command to start with:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIt should display a list of partitions available on your system. One of these is likely to be your Windows XP partition. It might look a little like this:\n/dev/sda1               1        1959    15735636    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n\nSee that /dev/sda1? That's the think we're interested in. It could be hda1 or sda2 or sda5 - but it should have W95 at the end there somewhere (or potentially NTFS as Danatela points out below - depending on what installation options you chose for Windows).\nNext we need to mount it. Run the following:\ncd /tmp\nmkdir Windows\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 Windows\n\n(Where /dev/sda1 is the W95 partition mentioned above). Although there are plenty of other arguments you could supply to the 'mount' command, ubuntu is smart enough to work out what you're after in this instance.\nOk, you now have your Windows files available in /tmp/Windows. Bring up your file manager, point it there, slot in a USB disk, and copy off the files you need. You won't be able to delete the files with your normal user account, since we mounted the drive as 'root' (via sudo), but the permissions should be adequate to give you read-only access to the files.\nOnce you're done, you can reboot your computer, and reinstall Ubuntu completely.\n\nA: There is also a way to do this without re-installing Ubuntu completely, its a bit more complicated, but Ubuntu does not need to be set up again. \nFirs of all, copy all the data you want from your windows partition (using the method described in RedPhoenix's answer, or you can simply open the file browser, select the windows disk, and copy the data off of it.)\nHere is what you do to delete the windows partition and add it to the ubuntu partition. This method is more complicated, but you can hopefully will be able to keep your files. You will still need to do a backup, but if everything goes well, you should be able to keep your files.\nTo use this method, boot up on you Ubuntu install, CD/USB stick, click try ubuntu on this computer, open the dash, and open the program called gparted.\nclick on your XP partition (it is the one formatted as NTSF) In this image, it is the first partition Then click the red delete (on the top left hand corner) button. There should now be a big gray are where windows xp used to be. Next, click on the partition and click the resize button (in the partition menu), then drag the slider on the left to encompass the big gray area. Click ok. It should now look somewhat like this:\n\nFinally you must click on the ext4 partition, and resize it to include unallocated space (like in the this screenshot)\n\nFinally, click the green check button to start the process. This will take a long time, especially if you have a large hard drive. Now you are mostly there, you just need to re-configure grub (the program that manages booting up). To do this, follow the instructions here!\nIMPORTANT: while gparted is working, do not click anything or mess around with the program, it might crash and corrupt your data (i learned this the hard way)!\nEDIT: here is a more in depth tutorial if you need more information.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu on new hard drive I just got a new motherboard to get my old PC up and running.  For some reason I cannot get any usb drives or cd/dvds to boot, however I do have an older hard drive with ubuntu already on it and it boots right up.  This hard drive is old though, not much space and I think its on its last legs.  I have several other hard drives, can I put a 2nd one in my computer and install ubuntu on it while the computer is booted up and then take out the old hard drive and boot straight from the new one?  \n\nA: Yes, you can. I actually did that very recently. Here's how I did it. \nI connected the drive that I wanted to install Ubuntu onto. I then created a rawvmdk image so that I could give direct access to the disk to a VirtualBox guest. I then mounted a CD image on that guest, using the rawvmdk disk image as harddisk. I then simply booted the guest and installed Ubuntu as usual. I could then remove the old disk and boot from the new one.  \nPlease note that this must be done correctly, and if you do something wrong, you could potentially ruin your running system. Pay attention. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have the correct device name for the harddisk you want to install on, such as /dev/sdb\n\n*Open a terminal and run this command, again assuming your disk is actually /dev/sdb: sudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /root/rawdisk.vmdk\n  -rawdisk /dev/sdb \n\n*Run VirtualBox as root (you'll need to do that in order to access the raw disk)\n\n*When creating the new virtual machine, you'll be asked to choose a harddisk. Select \"Use an existing virtual harddrive file\" and choose the /root/rawdisk.vmdk from the previous step. \n\n*Run the guest and install Ubuntu as usual. \n\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu 14.04 Have Improved UEFI Support Or Will We Be Using Boot-repair For The Next 5 Years? Everyday I see questions on here about someone unable to get Ubuntu to play nice with UEFI. They are soon reminded they aren't in Kansas anymore, told to follow the yellow brick road, see the wizard, and ask him for boot-repair. I'm not complaining I understand the widespread adoption of UEFI hardware is new and developing stable software takes time, but I am wondering if any progress has been made that will be incorporated into the new 14.04 Long Term Support release as I've been unable to find any news on this. I did stumble upon some postings about improved Secure Boot support, but I'm more concerned with UEFI support itself than the Secure Boot feature which I don't use.\n\nA: Don't listen to these people. UEFI is a replacement for BIOS, it's been around for years, efi has long been promoted by Apple, and has nothing to do with Microsoft. Microsoft has required manufacturers installing OEM windows 8 to ship with secure boot enabled thus twisting their arms into installing Windows in UEFI mode. This was done to help protect consumers who aren't tech savy, and Microsoft believes if you're tech savy enough to be dual booting you can find the on/off switch for secure boot. If your computer is less than 5 years old you probably have the 1.1 version of UEFI, but the system likely shipped in legacy mode since UEFI wasn't commonly used by PCs yet. As for UEFI support both Windows and OSX have supported it for years, even the IA version of XP supported it, it's not their fault we're not keeping with the times. UEFI is easier to backup and the secure boot option is a big help in the banking industry.\nUbuntu 14.04 will have a beta version of Grub2 that will have UEFI support improvements.\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/01/grub-2-beta-ubuntu-14-04-lts\n\nA: Before going to the actual question, I would like to give you an idea of the basics.\nThe wikipedia page on UEFI, gives detail information about UEFI and its use.\n\nThe Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI is meant to replace the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface, present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers.\n\nUEFI is used by windows™ OS's. Skipping the pro and cons, we come directly to secure boot.\n\nThe UEFI 2.2 specification adds a protocol known as Secure boot, which can secure the boot process by preventing the loading of drivers or OS loaders that are not signed with an acceptable digital signature.\n\nSo secure boot does not allow computers to boot any other OS than the one existing, in most cases it's windows 7/8™ etc.\n\nComing to the question, Linux or any other OS needs to get rid of this blockade, to boot itself into the system. There are few ways to do this, which you can read in many questions across AU. Ubuntu can't do much to improve this situation. M$ wants there PC™ to use only windows™, so they make this process as hard as it could be.\nTHE TRUTH: As long as one takes time to read docs, forums, Q&A sites like AU for understanding the process, it is very easy.

First of all BACK UP IMPORTANT DATA! Things can go wrong (although they shouldn't, you can never be too safe!) The issue here is that:\na -  It appears that you are booted up onto that specific hard drive at the moment. You cannot modify partitions when you are currently using that drive. To remedy this, boot into a live USB (using your Ubuntu Install disk).\nb - When you want to merge two partitions, you need to have them side by side. To do this you need to\n1 select sda2, and move it to the left (using the partition menu>move).\nNote: There will be an error that pops up, warning you about failure to boot, this is normal!\n\n2 Select sda3, click resize, and add the unallocated space to sda3 by dragging the slider on the left all the way to the left. It should look somewhat like this:\n\n3 Select sda6, click resize, and add the unallocated space to sda6.\n\nAfterwards, your diagram should look somewhat like this: \n\nNow what you want to do is click the green checkbox to apply the changes. This will take a long time!\nWARNING: after this is done, your computer may not boot up! To remedy this, you have to re-install grub (the screen that you see before you boot into windows or ubuntu). There are two ways to do this:\nEither way, you need a Live CD/USB stick to boot off of. I found pretty detailed instructions here.

Unallocated partition is without file system and must be formatted before usage. Your /dev/sda6 is logical partition on primary partition /dev/sda3 and can not be bigger then host partition /dev/sda3 without space for /dev/sda5.\nSolution is to move partition /dev/sda2 on beginning of disk.

My BIOS boot mode is set to Legacy+UEFI and my Windows 8.1 installed as Legacy, however, when I try to install Ubuntu, it attempts to install as UEFI and doesn't detect windows and can't install GRUB properly. So I was wondering if there was a way to force Ubuntu to install as Legacy or if I need to completely reinstall everything.\nAlso, this is a custom built computer. The motherboard is an MSI Z87-GD65 Gaming motherboard.\n\nA: First, verify that Windows is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Windows 8.1 booting in that mode is certainly plausible on a self-built computer, but you should be 100% certain of what you're dealing with.\nSecond, the simplest way to get Ubuntu to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is to remove the EFI boot loaders from the Ubuntu boot medium. If you're booting from a USB flash drive, deleting the EFI directory tree on the flash drive should do the trick. There's also a Mac-specific version which, ironically, is BIOS-only, so you could download and use that.\n", "Q: How to list servers running in Ubuntu machine along with their port numbers?

You were pointing it at the java binary itself.\nYou should not need to add $JAVA_HOME to your $PATH unless you are installing Java manually and not using update-alternatives, because /usr/bin is already in your $PATH.\n\nA: You have incorrectly set your JAVA_HOME variable in your ~/.bash_profile file. Change your JAVA_HOME variable to:\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/\n\nand then do source ~/.bash_profile\nThis should resolve your issue.\n", "Q: After boot-repair \"Please install an operating system on your hard disk\" I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 alongside windows 7.

For example, after running sudo ifconfig wlan0 down gnome doesn't even recognize that the wifi is disconnected (even though internet obviously doesn't work any more).\nIs there a way to address whatever system it is that gnome is using?\nThanks\n\nA: If wireless is the only networking interface for your system, you could try nmcli to disable/enable your network, wifi should reconnect automatically in that case:\nnmcli nm enable false && sleep 10 && nmcli nm enable true\n\n\nA: Ended up being quite simple:\nnmcli nm wifi off\nnmcli nm wifi on\n\nNo sleep required.

Both are accessible by entering domain.com.\nI would like to change it so you have to enter cod.domain.com and mc.domain.com to enter the server. It should refuse access if you just enter domain.com (although it should still give you the site if you enter it using the browser).\nIs this possible and if so, how? Using Google I was not able to find any tutorials. I could only find tutorials for Apache (which is not what I want).\nUsing Ubuntu 10.04 x64.\n\nA: This isn't how DNS works. For websites (and their servers) here's how things work:\n\n\n*\n\n*User punches in askubuntu.com\n\n*Browser requests a resolution from domain name to IP from the operating system's networking stack\n\n*This trickles through to the registrar which links to the nameservers for the domain\n\n*The nameserver provides an IP back along the chain for the browser\n\n*The browser connects to the IP (implicitly on port 80) and sends a GET request:\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: askubuntu.com\n\n\n*If the server daemon supports it, it will look at the Host segment before deciding which virtualhost to process the request as.\nThis is how you can host multiple websites off the same IP address.\nBut HTTP and its servers are special; this domain-aware requesting was developed over many years. Most server daemons don't care about DNS. All they really care about is what interface or IP and port they're hosted on and where they allow connections from.\nThis is the case of a COD4 or Minecraft server. They are told what interface and port to host on but that's it. When a COD4 client connects, it's doing the same DNS resolution (up to part 4) but the client isn't sending the domain name and the server wouldn't care if it did.\nIn short, you could stick in any domain that resolved to your game server's IP.\n\nThe only way to make this work the way you would want is to make sure your subdomainless domain name points to a different IP address of your game servers. You could do that. Most hosts allow the purchase of additional domains so you could have:\n\n\n*\n\n*example.com and www.exmaple.com on 1.1.1.1,\n\n*cod.example.com on 1.1.1.2, and\n\n*mc.example.com on 1.1.1.3\nIs any of that worth it? No. Plus it's frankly a waste of IPv4 IPs which are already a scarce resource.\n", "Q: How to add a Package to kernel to make it default package? I want to add xclip package to kernel to make it default package. Means if I give mine custom version of kernel to someone to install then xclip package should also be installed with kernel. They don't have to use \"apt-get install xclip\" command to get it. How is it done?\n\nA: You'd add xclip as Depends in the package headers. How you best do that largely depends on how you're packaging the kernel.\nIf you're building from the Ubuntu packages, the debian/control file currently contains:\nDepends: ${misc:Depends}, binutils, bzip2, coreutils | fileutils (>= 4.0)\n\nJust add xclip onto the end:\nDepends: ${misc:Depends}, binutils, bzip2, coreutils | fileutils (>= 4.0), xclip\n\n\nIf you're building out another way, it might just be easier to add the dependency after the fact. A package is just a compressed archive. You can still break in and edit the control file after something has been packaged but you'll need to resign it (if you're signing).\n", "Q: Why do only IPv6 autoconf services get listed from wlan I've installed squid-deb-proxy on a server which is connected to my router's LAN.\nIf I browse available zeroconf services from my laptop connected directly to the LAN, I see both IP4 and IP6 squid-deb-proxy advertised:\n$ avahi-browse -a\n...\n+   eth0 IPv6 Squid deb proxy on mythbox                    _apt_proxy._tcp      local\n+   eth0 IPv4 Squid deb proxy on mythbox                    _apt_proxy._tcp      local\n\nBut if I disconnect my laptop and try again via the WLAN, I only see the IPv6 service:\n$ avahi-browse -a\n...\n+  wlan0 IPv6 Squid deb proxy on mythbox                    _apt_proxy._tcp      local\n\nI can still ping the IP4 address without problems, it seems to just be the mdns? Also, the server (on the LAN) can see all the IP4 mdns entries for the other (WLAN) machines. Why do I only see the IPv6 services from the wlan?\n\nA: I found this happening when I had an iptables firewall blocking UDP port 5353 on my laptop. This blocked the incoming mDNS registration broadcasts for IPv4 addresses, which are normally only carried over IPv4, from reaching my avahi-daemon and being registered in the cache.\nI had not configured ip6tables, so the IPv6 packets carrying IPv6 addresses were not being blocked, and were arriving at the avahi-daemon and being stored in the cache. So I could see those in my cache, but not the IPv4 addesses.\n", "Q: How to submit a feature request for chmod linux command Note: I believe this question doesn't fit the SO guidelines for question types, but if you can, please move it to appropriate section of the SE network or please tell me where it would be appropriate to put this question.\nThe question is how can I suggest a new feature request (or submit a patch with that feature implemented) for the Unix-like tool \"chmod\"?\nThe feature I would like to see in the chmod tool is to specify an option (e.g. \"-d\") which would make chmod only change modes of directories, not touching regular files. This would make it more convenient than using this approach, which makes use of the \"find\" tool:\nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\nand\nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: This answer completely ignores the request in favour of addressing the how you contact the right people to make a feature request in an upstream project.\nThis request is already been asked and rejected.

I use the man command all the time when I want to get information about a specific command. But this doesn't help me too much when that specific command is a shell builtin. For example:\nman cd\n\nreturns:\nNo manual entry for cd\n\nMy question is: it is possible to make man also work for all shell builtin commands (like cd, alias, history, etc.),  and keywords (like if, while, [[, {, etc.)?\n\nA: The help command when is used with -m option can display information about builtin commands in pseudo-manpage format. For example:\nhelp -m cd | less\n\nwill display information about cd command in a format almost exactly like in a manual page.\nStarting from this command you can wrap man command in one function in your .bashrc file as follow:\nman () {\n    case \"$(type -t -- \"$1\")\" in\n    builtin|keyword)\n        help -m \"$1\" | sensible-pager\n        ;;\n    *)\n        command man \"$@\"\n        ;;\n    esac\n}\n\nAfter this man will work also for all shell builtin commands and keywords.

Doesn't everyone just Google the man page they want (so that they get fancy things like unlimited scrolling)?'. Then I realized that the sites I Google usually all have both types of commands so why not just use them to provide a uniform man page interface across all commands. Hence, this fun was born.\nThis requires an Internet connnection for any entries you haven't already looked up at least once. It also needs these two small apps which are missing in a default installation of Ubuntu:\n sudo apt-get install tidy html2text\n\nThese aren't absolutely needed but they do help make it look a little nicer. Tidy will clean the HTML and html2text will format that html as formatted text (which is usually pretty trivial since most of these sites are already text formatted and just wrapped in <pre> tags. \nNow all you need to do is add this to the end of ~/.profile:\nfunction iman() {\n    if [ ! -d \"/usr/share/iman\" ]; then\n        sudo mkdir -m a=rwx /usr/share/iman\n    fi\n    if [ ! -f \"/usr/share/iman/$1.html\" ]; then\n        curl \"http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?$1\"| tidy -n -asxml 2>/dev/null| html2text > \"/usr/share/iman/$1.html\"; \n    fi\n    if [ -f \"/usr/share/iman/$1.html\" ]; then\n        cat \"/usr/share/iman/$1.html\";\n    else\n        echo \"Entry not found.\"\n    fi\n}\n\nAfter you logout and then back in you should be able to type this:\niman cd\n\nand it'll display the man page for cd.\nThis uses a data directory (/usr/share/iman) in order to minimize our network requirements (so it'll work for entries you've already found before even without the connection; also to minimize load on this random linux man pages site I found with the system entries we want in it as well). If you don't use this anymore you'll want to remove that to recover disk space.\nHopefully, the rest is pretty straight forward.\n\nA: You can install manual pages about using a POSIX system for development as,\nsudo apt-get install manpages-posix-dev\n\nIt will provide man pages for shell builtins.\n$ type cd\ncd is a shell builtin\n\nNow try,\n$ man cd\nCD(P)                      POSIX Programmer's Manual                      CD(P)\n\nNAME\n   cd - change the working directory\n\nSYNOPSIS\n   cd [-L | -P] [directory]\n\n\n...\n\n", "Q: get-edid always fails, yet ubuntu detects monitor make/model in system settings I am trying to writer some scripts to detect what monitor is plugged in and when.

When I listed files in my home directory, there was a hidden file named .ICEauthority.\nWhat is this file, and what is its role?\n\nA: \nBasically ICE is a inter process communication protocol, with authentication, protocol negotiation and potentially multiplexing built in.\nIt allows two X clients to talk directly to each other, for example, a video player program could potentially talk to a jukebox program to update each other.\nAs Richard Holloway says, the .ICEAuthority file is for authentication. It contains a number of random cookies. If two programs have the same cookie, then they're allowed to talk to each other. In practice this either means that they're reading the same .ICEAuthority file, or the cookies have been added.\nIn a lot of ways it's similar to the xauth program & the .Xauthority file, except that .ICEAuthority is used for client to client, while .Xauthority is for client to server.\n\nSOURCE: https://serverfault.com/questions/119580/what-is-iceauthority-file-in-opensuse-11-2\nFor detailed info on what ICE is and what it does, you can download this pdf file.\nFor more info, look at this question: What are \"unknown\" file types?\n", "Q: Change MAC address via Terminal Is there any way to change MAC address via Terminal ?And  of course any command for this job ?\n\nA: Easiest way to change mac address on nic is:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 down\nsudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up\n\nWhere xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx represent mac address\nFor wlan\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\n", "Q: itunes alternative that will sync with an android Apparently there's a bit of a workaround with rhythmbox to get it to sync with an android.

Yeah, it's fine.\nBut I'll offer you an alternative because that's what I do:\nshopt -s globstar dotglob\nsha1sum **\n\nglobstar enables a recursive match for ** and dotglob enables matching hidden files. Between them they expand to all the filenames and sha1sum can parse them all.\nThe main problem with this approach is it will pass all the filenames off to sha1sum in one fat pile. While this can be somewhat faster at small loads, it will explode if you have too many filenames. I don't know what the cut-off is.\n\nA: Python script with hashlib and os.walk\nAside from using find and globstar, python has modules for hashsum calculation and recursive walk through directory tree. Thus, one can write a simple script just as presented below.

When I restarted the system, I found out that my drive was reformatted. Is there a way I can recover my files?\n\nA: The short answer is \"no\".\nThe long answer is \"yes but . . .\" You've re-partitioned the drive with a different type of data structure (ext4) that Windows can't recognize, so the original partition table that tells an operating system what is data and where it is is gone, and some of the data has been overwritten by the new version of Ubuntu you've installed. Much of your original data is likely still on the hard disk, but there is no way to find it, and every time you use the drive for anything, even booting the computer from it, more of this remaining data that you can't get will be over-written. It is possible (but exceedingly difficult) to recover some of the data in situations like yours, but it's not something you can pick up with a quick Google search, and it's something that gets harder the more you use that computer. At the very least, you'll need another disk to boot from, perhaps a Live DVD like you installed Ubuntu from, or you could remove it from that computer and use it as a second drive in a different computer so you can read from it without writing to it.\nAs you can see, this is not going to be easy.

The reboot problem on shutdown, after suspend, persisted across the different chips.\n@terdon: I see two potential problems in var/log/pm-suspend.log.

Basically, I would like to be able to do things in Windows while sort of running Ubuntu in the background. I've already dual booted my machine and everything runs properly. \nI would want to do this with my computer as is, without creating a virtual machine.\n\nA: No, to the best of my knowledge that is not possible without creating a virtual machine. There would need to be something like a hypervisor in the bios.

T410p, NVIDIA I've just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a Lenovo T440p. I have an integrated Intel GPU, which works fine (until now), and another gpu (NVIDIA GeForce 730M) which I wanted to use instead. I installed the drivers but I had the following problem: whenever I close the lid the laptop goes into sleep mode, but when I open the lid, the screen shows crap (it's not black, it has glitches) and it doesn't return normal. It's kind of annoying since one has to shut down the computer brutally.\nI also tried installing directly the drivers which one can download from the NVIDIA website, or doing everything on Ubuntu 13.10 but this doesn't change much.\nNote that this only happens when I'm using the NVIDIA gpu. If I deactivate the driver for the NVIDIA, and use the intel instead, then the screen works fine, also after having reopened the lid after sleep mode.\nWith Ubuntu 13.10 it's the same. I have read in some forums that some other users had the problem that they're screen went black after sleep mode, but I couldn't find any post about glitches, and I also tried the solutions for the black screen.\nIf there is a similar post, please delete this one, if not, I'd be happy to hear from someone that had the same problem or that has a clue about it!\nthanks,\nnico \n\nA: I have the same problem with NVIDIA 740M, from what I have read so far its seems to be related to the NVIDIA prime tecnology that allows to switch between the INTEL and NVIDA GPUs on the fly.

I want to write a bash script to download and install BleachBit from a .deb file only if the version already installed is not 1.0. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and Bleachbit is only version 0.9 in the official repositories and I cannot find a PPA with version 1.0 for Ubuntu Precise. How can I do this?\n\nA: Here's a simpler version of your script, (keeping the humor intact :) ):\n#!/bin/bash\n\n## The && means that the script will run the next command only if this one\n## succeeds, in other words, only if the string `version 1.0` is found.\nbleachbit --version | grep -q 'version 1.0' &&\n echo \"$(tput setaf 2)The elves have verified the BleachBit version.$(tput sgr0)\" &&\n   exit 0\n## This block will only be executed if the grep above failed\nwget -P ~/Downloads http://katana.oooninja.com/bleachbit/sf/bleachbit_1.0_all_ubuntu1204.deb &&\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/bleachbit_1.0_all_ubuntu1204.deb &&\n echo \"$(tput setaf 2)The elves have installed BleachBit 1.0.$(tput sgr0)\" \n\nNote that I added && to the end of each command, that way, you will avoid errors if any of the commands fail since the script will exit on the first failed command.\nA safer approach would be to change the first command to:\nbleachbit --version | awk '/version/{if($NF>=1){exit 0}else{exit 1}}' \n\nThis has the advantage that it will work fine for future versions, when the version number will be greater than 1. The $NF in awk means the last field and /version/ means the script will run on lines matching version. So, since the first line is:\ninfo: starting BleachBit version 1.0\n\nawk will test whether the last field (1.0) here is greater than or equal to one and will exit with a 0 status (success), if it is which means that the next block (&&) will be executed, and your script will stop. \nYou could also condense the entire thing to:\nbleachbit --version | head -n 1 | awk '{if($NF>=1){exit 1}else{exit 0}}' &&\nwget -P ~/Downloads http://katana.oooninja.com/bleachbit/sf/bleachbit_1.0_all_ubuntu1204.deb &&\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/bleachbit_1.0_all_ubuntu1204\n\nBut that comes at the expense of the poor elves.\n\nA: I put this short script together that seems to work for me! This also include a bit of my own brand of elvish humor. I am using this code in a larger script so I can copy and paste this conditional anywhere I need it.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check BleachBit Version and install if necessary\nif [ \"$(bleachbit --version | grep -c 'version 1.0')\" = \"0\" ];\n    then \n        wget -P ~/Downloads http://katana.oooninja.com/bleachbit/sf/bleachbit_1.0_all_ubuntu1204.deb\n        sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/bleachbit_1.0_all_ubuntu1204.deb\n        echo \"$(tput setaf 2)The elves have installed BleachBit 1.0.$(tput sgr0)\"\n    else\n        echo \"$(tput setaf 2)The elves have verified the BleachBit version.$(tput sgr0)\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: How to disable fast boot setting? I have an Acer aspire V3-571 running Windows 8.1. I want to give Ubuntu a go. I started looking at a few dual boot guides and tried disabling fast boot and switching to legacy BIOS.\nWhen looking for fastboot setting, I went into power options. Power options showed unavailable options and there were no signs of \"fast boot\" there. \nRegression\n\n\n*\n\n*When I changed from UEFI to legacy, it brought up an error to tell me it couldn't find even windows.\n\n\nHow to disable fast boot setting? How to boot into windows even when in legacy BIOS?\n\nA: There are two types of \"fast boot\" options:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows -- This option, generally called Fast Startup, Hybrid Boot, or Hybrid Shutdown, turns a shutdown operation into a suspend-to-disk operation. As such, it leaves filesystems in an inconsistent state, which means that they will be, at best, ignored by Linux or other OSes. At worst, they'll be mounted and damaged. This makes it imperative that this Windows feature be disabled in any dual-boot scenario. Note that one of the partitions that can be affected by this is the EFI System Partition (ESP), which holds boot loaders. Thus, you can encounter boot weirdness if you don't disable this feature. See here, among other places, for information on how to disable this feature.\n\n*In the firmware -- Many EFIs include a \"fast boot\" option. When enabled, this feature causes the firmware to take shortcuts in the system's early power-up steps. For instance, USB devices other than keyboards and mice may be left uninitialized. This feature is generally harmless from a Linux perspective, except that you may need to disable it to get a Linux installation medium recognized. On occasion, though, the initialization shortcuts may cause devices to malfunction in Linux. The naming of this feature varies greatly from one firmware to another, so it's impossible to tell you precisely where it is or what it's called. Some EFIs don't even have such a feature.\n\n\nIf Windows was installed in EFI/UEFI mode, it's impossible to boot it in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode -- at least, not without converting the partition table from GPT to MBR and installing a BIOS-mode boot loader. I don't know of any site that documents the precise procedure for doing this conversion. Personally, I wouldn't try without some very compelling reason. It's almost always better to install Linux in EFI/UEFI mode. See my Web page on this topic or the Ubuntu community wiki on the subject for more on how to install in EFI mode.\n", "Q: How can I delete a multi-line record from a text file?

For example, this perl command will remove Elvis's entry from the above file:\nperl -000 -ne 'print unless /Elvis/ && /Presley/' test.txt \n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The -0 sets the input record separator. Setting this to 00 (with -000) activates 'paragraph mode' where Perl will use consecutive newlines (\\n\\n) as the record separator. In other words, a \"line\" is now defined \n\n*The -n means \"read the input file line, by line and apply the script given with -e.\n\n*print unless /Elvis/ will print all lines that contain neither Elvis nor Presley. Since a \"line\" is now defined as a block of text separated by two newlines (\\n\\n) because of the -000, this will remove Elvis's entry from the file.\n\n*The i in the match operator (//i) makes the match case insensitive so that both Elvis and elvis will work. You can remove it if you don't want that.\n\n\nIntegrate into your script\nTo make this work with your script, we need another step. Perl has the special %ENV hash which holds the environmental variables currently defined. For example, $ENV{HOME} is your $HOME directory. To add a bash variable to this hash, you need to export it. So, what you can do is edit the b block of your script to export the variables and to use the perl script from above:\n\"b\"|\"B\")\nok=1\necho -e \"[Remove a contact]\"\necho -n \"First Name: \"\nread first\necho -n \"Last Name: \"\nread last\n\n## export the variables, to make them available to the `perl` script\nexport first\nexport last\n## remove the entry from the file and create a backup\nperl -000 -i.bak -ne 'print unless /$ENV{first}/i && /$ENV{last}/i' ./contacts_firstname\n\n\n\n*\n\n*$ENV{first} will be $first and $ENV{last} will be $last. \n\n*The -i.bak means \"edit the original file and create a backup copy called filename.bak\". In other words, the perl command will delete the entry from contacts_firstname and create a backup of the original file called contacts_firstname.bak. \n\n\nIf you don't want a backup file, just use this instead:\nperl -000 -i -ne 'print unless /$ENV{first}/i && /$ENV{last}/i' ./contacts_firstname\n\n", "Q: Accessing internet from Ubuntu 13.10 I recently downloaded Ubuntu 13.10.

You will have to re-enable the sources to download the software again. This can be done from \"software sources\"\nSome applications can be reinstalled through the Ubuntu Software Center, but I believe the ones you listed are all third party apps.

In this thread it is discussed how to log a scan by ClamAV. However, the suggestions are only for logging one-off scans triggered from command line.\nMy situation is that I'm working in a setting where we have to comply with certain rules set forth by credit card companies etc. where two of the requirements are that\n a) we need to have scheduled, automatic AV scanning enabled, and\n b) we need to keep log files for at least one year.\nI'm currently running ClamAV 0.97.8/18695 on Ubuntu 13.10 (upgraded all the way from 10.10) and the ClamTK GUI v5.05\nI've defined daily scan (as well as daily update of signatures/AV definitions), but I cannot find any logs (my first guess was under /var/log/ ). Also, I can't find any clamscan config file where to define such things as logging.\nDoes anyone have ideas on how to enable automatic logging, and is there a major difference in the installation/config depending on whether ClamAV was installed with or without the ClamTK option? (I installed from Synaptic by selecting ClamTK and allowing apt to resolve dependencies/include what was needed, then I manually upgraded the GUI later from http://code.google.com/p/clamtk/ ).\nAlso, if anybody can answer how the scheduled of ClamTK is working, I'd appreciate it very much (I do realise it's a separate question, really). Grep'ing in /etc/cron./ doesn't show any hits on 'clam', so I wonder if ClamTK is using its own, custom scheduler or what is going on under the bonnet.\n\nA: A couple of things:  \n1) ClamTk does not take any arguments like a commandline program would.  Anything added after \"clamtk\" is assumed to be a file or directory for scanning.\n2) ClamTk uses crontab for scheduling.  Open a terminal window and type \"crontab -l\", and you'll see what you have scheduled.  This should also appear in the GUI.\nHope this helps,\nDave M\n", "Q: Why not all Linux packages/software come in .deb format? A .deb package is very easy to install, just like .exe in Windows, simply double click and install via USC. I wonder why  some developers choose formats like .tar.gz (it scares the hell out of me) which is complicated to install.\nProbably not all Linux forks are compatible with .deb; is it so?\nWhy Linux community does not set some standard for package management so that each and every software can be in .deb format(I love this format because of its simpleness to install) and ultimately end users will be benefited.\n\nA: Actually there are alternatives to .deb packages\n.deb packages stands for debian packages. It was started by the Debian Linux Distribution\nAnother major player is rpm which stands for RedHat package manager\nLinux relies on open source. So most of zipped file like .tar.gz are source codes\nYou have to compile and run on any linux distribution like so:\ntar -xvf yourdownloadedpackagefilename.tar.gz\ncd yourdownloadedpackagefilename\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\nNote: you should carefully read the README file because not all source packages behave the same way!\nThis is not the case when dealing with package managers. They depend on the distro.\nHope that helps\nI found this quote very helpful defining the difference between package managers:\n\nBoth these groups are \"package managers\" which greatly simplify the\n  process of installing, updating, otherwise maintaining, and removing\n  software. The \"deb\" files are for use by the \"dpkg\" utility that\n  originated with the Debian distro (of which Ubuntu is a variant) and\n  the \"rpm\" files are for the RedHat Package Manager, a similar but very\n  different utility that originated with the Red Hat distribution.\nBefore package managers came into use, installing a new piece of\n  software was a complicated process that turned off many non-geeks. You\n  had to locate its source code, then compile and link that source into\n  an executable binary file. The first attempt to do so usually resulted\n  in a long string of error messages about missing library files -- for\n  which you had to search, install, and repeat the process.\nThe package manager utilities made it possible to list all these\n  \"dependencies\" within a single file that also included a description,\n  and the ready-to-run binary program file. The package manager takes\n  care of fetching all the needed dependencies, and also handles initial\n  configuration of the new software.\nWhile the two different types of manager do essentially the same job,\n  their files are not directly interchangeable. A utility does exist for\n  converting RPM files into the DEB format, but there's no guarantee\n  that a converted RPM file will automatically configure things properly\n  for the Debian standards of file location (which differ significantly,\n  in some respects, from those of Red Hat and its descendants).\nI hope this helps a bit; not all distributions use package managers,\n  so if you want to learn more about the \"old ways\" you can try things\n  like Slackware or GenToo! That may tell you more than you'll be\n  comfortable learning\n\n\nA: Really, because the question is wrong. \nIs like to ask \"why I can buy cakes and flour, eggs, sugar too? It's so easier to just eat the cake, why someone sells all that other things too?\"\n.deb are packages with (normally) compiled programs that someone compiled, installed, configured and adapted to a specific operating system. Someone took care of dependencies, side effects, etc. Note that .deb format is used by Ubuntu and several other distributions, like debian, Mint, etc... and even if you can install a debian .deb in Ubuntu and often it will work, is not guaranteed so. Other distributions have different packaging systems (rpm, pacman, even .tar.gz for slackware). \n.tar.gz is a compressed, archived set of files. Think .zip. It could be whatever. A software, a photo collection, source code, compiled code, even a package for a distro, you name it. \n\nA: As explained in the Debian FAQ:\n\nPackages generally contain all of the files necessary to implement a\n  set of related commands or features. There are two types of Debian\n  packages:\nBinary packages, which contain executables, configuration files,\n  man/info pages, copyright information, and other documentation. These\n  packages are distributed in a Debian-specific archive format they are usually\n  distinguished by having a '.deb' file extension. Binary packages can\n  be unpacked using the Debian utility dpkg and possibly via a frontend\n  like aptitude.\nSource packages, which consist of a .dsc file describing the source\n  package (including the names of the following files), a .orig.tar.gz\n  file that contains the original unmodified source in gzip-compressed\n  tar format and usually a .diff.gz file that contains the\n  Debian-specific changes to the original source. The utility\n  dpkg-source packs and unpacks Debian source archives. The program apt-get can get used a\n  frontend for dpkg-source.\n\n\nA: This is because the .tar.gz includes the source code, so that you can poke around, if you'd like. \nPlus, this also gives the developers a chance to give you a README\nDon't let them scare you - all you have to do is read the INSTALL file that typically comes bundled (or is otherwise in the README) -- \nusually, it's simply: \n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\nand voila ! \n\nA: This is because the Linux ecosystem contains many many different sub branches (click on the image for a larger version)1:\n\nNow, one of the basic differences between these distributions is the package manager they use. Debian and its derivatives (one of which is Ubuntu) use dpkg which deals with .deb packages. The other large player is the RedHat Package Manager (rpm) which works with .rpm packages. Other distributions have their own system or use a wrapper to install directly from source or even have no package manager at all.\nIn any case, the .tar.gz format is\n\n*\n\n*Not actually a format. That is what is known as a compressed tarball. tar creates archives (.tar) which are then passed through gzip to compress them (.gz). See here for more details.\n\n\n*Not an installer. It is just a collection of files/directories, in the case of source tarballs, the source code of a program.\n\n\n*Not in any way specific to source codes or programs. You can think of .tar.gz as an equivalent to Windows (and not only) .zip files. They can contain an installer or they can contain word documents or whatever else.\nThe reason why all Linux programs are not packaged as .deb files is because while .deb is indeed popular, it does not work for all distributions. Therefore, a developer can either attempt to package their app for as many distributions as they can or simply make the source code available and let users compile it themselves. Up until a few years ago, the vast majority of Linux programs were only distributed in this way. The variety of pre-packaged programs was quite small.\nThis has changed in recent years with the huge increase of popularity of the .deb format, which was largely due to the corresponding popularity of Ubuntu and Linux Mint.\nThe reason why not everyone uses .deb is that each approach (dpkg/apt-get, rpm/yum, pacman etc) has its diehard fans. And if I only release my program as a .deb not everyone will be able to use it. The only way to make sure that any GNU/Linux user will be able to use my software is to release it as source and let them compile it manually.\nAs a final note, you really shouldn't be scared of such programs. While it is true that sorting out the dependencies can be a pain, most devs will clearly state the dependencies on their webpage and as long as you have them installed, installing software from a source tarball is really quite easy:\n\n*\n\n*Extract the file\n tar xvzf software.tar.gz\n\n\n\n*Move into the newly created directory where the files were extracted\n cd software/\n\n\n\n*Configure\n ./configure\n\n\n\n*Compile\n make\n\n\n\n*Install\n sudo make install\n\nThis can all be condensed to:\ntar xvzf software.tgz; cd software; ./configure && make && make install\n\n1 Image taken from this Wikipedia page.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 and realtek rtl8723ae some networks work, some not I have Ubuntu 12.04 and MSI MS-16GC with Realtek 8723ae and here is my problem.

As soon as the Update Manager displayed the red icon (broken packages) I noticed that the Unity Dash was unable to show any applications. I shut down my PC for the night in that state. The following day I fixed all the i386 (Mulyi Arch) libraries. Then the Update Manager was working again, but the Unity Dash is still unable to show any application ...\nI tried to purge and re-install unity-lens-files and unity-lens-applications then restarting the PC. That didn't change anything to the Unity Dash behavior. It looks like there is somewhere a bug or some configuration on which it relies is corrupted. Everything else is working fine so far.\n\nA: Sorry for disturbing people here ... This low tech failure had me on my nerve.\nThe solution was to clear the software-center hidden folder ~/.cache and to reset unity. This is one of the solution proposed on Dash search gives no result. However in order to be able to restore the cache in case this does not work it is better not to remove it first but to rename it to -bak for exemple:\n$ mv ~/.cache/software-center{,-backup}\n$ unity --reset &\n\nOr <Alt> <F2> and type unity (to reset not using a terminal).\nAfter checking's it's working\n$ rm -r ~/.cache/software-center-backup/\n\n\nA: I am using Ubuntu 14.10. unity reset option is now deprecated. \nIf software-center cache data caused this issue, by taking a backup & removing the folder should allow unity to function as usual.\n$ mv ~/.cache/software-center{,-backup}\n\nthen after few seconds, try using the dash again. We should get back the applications listed.\nIf you are struggling to manually invoke any general apps., press Super + N to open folder and navigate to /usr/share/applications. Here you should find general applications listed. \nOnce the unity is back, analyse log files in ~/.cache/software-center-backup to understand what went wrong.\n", "Q: Migration from XP to Ubuntu I have an older Dell Inspiron. I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it.\nThe originally OS is Win XP and right now both OS are running on the PC alongside each other, with XP as the default system.\nWhat I would like to do is to have Ubuntu as the default OS and eventually get rid of XP.\nI anyone out there can help, it would be very much appreciated.\nThanks in advance ! \n\nA: The boot order and default is determined by GRUB, the boot loader. The default entry is determined by the GRUB_DEFAULT= setting in /etc/default/grub; the first \"menuentry\" has a value of \"0\". So, if Ubuntu is the second entry, just edit this file:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nand change it to:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=1\n\nYou can also change the GRUB_TIMEOUT to a lower value if you don't like to wait too long\n", "Q: How can I install GNOME 3.12 on saucy (13.10)?

I found that the easiest way to set this when you know you want this style is an abbreviated version of his answer:\n:setf apache\n\nYou may want to mark his answer as correct.\n\nA: The file ending .conf has no syntax set by default.  Different configuration files have different syntax, so vim cannot use the same syntax for all .conf files.  To handle this, vim looks at the whole file name and compares it to the patterns found in filetype.vim (located at /usr/share/vim/vim74/filetype.vim on my system)\nFor example, say you opened the file apache.conf, vim will look in filetype.vim until it finds something like:\n       au BufNewFile,BufRead apache.conf*,apache2.conf* setfiletype apache\n\nwhich tells vim to use the apache syntax highlighting file for any file that begins in apache.conf. Try creating a new file called apache.conf and you should get apache syntax highlighting for that file.\nAnother way vim can set the syntax for a file is with modelines. Modelines let you run vim commands for specific files. They can be found at the top or bottom of files and look something like this:\n# vim: syntax=apache\n\nFor more info on modelines checkout :help modeline in vim.\n\nA: Based on the comments, I think your question is \"If I save a file, will it later have highlighting on\".  Until you save the file, unless you've added a line at the beginning of the file (such as #!/bin/bash), it won't have any highlighting.  Highlighting is defined by the first line of the file, or by the file extension.\nIf there's special .conf highlighting, based on the filename pattern, it will show up when you next open the .conf file.\nAll .txt files are plain-text and don't have any syntax highlighting unless the file opens with #!/bin/bash or some other similar line.\n\nTL;DR; the syntax highlighting is not saved with the file.  It's determined internally with Vim, when the file is opened.  (Or, if it's a new file, at first save)\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1?

Well I am using that option and the drive is still mounted by the time I log into my account.\nHere are my fstab entries for the 2 partitions that are on the same external drive:\n#External 2TB drive\nUUID=8598c4fc-171a-4324-a4d3-06145d12ceba /media/Storage   ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       2\n#Windows compatability partition on external drive does not need to be mounted.\nUUID=751E843A54B3D902 /media/Windows\\040Compatability     ntfs    noauto     0        0\n\nI am at a total loss for why the noauto option is not working like I expect it to, but when I start up my pc the drive is available and mounted at the location specified (/media/Windows Compatability). I tried changing the options (like user/nouser) and those behaved as expected. Just the noauto is completely baffling me.\nThanks for any help.\nB.\nPS: If you are curious about the use case, there is a 2TB ext4 partition on the drive, and then a small ntfs partition on it. The point of the ntfs is to carry some windows tools for reading ext4 when I have to use my drive on a strange machine.\n\nA: Why don't you just comment the line in fstab to disable it on boot?\n#UUID=751E843A54B3D902 /media/Windows\\040Compatability     ntfs    noauto     0        0\n\nYou should still be able to mount he partition simply with nautilus whenever you need it.\n\nA: If the disk is mounted by udev, try to add a file 81-hide-my-disk.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d with the content:\nENV{ID_FS_UUID}==\"751E843A54B3D902\", ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}:=\"1\"\n\n(strange UUID, by the way). \nBy the way, i think you probably need to reload udev rules after the change:\nsudo udevadm control --reload-rules\n\nOriginal source is on Unix-Linux SE. \nI checked the language in the (current in 13.10) /lib/udev/rules.d/80-udisks.rules and it seems that it is still the same.\n", "Q: Can I run Ubuntu installed on a USB flashdrive from the flashdrive to safely use the internet on an NT desktop I have an NT desktop I want to continue to use but do not want to be exposed to security issues after April 8.

They said the motherboard was dead so they just gave it to me. They also said that it was a 40GB hard drive but after taking it apart, I found it was a 120GB hard drive and the motherboard battery needed to be replaced. When I got it running I found that there was an 80GB partition which was almost empty except for a few documents. When I tried to update it to Windows 7 There was not enough room on the hard drive as the operating system was using the smaller partition and all programs were on that partition.\nHow can I remove the partition and restore the 120GB hard drive?\nI had a terrible time getting Ubuntu installed as the BIOS would only show to boot from a network or the system files.\nIs there a way to remove this partition using Ubuntu?\n\nA: Okay, I have to justify the trust given. First of all, you should update your BIOS. Ubuntu is very dependent on this. I can show you the way how to overcome impossibility of booting from CD, but you may experience some problems after installation if you don't update your BIOS.\nNow, \nHow to boot from CD even if BIOS doesn't allow this\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install VirtualBox\n\n*Create virtual disk from physical drive\nRun as Administrator (probably you are already Admin):\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename C:\\path\\to\\file.vmdk -rawdisk \\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0\n\nRefer for instruction to link given above if you are running Ubuntu.\n\n*Create Virtual Machine\n\n\n*\n\n*run Oracle VM VirtualBox as Administrator\n\n*Select Machine → New or press Ctrl + N\n\n\n\n*Attach vmdk file:\n\n\n*Attach Ubuntu ISO file or use physical device\n\n\n*Set boot order as shown below\n\n\n*Click OK to save settings\n\n\n*Start Raw and press F12. Choose CD\n\n\n*At this point, follow this guide from the step 6. Don't touch existing partition, just install Ubuntu. After Installation you may simply reboot computer and boot into Ubuntu.\n\n*To remove Windows partition, use either Gparted or Disks utility.\n\n\nFeel free to ask if something goes wrong!\n\nA: Since you can't boot from a USB/CD-ROM, if you have another HDD that has Ubuntu on it, you can mount the HDD (I'm assuming it's either SATA or IDE ports on the motherboard) and boot off of it instead of the old HDD. Gparted is a tool than you use can partition the other drive for you.\nBasically, you can substitute a LiveCD with a HDD with ubuntu with it. This answer requires another HDD and cable, as well as an open port.   \nAlternatively;\nYou can just extend the partition inside of Windows XP to give that smaller partition more room. That way, the Windows 7 has room to install on.

Will switching to Ubuntu address these problems? Can i get a faster OS with Ubuntu?  \n\nA: No and Yes. If your PC overheats, the first thing you need do is to clean the Heat Sink.

However, it blocks certain file extensions like .iso, .exe or .msi (thankfully I don't need the last 2 mentioned ones).\nMy problem is, that the ubuntu downloads are no longer .zip and that prevents me from upgrading to 13.10. I don't trust any others pages so I think it might be a good idea to offer both, .iso AND .zip for all versions on ubuntu.com, or is it already?\nThanks for listening.\n\nA: If there were a totally official Ubuntu mirror that used HTTPS, that might be your best bet: unless you have configured your computer to recognize the proxy you're required to use as its own certificate authority (which would be insecure unless you totally trust the proxy and controversial anyway), the software that restricts what you may download cannot distinguish filenames by extension, through HTTPS.\nUnfortunately, the current official mirrors for Ubuntu ISOs are http, ftp, and rsync only.\nFortunately, HTTP mirrors occasionally support HTTPS as well. By going through the list, you'll often find a small number that do. In particular, you can download Ubuntu ISO images from https://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu-releases/.\n(The HTTP version of that site actually isn't listed--I got it by removing the \"us\" subdomain prefix from http://mirrors.us.kernel.org/ubuntu-releases/. The HTTPS version of that site should work too but you'll get scary warnings in your browser because its security certificate is for the unprefixed domain instead.)\nNote that, once Ubuntu is installed, you may have some trouble updating it and installing software in it, depending on what extensions you can download via HTTP. In particular, you must be able to download .deb files. Hopefully the block is limited to just a few extensions rather than blocking everything but just a few extensions.\nYou can also make Ubuntu use HTTPS download mirrors to update and install software, same as with HTTP. I don't know of any HTTPS sites mirroring Ubuntu's official software sources--those mirrors aren't, in general, all the same as the mirrors for ISO images--but if you need that, you could post a new question about it. (In your question you should explain why you need it, as otherwise it will likely be answered with an explanation of how APT operates securely even though archives are downloaded via HTTP.)\n\nA: I was looking for a HTTPS link but I couldn't find one. But I found something interesting, that you can use rsync to download ubuntu and according to wikipedia it uses port TCP 873 (MAC and Linux OS'ses most of the times rsync come preloaded, but for Windows you may need to download rsync).

But don't worry, as the open source community has its geniuses like Lorenzo Breda, who developed an unofficial Google Drive client for Linux, called Grive.\nAdding the PPA Repository\nThis is an easy step, which requires you to open a Terminal by searching it in the Unity Dash or by pressing the CTRL+ALT+T key combination, and to paste the following code in the Terminal window:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:thefanclub/grive-tools\n\nHit the Enter key, type your password when asked, and hit Enter again when asked if you want to add the repository.

I want to create directory /var/logs/my_package and to change it's owner to my_user.\nIn the docs there is information that I can create file debian/dir. But there is info that this is not the best way to do it. And there is no info how one should change there directory owner (I'm thinking about placing command chown my_user.my_user /var/logs/my_packageit in debian/postinst file).\nWhat is the recommended way to create directory with the deb package?\n\nA: You do not need to create a postinst script, but the solution is still a bit tricky. I use dh wildcard in debian/rules:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n%:\n        dh $@\n\nbinary:\n        dh $@\n\nwhich does all the needed stuff. But I need to override some dir's ownership (lets call it data). So I must make some exception, I use special directives as follow:\n    override_dh_install:\n        dh_install   #calls default *.install and *.dirs installation\n        install -d -o www-data -g www-data $(CURDIR)/debian/<package_name>/var/www/<something>/data \n\nThe data directory do not need to be in *.dirs file. But still there is one trick. Debhelper contains script dh_fixperms, which would fix ownership back to root, so we need to override too:\noverride_dh_fixperms:\n    dh_fixperms --exclude data\n\nThat's all. Keep in mind the data dir does not count as a conffile, so it will be removed on package removal. If you need to make it a conffile, it is another story.\n\nA: You were right, you need a debian/my_package.postinst file to perform such operation:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#DEBHELPER#\n\nset -e\n\nDIR=\"/var/log/my_package/\"\nUSER=\"my_user\"\n\nmkdir -p ${DIR}    \nif id -u ${USER} > /dev/null 2>&1; then    \n    chown ${USER}:${USER} ${DIR}\nfi\n\nNote: The script checks if the user exists before calling chown.\n\nA: I've read that if you have to use the debian/[<package>.]dirs file, that means your make install step did not do its job properly. That step should create that folder.\nHere are the issues I can see with this:\n\n*\n\n*make install can't install anything under a directory other than /usr (for a Debian package), so it's useless if you want a directory under /etc/..., /var/lib/<package>/..., etc.\n\n\n*If you use mkdir -p ... in your debian/[<package>.]postinst script, then you need to manually remove it with an rmdir ... in your debian/[<package>.].postrm script.\nSo the solution proposed by Marek Šimon is the same as mine, the only difference is that I use chown ... instead of install -d ... although with the install -d ... you can avoid the debian/[<package>.]dirs altogether. Personally, I like to see a list of the directories I create in a separate file. It looks much clearer.\nExample\nCreate the directories:\n# in debian/package.dirs\n/etc/package/magic/configuration\n/var/www/package/data\n\nChange the ownership:\n# in debian/rules\noverride_dh_fixperms:\n    dh_fixperms\n    chmod 700 debian/tmp/var/www/package/data\n    chown www-data:www-data debian/tmp/var/www/package/data\n\nWARNING: The debian/rules file uses tabs to indent the code under a target name. This is important.\nAs shown in the example, I also often change the permissions (chmod).\nThe debian/tmp/... introducer is required if you create two or more packages. I'm not too sure what it is if you are creating a single package (in  part because it's really rare for my projects to have a single package and also many paths change when you add a second package so instead I always include at least a package-doc.install even if mostly empty so that way it won't change on me).\nFinal Note\nIf you are creating a public Debian package which is to be accepted by Debian or Ubuntu, you probably want to follow Sylvain Pineau's solution. Keep in mind that on a purge you need to remove your directory (unless the user created its own files in it).\n", "Q: Encrypted Lock Screens? I really like the disk encryption to secure my funds, but my problem is I practically never have my computer off. I live a very busy life and shutting it down totally every night is entirely impractical, so at most I typically suspend/lock it. I have my suspicions that this lock screen does very little against an attacker that might have the computer in their hands. Am I right? Is having disk encryption pointless if I never turn off my computer? Is there any software that can enable lock-screen encryption?\n\nA: I thought the same thing, which is how I found your question.\nBut then I realized, programs cannot really keep running if all the data (including their own code) is suddenly encrypted. And data might be in RAM anyway if programs are running.\nSo the only way to encrypt things is if all programs stop running, which doesn't happen when locking.\n\nA: Full disk encryption is a great security measure, but it is seen as a ways of preventing physical access to the machine's data.  Before disk encryption, physical access to a HDD was all it took to gain access to data.  When you are able to take out the HDD, you can use any other system to look at the data, so you can't think of it as secure just because someone doesn't know your root password.\nIt is completely possible to have an encrypted system that has suspend-to-disk support.  This, in combination of ensuring that your RAM and any swap is kept secure, is an imperfect method to keep you safer in your situation.\nOnce you've helped to secure against physical threats, you have to then take a look at how the system itself is vulnerable.  By connecting your machine to the Internet, you are exposing it to potential problems.  If you're serious enough, you should consider using an encrypted, 'cold-storage' system, where you limit the connectivity, or only interact via thumb drive or serial port.\nOther options are to add additional layers of encryption to your data, and only keep that data unlocked while it's in use.  The point is to take advantage of keeping the data encrypted as long as possible, and only decrypt when needed, and not to suggest excessive use of multiple/cascade encryption.   This would mean that any adversary having access to the system would need to take time to decrypt the data.  Unless, of course, you leave the data unlocked, or leave they key somewhere accessible.  Additionally, there are many ways to hide data in data, and utilize one-time pads, to better secure information.\nEven by encrypting and not leaving the keys available for individual datasets, someone with enough time and access could eventually unlock the data.  For something such as passwords, this can be mitigated by changing the passwords frequently, and re-encrypting the dataset with a new key at that time.  For something that needs to be kept secret over a longer period of time, and you have a physically secure location, a simple solution may be to store encrypted data on a thumb drive that you only connected to the machine when needed, and then place the drive in a safe.\nCertificate Authorities who provide proper key storage provide good examples of how to secure data in situations that require a mixture of security and practicality of use.\n\nA: Let me answer the question first and then propose an option for encryption at the lock screen. \nYou are correct in saying that your data is not encrypted when the lock screen is visible. If you're using full-disk encryption (FDE), your data is decrypted at boot time before the login screen is shown and remains decrypted until the system is powered down. If you, like the OP, used home directory encryption, your data is decrypted when you log into your account and remains encrypted until you log out of your account which can happen during logoff or shutdown. The fact that your data is decrypted when you are logged in does not make encryption pointless. If someone gains physical access to your computer, the only way around your login screen is to enter your current password, or reboot the system and modify some files. If they reboot, your system (FDE) or user files (home directory encryption) will be in an encrypted state, offering you protection from disclosure. There is no backdoor that I am aware of that would allow someone sitting at your keyboard to bypass the lockscreen unless they already had some form of remote control.   \nNow, in the event that your system has been compromised and a backdoor has been created providing an attacker remote access, your system will be vulnerable any time your system or files are decrypted. No amount of encryption will help you in this case. Your only solutions to protect your files are to 1) take them and the system offline, and 2) remove the malware.\nA lock screen encryption option:\nIf you would like to be able to encrypt your files whenever you lock your screen, you are still not without options. You could create an encrypted file container, keep your sensitive files in that container. Then you can either manually lock the file container before locking your screen or write a simple script that would lock the file container and then lock the screen. In this way, your files could be encrypted even while your system is in a running state. All you would need to do is decrypt the file container when you want to use it.\nThis can all be accomplished with VeraCrypt, or if you, like I, would prefer to use LUKS...\n#-------------------- Setup --------------------#\ndd of=~/encrypted-fc count=0 seek=1 bs=1G       # bs should reflect maximum desired \n                                                #   container size. This command creates\n                                                #   a sparse file that will grow\nsudo cryptsetup luksFormat ~/encrypted-fc       # set up file container encryption\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen ~/encrypted-fc enc-fc  # decrypt the file container\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/enc-fc               # create a file system in the container\nsudo cryptsetup luksClose enc-fc                # lock (encrypt) the file container\n\n#--------------------- Usage ---------------------#\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen ~/encrypted-fc enc-fc    # decrypt the file container\nsudo mount /dev/mapper/enc-fc /your/mount/point   # mount decrypted container\n\nsudo umount /dev/mapper/enc-fc                    # umount decrypted container\nsudo cryptsetup luksClose enc-fc                  # lock (encrypt) the file container\n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure it is pointless to have disk encryption if you never turn the computer off. I could be wrong though.\nBut if you never turn it off, it will never boot to the screen that unencrypts your hard drive. So it is pretty much always unencrypted.\nDo you have a /home partition that is encrypted? If so, if someone were to steal it, they would not have access to all the files in your user account, so therefore, if it requires your user password, it would be safe.\nSo in short, if just your hard disk is encrypted, yes it is pointless. If you have a separate /home partition, you should be ok if that is encrypted because they cannot access those files.\n", "Q: Updating ubuntu 13.10 Problem on Dell E6410 When ever I try to update, I get this message:\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-GNOME 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131017)/dists/saucy/main/binary-amd64/Packages\nPlease use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-GNOME 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131017)/dists/saucy/multiverse/binary-amd64/Packages\nPlease use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-GNOME 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131017)/dists/saucy/restricted/binary-amd64/Packages\nPlease use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-GNOME 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131017)/dists/saucy/universe/binary-amd64/Packages\nPlease use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-GNOME 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131017)/dists/saucy/main/binary-i386/Packages\nPlease use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-GNOME 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131017)/dists/saucy/multiverse/binary-i386/Packages\nPlease use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-GNOME 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131017)/dists/saucy/restricted/binary-i386/Packages\nPlease use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-GNOME 13.10 _Saucy Salamander_ - Release amd64 (20131017)/dists/saucy/universe/binary-i386/Packages\nPlease use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/tualatrix/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/tualatrix/ppa/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\nE:Some index files failed to download.

The question is here. \nNow I managed to accomplish that by changing that debian/rules. And I managed to do bzr builddeb -- -us -uc in my local computer. I don't know exactly what packages to be included as build-depend in the clean machine.

This is the build log\n\nA: Based on your Qt 5.2 builds, you are installing the libraries to /opt/qt52. This isn't the standard place for libraries, and therefore the libraries are not found by shlibdeps (and also probably wouldn't run on a user's computer because there is no RPATH specified). Instead, you should install libraries to /usr/lib, which is the standard place in Precise.\nAlso, typically, library packages are split into three packages: a package that only contains the runtime library (what the user would need just to use the library in an application), a development package (what a developer would need, which includes the headers and the development library symlink), and a debug package. Your current structure has the runtime package and the development package combined, which means that users will have to install more stuff than necessary. You might want to look into splitting that package (see a sample debian directory that Debian uses for Qt 5.2.1; note that the -dev package files are specified in the qtbase5-dev.install-common file).\n\nA: After looking at the recent build failures that you got in your ppa you're depending on Qt5 packages that are not available for precise (such as libqt5widgets5).\nI'd suggest to add a new ppa dependency to your own ppa, the ubuntu-sdk-team stable ppa:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/+archive/ppa\nGo to this page to add it.\n", "Q: Can't start Byobu?

I am new in using UbuntuServer13.10 so during giving permission to a folder to open it on FileZilla on other PC, I got these words and now I want to know about the difference between; \"root\", \"user\", \"group\", \"guest\" and their security levels. So can anyone explain to me briefly about their function and usage. Just the basics, or provide a link to an external article on them.\n\nA: root: is a special account which is usually locked in Ubuntu. This account is in effect the ultimate super user and can change anything on the system.  If you want to enable this account you can but its not recommended see How to enable root login? For how this can be done and a discussion on why its not recommended.\nuser: These are the users of your systems there are three types administrators, normal users and guest. Administrators can make major changes to the system while normal users can not. There is a useful summary in the RootSudo Comunity Documentation.  The guest account is used to provide casual access to someone (to play a game, surf the web, etc.) without giving them access to other users files. Any files they create are automatically removed when they log out.\ngroups A user can be a member of one or more groups groups are used to control privileges within the system for example all administrators are in the sudo group but you can also create you own groups.  You may for example have a sales team who need to share some files but you want to prevent other people from accessing these files.  By creating a special group for these people you can do that. See:How can I share a directory with an another user? for how you can set this up.\n\nA: Ok here goes my best shot at explaining this.First of all  root is like what the System user name would be. It has the highest level of permissions available. Some apps require you to run them as root in order to unlock their full potential (i.e. to carry out tasks regularly unavailable to just an administrator/user)\nSecondly, user is kind of a generic term for your login or the login of another on the system (i.e. Joey, or Alice) Users are part of groups, There are different levels of groups such as Administrator, or User. Administrator is second to root, and User would follow Administrator. So inyour case file access permissions can be set to only allow one \"User\", or an entire \"Group\" of users. Some items are only accessable by root, which usally means that it is some system file or folder that you should consider avoiding messing with. To access these particular files and folders you can get there several different ways. Including by typing from the Terminal \n sudo nautilus This will start Nautilus with root permissions...

You partition it that way when you'll have a few system files and applications accessible to all users on one small partition (/) and per-user data on the other very large partition (/home). In other words, it's for standard desktop use.\nYou have a MySQL server that stores huge database files, which don't fit anywhere in that scheme. In other words, you have a server that's not run by a particular real user, not purely a standard desktop.\nYou should probably repartition, either to merge the / and /home partitions (the best option to avoid this sort of thing) or to increase the proportion allocated to the / partition.\n\nWith that out of the way, use BleachBit.\nUse BleachBit from the Universe repository:\nTurn off MySQL\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the following:\nsudo service mysql stop\n\nFree up some space by removing unneeded and still-packed software and by removing archived log files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal and run the following:\nsudo -i\napt-get autoremove --purge\napt-get autoclean\napt-get clean\nrm -rf /var/cache/apt/archives/*\nfind /var/log -name '*.gz' -delete\n\nTurn on the Universe repository through Synaptic Package Manager\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Synaptic Package Manager.\n\n*Settings menu > Repositories.\n\n*Make sure Community-maintained free and open-source software (universe) is checked.\n\n*Click Close.\n\n*Exit Synaptic Package Manager.\n\n\nFix things because you're using an unsupported release (12.10)\n\n\n*\n\n*Only follow this section if you're using a release that's so old that it's no longer supported.\n\n*Open up a terminal and run the following:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\n*Replace everything that has the pattern http://whatever/ubuntu with http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu.\n\n*Press Ctrl+O, Ctrl+X to save and exit.\n\n\nInstall BleachBit\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal and run the following:\nsudo -i\napt-get update\napt-get install bleachbit\n\nRun BleachBit as root\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the applications menu (press Alt+F1).\n\n*System Tools menu > BleachBit (as root).\n\n*Clean a bunch of stuff.\n\n\nTurn on MySQL\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal and run the following:\nsudo service mysql start\n\n\nA: Looks like your root filesystem is full (a bit hard to read the output of df - try use df -BM for the disk usage in megabytes rather than bytes). The root filesystem is mounted on /dev/sda1 which refers to a physical device - in this case a hard disk.

I noticed that my battery capacity reduced to 85.2%. Is there a solution for this?\nThanks, Leo.\n\nA: Since when?\nIf this is something that has always been the case in Ubuntu it could be that your have a wear-limiting feature enabled in your BIOS. Our Samsung laptop does this and we only get 80% of battery (but it has lasted 3 years without much drop in overall performance).\nIf the capacity is slowly dropping off, it could be that it's just losing capacity. This still happens with batteries; they have a lifespan where they slowly become less effective at holding charge.\nAnd then there's the possibility it's a bug in the software that's reading the max charge and current charge. You can look at the rawer numbers with:\nless /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state\n\nIf they don't correlate with what you know about the battery (it should have its capacity printed on the battery - you might have to take it out to see it), that might be your problem.\n", "Q: How do I resolve webpage encoding issues when using a proxy?

Hopefully something will change in either Ubuntu or VMWare Player soon to make it easier than this.\n\nA: To get extra mouse buttons to work under VMware, edit configfile.vmx (append following lines):\nmouse.vusb.enable = \"TRUE\"\nmouse.vusb.useBasicMouse = \"FALSE\"\n\nThe above settings will enable a virtual vmware mouse with 20 buttons. However, in certain situations vmware is not mapping the mouse event arriving at the host to the correct guest event.\nExactly why it fails to send the correct mouse event is a good question that is not covered.\nStart and run the following in the guest os. Run xev | grep -i \"button\" in a terminal. Move to the spawned window, click the buttons you wanna assign or swap once. xev outputs the registered mouse event, in many cases the extra mouse buttons that should be eg. mouse button 8 or 9 is received as mouse button event 16 or 17.\nThe reassigning of mouse button events can be done with eg. xinput, the following makes deviceID 8 having mouse button 16 acting as mouse 8, and mouse 17 as mouse 9. \nxinput set-button-map 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 8 9\n\n\nA: You can't emulate more than 3 buttons in VirtualBox and VMware. This is because it presents to the guest system an (super) standard 3-button mouse. It could be possible if they like, but right now the answer is no.\n\nSo, why it works in Windows? Because the Linux and Windows implementations follow different roadmap, and \"each front-end has its own way of getting at mouse input\" (source). This can be seen in another question of Super User\n\nA: I tried all this, the fix was simple on my Dell XPS 13, Windows 10, VMware Player 12, guest Ubuntu 14.04\nLaunch control panel, change mouse settings, mouse & keyboard center, Microsoft mouse settings, wheel button. Set to middle mouse click instead of the default instant viewer.\nThis allows middle mouse click copy and paste in Ubuntu.. \nJames\n\nA: Tested this on Windows 10 host (should be the same on ubuntu), VMware workstation player 12, with a logitech m510 mouse.\nIf you do this, your mouse will only work on the virtual machine, so you'll need to know the keyboard shortcuts to enable and disable, unless you have two mouses, or a touchpad and a mouse, like in a notebook.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your virtual machine folder and locate the .vmx file.  \n\n*Edit it in notepad and add:  \nusb.generic.allowHID = \"TRUE\"\nusb.generic.allowHID = \"TRUE\"\nusb.generic.allowLastHID = \"TRUE\"\n\n\n*Open the virtual machine and navigate to Virtual Machine > Removable Devices > [Your Mouse] > Connect (Disconnect from Host). When you do it, the mouse will only work on the virtual machine. \n\n*Install logitech mouse driver/software on the virtual machine (you can do this step before everything if you want)  \n\n*You may press Ctrl+G on your keyboard to get rid of the host mouse icon and fully immerse yourself in the VM. \n\n*When you want to use the mouse on the host machine again, hit Ctrl+Alt, then release, so that the focus be on the vmware player, not the virtual machine. Now you can use the regular windows keyboard shortcuts. In this case press Alt+P to open the vmware workstation player menu, and use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate to Virtual Machine > Removable Devices > [Your Mouse] > Disconnect (Connect to Host). \n\n", "Q: Iptables and bind9 to forward to google's dns Hello i have a very hard time on getting along with iptables and bind9 as my internal network dns server.\nIt's configured to forward my queries to google's dns (8.8.8.8).\nThe main problem is i can't configure iptables to allow to speak with my dns.\nMy main rule is to drop all INPUT and OUTPUT connections and allow only those i require for some services and bind9.\nHere is my iptables now\nChain INPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:1155\nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            \nACCEPT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere             udp spt:domain\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            \n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp spt:1155 state RELATED,ESTABLISHED\nACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            \nACCEPT     udp  --  anywhere             anywhere             udp dpt:domain\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            \n\nI have tried to use what this user says but with no luck.\nAlso i have tried many combinations allowing port 53 for udp and tcp like this\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -m state --state NEW -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n\nAlso here is what i get from \nsudo netstat -anp | grep -e tcp -e udp\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1155            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      969/sshd        \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1179/apache2    \ntcp        0      0 192.168.0.22:53         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1087/named      \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1087/named      \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:953           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1087/named      \ntcp        0      0 192.168.0.22:1155       192.168.0.20:50016      ESTABLISHED 1263/sshd: giorgos \ntcp6       0      0 :::1155                 :::*                    LISTEN      969/sshd        \ntcp6       0      0 :::53                   :::*                    LISTEN      1087/named      \ntcp6       0      0 ::1:953                 :::*                    LISTEN      1087/named      \nudp        0      0 192.168.0.22:53         0.0.0.0:*                           1087/named      \nudp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53            0.0.0.0:*                           1087/named      \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:68              0.0.0.0:*                           943/dhclient3   \nudp6       0      0 :::53                   :::*                                1087/named  \n\n\nA: Ok, iptables rule for this can be something like this\nthis will accept dns req\nsudo iptables -t nat -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -t nat -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -m state --state NEW -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\n\nThis will create chain to catch dns req\nsudo iptables -t nat -N CATCH_DNS\nsudo iptables -t nat -A CATCH_DNS -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53\nsudo iptables -t nat -A CATCH_DNS -p tcp -m tcp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 53\n\nThen you can apply rule on INPUT \nsudo iptables -t nat -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j CATCH_DNS\n\nI think this will work :)\n", "Q: How to install Trust SC-5500p USB 5.1 external sound card? (I use Ubuntu 14.04 64bit and the sound card is not broken as it works fine on Windows)\nAccording to most of the reports online installing SC-5500p on Ubuntu seemed to be a cinch for most of the time.

Consider the following:\n$ echo -e \"v0.1.5\\nv0.1.6-2-p343h3d3\" | sort -V\nv0.1.5\nv0.1.6-2-p343h3d3\n\noli@bert:~$ echo -e \"v0.1.5\\nv0.1.4-2-p343h3d3\" | sort -V\nv0.1.4-2-p343h3d3\nv0.1.5\n\nThis basically means we can sort the versions so the latest is on the last line. All we have to do then is a string comparison against the last line, inside an if, or a shortcutted-if:\n[[ $(echo -e \"v0.1.5\\nv0.1.4-2-p343h3d3\" | sort -V | tail -1) != \"v0.1.5\" ]] && echo NEWER\n\nPlay around with the v0.1.4-2-p343h3d3 string. If you stick it up to 0.1.6 it'll echo out.\nNow to bring this all back around to your command:\n[[ $(echo -e \"v0.1.5\\n$(${HOME}/temp/.git describe --always --tags HEAD)\" | sort -V | tail -1) != \"v0.1.5\" ]] && echo NEWER\n\nOr you could break it down for readability:\nTHRESHOLD=\"v0.1.5\"\nVERSION=$(${HOME}/temp/.git describe --always --tags HEAD)\nif [[ $(echo -e \"$THRESHOLD\\n$VERSION\" | sort -V | tail -1) != \"$THRESHOLD\"  ]]; then\n    echo GREATER\nfi\n\n\nA: You could do something like\n${HOME}/temp/.git describe --always --tags HEAD  | awk ' {\n                             match ($0, /[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+/,m)\n                             if(m[0]>\"0.1.5\"){ \n                                 print(\"hello\")\n                              }\n                             }'\n\nThis will check the first matching regex result.

Anyway, I always found myself in the situation of having nothing else to do but re-install it because of these strange, unexpected and hard to understand errors. It happens almost each 2 or 3 weeks, just after I have installed a little more software than the default. I am quite disappointed and thinking about going back to some more stable system but I will try my last chance with the community, which I see is one of the most active and maybe it´s the pro that will keep me here. Also, this is my first question here so forgive my lack of experience.\nSo, I have a laptop (HP Pavilion g6 2305 sq, with AMD Radeon HD 7670M) and I have installed Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS (amd64). I installed the proprietary drivers recommended by the system (fglrx, I think is how they are code-named). Everything was fine until yesterday, when I compiled and installed various libraries that I need to develop some applications (Ogre3D, OIS, Boost, ODE, Freetype and much more). I don´t see how this would affect the boot-ing or the kernel because they are just headers, libraries and source code to use when developing applications. But is after this when it happened. This  issues usually happen after playing a little bit with the 3D graphics. At some point I realized that the icons of the running applications were not shown on the lateral bar and when I exited the system it forcefully closed some applications.\nToday when I start the computer it shows me the GRUB loader, I select Ubuntu, with Linux 3.11.0-18-generic and press ENTER. The loading screen is doing its job for a few seconds then a black screen is where everything hangs. I restart (CTRL+ALT+DEL) and choose recovery mode. If I choose to clean, dpkg, failsafex, everything will hang with this line of text:\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\n/dev/sda1: clean, 694243/60530688 files, 20142664/242119168 blocks\n\nI click CTRL+C and now it fails (of course) with this line:\ninitctl: Event failed\n\nCTRL+ALT+DEL will reboot the system. Now, I tried this solution: Is recovery mode supposed to hang after fsck?\nfor the fsck problem (the hanging) but I am just left in the sda1 partition (where I don´t know what I am supposed to do). I purged some nvidia packages (only for development) and with sudo apt-get autoremove I removed unecessary packages. I reboot and the same issue: black screen just before entering the login screen.\nI inserted the Live CD and I opened some log files but they don´t tell me much either. In syslog is where I found the most recent logs: http://pastebin.com/tCF0c4pY\nIf while seeing the loading screen I press ESC to get in CLI mode the same happens. I see some text on the screen then at some point everything goes to black. Some weeks ago, when the problem was related to gflrx I could enter CLI mode from the loading screen. In other words, I don´t have access to the system as root, so I can reset things. Also, I am using a broad-band connection, which doesn´t connect automatically if the X System is not loaded and the GUI is working. \nSo, here I am, out of any idea or possibility. If you need any other log file or info just let me know. I hope this can be fixed. Thanks so much\n\nA: Maybe your X windows config or other graphic config has been changed by the install of libraries that has been done. Good news is IF this is the problem then solution would be making a change in config file.

Now I'm afraid I won't be able to make the resize operation... I don't adventure into any other possibilities, since I'm afraid to screw up my boot. What am I missing? Is there any other alternative I can use?\n\n\nA: If you need to resize a partition, on which you already installed Ubuntu, the best way is to do it from right to left, so the data will not have to be moved.\nThe whole procedure should take a minute or two.\n\n\n*\n\n*first choose to resize:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*then drag the partition's right side to the left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*and then creat a new partition in the unallocated space\n\n\n\nI am not sure what went wrong in your case, but this way, it should work, I just tried to resize on my laptop. If it does not solve your problem, I will remove the answer.\n", "Q: Shell Scripting editor in Ubuntu 13.10 I want to do some Shell Scripting on my Ubuntu 13.10 (32-bit) desktop. How can I create Shell Scripts using the editor. Since I am not familiar with the Ubuntu editor Gedit. Is it possible to do it with Vim. If yes, then which package would be suitable for me. \n\nA: To install vim, do sudo apt-get install vim.\nYou don't need any other package if you want to write shell scripts. You can use vi <filename> to write the scripts and bash <filename> to execute the scripts using bash shell, sh <filename> to execute using sh shell, dash <filename> using dash.\nIf you need other shells like zsh, fish, etc., you'll need to install them using sudo apt-get install zsh or whatever package-name.\n", "Q: 13.10—shutdown impossible I have a freshly installed Ubuntu on a new Desktop.

Second go to Power Manager in Ubuntu and change settings for what 'power button' should do to 'shutdown', and see if there are other suspicious settings that may force your system to keep rebooting.\nOnce you're done you can install this program in a terminal:\n sudo apt-get install qshutdown\n\nTest it after install, and see if Qshutdown will be able to poweroff your computer.\n", "Q: IP address changes in vmware? I am using Ubuntu 13.10 in vmware on my Windows PC. So the problem is: when I see my IP using     ifconfig command then it shows 198.168.33.180, but when I see my IP on whatismyip.com (on Ubuntu), it shows my IP 37.x.x.x. Is there any way to resolve this? I don't want this IP address 198.168.33.180 to be shown using     ifconfig command for some reasons. Please help. Thanks in advanced.\n\nA: 198.168.33.180 is your IP address on the local network. whatismyip is telling you the address that is facing the outside network (the internet). Moreover, since you are in a VM, depending on your settings this IP(198.168.33.180) is in a specific range that is only seen locally by the host machine then is translated by the host using NAT. Then your router translates this address to your outward facing address that whatismyip is telling you. \nSo there's not really anything to resolve. Its just how networking works.\nIf you want the VM to be available on the local network you should use a bridged connection. Vmware has alot of documentation on this, and varies depending on the exact vmware solution your using, so I'll let you do the research but its pretty straightfoward. \nBasically:\nEdit the machine settings. Go to the network card and choose Bridged.\nTo test if you are set up correctly run ipconfig on the host and ifconfig on the VM.\nThe gateways should match.\n", "Q: Why is my inet for ip colored red? I'm trying to set up a web server but when I try to see the ip of the server with this code ifconfig | grep inet the four inet that comes up is colored red and shows some numbers. If I continue another message comes up and tells me that there is nothing wrong with my ip.\nWhat is wrong and what can I do?\n\nA: Red is the default color for matches when using grep with the  --color=auto option (which is set by your default ~/.bashrc file). \nIt has no significance beyond indicating that grep found the text that you asked it to search for.\n", "Q: If I turn on the UEFI, will my BIOS mode installed operating systems be damaged in any way? I have triple boot system. One of them is ubuntu. All of them are installed in legacy BIOS mode. Whenever I boot to Ubuntu, it shows kvm disabled by BIOS. My PC supports UEFI BIOS hardware which is turned off.\nIf I turn on the UEFI firmware (disabling BIOS), will my operating systems be damaged in any way or will it be beneficial? \n\nA: It won't be a problem if you turn on the UEFI BIOS. If you decide to switch back to the legacy BIOS, just follow this guide.\n\nA: \nIf I turn on the UEFI firmware (disabling BIOS), will my operating systems be damaged in any way or will it be beneficial?\n\nIt won't harm them, but it won't benefit them either.\nOperating systems that were installed in BIOS mode will just continue to boot in legacy BIOS mode even under a UEFI firmware, and behave as they did before.  They won't magically be converted to UEFI boot mode, so you won't get the fast boot benefits you would have had you configured your disk - and the OS - for UEFI boot from the start.\nAll your hardware being equal, the benefit of true UEFI boot over legacy BIOS mode on a UEFI firmware will simply be a few seconds faster boot time, and maybe a prettier boot screen - that's it.  Converting an existing OS from legacy BIOS boot to UEFI boot without a full reinstall is a difficult and potentially dangerous process, as it is likely to require re-partitioning and may even require operating system reinstalls - so it's not really worth doing for the negligible benefit.  It'll continue to run quite happily in legacy BIOS mode on your UEFI system.\n", "Q: Extremely slow internet over ethernet cable and no WiFi at all on HPG5000 I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on an old HP G5000\nThere is no WiFi and the  internet connection is extremely slow over the ethernet cable, seems no more that few Kb/s, e.g. the browser is able to download the page title, but nothing else.

Please try again.  \nSo I looked over the terminal output for that command and it turns out that the command was uninstalling grub*-common but was also installing grub-common:i386, which was then detected by boot-repair. So I uninstalled grub-common:i386, which then reinstalled grub-common, grub-pc etc. Rather annoying that apt-get is this stubborn when it comes to grub imo.\nSo in order completely uninstall grub I had to modify the command to sudo chroot \"/mnt/boot-sav/sda7\" apt-get purge -y --force-yes grub*shim-signed linux-signed* grub-common:i386 and once finished I was able to proceed with the boot repair.\n\nA: When trying to update 16.4 grub while using 21.04 I got this error.

There in I chose /dev/sda and installed grub. Then was able to remove the usb drive (live cd) and reboot to see grub smiling back at me.\nAll this because I installed windows after installing ubuntu.

You never know. \nIf your router supports VPN (OpenVPN) you could invest in a VPN account. There are free accounts but they're usually slow.\nAnswer from Martin Ravensholt on G+, not myself.\n\nA: Tor is slow, and maybe uneccessary. There are pretty cheap virtual or even dedicated servers for ~ 5€/month,so maybe you could simply tunel traffic through OpenSSH to /from such server. Check for example kimsufi /OVH for cheap dedicated servers, and/or DigitalOcean for virtual servers on SSD storage. \n\nA: There is firmware for your router available that has a Tor enabled option to route all your computers through Tor. Tomato firmware has Tor, however, only traffic on destination port 80 is routed through Tor so it probably won't work for social network sites that use https. DDWRT is probably best for a beginner because the wiki instructions are easy to follow and there's a larger community on the internet. It is possible to brick your router so FOLLOW ALL of the wiki INSTRUCTIONS step by step! It's not complicated, but you should gather all the information for your specific make and model first before starting to prevent problems.  Aftermarket router firmware will also increase router performance, range, speed, etc, considerably. You can check to see of you router is supported here http://www.ddwrt.com. You will have to do more searching to find out what firmware has the Tor enabled option. After getting familiar with how to flash your firmware using DDWRT you might want to check out firmware from somewhere else. \n", "Q: When using Bumblebee, how do I query the current state of the nvidia card?

If found, it inserts a newline between them.\nIn more detail, sed commands of the form s/old/new/ look for old and replace it with new.  In our case, old consists of two characters: ([0-9]) matches any number and, because it is enclosed in parens, it saves the value.  ([^0-9]) matches anything other than a number and saves it also.  Those two characters, if found, are replaced with \\1\\n\\2 which means the first match (the number), a newline, and the second match (not-a-number).\nMORE: If we want to break at the beginnings of numbers as well as at the end, then we add one more substitution command:\n$ echo xyz541wpk | sed -r 's/([0-9])([^0-9])/\\1\\n\\2/g; s/([^0-9])([0-9])/\\1\\n\\2/g'\nxyz\n541\nwpk\n\nThe second substitution command is just like the first but it looks for the reverse pattern: not-a-number followed by a number.\n\nA: Here are two more choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*grep\ngrep -oP '\\d+|.*' file\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*-P : activates Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, which lets us use \\d for digits. The | symbol, logical OR, means that grep will first try to match one or more (+) digits, and then everything else (.*).\n\n*-o : This causes grep to only print the matching part of the input line. A side effect is that if a line has multiple matches, it will print each of them on a new line, so it will produce the desired output.\n\n\n*Perl\nperl -lne 's/(\\d+)(\\D+)/$1\\n$2/; print;' file\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The -n means, read the file line by line and apply the script given by -e to each line. -l i) removes newlines (\\n) from the end of the line and ii) adds a \\n to each print.\n\n*s/pattern/replacement/ : replaces pattern with replacement. \n\n*(\\d+)(\\D+) : Match one or more digits (\\d) followed by one or more non-digits (\\D). The parentheses () means that the matches are captured so we can then refer to them as $1 and $2.\n\n*Taken together, the substitution will simply insert a newline between a string of digits, and the following non-digits.

I've even trying for weeks to install Ubuntu over the the network.

It contains folders, exactly as it is on your system and \"projects\" the contents of a .deb file on to your system. \nThere are general rules of where to install what, for example: binary files in /usr/bin/ , libraries in /usr/bin or /usr/share, desktop file in /usr/share/applications and so on (see also here). If you are interested, you should look into a .deb installer to see what it installs where.\n\nA: Not all packages install exactly the same way, but some generalizations can be made and are usually adhered to.\nBinary files that are called when you run the program are stored in /usr/bin or /bin.\nYou can check this by running <package> and /usr/bin/<package> with the same results.\nConfiguration files for the package are usually stored in /etc/<package>.\nHere is a good breakdown of the filesystem\n\nA: The really short answer is \"It varies by package\".\nHere's the longer version:\nThese are the directories where most user programs are installed:\n/usr/bin\n/usr/local/bin\n/opt\n\nIn general, if you've installed a package with sudo apt-get install <package>, the executable will usually be placed in one of those three directories.  When I say \"executable\", I mean the file that is usually the name of the program that you \"execute\" from the command line.  \nExample:  \n`echo \"foo\"`\n\nIn the above example, there is a file named \"echo\" residing on your system that executes the program \"echo\".\nIf I understand your question correctly, you'd also like to know where the downloaded package archive is stored.

It uses Bluetooth to connect to my laptop and all regular mouse buttons work perfect under both Linux and Windows 7. What's different about this mouse, though, is that it has a special Windows/Super key on the side that launches the start/menu when pressed. It also has a touch sensor that detects when the side button is stroked up or down and vibrates the mouse to acknowledge it's been activated. \nOf course in Windows there is a program that lets me change what the strokes do and turn off the vibration. \nIn Linux, xev detects only a normal keystroke when the side button is pressed or swiped. Xev doesn't report any mouse button presses. \nSo my question is, can I change what key presses are sent when under Linux? \nI would love to change the key binding from tab to down, backspace to up, (what xev reports) to ctrl+alt+left/right to switch between workspaces. \nThanks for any help!\n\nA: I just bought one myself and found that the following workes perfectly for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open dconf-editor (sudo apt-get install dconf-editor if it isn't already installed).\n\n*Navigate to org -> gnome -> desktop -> wm -> keybindings.\n\n*Change the value of switch-to-workspace-down to\n['<Control><Alt>Down', '<Primary><Super>Tab', '<Control><Super>Tab']\nand the value of switch-to-workspace-up to\n['<Control><Alt>Up', '<Primary><Super>BackSpace', '<Control><Super>Backspace']\n\nA: So since the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse isn't registering mouse button presses for the super and swipe gestures, but instead is registering keyboard key presses, I used the 'xautomation' and 'xbindkeys' packages to listen for those key presses and send Ctrl+Alt+Right/Left to switch between workspaces. It's not an ideal solution, but it works like 8 out of 10 times. \n#Move to left workspace\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'keydown Alt_L' 'usleep 100' 'key Left' 'keyup Control_L' 'keyup Alt_L' 'keyup Left'\"\n   m:0x4+mod4+m:0x0+c:23\n   #Control_L+Super_L+Tab\n\n#Move to right workspace\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'keydown Alt_L' 'usleep 100' 'key Right' 'keyup Control_L' 'keyup Alt_L' 'keyup Right'\"\n   m:0x4+mod4+m:0x0+c:22\n   #Control_L+Super_L+Backspace\n\nWhat this xbindkeys script does is it listens for the keypresses that the mouses swipe up and swipe down gestures send to the computer. If detected, xautomation sends the standard move desktop keystroke, control+alt+left/right.\nThe swipe up gesture on the mouse sends the keystroke of left control+left super+backspace. The swipe down gesture on the mouse sends the keystroke left control+left super+tab. m:0x4+mod4+m:0x0+c22 is the actual key code combination that gets detected by xbindkeys.\nI'll mess with it a bit more to see if I can improve the efficiency, but for now this gets the job done. I just hope the tab and backspace that the mouse outputs don't screw with any work that I'm doing.\n\nA: I wanted to map the same buttons to navigate through tabs in Firefox in both directions. I'm using xbindkeys and xmacro. It's working pretty well!\n.xbindkeysrc\n\n#Thumb down\n\"echo 'KeyStrPress Control_L KeyStrPress Tab KeyStrRelease Control_L KeyStrRelease Tab'|xmacroplay :0\"\n   Control+Mod4+Tab\n\n#Thumb up\n\"echo 'KeyStrPress Control_L KeyStrPress Shift_L KeyStrPress ISO_Left_Tab KeyStrRelease Control_L KeyStrRelease Shift_L KeyStrRelease ISO_Left_Tab' |xmacroplay :0\"\n   Control+Mod4+BackSpace\n\n", "Q: do i need to make a bootable cd I have windows 8, I already choose the option of try and install, and after the computer restarts it doesn't start. I have it mounted on a virtual drive.\nDo I need to make a bootable cd if I want to install it?\n\nA: Depending on the version of Ubuntu you will need a bootable CD or DVD. Ubuntu 12.04 LTS may fit in a CD, but Ubuntu 13.10 and soon to be released Ubuntu 14.04 LTS won't. You will need a bootable DVD for recent versions of Ubuntu.\nAlternately you will need a bootable USB drive of 1GB or more. \nUbuntu won't install from a virtual drive as you can't boot your computer from it. \nInstalling Ubuntu on a computer that came pre-installed with Windows 8 can be complicated.

The thing is, it worked when I was using Windows 7 with bugged Optimus, always choosing Intel integrated card, so I know it works on it. My question is: is there a config file somewhere that I can use to make Bumblebee NOT activate Nvidia for a specific program? I'm pretty sure that would fix my problem.\n(also if you ever consider buying anything Nvidia related for the love of God, DON'T DO IT)\n\nA: Nvidia support for Linux is actually terrible, my first laptop with Nvidia optimus made me lose 1 week to properly install the first version of bumblebee.\nBumblebee only runs a program if you ask it to, with the optirun or primusrun. \nYou can uninstall bumblebee and install it easily again, but I don't think there is a way to disable it since you need to call it to use.

For various reasons I can no longer access my graphical desktop, and can only login via a tty (Ctrl+Alt+F1 through F6 by default).\nTo help diagnose and solve my problem I need to look through the logs and maybe put some of the info into my question or forum thread.\nHow can I get this information?  \n\nA: First here is a list of some of the common log files and what they contain:  \n\n\n*\n\n*/var/log/messages : General message and system related stuff\n\n*/var/log/auth.log : Authenication logs.  \n\n*/var/log/kern.log : Kernel logs.  \n\n*/var/log/cron.log : Cron daemon logs.\n\n*/var/log/Xorg.0.log : Log for the X server.  \n\n*~/.xsession-errors : Logs related to the last X session (and the one before that, in xsession-errors.old)\n\n\nAfter you've logged into the tty it's a good idea to move to the folder where the logs are located (usually /var/log). For this we use the cd command:  \ncd /var/log  \n\nNow that we're in the folder where the logs are stored we use the ls command to see what logs exist:  \nls -a\n\nThere will probably be quite a few, these instructions should apply to all of them.  \nOnce you find a log you want to view, you can use the less command:  \nless kern.log  \n\nUse the up/down arrow keys to browse through the file. When you're done, press Q to quit less. If you want to search the logs for a certain keyword you can use grep:  \nsudo grep \"apparmor\" kern.log \n\nGrep also accepts regular expressions. See man grep for more information.  \nIf you just need the output of a certain command see this question about saving terminal output to a file which you can then give to someone assisting you following one of the methods below.\n\nThis is all shiny and great you might say, but I don't have a single clue what I'm looking for, and I just need to give the log file to someone else to help me. We can do that too!  \nIf you are getting help from someone on the internet (like this site!) the best way to share this information with them is to upload the file(s) to http://paste.ubuntu.com and provide them with the link. If your machine has an active internet connection you can do this in one step as described in method 2, otherwise follow the steps in method 1 and upload the files from another computer that can access the internet.  \nMethod 1: Put them on external media..\nsuch as a  flash drive or SD card.  Plug one in. Ubuntu should automatically mount it in /media so run  \nls /media  \n\nIf you see the name of your flash drive/SD card there then you can continue. Otherwise you'll have to mount it manually. (don't worry! It isn't scary at all).\nOnce you have your drive mounted you can use the cp command to copy over any logs or files you need:  \ncp /var/log/kern.log /media/myFlashDrive/\n\nWhen you're done unmount the drive:  \nsudo umount /media/myFlashDrive  \n\nMethod 2: Upload the files directly to a pastebin..\nlike paste.ubuntu.com. For this use the pastebinit command. First we need to install pastebinit:  \nsudo apt-get install pastebinit  \n\nthen upload the files like so:  \npastebinit file1 file2 file3  \n\nWhere file1 file2 file3 is a space delimited list of the files you would like to upload. For example, if I was uploading kern.log and Xorg.0.log I would use the command:  \npastebinit /var/log/kern.log /var/log/Xorg.0.log  \n\nPastebinit will return a link for each file uploaded.

If it is possible, what are the steps?\n\nA: The simplest way would be use a liveCD and format the drive without reinstalling. You can do that with a normal Ubuntu Live CD just boot from it, then open a terminal and run \nsudo gparted\n\nThen delete the partitions you have defined and shutdown without installing. There you go, you now have an unpartitioned disk and a computer returned to a pristine state.\nImportant: If your objective is to stop anyone from gaining access to your files, you might want to go further than that. The above will make it hard for your data to be restored but not impossible. If you have nothing to hide and HR have no reason to spend hours and $$ looking into your data, this will be enough. If you are in paranoid mode and want to be really sure that the data are gone, you can use a program like shred. So, to shred all data on /dev/sda1, do:\nshred -n 10 -vz /dev/sda1\n\nFor more details on shred, see here.\n", "Q: How do I get a wireless USB keyboard to to wake Ubuntu 13.10 from suspend? My PC with Ubuntu 13.10 is set to suspend after 30 minutes of inactivity.  Up until it suspends I can resume working at any time using my Logitech K400r wireless USB keyboard.  \nThe OS defect/problem is that once it suspends - the wireless keyboard can no longer wake the suspended Ubuntu 13.10.  This appears to be a Ubuntu specific problem because the same PC when booted up with MS Windows 7 always wakes up from sleep mode when you press any key on the Logitech keyboard.\nI imagine something in Ubuntu is causing the USB to go into a different state from what Windows 7 puts it in.  Does anyone have any ideas how to overcome this issue as the only way to wake the PC is to walk up to it and push the power button for a short period once.  \nWhile this power button wakes up the PC it then displays a number of error messages about sound, networking etc being down ....which do go away after a few minutes of what seems to be the OS recovering from Suspend.  Not sure if this is normal Linux behaviour due to my short experience with this OS.\nAgain could anyone help with some details on whether there is any setting that would help keep the wireless usb keyboard alive just enough to wake the pc?\nMany thanks.\n\nA: I found an open source project that provides extra functionality for devices on the Logitech Unified Receiver. Installing that application and a udev rule from a fork of that project allows me to wake Ubuntu 14.04 from suspend using a wireless Logitech keyboard.\nInstall solaar from the (now) author's PPA.\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:daniel.pavel/solaar\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install solaar\n\nIf you don't have git, install it\nsudo apt-get install git\n\nClone the fork with a corrected /udev rule\ngit clone https://github.com/3v1n0/Solaar.git ~/solaar\n\nInstall the /udev rule that will enable resume via the unified receiver\ncd ~/solaar/rules.d\n./install.sh\n\nAt this point, I unplugged the receiver and plugged it back in (as per instructions on the repo). Next, I launched solaar through the Dash and verified that my keyboard was communicating with the app. Finally, I rebooted and tested the Sleep button on the keyboard. After the machine was asleep, I was able to resume using any key.\n\nA: Your question may have been answered in this forum thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1938480\nWhile I didn't try making the udev rule, I was able to get my machine to wake from suspend from the Logitech keyboard (K340) and mouse (M505) on the unifying receiver.  In my case, I had to put the word enabled in the file\n/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-1/2-1.5/power/wakeup.\nBut what I'd really like is wake from keyboard, but not mouse. Maybe I can do that by separating keyboard and mouse to separate receivers.\n", "Q: Installing Android SDK on Ubuntu (12.04 or above) 64 bit without ia32-libs I have Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nAfter following the official steps to install Android SDK and ADT bundle on a Linux machine, I wasn't able to run the SDK as some of the binaries in it needed 32 bit libraries.\nAlmost all the highly voted answers to this quandary in this forum and elsewhere suggest the installation of ia32-libs.\nFor reasons, I simply could not install ia32-libs.

I currently have a persistent Edubuntu 12.04 LTS on it, but this is the install version, which has an annoying \"Try Ubuntu\" button, as well as a \"Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\" app in it. Is  this possible?\n\nA: Yes you can install Ubuntu on a USB, but it won't transfer nicely to other systems. I'm running a Lubuntu install from a usb stick right now. Just boot up a installation disc and choose install, then when it comes time to choose the install type pick \"something else\" and specify that your install be done to the usb stick (eg \"/\" on \"sdb1\" use as \"ext4\"), make sure to specify the bootloader to it as well (eg \"sdb\"). Ubuntu doesn't care if it's a flash drive, ssd, or hard drive. \nTo find out the correct device name for you USB drive, you can open a terminal and run \nlsblk\n\nThat will list all attached drives, one of which (usually /dev/sdaX) is your internal hard drive and one (usually /dev/sdb1) will be the pendrive.\nOfficial Ubuntu Installation Instructions (These are for 13.10, but it's the same):\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-desktop-latest\n", "Q: How to get windows boot loader back I uninstalled ubuntu 32 bit to get ubuntu 64 bit but when I did that when I turn on  my pc when I try to go to windows and get a black screen that just blinks and I do not have a windows disk\n\nA: Grub will still work for you, all you need to do is give it a new place to store its files (since the original place was on the Ubuntu partition).  Windows machines frequently have several FAT partitions for recovery or tools, any of which will work to store the grub files.  Suppose you have a FAT partition on sda1,  just add a directory \"boot\" and install grub with that as the  boot-directory. Run the Ubuntu live media, mount the FAT partition in /mnt, so you see /mnt/boot  (make the boot directory now if you haven't already).  Then install grub there\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\n\nThis should pick up Windows and result in a bootable system.\n", "Q: Is there a utility for hopping in and out of a CLI? Lets say I've got a bit of server software. I start it up and it provides an interface on stdin/stdout that I can use to enter commands during runtime. I want to be able to start it up over SSH, exit the session, come back and hook right back into that stdin/stdout interface again.\nI was thinking there must be an easy command like nohup or & that would allow me to do this. Is there?\n\nA: Yes, use can use tmux or, the older screen. The following are excerpts of their respective man pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*tmux:\n tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be\n created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  tmux may be\n detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later\n reattached.\n\n When tmux is started it creates a new session with a single window and\n displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows\n information on the current session and is used to enter interactive\n commands.\n\n A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management\n of tmux.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window\n occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each\n of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents\n the technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of tmux instances\n may connect to the same session, and any number of windows may be present\n in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, tmux exits.\n\n Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection\n (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the\n 'C-b d' key strokes).  tmux may be reattached using:\n\n       $ tmux attach\n\n\n*screen\n   Screen  is  a  full-screen  window  manager that multiplexes a physical\n   terminal between  several  processes  (typically  interactive  shells).\n   Each  virtual  terminal  provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal\n   and, in addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48,\n   ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support\n   for multiple character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer for\n   each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving\n   text regions between windows.\n\n   When screen is called, it creates a single window with a  shell  in  it\n   (or  the  specified  command) and then gets out of your way so that you\n   can use the program as you normally would.  Then, at any time, you  can\n   create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including\n   more shells), kill existing windows,  view  a  list  of  windows,  turn\n   output  logging  on  and off, copy-and-paste text between windows, view\n   the scrollback history, switch between windows in whatever  manner  you\n   wish,  etc.  All  windows  run their programs completely independent of\n   each other. Programs continue to run when their window is currently not\n   visible  and  even  when  the whole screen session is detached from the\n   user's terminal.  When a program terminates, screen (per default) kills\n   the  window  that  contained it.  If this window was in the foreground,\n   the display switches to the previous window; if none are  left,  screen\n   exits.\n\nBoth of these programs will enable you to log on to a server, launch a process, then log off and leave it running. When you want to check on it, you log back on to the server and reconnect to the running tmux or screen session and it is as though you never left. You can install both of them from the Ubuntu repositories:\nsudo apt-get install screen\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install tmux\n\nYou can find a nice Q&A comparing the two programs on our sister site, Unix & Linux.\n", "Q: I can not connect to internet with Ethernet I am completely new to this entire OS and looks like i need some help.

This is probably a stupid question, but I recently realized that I have no idea why there's no single-user functionality with apt-get.\nAnswers I'm not looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"It's because apt writes to system-level directories\". This is the surface-level why, but I'm looking for a level deeper. Is there something fundamentally blocking a single-user environment (a la pip + virtualenv)?\n\n*\"You can just build from source\". This is a workaround, but does not address my question. I don't want to fix a short-term issue, and I have root access on all of my machines anyway.\n\n\nA: It's not a stupid question.\nWhat you're asking is, why does Apt only install software at a system-level, which requires superuser privileges?  Why can't it optionally install software at a user level, requiring no such privileges?\nThe short, glib answer is that that isn't Apt's role.  Apt's role is the management and installation of software that forms part of your system.  If you want to install software at a user level, you can do that yourself, but you don't use Apt for it.  You can compile it yourself, or grab a statically compiled binary from somewhere, or using something like flatpak.  Or spin your own method for deploying.\nThe role of Apt\nUbuntu is a Linux distribution.  A Linux distribution is at its core a collection of software from many different sources, all which have been collected into one place by the distribution's managers so that you can install a complete, working system from it.\nFor this to work, the distribution can't just make software available completely unmodified - for each piece of software that forms part of the system it has to \"install\" it in a particular way into the system so that it works correctly with the rest of the software on that system.\nDistributions like Ubuntu maintain repositories of software that comprise this system.  The repositories consist of many packages, which are discrete parts of the system that can be chosen and installed separately.  Each such package lays out the software inside it in a way that allows it to be installed into a working system, so all the software and supporting files are already in the directory paths they will reside in on the target system.  In addition to this the package comes with install, configure and/or uninstall scripts that perform any other work required.\nThe laying out of the files inside the package, and the install/configure/uninstall scripts in the package, all assume the package will be part of a whole system.  Thus, it's not easy to take a single package and install it somewhere else, because the scripts and the layout of the package won't have been designed for this.\nOn top of this, the packages in the system frequently are relied upon by other packages.  And, if the software in a package is relied upon - is a dependency of - another package, it has to be placed into its correct place in the filesystem and in many cases the install and configure scripts have to have been run to ensure it's installed correctly.\nThe tool on Ubuntu and Debian which install packages and run their install/configure/uninstall scripts is called DPKG.  But, the tool that finds packages in the repository and ensures that all packages that are dependencies of other packages are also installed is called APT.\nAs you can see from this, every part of the software distribution stack is designed so that software is installed into a predictable location so that it can work as part of the system, and so that software can depend on other software to be there, and so on.\nOperating systems like Ubuntu draw a very clear distinction between software that is provided as part of the system and software the user has installed themself.  This distinction is even built into the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) which dictates how Linux distributions (and unix-like operating systems) lay out their software.  Software that is installed by the user is to go into separate directories on the system, such as\n\n*\n\n*/opt - for system wide software that isn't part of the OS but is provided by other vendors\n\n*/usr/local/* - for system wide software that was installed by the system admin manually, that isn't part of the OS\n\n*home directories - for software installed by end users in their user account, not system wide\n\nIn addition to the above, other directories can be used if there is justification for making up your own directory scheme and not using the above.\nWhat other options are there?\nIf you write software yourself or you grab it from an upstream source and adapt it yourself, you can modify your software to be installed where you like and work how you like.  So that's always an option.\nIf you want to use your operating system's (or another Linux distribution's) packages but install them in another location, various hacks exist to get software out of a package and do this.  But, the extent of success of doing this will depend on how the package is written, how its install and configure scripts work, how dependencies in the package work and so on.\nYou can use containerisation (with chroot) to install into a directory, and even run a separate copy of Apt in that directory.  Then, you have basically a cut-down Linux distribution in its own right inside a directory within your OS.\nA technique like this is what is employed by technologies like Snap or Flatpak, and is why they are pretty flexible in how and where they can install software.\n\nA: Information in the package itself determines where files will be installed, so you need sudo both to write to / and to change the package database. \nWhen you are installing packages, you are installing pre-built binary files and associated configuration and meta files and scripts that are essential parts of the package. These scripts and configuration files are tightly linked to dependencies and the rest of the system. You wouldn't want to change these lightly unless you knew exactly what you are doing.\nIf you are on a system, say at work, where you don't have sudo access, you can compile from source and set the installation directory to your home. Then, there's no need for sudo. When you are installing from source, you are generally not changing the package database.\n\nA: \nWhy does apt-get require sudo?\n\nNot always. You can perfectly use apt-get without sudo. There are instances where you don't need sudo at all, like using apt-get download which downloads a package to your current directory, apt-get source which downloads the debian sources files to your current directory, changelog which downloads and prints the changelog of a given package, and any command which has the --simulate/--dry-run/--no-act (in the case of install you need also --no-download).\nThis is because these actions/commands doesn't require to write system directories.\nNow, why apt-get needs sudo? Actually it doesn't. You can ditch apt-get, download a package with wget and use dpkg --extract and extract the package in whatever directory you like. There's also --instdir which should work for binary only package.\nNow, why this isn't the default? Because it's a pain. To do what you want, we would need to repackage each package twice, one for the right way, and another to do what you want. At build, binaries normally need to know where are the files and libraries they need (in some cases, this is hardcoded at compilation).\nNow, what you can do instead? Just chroot some environment a la virtualenv, where you can install packages without root.\nSummary, this is not the way that apt-get was meant to be used, and I don't know another package manager similar to apt-get which allows you to do that. At the end of the day, apt-get is just a front-end to dpkg which could do some of this.\n\nA: Why apt-get installs to / (or similar) directories by default?\nThe simple reason for this is that apt-get does not decide where to install software. It is decided by the developers and coded inside the application itself.\nCan I install to other directories?\nYes, you can install to other directories.For open source software, get the source, change the installation directory, compile, build and install it. There is usually an option to the included configure script that lets you specify where to install. This is usually --prefix.\nBut I insist on using apt-get. What to do now?\nOK. There is still a way to do this with apt-get, though it would be too much for a end user. Follow the steps.\n\n*\n\n*Get the source.\n\n*Change the installation directory to something like $HOME.\n\n*Compile and build.\n\n*package it into a .deb file.\n\n*Create a launchpad account.\n\n*Sign the ubuntu code of conduct(I'm not sure if this one is necessary).\n\n*create a ppa for yourself.\n\n*Upload the deb package to the ppa.\n\n*add the ppa to your sources.\n\n*Run sudo apt-get update.\n\n*Run apt-get install package.\n\nThat was too easy/hard.Is it possible to select directory during installation?\nYes and no.\nYes because it is possible, some softwares use this method, the only one that I know is Qt5.It has a .run file which, when executed asks for installation directory among many other inputs.\nNo because this method does not use apt-get.\nCould I do this easily some day, with apt-get?\nI don't think developers of apt-get and/or developers of softwares would be interested in doing this, but some software can be developed which will do the source, change, compile, build, install steps automatically by only asking for the installation directory.\nMy 6th sense tells me that the command would be\napt-dont-get install pkg1 pkg2 ...\n\n\nA: Cause it editing files that are chmodded so you cant use them. You might be able to chmod them so you cant I dont reccomend doing that though\n", "Q: Should I install Ubuntu 14.04 after release? Will 14.04 be good for install just after release or shall I wait few months for it's revision?\n\nA: That's up to you.  That's the reason this question has been tagged as opinion-based: it depends on your individual needs.\nIf you can afford to wait a few months, then there's no reason you need to upgrade immediately.  Support from the previous version won't run out immediately.  This therefore gives you an element of choice.\nOn other other hand, as soon as Ubuntu 14.04 is officially declared as \"released\" it is supposed to be considered fit for release and to be used from that point.  So there's no reason you should need to wait any length of time after release to get a release-ready product.\nSo your choice.\n", "Q: Document root not exists?

Is there anyway to change the default behavior of the launcher to check for this before opening a new window?\n\nA: Update April 7: A different version added and found Albert, see update and Bonus bellow !!!\nConcerning dash functionality:\nYou have asked \" Is there anyway to change the default behavior of the launcher to check for this before opening a new window\". Basic answer is, no, as a regular user you have no way of adding that behavior to dash. However, if there would be a unity scope developer who'd be willing to implement that, you might approach them or develop one yourself if you have resolve and willing to learn. My coding skills are very modest, hence I use shell scripting and the available graphical front-end for the scripts as a workaround.\nRelated information\nOriginal post:\nI have written a script that uses zenity dialogue and wmctrl to achieve what you asked for. Notice that this is a graphical script, meaning it will only work with windows, in GUI, and won't work if you try to launch something in tty. Besides, from what I understand Alfred does exactly the same thing. You can create a desktop shortcut to it or launcher shortcut to it, as described here and here. \nThe script:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Description: A launcher script that checks whether\n#       or not a window of a particular program already exists\n#       If a window of such program is open, bring it to focus\n#       Otherwise - launch a new window\n#       Written for https://askubuntu.com/q/440142/295286\n# Date: April 6 , 2015\n#\n\n\nMYPROG=$( zenity --entry --title='MY LAUNCHER' --text='Type the name of application to run' )\nsleep 0.5\nwmctrl -lx | awk '{print $3}' | grep -i \"$MYPROG\"\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    sleep 1         \n    wmctrl -xa $MYPROG\n   #as an alternative try the line bellow\n   #wmctrl -a $MYPROG\n    exit 1\nelse \n    $MYPROG &\n    exit 0\nfi\n\nSide notes: in the previous version , script used echo $?, to test if previous expressions exited successfully. As per muru's suggestion ( from the edit ), I changed the code to somewhat more compact version, so i suggest you take a look at the previous version and the current.\nAlso , previously wmctrl -a $MYPROG didn't work with testing google-chrome or chromium-browser; for some stupid reason some programs have WM_CLASS property of the window capitalized , while the program as listed by dpkg --get-selections is lowercase (just read man wmctrl and run wmctrl -lx, you'll know). Adding that -ax should take care of this. The script brings up the already open chromium window as it should\nAnother thing - wmctlr is somewhat weird in that it needs a delay sometimes (had experience with it in another script), so i had to add sleep 1 line. Previously it would be kind of on and off with firefox, but now works swimmingly.\nThe script in action\nIn the animation bellow you can see that on the first run of the script, there is one instance of firefox open, and the script switches focus to that window; on the second test, I open new instance of google-chrome, which hasn't been open previously. \n(Side note: If you are currious about the desktop, by the way, that is openbox with cairo dock)\nPer suggestion in the comments, embedded animation removed, posted link only. Report if it is broken please !\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/puuPZ.gif\nUpdate, April 7\nI improved the script somewhat to make all the programs listed in zenity's drop-down entry box. Now the user doesn't have to memorize each program, but can just scroll through a list of them using arrow keys or just open the drop down menu. Also, this improved version raises windows not by name, but by window id, which gives much better performance. Note, the way i go through .desktop files is kind of redundant, using cut command twice, but since my script-fu isn't that good so far, this is all i can do. Suggestions for improvement are welcome!\n#!/bin/bash\n# Author: Serg Kolo\n# Description: Second version of a launcher script that checks whether\n#       or not a window of a particular program already exists\n#       If a window of such program is open, bring it to focus\n#       Otherwise - launch a new window\n#       Written for https://askubuntu.com/q/440142/295286\n# Date: April 7 , 2015\n#\n\nset -x\n\nMYPROG=$(zenity --entry --text 'Select program from list' --entry-text $(ls /usr/share/applications/*.desktop | cut -d'/' -f5 | cut -d'.' -f1 | xargs echo))\nsleep 0.5\n# Do we have a window of such program ?\nwmctrl -lx| awk '{print $3}'  | grep -i $MYPROG\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    sleep 0.5 # if yes, find that window id, and raise it\n    WINID=$(wmctrl -lx | grep -i $MYPROG | awk 'NR==1{print $1}')\n    wmctrl -ia $WINID &\n #  exit 0  \nelse\n    echo $MYPROG | grep -i libreoffice\n    if [ $? -eq 0  ]\n    then\n        MYPROG=$(echo $MYPROG | sed 's/-/ --/g')\n    fi\n    $MYPROG &\n\n#  exit 0 \nfi\n\n\nBonus:\nI have actually found Albert , which is Linux version of Alfred, but have not tried it myself. Worth checking out though. However, as Jacob noted already, it is still buggy.\nThere is an app called Gnome-Do, which graphically looks similar to Alfred, however it does not have the same functionality as this script. \n\nLet me know if you like this script, if there's anything needs fixing, and don't forget to upvote the answer if you find it useful\n\nA: 1. Dash the Second\nBelow a script that can be used as an alternative to Dash, when it comes to running applications as described in your question. \nIt exists of a window with the same functionality as Dash; if type one or more characters of the application, the application will appear in the list. Press Enter to either start or raise the application, depending on if it is already running or not.\nYou can call it from a shortcut key combination, or set an icon in the launcher to use it similarly to Dash (see further below), or both.\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport getpass\nimport time\n\nuser = getpass.getuser()\nget = lambda x: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", x]).decode(\"utf-8\")\nskip = [\"%F\", \"%U\", \"%f\", \"%u\"]; trim = [\"chrome\", \"chromium\", \"nautilus\"]\n\ndef apply(command):\n    if \"libreoffice\" in command:\n        proc = [l.split()[0] for l in get(\"ps -u \"+user).splitlines() if \"soffice.bin\" in l]\n        module = command.split(\"--\")[-1]\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n        try:\n            ws = sum([[w.split()[0] for w in get(\"wmctrl -lp\").splitlines() if process in w and module in w.lower()] for process in proc], [])[0]\n            subprocess.call([\"wmctrl\", \"-ia\", ws])\n        except IndexError:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command+\"&\"])\n    else:\n        check = command.split(\"/\")[-1][:14]\n        proc = [p.split()[0] for p in get(\"ps -u \"+user).splitlines() if check in p]\n        time.sleep(0.5)\n        try:\n            ws = sum([[w.split()[0] for w in get(\"wmctrl -lp\").splitlines() if process in w] for process in proc], [])\n            if command == \"nautilus\":\n                real_window = [w for w in ws if \"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in get(\"xprop -id \"+w)][0]\n            else:\n                real_window = ws[0]\n            subprocess.call([\"wmctrl\", \"-ia\", real_window])\n        except IndexError:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command+\"&\"])\n# default directories of .desktop files; globally, locally, LibreOffice- specific when separately installed\nglobally = \"/usr/share/applications\"; locally = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.local/share/applications\"; lo_dir = \"/opt/libreoffice4.4/share/xdg\"\n# create list of .desktop files; local ones have preference\nlocal_files = [it for it in os.listdir(locally) if it.endswith(\".desktop\")]\nglobal_files = [it for it in os.listdir(globally) if it.endswith(\".desktop\")]\nlo_spec = [it for it in os.listdir(lo_dir) if it.endswith(\".desktop\")] if os.path.exists(lo_dir) else []\nfor f in [f for f in local_files if f in global_files]:\n    global_files.remove(f)\nfor f in [f for f in local_files if f in lo_spec]:\n    lo_spec.remove(f)\ndtfiles = [globally+\"/\"+f for f in global_files]+[locally+\"/\"+f for f in local_files]+[lo_dir+\"/\"+f for f in lo_spec]\n# create list of application names / commands\nvalid = []\nfor f in dtfiles:\n    content = open(f).read()\n    if all([\"NoDisplay=true\" not in content,\"Exec=\" in content]):\n        lines = content.splitlines()\n        name = [l.replace(\"Name=\", \"\") for l in lines if \"Name=\" in l][0]\n        command = [l.replace(\"Exec=\", \"\") for l in lines if all([\"Exec=\" in l, not \"TryExec=\" in l])][0]\n        valid.append((name, command))\nvalid.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n# create zenity list + window\nlist_items = '\"'+'\" \"'.join([f[0] for f in valid])+'\"'\nproposed = 'zenity --list --text \"Type one or more characters... \" --column=\"Application List\" '+\\\n           '--title=\"Dash the Second\" --height 450 --width 300 '+list_items\ntry:\n    choice = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", proposed]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip().split(\"|\")[0]\n    command = [r[1] for r in valid if r[0] == choice][0]\n    # command fixes:\n    for s in skip:\n        command = command.replace(\" \"+s, \"\")\n    for t in trim:\n        if t in command:\n            command = t\n    apply(command)\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n    pass\n\nHow to use\nThe script needs wmctrl installed:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Paste the script above into an empty file, save it as dash_alternative.py\n\n*Add it to a shortcut key combination: Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/dash_alternative.py\n\nExplanation\nWhen the script is run, It lists all applications, represented in /usr/share/applications. It searches the .dektop files, creating a list of all application names (from the first \"Name=\" line) and the command to run the application (from the first \"Exec=\" line). \nSubsequently, a Zenity list is created, presenting all applications in a sorted manner. \nWhenever an application is selected, the script looks in the list of running processes if the application is running. If so, the corresponding window is raised. If not, a new instance is opened.\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*To run the script on 12.04 (since the original question was tagged 12.04 simply change the shebang to #!/usr/bin/env python and run it by the command \npython /path/to/dash_alternative.py\n\n\n*As far as I tested it, the script works fine. Commands and their (not-) corresponding process names (e.g. LibreOffice <> soffice.bin), different window types (nautilus has several different window types, besides \"real\" windows) , multiple pids per application (Chromium, Google-chrome) can cause exceptions, that I fixed in the examples above. If anyone runs into an issue, please mention it.\n2.

Set the correct paths for /path/to/dash_alternative.py (the script) and /path/to/dash_alternative.png (the icon)\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Dash the Second\nExec=python3 /path/to/dash_alternative.py\nIcon=/path/to/dash_alternative.png\nType=Application\nHidden=false\n\n\n*Drag the .desktop file on to the launcher:\n\nA: For the launcher (the vertical panel on the left side of the screen), this is already the default behavior, as it is the task switching interface.\nFor the dash (the large bit that opens when you click the Ubuntu logo), there is no way to change the behavior in this manner, without a presumably significant modification to the source code itself.\nSome apps however, may already do this, as they are designed to behave that way. All apps are not, and should not necessarily be, implemented in such a manner, though.\nAs another feature though, if you open the window spread with Super+W, and start typing an application name, the windows for that application will be the only ones shown.\n", "Q: Can I change the theme for only one program in Ubuntu 13.10? I want to change the theme that Inkscape uses to a dark one, but I want the rest of the programs I use to retain the theme they currently have.\nI found this article (http://urukrama.wordpress.com/2008/07/13/setting-a-custom-gtk-theme-for-specific-applications/) but it seems to be outdated and doesn't work for me.\nI'm running Ubuntu 13.10 and the version of inkscape I'm trying to apply a different theme to is 0.48.4.

It should be Desktop. Try to copy as\nsudo cp -r /home/noyfb/Desktop/Grey /usr/share/audacious/Skins/\n\nor to move\nsudo mv /home/noyfb/Desktop/Grey /usr/share/audacious/Skins/\n\nAlso check, the folder is grey or Grey. You mentioned it differently in your question.\n-r is necessary, thanks to @jobin.\n\nA: Linux files and folders name are case-sensitive. As souravc suggested, the name of the desktop folder is Desktop, not desktop. So you should be doing:\nsudo cp /home/noyfb/Desktop/Grey /usr/share/audacious/Skins/ -r\n\nNote the -r in the command, it is used when you want to recursively copy files. This is needed since you say, Grey is a directory, you can omit -r, when the source is not a directory.

(Need to say here, I installed both versions, Unity and eOS w/out the unit in place, so I guess that messed up some configuration files from the very start)\nI have done some research, and some useful info is here, (note: during all the terminal commands, THERE WAS a CD in the unit)\nI guess this one is to look up for drives?\n~$ wodim --devices\nwodim: Overview of accessible drives (1 found) :\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 0  dev='/dev/sg1'  rwrw-- : 'hp' 'BD ROM BC-5501S'\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n~$ mount '/dev/sg1'\nmount: can't find /dev/sg1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab\n\nhere the /dev dir\ncdrom, cdrw, dcd and dvdrw, and some others, are in pink, is that normal?\n~$ls /dev\nautofs           mcelog              sda2      tty30  tty63      ttyS9\nblock            mem                 sda5      tty31  tty7       uinput\nbsg              net                 sg0       tty32  tty8       urandom\nbtrfs-control    network_latency     sg1       tty33  tty9       usbmon0\nbus              network_throughput  shm       tty34  ttyprintk  usbmon1\ncdrom            null                snapshot  tty35  ttyS0      usbmon2\ncdrw             nvidia0             snd       tty36  ttyS1      usbmon3\nchar             nvidiactl           sr0       tty37  ttyS10     usbmon4\nconsole          oldmem              stderr    tty38  ttyS11     usbmon5\ncore             port                stdin     tty39  ttyS12     usbmon6\ncpu              ppp                 stdout    tty4   ttyS13     usbmon7\ncpu_dma_latency  psaux               tty       tty40  ttyS14     v4l\ndisk             ptmx                tty0      tty41  ttyS15     vcs\ndvd              pts                 tty1      tty42  ttyS16     vcs1\ndvdrw            ram0                tty10     tty43  ttyS17     vcs2\necryptfs         ram1                tty11     tty44  ttyS18     vcs3\nfd               ram10               tty12     tty45  ttyS19     vcs4\nfreefall         ram11               tty13     tty46  ttyS2      vcs5\nfull             ram12               tty14     tty47  ttyS20     vcs6\nfuse             ram13               tty15     tty48  ttyS21     vcs7\nhidraw0          ram14               tty16     tty49  ttyS22     vcsa\nhpet             ram15               tty17     tty5   ttyS23     vcsa1\ninput            ram2                tty18     tty50  ttyS24     vcsa2\nkmsg             ram3                tty19     tty51  ttyS25     vcsa3\nlirc0            ram4                tty2      tty52  ttyS26     vcsa4\nlog              ram5                tty20     tty53  ttyS27     vcsa5\nloop0            ram6                tty21     tty54  ttyS28     vcsa6\nloop1            ram7                tty22     tty55  ttyS29     vcsa7\nloop2            ram8                tty23     tty56  ttyS3      vga_arbiter\nloop3            ram9                tty24     tty57  ttyS30     video0\nloop4            random              tty25     tty58  ttyS31     zero\nloop5            rfkill              tty26     tty59  ttyS4\nloop6            rtc                 tty27     tty6   ttyS5\nloop7            rtc0                tty28     tty60  ttyS6\nloop-control     sda                 tty29     tty61  ttyS7\nmapper           sda1                tty3      tty62  ttyS8\n\nTrying to mount manually\n~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/dvdrw\n~$ sudo mount /dev/dvdrw /mnt/dvdrw\nmount: /dev/sr0 already mounted or /mnt/dvdrw busy\n~$ man mount\n~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/dvd\n~$ sudo mount /dev/dvd /mnt/dvd\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr0\n~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom\n~$ sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr0\n~$ sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrw\n~$ sudo mount /dev/cdrw /mnt/cdrw\nmount: no medium found on /dev/sr0\n\nblkid\n~$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"e6ef2898-5744-44bc-a9da-65d32f3bab1d\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"c953e0d7-fe23-4514-a579-de52a0be47a6\" TYPE=\"swap\"\n\n... and lshw\n~$ sudo lshw\nPCI (sysfs)  \n...\nLOTS OF INFO\n...\n           *-cdrom\n                description: DVD-RAM writer\n                product: BD ROM BC-5501S\n                vendor: hp\n                physical id: 1\n                bus info: scsi@1:0.0.0\n                logical name: /dev/cdrom\n                logical name: /dev/cdrw\n                logical name: /dev/dvd\n                logical name: /dev/dvdrw\n                logical name: /dev/sr0\n                version: 1.86\n                capabilities: removable audio cd-r cd-rw dvd dvd-r dvd-ram\n                configuration: ansiversion=5 status=nodisc\n...\nMORE INFO\n...\n\nHere an important file I didn't know about, fstab\n~$ cat /etc/fstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The question is a bit old by now, but still doesn't have an answer. So:\n\n*\n\n*It appears the /media/cdrom folder doesn't exists, that's why you get the \"mount point ... does not exist\" message.\n\n\n*Second, as /dev/cdrom is not included on fstab, if you want to mount it manually you must specify the type of filesystem with the -t parameter. Fortunately, there's an auto option.\nSo you'll need:\nmkdir /media/cdrom\nsudo mount -t auto /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom\n\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Kernel module getting loaded automatically When i do  rmmod usb_storage and then dmesg\ni can see the output saying usb_storage deregistered.

Each kernel driver\ncontains a line such as:\nMODULE_ALIAS(\"usb:...\")\n\nWhich must match the usbalias (wildcards are used to match multiple\ndevices). If the modalias matches one that the driver supports, this driver\nis loaded (or notified of the new device, if it's there already).\nYou can see the supported devices (by modalias) and their associated modules with\nmore /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.alias\n\nIf you grep for the usb-storage device driver, you'll see it has some\nspecific devices it supports by vendor and device ID, and will also attempt\nto support any device with the right (storage) class, no matter the\nvendor/device.\nSource\n", "Q: Wireless not working - ASUS X450J - Qualcomm Atheros I just did a clean install, overwriting my old Windows.

Actually the wireless problem has become a common problem in Ubuntu 12.04 and it happened with me too when I installed Ubuntu 12.04.

Just restart your system once.\n\n\nHope it works for you too.

From comments a method in diagnosing: \n\n\n\nAfter a lot of diagnostics and working with vendor support, it appears\n  this is almost certainly a hardware problem with some versions of\n  X9DR3-LN4+ motherboards.\nThe problem boards report \"REV:1.10\" as their Version in 'dmidecode -t baseboard'.\nAt our site, older boards with a Version of \"0123456789\" have not produced the errors, and we are replacing the faulty boards with newer\n  boards of the same model, Version \"REV:1.20A\".\nOn the faulty motherboards, the errors seems to manifest mostly with the higher speed 2.90 GHz E5-2690 processors and full (24 RDIMMM)\n  RAM configs, but we have been able to reproduce it with fewer RDIMMs.\nFWIW, memtester did not generate the errors; the method i hit upon was just to exercise the buffer cache.  So on a system with 384 GB of RAM, i'd put about 400 GB of data in a local file system mounted at /scratch, and do:\nwhile true ; tar cf - /scratch | cat - >/dev/null ; done\n\n(In my experiments, writing to /dev/null from tar would not work... the \"cat - >/dev/null\" was required.)  While this is running, you can check the error counts with this:\ncat /sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mc?/ce*count\n\nThe observed Error rate was usually at least one MCE error per hour\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Some more possible checks you can perform: I'm getting MCE (Machine Check Exception) errors, what does this mean?\n.\n", "Q: Problem in downloading any song or movie I am unable to download any file.

Then I restarted each node, entered in recovery mode, modified fstab so they could boot (commenting any NFS entry). When the node was up I restored fstab and mounted NFS filesystems.\nWhen entering in recovery mode I had to remount the filesystem before editing fstab, it was not writable before\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nnano /etc/fstab\n\nthen resumed normal boot.\nIn a terminal I uncommented NFS imports from /etc/fstab and run sudo mount -va\nNow, mounted filesystems appear, they can be listed and a file created/edited in a node appears on all nodes.\nOf course, there should be a better and more general solution for NFS properly booting but this has worked for me.\nHope it helps someone.\n", "Q: Splitting a video into multiple parts I have several large videos that I want to split into parts. The only way to do that I know is to split one part at a time with OpenShot. I have to split, wait a long time, delete the part, split the next part, ...\nIs there a better way?

I want to be able to just mark all the split point and come back later and find it all done. Does anyone know a way?\nUPDATE:\nNow I'm working on a command line solution.

I first put skeletons like\navconv -ss  -i x.mp4 -t   -vcodec copy -acodec copy -metadata track=\"  \" \".mp4\"  \n\nThen I filled out the -ss and put the titles. After that, I used libreoffice Calc with space as a delimiter. I got the values for -t and track with a formula and dragging. \n\nA: If you do this often you can try to create a bash script.

I have installed a JDK + NetBeans bundle from the downloaded .sh file. \nNow I have the NetBeans shortcut on my desktop but I can't run NetBeans from the terminal.\nWhen I run:\nsudo dpkg --get-selections\n\nNetBeans is not on the list and also I can't find it in the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I run it from the terminal and how do I find it in the system?\n\n*When I installed Emacs using apt-get it appeared in the main menu and I could launch it from the terminal straight away. How do these two installations differ?\n\nA: dpkg is a debian package manager, since you have installed Nebeans by a (presumably local) script, it will not be listed in dpkg -l.\nRetrieve an application's command from it's desktop file:\nWhen you have an application installed of which you don't know the command, but you do have a desktop file, you can read it from the desktop file's content. The link you have on your desktop is a desktop file. Look for a line, starting with \"Exec=\". What comes after that string is the command you are looking for.\nMake the application available in Dash:\nNormally, applications install a desktop file in /usr/share/applications (like emacs does). If a desktop file is located in either that location or in ~/.local/share/applications, it appears in Dash automatically, so if you copy the desktop file into ~/.local/share/applications, it will appear in Dash after next log in. \nOpen an application by (only) it's binary file name (or not):\nNetbeans did not open on the command netbeans because the shell does not know the path to your binary file. If binary files are located in /usr/bin (the default path to application's binary files) they will open right away, without the path-prefix. That is the case for example with emacs.\nIf an application does not install its binary file in /usr/bin, there are three possibilities; either the application's desktop file's execute line includes the path to the file, as you can see for example in the execute line of the file-explorer indicator's desktop file: /opt/indicator-file-explorer/bin/indicator-file-explorer, or the path to the binary file is added to $PATH (/etc/environment), so the shell will search for binary files in that directory too, or the application installs a link to the binary file in /usr/bin. All three options do occur, no matter the way an application is installed. \nIf you installed your application locally, it would be a bad idea to (try to-) create a link to the application's binary file from a global directory, such as /usr/bin; other users would be stuck with a dead link, because they have no valid permissions in your home directory. Therefore, the easyest way is to create a local bin directory (~/bin) and create a link to the local binary file from that directory (ln -sf). That way you can run your locally installed Netbeans by the single command netbeans.\n\nA: Assuming you downloaded the 7.4 version\nIf you installed netbeans from .sh installer using sudo then the default command to run netbeans is :\n/bin/sh \"/usr/local/netbeans-7.4/bin/netbeans\"\n\nif you installed netbeans without sudo then the default command is :\n~/netbeans-7.4/bin/netbeans\n\n\nA: Don't know if this might help but what works for me is assuming you are the the current home directory of your user\n./netbeans-8.0.2/bin/netbeans\n\nI installed netbeans by downloading the sh installer from their website.

I want to use Ubuntu but I need Windows for my studies (for like Visual Studio and other stuff does work only under Windows) so I was thinking of making Ubuntu my primary OS and then creating a virtual machine with oracle VirtualBox.\nI tried dual booting but I had problems with permissions. When I can read/write on Windows, Ubuntu doesn't have even read permissions and vice versa.\n\nA: I will suggest there are five stages of using both Ubuntu and Windows. Here is the list of the five stages in chronological order from the first stage to the last stage. As a new Ubuntu user you are still at stage 1 in the list.\n\n\n*\n\n*New Ubuntu user runs Windows in a virtual machine so that he can pop back into Windows any time it's necessary. Oracle VirtualBox is a good choice for the virtual machine application.\n\n*Ubuntu user with more experience uses Windows less frequently and wants more RAM to be available in Windows, so he dual boots Ubuntu alongside Windows.\n\n*Experienced Ubuntu user learns that there are many alternatives to the applications that he used in Windows including running the same Windows applications in Ubuntu using Wine, but he saves his dual boot Windows OS for when he needs to run applications that can't be replaced or won't run in Ubuntu using Wine.\n\n*The user doesn't use Windows much anymore, so he removes Windows and installs it on another computer if possible.\n\n*User rarely boots the computer that has Windows on it, and the computer sits unused gathering dust.\n", "Q: Can t update ssh I have two server, the first (target) is running my website and can t be rebooted.

Then encrypt it with gpg: \ngpg -c mysshcmds \n\nYou will be asked for a password (twice). Now it will create an encrypted file mysshcmds.gpg.

I'm tinkering with a QML app that interacts with a remote REST API over HTTPS.  The \"client\" part of the app is neatly packaged into a component and I'd like to unit test that, but I don't want to have to rely on the remote service being available whenever I run tests, nor do I want to commit actual transactions.  Instead, I want to mock the remote service.\nWhat is a good way to do this?  I'm developing on Ubuntu Trusty, using Ubuntu SDK 1.119.\n\nA: If all the logic for talking to the remote API and parsing the results, is in C++ as a component plug-in, you can use the googlemock library, packaged as google-mock in Ubuntu, to create unit tests that mock expected results and data. However, if the API on the server changes, your code may still fail, even though the tests would pass, as you are only testing some known expected results.\nAnother option is to introduce an environment variable in y our code, so that you may point the base URL to a different location, such as localhost:12345, and implement a mock HTTP server in Python or another language, which gets run on a random high port, which you can point the tests at. This makes running the tests a little more complicated, as you need to get the random port from the server script, and pass it on to the tests in some way. You can run this test on plain HTTP, or create a CA cert and server cert, which are included in the test suite, and add some way to ensure the networking library can load the CA into the certificate chain to validate the local HTTPS connection. However, this is all very complicated and doesn't give you any more useful results than simpler unit tests with fake data.\nBeyond that, you can only talk to an actual server, with an actual valid certificate. Ideally, the remote service will providing a staging/test server for doing such testing against, and you can introduce an environment variable or similar in your code, to point it at the staging/test server, instead of the live server.\n", "Q: Simple Scan: PDF does not open on Android (Adobe reader) (dated 1970!)

The document that opens is dated correctly (the date it was scanned on) while the others that do not open are dated as in the 1970.\nFor example the document that opens has the following metadata:\n\nProducer   itext-paulo-155 (itextpdf.sf.net-lowagie.com)\nCreator    pdftk 1.44 - www.pdftk.com\nCreated    Fri 14 Feb 2014 07:02:56 PM EET\nFormat     PDF-1.4\n\nWhile the documents that do not open:\n\nProducer   None\nCreator    Simple Scan 3.4.3\nCreated    Thu 01 Jan 1970 01:59:59 AM EET\nFormat     PDF-1.3\n\nIs my assumption correct?

To find the responsible, use systemctl --type swap.\n\nExample:\n# systemctl --type swap\n\nUNIT           LOAD   ACTIVE SUB    DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                     \ndev-zram1.swap loaded active active /dev/zram1                                                                                                                                                                      \n\nLOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.\nACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.\nSUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.\n\n1 loaded units listed.

The solution is quite simple anyways; to permanently disable swap you must:\n\n*\n\n*swapoff -a\n\n*edit /etc/fstab and comment any swap entries if\npresent (you might be able to skip this step 2, and step 3 without step 2 may work for you).\n\n*run: sudo systemctl mask \"dev-sdXX.swap\"  (where XX is the\nswap partition. Note, you should use quotes around the unit name in case the name has escape characters/backslash. Also useful to do it for all possible partitions so\nthat if there is a swap partition on any other drive it will not be\nmounted.)\n\nPeace out.\n\nA: Disable Swap Permanently\nswapoff -a                 # Disable all devices marked as swap in /etc/fstab\nsed -e '/swap/ s/^#*/#/' -i /etc/fstab   # Comment the correct mounting point\nsystemctl mask swap.target               # Completely disabled\n\nNote: All Commands Should Run with Root Privileges\n\nA: Just delete the entry (or comment it using # in front of the line) from fstab and reboot. Look for the line with the word \"swap\" in it.\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n\nA: May I suggest a safer approach? You never know when swap can save you from crashing. While swapping does indeed slow down your computer, if you use a program that eats up all your RAM, having the ability to swap can save you from a hard reboot. When the computer starts swapping, you'll notice and be able to kill the offending application.\nSo, instead of disabling swap altogether, just make sure your OS swaps very rarely. This is controlled by the vm.swappiness setting in /etc/sysctl.conf. Ubuntu's default setting is 60 if I remember correctly which is too much for most situations and will cause you to start swapping even while RAM is still available. If you reduce this value, you will be able to keep the safety line of swap while only using it for emergencies. So, open the file:\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nAnd add this line to it:\nvm.swappiness=10\n\nIf that is still too much, change the 10 to 1. Now, after you restart, you will only swap when absolutely necessary and you can simply forget about it.\n", "Q: crontab not running as root Mysql backup scripts not running as root crontab - help\nI'm trying to run a crontab as root but the script is not running successfully.

You're half way there by using variables that define the location of the commands (MYSQL=\"$(which mysql)\") but which mysql just reads your PATH to determine its output. which in a script like this doesn't do anything, you might as well just write mysql directly when the command is used, or hardcode the location for mysql in the variable instead of using which to try and populate it for you.\nOn a test Ubuntu x64 12.04.3 install, * * * * * env > test.out in a crontab shows that the PATH is /usr/bin:/bin.

I can make ubuntu boot by mounting the EFI partition and renaming the Microsoft/ folder to something else.\nIf renamed to something else, then update-grub will not find the os and always remove the entry for windows from the boot list.\nIf I let grub-update run when Microsoft/ is present, it will correctly detect it and create an entry for it. I can then manually edit grub.cfg to point to the renamed folder e.g. MicroS and then rename Microsoft to MicroS to get it working.\nHowever: update-grub is always run by ubuntu after a kernel has been added/removed. Therefore update-grub is regularly removing that entry, leaving my unable to boot to windows.\nWhat can I do to prevent this from happening? Thanks a lot.\n\nA: I have three suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Abandon GRUB 2 -- Several other EFI boot loaders for Linux are available, and when you start running into GRUB 2 problems, these alternatives are likely to be easier to configure than GRUB 2, which is complex and finicky. Chances are either rEFInd or Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy will work best, although with some adjustments to your configuration, gummiboot might work well, too. Note that you may need to move the EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi file down one level in its directory tree, to EFI/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi, to get this to work with rEFInd; or create a manual boot stanza for Windows.\n\n*Run Boot Repair -- The Boot Repair tool includes the ability to rename boot loaders in a way that should fix your problem. If it works well, this may be easier than the first solution; but it's a little less elegant, and on occasion it causes additional problems.\n\n*Create a manual boot stanza -- You can edit the /etc/grub.d/40_custom file to include the boot stanza that works with your renamed Windows file. GRUB should then pick it up. Overall, this is likely to be the quickest solution.\n\n", "Q: why `dpkg -l | grep package` is showing a package after being purged To uninstall a package (Ex: tor) installed from repository one should use \nsudo apt-get remove tor\n\nI did this but dpkg -l | grep tor shown something against the package.

If one of these packages (say, bar) Depends: on package foo, but foo itself is already not listed (this should not happen as long as you use only official stable Debian/Ubuntu repos) dpkg -l tor will mention them.\ngrep-status (no root required) is a neat command that can help you locate which package is the culprit:\n$ grep-status foo\nPackage: bar\nDepends: foo\n...\n$ dpkg -s bar\n$ dpkg -L bar\n...\n\nnow you can uninstall or purge the package using eg.:\n# dpkg -r bar\n# dpkg -P bar\n\n", "Q: Unknown internet traffic My Internet device (a USB dongle) shows Internet speed very good.

I'm trying to make a program that will store the passwords with users input (a web app), rather than having to do it from the command line. The problem is that I don't know where the passwords are being stored as to change then.\n\nA: The default Samba configuration on my system puts the password database in /var/lib/samba/passdb.tdb. Note that this is a binary database, not a flat text file.\nYou can tell Samba to use a text file by setting the \"passdb backend\" parameter in /etc/samba/smb.conf. But Samba uses a different password hashing algorithm from the one in /etc/shadow.\nsource\n", "Q: How to set up Unikey the same way as VPSKeys in Windows I am trying to switch a laptop to Ubuntu for a family member. Currently the laptop runs Windows and a program called VPSKeys, which is used to add Vietnamese accents and other characters when using a US Keyboard. I have found Unikey on GNU/Linux could be a replacement for it, but the documentation is written in vietnamese, and since I do not understand how VPSKeys work, or read vietnamese, I can't think of a way to replicate the same functionality.\nMy question is: Has anyone used Unikey. Does it behave the same way as VPSKeys on Windows? Are there tweaks required to get it to behave the same way?\nThe Unikey site is located at: https://code.google.com/p/ibus-unikey/\nMore info on VPS Keys: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPSKeys\nThank you,\n\nA: ibus-unikey is packaged for Ubuntu and available in the Ubuntu archive, so the first thing I would like to say is: Install it from the Ubuntu archive instead of downloading it from e.g. Google directly.\nActually, if you install the Vietnamese language in Ubuntu, ibus-unikey gets automatically installed.\nI have absolutely no idea if there are differences compared to VPSKeys. But judging from the positive user feedback from some users of Ubuntu 12.04, it's probably easy to handle.\n", "Q: Virtualbox hangs when shutting down after having installed guest editions I have had a few Ubuntu 12.04 LTS VMs running on my windows 7 host and it's been great.

I have a script I want to execute with many commands over the week end and I want to make sure if an error occurs at a line, the other lines are executed.\n\nA: Execution continues regardless of errors within commands (exit status isn't 0) unless you explicitly specify to stop execution in the event of an error (set -e).

It has been asked many times, but none of the solutions work for me.  I upgraded to BlueZ 5 because I want to be able to use its low energy capabilities eventually.  Right now, though, I can't get even get my devices paired.  I can't use a GUI because this will eventually be for an embedded linux system.  Therefore, I think I also can't use bluetoothctl, because it requires an interactive session.  (I may be wrong on that.)  So I want everything to be either through BASH, C, or python, in that order.  Also, because it needs to be automated, the pairing and connection will have to be initiated from the bluetooth device, not from the linux box.

Am I: \n\n\n*\n\n*Forgetting something really obvious?  \n\n*Using the tools incorrectly?\n\n*Forgetting to set a config file?\nEdit:\nSince the bluez simple-agent wasn't giving me any useful errors, I wrote my own pairing agent.  Once I did, I was able to pair but not connect.  bluetoothd gave me this new error:\nbluetoothd[3078]: profiles/audio/a2dp.c:a2dp_source_connect() path /org/bluez/hci0/dev_70_72_3C_62_49_7F\nbluetoothd[3078]: a2dp-source profile connect failed for 70:72:3C:62:49:7F: Protocol not available\n\nThis post pointed out that maybe my LOCAL bluetooth adapter wasn't supporting the a2dp profile of my audio source. (Not acting like a sink)  Then I saw that the same issue has been experienced by many people upgrading from BlueZ4 to BlueZ5.  The issue also was posted on the BlueZ mailing list.\nSo far, I haven't found a way to add this protocol to my adapter.\n\nA: Solution:\nAfter finding that the profile (a2dp) wasn't connected and seeing that others had the same problem, I looked into whether this profile was implemented in BlueZ5 yet.  I guess I didn't read the porting guide closely enough, because it explains that a2dp was moved out of the BlueZ stack and into GStreamer.  I had never heard of GStreamer, but I also saw from this post that PulseAudio and JACK would implement this profile as well.  I tried PulseAudio, but it would not load the proper UUIDs for the adapter.  Then I finally found a post on the ArchLinux wiki.  I must have been to this page a million times, but it was probably when I was still using BlueZ4.  \nMost importantly: \n-download the new PulseAudio 5 source code, which has support for BlueZ5, and compile it.  (It is not the newest version in the apt repositories.)  \n-compiling took a LOT of dependencies (JSON,libsndfile,libcap, etc)\n-keep in mind that the path for PA5 is /usr/local not /usr/  (This is important, because I had to put it in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that PA could find libpulsecore-5.0 at startup)\n-as the ArchLinux wiki says, kill the pulseaudio server that is run at startup and start a new one.  It doesn't load the profiles at startup. Also make sure that the daemon respawns.  (Set in /usr/local//etc/pulse/client.conf)\nAfter that, the usual pactl commands work.  I was able to get an a2dp BT source (i.e. iPod) to stream to PA5, and then, using the loopback module, stream to an a2dp BT sink!\nI wasn't able to get it to run with ALSA, but I read somewhere that BlueZ5 may not support ALSA pcm plugins anymore. \n\nA: Key to the above problem is this phrase: \"Once the discovery stops, devices neither connected to or paired will be automatically removed by bluetoothd within three minutes.\"\nPlease read Device discovery section from http://www.bluez.org/bluez-5-api-introduction-and-porting-guide/\nI had similar issue, but got it paired and connected. To pair and connect a device, it must have been discovered within the last 3 minutes. Both simple-agent and bluetoothctl work fine.\n", "Q: PROBLEM(13.10) : external monitor not working [- nouveau-driver on macbook pro] I am using Ubuntu 13.10 on a macbook pro.

In my machine this is DP-1. xrandr lists them, but they have slightly different names for the kernel. For instance, xrandr calls DP1 what the kernel calls DP-1.\n\n*Boot the machine with the port enabled, by passing the parameter video=<port>:<res>e. The e means \"force output to be enabled, even if it looks like there's nothing on the other end\".\nFor instance, I have to add: video=DP-1:1024x768e\nTo boot the kernel passing a parameter: enter the grub menu at boot (press Shift if the menu is skipped), press e on the first menu entry (default, latest kernel), go to the line that begins with linux /vmlinuz or something similar, and add your choice of video=<port>:<res>e to the end of that line.  Then press Ctrl-X to boot.\nThe resolution, as far as I know, is mostly irrelevant, although the ratio seems to be. xrandr/Ubuntu will later let you play with it a little and change it.\nWhen you boot, you should be able to see \"a monitor\", although it may appear disabled by default. Try to enable it a few times. In my machine, it doesn't always work the first time, but it may work the second or the third without reboot. (Why more than once? Because it's not Haskell :S I don't really know.)\n", "Q: Just finished installing Ubuntu Desktop 13.10, mouse clicking problem Installed on my MacBook Pro Early 2011, and I've encountered this problem before where my mouse will move around the screen but won't select anything.

When I have it plugged in, the cursor does as mentioned, but when I unplug it, everything's fine. But in-case this problem ever happens to me, an answer will still work for me.\n\nA: I knew exactly what your problem was before your comment because I also own a RAT and took me forever to figure out what to google for.\nBasically what you need to do is manually map all the buttons in the xorg.\nHere is the link to the solution.\nWhat is happening is your RAT needs a driver and linux isn't taking the button inputs correctly. Your symptom is due to the fact that it doesn't know how to click off. This gives it the illusion that none of your buttons are working. One workout around until you fix this is to unplug/replug or change mouse modes (RAT 7 and 9 only). You will get one click each time. Or just use a different mouse until you make the changes.\n", "Q: Internet and apt-get very slow I am using xubuntu 13.10 right now and I have some Internet problems.\nWhen I use apt-get it takes almost forever to download just a few kBytes.\nI get results like these and it pauses there for a long time:\njens@Ultrabuch:~$ sudo apt-get update\n[sudo] password for jens: \nIgn http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy InRelease\nHolen: 1 http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy Release.gpg [72 B]                     \nOK   http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy Release                                    \nOK   http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy/main Sources                               \nOK   http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy/main amd64 Packages                        \nOK   http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy/main i386 Packages                         \nIgn http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy/main Translation-de_DE                      \nIgn http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy/main Translation-de                         \nIgn http://extras.ubuntu.com saucy/main Translation-en                         \nIgn http://archive.canonical.com saucy InRelease                               \nOK   http://archive.canonical.com saucy Release.gpg                            \nOK   http://archive.canonical.com saucy Release                 \nOK   http://archive.canonical.com saucy/partner amd64 Packages                 \nOK   http://archive.canonical.com saucy/partner i386 Packages   \nIgn http://archive.canonical.com saucy/partner Translation-de_DE\nIgn http://archive.canonical.com saucy/partner Translation-de   \nIgn http://archive.canonical.com saucy/partner Translation-en   \n96% [Verbindung mit archive.ubuntu.com (2001:67c:1360:8c01::18)\n\nIt appears to me that these freezes are caused by \"Translation\" packages, they are always ignored.\nI tried to change the server as well, that didn't work either, as can be seen below.\nWhen I reload synaptic I get this message:\n\nCould not download all repository indexes\nThe repository may no longer be available or could not be contacted because of         network problems.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on my computer and I want to upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04. \nI do not have internet at home, so I need to do the upgrade offline. \nOn openSUSE there a way to make the upgrade offline simple and effective way is by using  the iso DVD. \nMy question is: Is there any way to make Ubuntu upgrade offline as in openSUSE ?\n\nA: Canonical doesn't provide alternate-cd since 12.10, so an upgrade through the installation disk won't be available. \nThe solution would be to create an offline mirror of the ubuntu package repositories [1]. Once you have one, you can follow this procedure :\n\n\n*\n\n*update-manager and do-release-upgrade reads the file /etc/update-manager/meta-release to find the location of the meta-release file. This points to the internet location changelogs.ubuntu.com normally. And if you just mirror the package repos, the meta-release file isn't included. So we need to fetch it first: \nwget http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/meta-release\n\n\n*Store it, for instance on the root of the internal mirror or some other convenient location, and put the url to it in the \"URL\" value in the /etc/update-manager/meta-release. If you're upgrading to a LTS release, fetch the meta-release-lts file too and repeat the process.\n\n*Edit the meta-release file you just downloaded and substitute the external mirror address with the url for the internal mirror so all package locations match up. For me this was replacing archive.ubuntu.com with file:/// and the path of the internal mirror. Make sure the file is readable via http (or file permissions if using file access to repo).\n\n*Run update-manager or do-release-upgrade and the upgrade should work as you were using an internet mirror. \n\nA: When I ran booted with the standard Ubuntu 14.04 DVD and selected the install option, I did get an option to upgrade in-place the existing Ubuntu 12.04 install. I have done such in-place upgrades using the DVD/CD media from 8 to 10 and 10 to 12.04. So I feel it would run without a hitch in the 12.04 to 14.04 case also.\n\nA: If your system is a vanilla install upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04 is easy offline using the Ubuntu 14.04 DVD. However, if your system has extra installations, it may lead to some complications during upgrade as compatible 14.04 packages will not be upgraded.\n", "Q: Installing Python 3.4 from source I am running Xubuntu 13.10 i386 with the python (2.7) and python3 (3.3) packages installed.

No option for in-place fixing.\nHow can I make a command like this work for my files, assuming I want to handle every file in a directory with the same, given extension?\n\nA: The biggest problem here is not being able to overwrite the same file.

If these is an error (ie if the MOOV is not at the end of the file), the script above will result in the file being deleted. This version avoids that by mv'ing the tmp file at the end.

The vendor has asked which kernel version I have.  Using uname -r I get 3.5.0-47 generic with my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nI just read that Ubuntu 14.04 generic will release with Linux 3.3 which appears to be an earlier version.  \nDoes this really mean that the latest Ubuntu uses an earlier Linux than an earlier Ubuntu?\nI'm confused.\n\nA: When a vendor asks what version of Linux you have, it is very plausible that what they mean by version is in fact distribution. In this case, if you are on Ubuntu 12.04, then that is what you should reply with.\nIf they specifically want the version number for the Linux kernel they will generally be more specific in stating so.\n\nA: I am not sure with what version of linux will the stable version of Ubuntu 14.04 released, but I can address the version confusion.

This enabled me to restore the whole system in case of a disk crash or virus, and to access individual files simply if required. Of course any changes made since the backup would be lost but whole system restore was rare and I didn't mind that level of loss.\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't find any way in Linux to do a hot full-image backup – is that correct?\nFailing that I am planning on the following approach:\nOnce a week back up all below / to the external drive using rsync.\nAs required do an incremental backup using rsync.\nThese backups will enable me to access individual files – from Linux or Windows.\nIf I have to restore the whole system I will wipe the disk, recreate Ubuntu using the original distribution DVD and then use rsync to restore the whole lot below /.\n\n*Will this approach restore the system to how it was at the last backup?\n\n*Is there any problem overwriting everything below / while the system is live?\n\n*Would there be any advantage to using Mondo Rescue or Clonezilla to create a copy of the “core” stuff?

At times i can access windows file from ubuntu but not ubuntu files from windows. is there an option to create a shared folder so that i can put the common files in it and access from both ubuntu and windows when necessary\n\nA: The files on \"ubuntu\" are probably saved on an Ext4 partition, of which Windows does not support the reading or writing of.\nYour first option is that you can use Ext2Read to read the Ext4 partition on windows, but there is no support.\nYour Second option is that any file on NTFS (which is what windows uses) should be fine on linux, as it has great NTFS support, so you should be able to just write to a folder on that partition.\nIf for some reason that doesn't work, you should be able to create a third partition formatted as FAT32 (bad) or NTFS, and just use this third partition as the cross over.\n\nA: The best way, in my opinion, is to use a NTFS/FAT32 partition. These partitions can be access in both Windows and Linux. You can do some changes to mount this partition at each boot time in Linux. And then you can use it to store files such a s music and videos that could be accessed easily in both the OS.\n", "Q: Thinkpad Edge E330 refuses to boot from USB after installing Ubuntu Before I installed Ubuntu my Thinkpad edge bios allowed me to specify boot devices, their order etc. Now it only says Ubuntu in the boot device list. I am thinking this has to do something with UEFI but I am not sure what to do exactly. I tried every sensible combination of BIOS settings but nothing helps. Maybe someone had a similar issue.\n\nA: This is clearly a firmware (what manufacturers and most people call a \"BIOS,\" although it's not) bug. I recommend you go to your manufacturer's site and look for an update.\nIf that fails, my only suggestion is to use a third-party boot manager that will provide its own way to boot an external medium. My own rEFInd should do this, although in some cases you'll need to hit the Esc key to re-scan for bootable devices after it's booted.\n\nEdit: It occurred to me after making the original post that disabling any \"fast startup\" type options in the firmware might also resolve the problem. Sometimes these options prevent the firmware from detecting a removable USB flash drive, so if such an option was accidentally enabled, it could cause the symptoms you're seeing.\n\nA: I was having the similar issue where the black screen was shown and hang up there when booting Ubuntu from USB HDD. I found that ext4 partition type is not supported by thinkpad edge 15. I reinstalled Ubuntu on the USB HDD by reformatting it with ext2. I suggest you to cross check the partition type.

OS was installed a short few days ago. Yesterday, I unplugged the ethernet cable to take the netbook outside for a few hours. Came back in, plugged the ethernet in again, everything worked fine as normal. A couple hours later, I noticed horrible lag on my desktop, with nothing using data. Check the netbook, and see the connection is absolutely maxed out. Being hasty, I simply unplugged the ethernet cable and went about my business.\nSome time later, I decided to plug it back in and see what was using all of that bandwidth, only to find that I could no longer get a wired connection. All configuration checks out, as far as I can tell, but Ubuntu just keeps trying to connect and failing, with the message:\nWired network\nDisconnected - you are now offline\nI have a separate Windows 7 partition, and decided to see if the situation was any clearer over there, only to find that I cannot connect to the internet there, either.

What does this mean, and is there a more acute way to change the priority?\n\nA: The way to change the default priority of system processes is through the renice command. From a terminal window, use renice to change your own processes' priority. Use sudo renice to change system process priorities. Read the manual page about renice first:\nman renice.\n", "Q: Pulseaudio: Loopback decreases volume? I'm trying to set up PulseAudio for some streaming, and I thought I had it set up correctly. Apparently I was wrong. I was having some issues with volume in my setup, so I decided to start from scratch.\nAfter running the below commands, any input (program) attached to \"stream_spkr\" comes out at a low volume, probably about half of what it is supposed to be. The created sink is at 100% volume:\npacmd insert-module module-null-sink sink_name=stream_spkr sink_properties=device.description=sink_spkr\npacmd insert-module module-loopback source=stream_spkr.monitor sink=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\n\nI deleted the loopback and used ffplay -f pluse -i stream_spkr.monitor to play the input from the null-sink over my speakers, and it's at full volume. This leads me to believe that it is, in fact, the loopback causing the issue.\nAny PulseAudio gurus here? I can't for the life of me figure out what the problem is. I checked the module options in PulseAudio's documentation and there doesn't seem to be any options for volume so I must be missing something.\nEDIT: Upon further investigation, pacmd shows that the loopback volume is, indeed, 36%:\nindex: 37\ndriver: <module-loopback.c>\nflags: VARIABLE_RATE START_CORKED \nstate: RUNNING\nsink: 1 <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo>\nvolume: 0:  36% 1:  36%\n        0: -26.62 dB 1: -26.62 dB\n        balance 0.00\nmuted: no\ncurrent latency: 35.78 ms\nrequested latency: 66.67 ms\nsample spec: s16le 2ch 44100Hz\nchannel map: front-left,front-right\n             Stereo\nresample method: speex-float-1\nmodule: 35\nproperties:\n    media.role = \"abstract\"\n    module-stream-restore.id = \"sink-input-by-media-role:abstract\"\n    media.name = \"Loopback from Monitor of stream_spkr_sink\"\n    media.icon_name = \"audio-input-microphone\" \n\nWhy would it start a loopback at 36% volume, and how can I override that?\n\nA: I think I know what happened here, I had changed the volume of the sink in Pavucontrol a while back. Pulseaudio kept the setting somewhere and was loading my old volume when I re-added the loopback. Subsequent unload/load of the module-loopback after changing the volume back to 100% proved this.\n", "Q: MTP mount fails of samsung galaxy S4 on 13.10 on lenovo t440 When I connect my samsung galaxy S4 active to my lenovo t440 running 13.10,  the device is detected and I'm offered to look at in Files.

Ubuntu.  I can't offer a solution to fix MTP (I've tried many), but I can suggest WiFi Explorer instead.  You run the app on the device, then point your browser to the URL the app gives you.  It works very well and is 100% reliable, unlike MTP.\nMine also intermittently connects with MTP.  There's evidently some sort of handshake with the device when you connect the USB cable that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  When it does, you get the USB symbol in the notification bar and are able to switch between MTP and Camera mode.  It IS sensitive to the cable you use, but this doesn't solve the problem, some cables don't work at all, the white Samsung cable is the same as various other cables I have, sometimes it works sometimes (mostly) it doesn't.  \n\nA: This may be different from your exact issue, but I have also been having problems mounting my S4 at home (Linux Mint 16 [based on Ubuntu 13.10]). Usually when I plug it in I get an error saying that it was unable to connect. At work (Windows 7, factory cable) it works every time. Once I had brought the white cable home and tried it in all ports to no avail.\nLong story short, I just took a can of compressed air to the micro USB male and female, and it now mounts first try.\n\nA: May sound weird, but what solved it for me was using the original (white) USB cable that came with the phone. When I used a different cable, it would only charge. \n", "Q: avconv - Extract one video frame and repeat it I'd like to repeat one frame from a source video to output.

You are more than likely to lose your files if you do not know what you're doing.\nThis is a rather advance topic.

Now I want to install a newer version, again from source. In both cases I have to add PATH to bashrc. I am a afraid from upcoming problems, because I think when I type NS (my program) in the terminal, Linux will not know which one to expose? Is it a correct criteria?\n\nA: When you install two softwares having same name into two different directories, one in /usr directory is called.\nIf both are installed in places other than usr, the one which is located first is used(that's what I think)\nIn your case, you must change name of either package in bashrc, for ex change to NS2 which will point to one of the app you will compile.The other will be pointed by NS.This will solve your problem.\n\nA: Assuming you compile both versions in different directories then you can just use one or the other directory in your PATH variable.\nSay you had a directory named NS-1.0.0 and the binary ended up under /bin in there:\nPATH=$PATH:/home/my-name/NS-1.0.0/bin\n\nNow you compile version 1.3.7, so the binary ends up in a new directory and you can change your PATH to the following:\nPATH=$PATH:/home/my-name/NS-1.3.7/bin\n\nIf you installed the software under /usr/bin/... or /usr/local/bin/..., then installing the new version is likely to overwrite the old version. However, you have no guarantee that it will work properly in case some files from the old version need to be deleted.\nIf you kept everything local, then the change I shown should suffice.\n", "Q: Unable to locate package php5-readline samitha@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install php5-readline\nReading package lists...

When I shutdown Windows 8 in Fast Startup Mode (by default) and then run Ubuntu, Ubuntu cannot mount any NTFS partition and sound is working. But if I restart in Windows 8, partition will be mounted but sound is not working. I don't know why and how to fix it. Can anyone help me? Every advice is appreciate! Thanks all.\n\nA: Fast Startup is incompatible with dual-boot configurations. It basically turns a shutdown operation into a suspend-to-disk operation, which leaves disks in an inconsistent state. At best, Linux will ignore such partitions. At worst, data corruption can result. Thus, I strongly recommend that you disable Fast Startup in Windows, as described here.\nNote that the Windows Fast Startup feature is different from the firmware's feature with a similar name. Any \"fast boot\" or similarly-named firmware feature bypasses certain types of hardware setup. This is usually fine from a Linux perspective, although it can result in an inability to boot from an external medium like a USB flash drive. Thus, it may need to be disabled when installing Linux.

I need to add some real numbers in a script. I tried:\nlet var=2.5+2.5 \n\nwhich gives me an error - invalid arithmetic operator and then I tried:\nlet var=2,5+2,5 \n\nwhich does not give me an error, but it gives me a wrong result -2 in this case. \nWhy? How to add real numbers using let or other command?\n\nA: The first variant (let var=2.5+2.5) doesn't work because bash doesn't support floating point.\nThe second variant (let var=2,5+2,5) works, but it may not be what you wish because comma has another meaning in this case: it's a separator, command separator. So, your command is equivalent in this case with the following three commands:\nlet var=2\nlet 5+2\nlet 5\n\nwhich are all valid and because of this you get var=2.\nBut, the good news is that you can use bc to accomplish what you wish. For example:\nvar=$(bc <<< \"2.5+2.5\")\n\nOr awk:\nvar=$(awk \"BEGIN {print 2.5+2.5; exit}\")\n\nOr perl:\nvar=$(perl -e \"print 2.5+2.5\")\n\nOr python:\nvar=$(python -c \"print 2.5+2.5\")\n\n\nA: Bash doesn't handle floating point arithmetic.\nIf you really need fp arithmetic, use bc or dc. E.g.,\nvar=$(bc <<< \"2.5+2.5\")\necho \"$var\"\n\nwill output 5.0, or with dc (lots of fun, it's reverse polish notation):\nvar=$(dc <<< \"2.5 2.5 + p\")\necho \"$var\"\n\nwill also output 5.0.\n\nA: zsh is another shell different to bash that allows floating point in the shell. If you use zsh instead of bash, which do support let using floating points you don't need to modify the script. Just install it using sudo apt-get install zsh and then using it in your script with the shebang #!/usr/bin/zsh or using the shell. Demostration:\n➜  ~  let var=2.5+2.5                      \n➜  ~  echo $var\n5.0000000000\n\nThe script should work fine since zsh implemented all the functions that bash has and more. Your second example will not work because the comma (,) is interpreted by the shells as separator. It tells to execute the command let with var=2 5+2 and 2.\n", "Q: How can I export ALL notes from Gnote to HTML through command line? I want to export the notes of Gnote. All of them.

I want to execute the executable in terminal with name only like other commands.\nI can put my executable in /usr/local/bin or I could add its PATH to ~/.bashrc. Both will work.\nWhat is better?  Is there  any difference?\n\nA: If you put the executable file in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, then you will be able to run that program by only specifying the name (your-program instead of /usr/local/bin/your-program).\nIf you instead add the directory containing the program to the ~/.bashrc file to the PATH, then any executable file present in that directory can be launched by only typing its name.\n\nA: Adding the location of the file to your $PATH variable in your ~/.bashrc file will only allow you to execute from any location, whereas putting it in /usr/bin/ will allow all users on your system to execute that file from any location.\nWhy is that? Because, your ~/.bashrc file is only visible to you as a user. So all variable changes done are limited to you. Whereas, adding that file to /usr/bin will allow the file to remain there for all users and since /usr/bin is present in the $PATH variable unless someone removes it, will allow all users to execute it from any location.\n\nA: For example let me assume, you have an executable myscript. You need to run it from a terminal as,\n/path/to/myscript\n\nUser level Change\nIf you  add the PATH of that executable to ~/.bashrc, you can run the executable with name only from anywhere (Avinash Raj already mentioned), as \nmyscript\n\nBut the change will be affected in user level. That means if you have any other user(s) they could not access the executable with name only.

Here's what I came up with. \ndate -d @$(shuf -i \"0-$(date +%s)\" -n 1) +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S\n\nWorking from the inside-out:\n\n\n*\n\n*date +%s gets the current date as a Unix timestring (seconds into the Epoc, since 1970)\n\n*shuf uses that as an upper bound for a random number from 0\n\n*date converts that back into something we can use.\n\n\nThen there's the setting the mtime on a file. Thankfully touch makes this really simple:\ntouch -mt <[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]> <filename>\n\nSo we just need to loop over files and chain these two together:\nfind -type f -exec sh -c 'touch -m -t $(date -d @$(shuf -i \"0-$(date +%s)\" -n 1) +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S) \"{}\"' \\;\n\nThere's a bit of padding in there to stop the date being randomly generated outside the loop but this does work:\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 oli oli 0 Jan  4  2012 1\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 oli oli 0 Jan 28  2009 2\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 oli oli 0 Jun  8  1984 3\n\n\nA: In case anyone runs into this, this command works for me to set a random date from 1st January 1970 to 28th December of last year:\ntouch -m -t $(date -d \"$((RANDOM%$(($(date +\"%Y\") - 1970 - 1))+1970))-$((RANDOM%12+1))-$((RANDOM%28+1)) $((RANDOM%23+1)):$((RANDOM%59+1)):$((RANDOM%59+1))\" '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n\nIt is not perfect (doesn't generate a day higher than 28 or this years' dates), but should be good enough for most cases.\nInspired by https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/random-date-generator-784598/\n", "Q: Ubuntu on ARM platform PC I have read that Ubuntu runs on ARM computers, but where are they then?

For example I need kind of terminal command which search for only executable files.\n\nA: This should do what you want:  \nfind . -perm -u+x -type f  \n\nIf you want to find everything that could possibly be executable, you could look at mime-types or file output.  That would be counter-productive though since you couldn't possibly catch every script.  \nReferences:\nThe man page\nStackoverflow \n\nA: This also works,\nfind ~ -type f -executable\n\nList all executable files inside your /home/$USER directory.\nFrom man find\n-executable\n          Matches files which are executable  and  directories  which  are\n          searchable  (in  a file name resolution sense).  This takes into\n          account access control lists  and  other  permissions  artefacts\n          which  the  -perm  test  ignores.   This  test  makes use of the\n          access(2) system call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which\n          do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems implement\n          access(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use  of  the\n          UID  mapping  information held on the server.  Because this test\n          is based only on the result of the access(2) system call,  there\n          is  no  guarantee  that  a file for which this test succeeds can\n          actually be executed.\n\n", "Q: Can't boot Windows or see Windows partitions after Ubuntu installation I downloaded and installed Ubuntu 13 (32 bit) using the Install alongside Windows 8 option.

If you need to recover personal data files, your only hope at this point is a tool like PhotoRec, which scans a disk for signs of files and extracts them to another disk. If this is your need, stop using the disk immediately!!! Every second you use the computer as it is now, the odds of it overwriting an old file goes up. Boot using an emergency disk (on CD-R or USB flash drive) and do your recovery from there. Note that there are Windows tools that are similar to PhotoRec and that may do a better job than PhotoRec for recovering files from NTFS, but I don't happen to know what they are, so I can't point you to them. Asking on a Windows forum may be helpful. If you have lots of money and your data are particularly valuable, there are professional data-recovery services available. I don't happen to have any specific recommendations, though.\nIf you don't need to recover personal data files, your best bet is to shrink your Linux partition and re-install Windows. If the computer came with Windows pre-installed, you may need to pay the manufacturer or Microsoft for recovery discs, although this page offers some suggestions about legal downloads of Windows 8, so you could check those options first.\nMoving forward, let this be a lesson on the importance of keeping backups.\n", "Q: Unable to generate core dump after apport disable Hi I'm currently programming c++ on Ubuntu and am unable to generate a core dump with a segmentation fault. I just get \"Segementation fault\" and not the (core dump) I have set ulimit -c unlimited.\nI used to be able to generate core dumps but sometime ago they stopped coming. Maybe this is because I disabled apport because of this bug \"Sorry, Ubuntu 12.04 has experienced an internal error.\".\nSo I was wondering what other steps are there to enabling core dumps after ulimit -c unlimited?\n\nA: Coredumps have to be enabled in the kernel in\n/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern\n\nwhich can be set by\nsysctl kernel.core_pattern=$coredump_name\n\ne.g.\nsysctl kernel.core_pattern=core\nsysctl kernel.core_pattern=/var/crash/%E.%p.%t.%s\n\n\n*\n\n*%E gives the full pathname of the crashed program (with / replaced by !)\n\n*%p gives the process ID of the crashed program\n\n*%t gives the epoch timestamp\n\n*%s gives the terminating signal number\n\nFull details are in man 5 core.\nThe kernel's default is core, but it may be set to something else (or disabled) at boot time, using /etc/sysctl.conf or /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf or similar. If you have the latter, then simply add a new file with a name that sorts after the others (perhaps starting with z); if not then edit the existing file. In that file put the parameter to the sysctl command above, e.g.\nkernel.core_pattern=core\n\n", "Q: Listen to pulseaudio rtp stream using VLC I want to listen to Pulseaudio's RTP multicast stream using VLC, but it's not working out.\nFirst, I try to determine where it's playing:\ntcpdump -n net 192.0.0.0/8 -c 10\n\nWhich gives me\n\nlistening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes\n13:38:07.637528 IP 192.168.1.3.53918 > 224.0.0.56.46504: UDP, length 1292\n13:38:07.645170 IP 192.168.1.3.53918 > 224.0.0.56.46504: UDP, length 1292\n13:38:07.651897 IP 192.168.1.3.53918 > 224.0.0.56.46504: UDP, length 1292\n13:38:07.662192 IP 192.168.1.3.53918 > 224.0.0.56.46504: UDP, length 1292\n13:38:07.662207 IP 192.168.1.3.53918 > 224.0.0.56.46504: UDP, length 1292\n13:38:07.669482 IP 192.168.1.3.53918 > 224.0.0.56.46504: UDP, length 1292\n\nSo then I try to play just about every possible combination:\n\nvlc rtp://@192.168.1.3\nvlc rtp://@224.0.0.56\nvlc rtp://@224.0.0.56.46504\n\nBut it just does nothing.

This is defined in something that we call Master Boot Record. In this case, you could go on with using GRUB since you have it installed, especially if you want to go on installing other operating systems in the future.\nThe other option is that you could switch to the Windows bootloader and rewrite the MBR because you won't be using anything other than Windows for the rest of your life.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to fix the broken GRUB, you need the prepare a GRUB Boot Repair USB.

(The computer is a little bit to old for fluent use of the Unity desktop).\nThanks a lot!\nEdit\nI switched to 13.10 - still I am wondering what the answer to this question is.\n\nA: Lubuntu 12.04 is an extra important version, because it's based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, which will receive security updates until April, 2017.\nFor the software that's specific for Lubuntu (the LXDE desktop as such), Lubuntu 12.04 receives no more updates. But for the software that Lubuntu shares with Ubuntu, by far the most, Lubuntu 12.04 will receive security updates until April, 2017 as well. Things like Firefox, Adobe Flash Player, Libre Office and the kernel.\nNormally I'm very much against running an operating system that doesn't receive updates anymore, but for Lubuntu 12.04 it's an acceptable small risk to keep using it until April, 2017.

My PC has been thrown into an Automatic Recovery loop, and nothing is working. The only option I have is to repair using a media disc, but I do not have one for Windows. If I select this option and use a disc that has Ubunutu on it, will it download properly/fix the problem/functionally run Ubuntu?\n\nA: You cannot repair a Windows boot issue with Ubuntu, because Ubuntu uses Grub2 and Windows uses it's own. Depending on the issue a Windows disc may not even be able to fix it. You will need a Windows installation disc that matches your Windows version (eg Windows 7 - Home Premium X86-64), or you will need to build a WinPE disc (which requires a functioning Windows installation to build on or maybe you could use wine?, and the version you want to build will depend on which version of Windows you are running). Long story short, you're pretty hooped. Sorry.\nIf you are desperate you could try building WinPE using wine (unlikely to work), but this tool is orientated towards experienced users, and even if the disc builds there no guarantee it can help you because it depends on the issue. WinPE cannot fix file issues, but it can fix bootloader issues. Bare minimum you can use WinPE to re-add the bootloader and create an entry for you Windows recovery partition. If you have Windows 8 then you will need to download WADK and build with it. If you have Windows 7 you will need WAIK instead. WinPE can only be used to install the Windows bootloader or add a boot entry. If you are having any other kind of a problem then an installation disc is needed. Re-installing the Windows bootloader will ovewrite grub on mbr systems and prevent you from booting Ubuntu.

This causes a few terminals to remain open while I don't really use them anymore, or I get confused which terminal was serving which purpose.\nI know I can label terminal tabs and such, but can I force a new terminal that is being openened, to become a new tab in a terminal screen (if there is one open already?) This way I always have them tabbed in a single terminal.\nEDIT\nOkay, so it's been a while and my linux mojo has improved a lot. So the current solution to this situation for me has been using tmux. It's a little more advanced than regular terminals and tabs but once I got the hang of it (about an hour of trying) I'm very pleased with the way of going about things. \nFirst of all, I made sure that whenever I opened a terminal using ctrl-alt-t, it would open tmux by default. This can be achieved by adding the following line in your .bashrc file after all the aliases:\n[[ $TERM != \"screen\" ]] && exec 'tmux\n\nNow everytime you spawn a terminal using ctrl-alt-t you will be presented with a tmux.\nTo make sure you only have one terminal open at the same time I did the following:\nFirst of all, you can reattach a session in tmux by running tmux attach -d. This will disconnect all other clients connected to this session. This works fine if you are the only person using the sessions.\nBut, if you don't have a session running it will say it did not find any sessions. Ergo, you need something like if(nosession) { tmux } else { tmux attach -d }. To do this create of append to your ~/.tmux.conf file the following line:\n#if run as \"tmux attach\", create a session if one does not already exist\nnew-session -n $HOST\n\n(Thanks to this post)\nIn my .bashrc file, I changed the line added previously to the following:\n[[ $TERM != \"screen\" ]] && exec 'tmux attach -d'\n\nWhat this does is detach all other clients from the tmux session. When you do this, all other terminals close. They close because this line also makes sure that when you open a terminal (ctrl-alt-t), it immediatly starts a tmux session.\nErgo, attach -d kills the other sessions. So this is the closest fix I could get and I'm rather happy with it! :)\nThe only thing I would still like is that when I press ctrl-alt-t it opens up my current session and also creates a new window. I haven't figured that out yet so feel free to help!\n\nA: Unfortunately opening new tabs in the existing gnome-terminal session has been a wanted feature for a several years now - see here.\nIt would be possible to hack something together, though.

I'm running a Plex Media Server, and while my current ISP is very lax on my bandwidth usage, I'm afraid that may be changing soon and want to be prepared.\nI've looked into both NTM (http://netramon.sourceforge.net/eng/index.html) and Trickle (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/trickle.1.html) but NTM appears to need a GUI to run and doesn't monitor on a per process basis and Trickle doesn't appear to allow total transfer caps, only upload/download speed limitations. All of the posts I've seen on Ask Ubuntu are related to these two applications.\nIs anyone aware of an application that will let me set a total monthly transfer limit, or any other way I could work this out?\n\nA: The 'tc' command should do what you want.\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/tc.8.html\n", "Q: Customizing the boot message?

I know I can manually check disk space, but it seems like a common problem to want to delete log files when disk space is low (for example) which is what I want to do.\n\nA: You can use df and a one-line shell script.\nFirst, we need to tell df to only print the percentage used:\ndf / --output='pcent'\n\nCombine this with grep to get only the number:\ndf / --output='pcent' | grep -o \"[0-9]*\"    \n\nThis will yield e.g. \"55\" if the disk has been filled by 55%.\nNow in the crontab, we can use it like this:\n@daily sh -c \"if [ $(df / --output='pcent' | grep -o \"[0-9]*\") -gt 90 ]; then docker system prune -af; fi\n\nIn this example, we run docker system prune -af if the disk has been filled by more than 90%. Adjust as needed.\n\nA: If you are not specifically concerned about your log files, you could put a script to check the disk space in the cron.\nAutomatically clearing old logs is what logrotate is for.\n", "Q: Can't install Phalcon extention on Ubuntu I'm trying to install Phalcon frameworks and I can't get this part done right\n\n\n  \n*Add the extension to your php.ini:\nextension=phalcon.so\n  \n*Finally, restart the webserver\n\nI've changed my php.ini file located at /etc/php5/apache2/ restart the apache server but the extension is not added when I test it through \n<?php print_r(get_loaded_extensions()); ?>\n\noutput\nArray\n(\n    [0] => Core\n    [1] => date\n    [2] => ereg\n    [3] => libxml\n    [4] => openssl\n    [5] => pcre\n    [6] => zlib\n    [7] => bcmath\n    [8] => bz2\n    [9] => calendar\n    [10] => ctype\n    [11] => dba\n    [12] => dom\n    [13] => hash\n    [14] => fileinfo\n    [15] => filter\n    [16] => ftp\n    [17] => gettext\n    [18] => SPL\n    [19] => iconv\n    [20] => mbstring\n    [21] => session\n    [22] => posix\n    [23] => Reflection\n    [24] => standard\n    [25] => shmop\n    [26] => SimpleXML\n    [27] => soap\n    [28] => sockets\n    [29] => Phar\n    [30] => exif\n    [31] => sysvmsg\n    [32] => sysvsem\n    [33] => sysvshm\n    [34] => tokenizer\n    [35] => wddx\n    [36] => xml\n    [37] => xmlreader\n    [38] => xmlwriter\n    [39] => zip\n    [40] => apache2handler\n    [41] => PDO\n    [42] => curl\n    [43] => gd\n    [44] => imagick\n    [45] => imap\n    [46] => intl\n    [47] => json\n    [48] => mcrypt\n    [49] => memcache\n    [50] => ming\n    [51] => mysql\n    [52] => mysqli\n    [53] => pdo_mysql\n    [54] => pdo_sqlite\n    [55] => pspell\n    [56] => readline\n    [57] => recode\n    [58] => snmp\n    [59] => sqlite3\n    [60] => tidy\n    [61] => xmlrpc\n    [62] => xsl\n    [63] => mhash\n    [64] => Zend OPcache\n)\n\nphalcon extension is nowhere.\nI even tried this.\n\nA: I did the setup via following these steps...\nsudo apt-get install php5-dev libpcre3-dev gcc make php5-mysql git-core autoconf\n\n### Do these in any folder you want\ngit clone --depth=1 git://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon.git\ncd cphalcon/build\nsudo ./install\n\n### Create the extension ini file in /etc/php5/mods-available    \necho 'extension=phalcon.so' | sudo tee -a /etc/php5/mods-available/phalcon.ini\ncd /etc/php5/mods-available    \nsudo php5enmod phalcon\n\n### Restart apache\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\n\nA: I worked through it, I used nginx + php-fpm instead, but the workflow should be the same.

This is illegal. This sort of thing can sometimes be fixed by my FixParts program, but in this specific case, I don't believe it will do the job except by deleting at least one partition. The reason is that, as FixParts does it, both /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3 must be primary partitions, and their ordering on the disk means that you can't have both of them be primary and have an extended partition that covers all the remaining partitions.\nIt's possible that a commercial Windows tool will be able to handle the job in one operation, but I can't make any specific recommendations on this score. It might be worth asking on a Windows forum, since this seems to be a Windows disk (all partitions are either FAT or NTFS).\nIf you must attempt a repair within Ubuntu, I'd do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up /dev/sda7.\n\n*Launch fixparts on the disk. It will probably present a solution with one or more partitions omitted (that is, that fixparts will delete when you save the table).\n\n*Use the fixparts options to juggle which partitions are omitted until only the current /dev/sda7 is omitted.\n\n*Save the partition table in fixparts.\n\n*Using fdisk, parted, or GParted, create a new partition in the space occupied by the current /dev/sda7.\n\n*Restore the backed-up data to /dev/sda7.\n\n\nAnother option is to try the repair using sfdisk. IIRC, this tool is more flexible than FixParts in its logical partition layout, so you might be able to make all the partitions from /dev/sda5 through /dev/sda8 (including /dev/sda3) logical. I can't promise that sfdisk will work, though; I might not be remembering its capabilities correctly.\n", "Q: QML ListView overwriten with buttons - but should be in different rows In below code I have 2 rows .\nIn first I have buttons and in second a ListView.

By default, when you add a repo (PPA or otherwise), two entries get created: one for the regular binary packages and one for the source code. For PPAs, the source code isn't directly downloadable through apt-get, so I personally have those entries disabled. For non-PPAs, it depends on the provider. You can remove these sources entries (labelled with \"(Source Code)\") without any major downside to the stability of the system; you just won't be able to download the sources as easily. You could also remove unchecked non-source entries, since apt-get and other frontends effectively consider those as non-existant.\n\n*Don't disable the universe repo unless you have a very good reason. While the default Ubuntu installation doesn't use anything from this repo (to the best of my knowledge), there are tons of software in this repo that you can easily install (as compared to downloading from the website). There's a good chance that you are using software from this repo, and disabling this repo would disable updates to the programs you are using. For example, the Chromium browser and KDE packages are in the universe repo. The XFCE terminal (which should be included in Xubuntu) is in the universe repo.\n\n*The Spotify example you listed isn't exactly a duplicate entry (one is for the binary packages and the other is for the source packages), but there are source code duplicates for the webupd8team/java PPA that you can (and should) remove.\n", "Q: Virtual box 4.3 error not support 64 bit?

I am fairly certain that my Ubuntu 13.10 laptop is infected with some sort of malware. \nEvery once in a while, I find a process /lib/sshd (owned by root) running and consuming lots of cpu. It is not the sshd server which runs /usr/sbin/sshd. \nThe binary has --wxrw-rwt permissions and it generates and spawns scripts in the /lib directory. A recent one is named 13959730401387633604 and it does the following \n#!/bin/sh\nexec 1>/dev/null\nexec 2>/dev/null\nuseradd -g 0 -u 0 -o gusr\necho gusr:chaonimabi123456123 | chpasswd\n\nThe gusr user was created by the malware independently, and then the chpasswd hangs while consuming 100% cpu. \nSo far, I've identified that the gusr user was additionally added to files in /etc/\n/etc/group\n/etc/gshadow\n/etc/passwd\n/etc/shadow\n/etc/subgid\n/etc/subuid\n\nIt seems like the malware made copies of all these files with the \"-\" suffix.

I disabled it and put up denyhosts. \nThe login was from 59.188.247.236, somewhere in Hong Kong apparently. \nI got the laptop from EmperorLinux, and they enabled root access. If you have one of those and you're running sshd beware.\n\nA: First, get that machine off the network now!  \nSecond, why did you have the root account enabled? You really shouldn't enable the root account unless you have a very good reason to do so.  \nThirdly, yes, the only way to be sure you're clean is to do a clean install. It's also advised that you start fresh and don't go back to a backup, as you can never be sure when it all started.\nI also suggest that you set up a a firewall in your next install and deny all incoming connections:  \nsudo ufw default deny incoming\n\nand then allow ssh with:  \nsudo ufw allow ssh\n\nand DON'T enable the root account!

Distribution mode allows you to install packages and add files, but it doesn't save user configuration information. Backup mode saves everything including user configuration changes. The reason your settings aren't there is because they are not system wide, they are user specific, and as such will only appear in your user account. Since settings are done on a per user basis any new user accounts will also get the applications default settings rather than your user's settings. Remastersys cannot help you accomplish your goal because it doesn't alter an applications default settings. \nThe closest thing you can do would be create a backup so that the pre-included user account on the disc will have settings saved, but as mentioned before newly created additional accounts won't as they get the applications default settings.\n\nA: simple , \ncreate a new user acount , and customize it , (or use your own .....)\nnext  make sure no user data is in your home account , use bleachbit \nhttp://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/download/linux\nplease check if there are no documents , movies , music left in your home folder , if so backup them and delete them in your home folder. \nnow copy with sudo premissions your home folder incl all hidden files , to /etc/skel/\nthen create a new user account and login to that account to see if all your settings are there. \nis so , your good to go , run remastersys or relinux , both work fine. \nbest way to use remastersys is from commandline , sudo remastersys dist cdfs\nat finish of that command , sudo remastersys dist iso nameofyourdist.iso\n", "Q: Is there any way to set the display scaling back to default other than from the display settings dialog?

There is a workaround to move the lower part on top. For this, go to System settings -> Display and then right-click on the window bar on top and click on \"Move\". Do not move your mouse after clicking on \"Move\", otherwise the keyboard is not used for moving, only the mouse has the control for moving the window.\n\nand then use your keyboard to move the window to top, slowing showing you the lower part where you drag your mouse to reset the scale to 1.

Below is my current mouse and headset, and the keyboard and new mouse I plan on eventually getting.\nCurrently, I have a Logitech G35 headset and a Logitech M510 mouse. I also plan on getting a Corsair K95 keyboard, and a SteelSeries Sensei mouse.\nMy main problem at the moment is that Logitech doesn't support Linux. The mouse works fine without SetPoint, it's configuration software, but offers advanced features. A replacement program for it or a way to get SetPoint working on Linux would be appreciated, but not required. As for the G35 headset, it makes use of the Logitech Gaming Software, which provides surround sound and extra features. I honestly don't need the extra feature, but it's appreciated. However, once I buy the keyboard and new mouse, replacement programs or versions that work on Linux are necessary due to the features.\nSo, to sum it up, my main problem is lack of driver support for my current devices, and in want to know if there's software I can use to fix my predicament that I might have missed when I looked. Alternatively, how many of these can I successfully run on WINE and get the expected function?\nI already asked this question on Reddit, and got one answer and a prompt to ask here, so I'm asking just in case they missed anything.\n\nA: You may want to reconsider your approach on using Ubuntu as your main OS. Ubuntu is an Open Source OS based on Debian. This makes it depend on voluntary free contributions from developers all around the world. \n\nIt is us not them who build the OS.\n\nDrivers are often provided for free from the manufacturers of hardware but sadly not all manufacturers contribute with Open Source software to support their devices. Then they may have a closed source proprietary driver or additional software available, but some manufacturers decide to not support Ubuntu. It is my strong believe that we then should in return not support these manufacturers by simply not buying their products.\n\nIf you are not happy with this approach then Ubuntu/Linux is not the right place for you. You should pay for a closed source OS where you can expect that all of your drivers and software should work without issues.\n\nAs a rule of thumb brand-new hardware will always take some time until we can provide drivers to make them work. Do not expect the community to be able to support hardware at the time of release. This is even more so after the manufacturer made a great secret on  specifications, hence making the development of drivers and tools almost impossible.\nAfter a while however most devices will be supported. You may then also find, that older devices will have a much longer support span than offered from a proprietary OS. Many people needed to switch from XP to Ubuntu just because later Windows versions did no longer support their hardwares.\nTo be able to use Ubuntu without frustration we should therefore search communtiy places for issues and solutions before we buy hardware. We will see that most hardware is supported out of the box, i.e. no drivers are needed to have it working, just plug them in. This too is different to another OS. Other hardware may need some tweaks to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logitech k350 keyboard and m510 mouse not working unless I unplug and replug dongle 20 times\n\n*Logitech USB headset not working on 12.04\nPlease also note that while having support for a device this does not always mean that all fancy special secret features will work the same as they do on Windows. But then this entirely is the responsibility of the manufacturers.\n\nStay with Windows if you need any such device or feature fully supported.\n\nFor example I still have a copy of Windows running in a virtual machine because the Canon printer I had left over from when I was still running on Windows will not let me print on photo paper or CDs in a way only remotely as comfortable as it does from Windows.\n\nA: For keybindings, you can download xbindkeys (similar process to the answer to this question).  As far as the headset, I have a G930 and i use Debian Linux.  It registers as two devices, one as a stereo headset and the other as a 5.1 surround sound.  Both modes work perfectly in Linux.  It is true that Logitech provides no driver support on Linux, but as I type this post on my G710+ keyboard, listening to Pithos on my Logitech G930 headset, and clicking \"Post Your Answer\" on my G600 mouse, I couldn't be happier with the way my components work in Linux.\n", "Q: Change default downloader in Firefox or Chromium I want to download all types of file with Firefox or Chromium web browser directly with a downloader without copying and pasting the link.\n\nA: i'm using internet download manager in windows, and can't say it works on ubuntu or not (for example under wine), but here you can find recomendations about download managers in ubuntu IDM-Like softwares in ubuntu\n\nA: I realize this is old, but anyway:\nIn Firefox there are different solutions:\n\n*\n\n*Install DownThemAll addon.\nTo be sure it appears as an option in the Save as dialog: go to the addon's options and check that\n\nTo improve speed maximize the number of connections in preferences (now up to 10 connections per download):\n\nThen when downloading select one of the DTA options in that dialog:\n\n\n*\n\n*To set a custom downloader in Firefox, install Flashgot addon Then, in the addon's preferences add the custom downloader (General>'Add').

Android had a concept of Intents by which you can launch the system apps using your own apps. Does Ubuntu touch have any options like that? If so how can one do it?\n\nA: From simple QML apps, you can't launch an external application (the Ubuntu SDK will probably support this feature in the future though).\nTo start a system application, your Touch application must be using some C++ code an then rely on QProcess.\nRegarding communication between apps, again using C++ you could use QDBus.\n", "Q: Why ubuntu is not detecting my AMD Radeon graphics?

For this:- \n\n\n*\n\n*Note that you must install your graphic driver only after completely updating your OS. Therefore you must first Updte your OS. \n\n*Then, go to this site . You can find the right driver for your graphic card there by specifying the right options in the list boxes in the site. If you cant find the right driver, then you can install that auto detect software found in the same site in your Windows OS, know your graphic card details  and then come back to Ubuntu and get the right driver.\n\n*Next most importantly check out the the release notes of the driver you are going to install. Check if your OS meets all the system requirements of the driver as specified in the release notes. \n\n*Then follow the installer notes to successfully install your driver.\n\n\nIf you run into problems(ie if unity desktop doesnt open or if you have a similar problem) after installing the driver it might mean that you have installed an unsupported driver. So start a tty session by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 . There type the following:\nsudo aticonfig --uninstall\n\nThis should delete the driver you installed. Then type:\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nThis should reboot your computer and now Unity would open so that you can now follow the process all over again to find the right driver and install it.\n\nA: you can download ati/amd proprietary fglrx graphics driver, but be careful with installation, you'r system may become crashed, here is download link http://support.amd.com/en-us/download (at right you will see linux (32&64)), but please read users reviews about installation and compatibility at ubuntu forums :) hope it was helpful\n", "Q: Help running World of Warcraft in Ubuntu 13.10 I'e been trying to play world of Warcraft on Ubuntu.

I know that when I install a program from source is possible to make it run in terminal only by typing its name using these two ways\n\n\n*\n\n*copy executable file from home directory to /usr/local/bin.\n\n*add its path to the PATH in ~/.bashrc file.\n\n\nWhich file (or better to say which type of file) from home directory I should add to /usr/local/bin? Please do not tell me just executable! I saw a lot of executable files in my home/myprogram directory with this command:\nfind . -perm -u+x -type f\n\nfrom How to find executables. Also there is a file named myprogram. Should I add this to /usr/local/bin?\n\nA: Whatever you try to do or to archive, please try as much as possible to not add your executable files in a system directory like /usr/local/bin. This can be unpleasant for other users who use the same system.\nYou can put your executable files in your ~/bin directory. If you don't have already one, create it:\nmkdir -p ~/bin\n\nThis directory is already added to your PATH as you can see in the last lines from your ~/.profile file. So, any executable that you put there can be run only by typing it's name.\nAnd which file to add? - Any file you want, nobody (other than you) and nothing will be disturbed because of this.\nIn case of a program installed from sources you better create a symbolic link to the executable file which starts the program, instead to copy the executable file:\nln -s /path/to/program/executable_file ~/bin\n\n", "Q: How to check installed program version? How can I check installed program versions in terminal.

Usually \napplication_name --version\n\nor\napplication_name -version\n\ncan be used to know it. It is better to see man application_name and search which is the command line switch to know the version.\nIf you installed any package using apt, to see the version you can try \napt-cache policy package_name\n\nIn few cases the version can be found in application_name --help.

Seems like Ubuntu is the best OS but the lack of big games is unfortunate. Does anyone got a walkthrough on getting Titanfall specifically up and running on Ubuntu with an Nvidia card?\n\nA: It will most probably not work\nLike many games, Titanfall was programed for Windows. While someone has tried and succeeded to install with Wine he wasn't able to start it. The situation might have improved since then... or not.\nSetting up and configuring wine for a game isn't for the faint at heart. It's much easier using PlayOnLinux, but I think this won't matter much in this case.\nPersonal Note\nI play games on Linux all the time, but I stick to the stuff Steam supporting under Linux. For the rest I keep a Windows 7 installation around.\n\nA: Use lutris, https://lutris.net/ I've personally used it successfully. they have good forums and the community is quick to respond, just remember that dxvk with WINE is a new technology and is improving so don't go into it with expectations that non-native software will work perfectly. Also as you are emulating windows some problems on windows can come with programs to, just follow the instructions.\nOne more thing, install wine with sudo apt-get install wine-stable in a terminal, it's just easier. And install the nvidia drivers with software and updates in additional drivers and install the recommended driver. Hope you understand, and google is your friend.\n\nA: download wine, it allows you to run all windows binaries i.e programs games,you can download wine through Ubuntu Software Center. Or you can play this game on Play on Linux also available in software center.\nor visit wine HQ for more details\n", "Q: On what partition is Ubuntu installed?

Is there any way of adding any Windows partition to Ubuntu after installing it to the system?\nI've also tried doing it by deleting it first from Windows and then trying to use that free space to make a ext4 partition in Ubuntu, but the same problem appears!\n\nA: You've probably run into a rounding error -- the partitioning tool tried to align a partition to a 1MiB boundary and that ended up causing it to overlap with a preceding or following partition. The simplest way around this problem is to leave a small gap (~1MiB) before and/or after the partition you're creating.\n\nA: do not use disks to manage partitions. rather use gparted. install gparted from software center and use that to make your partitions. it will not generate errors. you can create an ext4 as well as an ntfs partition. ext4 is only accessible in ubuntu whereas ntfs will be accessible by both windows and ubuntu.\n", "Q: Cairo dock workspace switcher and weblet dissapear on minimize Today I discovered that there is a keyboard shortcut (by default) for minimizing windows in Ubuntu 12.04.

You messed up Ubuntu installation. You have leftover Mint files in your Ubuntu partition. It can't be repaired because nobody know what exactly was left. \nReinstall your Ubuntu, don't forget to either format root partitions or remove all folders that are not cleanly your own from it. \n", "Q: unnecessary accounts in ubuntu It is recommended in hardening process that remove unnecessary accounts.\nWhat security problem exist with unnecessary user account?\nAre there recommended user accounts that should be removed?\n\nA: What it means is that if there are more accounts than are needed (or old accounts) anyone with access to those old accounts can get in and potentially cause harm to the system.  Removing user accounts limits points of access to the system, making it more secure.  Any user account that hasn't been used in 30 days should be removed from the system.  The exception being root, obviously.\n\nA: As with any system, an extraneous account is only a problem if the following conditions are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can access be gained to that user?\n\n*Even if you could become that user, could you do anything else?\n\n\nThere are plenty of user accounts around the system (less /etc/passwd) but plenty of them can't be accessed without sudo access at the least. Look at /etc/shadow for the accounts that can directly be logged into. The second vector into these accounts is exploit. What are these accounts running? Assume exploits exist. This is just part of the standard service analysis you'll be doing as part of your hardening.\nSo assume any account with services or a login can be broken into... What can that account access? I've been working on this in a separate question/answer. Are there services this user can talk to that other can't? Is that a problem?\nIt's at that point you realise the enormity of the task. You might think having too many users is a problem, but having single user accounts with too much individual access is just as much of an issue, if not more.\nUnless you're willing to chase down every permission on every user, I would settle for trusting most of the Ubuntu/Debian defaults and just follow decent security procedures where they count... Like SSH where the defaults aren't great.\n", "Q: How do I initialize webcams without signing in to an X session? I'm attempting to use OpenCV for a robotics project, and I'd like to be able to capture from the webcam without having to log in to an X session on the host. Currently I have to sign in through the GUI login screen before any webcam will respond. For example, when I am using ssh with X forwarding and start cheese, it will say \"No device found,\" until I sign in on the host at which point launching cheese will stream the video as expected.\nI'm relatively inexperienced in Linux and I'm hoping there's some kind of startup script I can create that will initialize the webcam without logging in.\n\nA: I was able to start the webcam remotely by using sudo. Not sure why that was required but it's good enough for my purposes.\n\nA: There is uvc subsystem for this and uvcviewer application. Unfortunately, it does not support all webcams.

Until data wasn't lost I could login and use OS as normal and access my home folder without entering any passphrase because it was automounted at login.\nNow I want to access my home folder just by entering the login password as I always did when logging in.But I cant login anymore..\nSo how to access my home folder only knowing the login password?\nIn reply to Jo-Erlend Schinstad:\n\nMy situation is I cant login anymore because several system files have\n  been corrupted due to usb problems.So I must use another OS\n  and because I don't know my mount passphrase I must somehow access\n  valuable files knowing only my login password.\n\n\nA: \nseveral system files have been corrupted due to usb problems\n\nThis may or may not be a significant problem for you.\nTo decrypt the contents of an encrypted home, Ubuntu normally needs not only the login password but also a \"mount passphrase\" - a secret, long secure string that was probably generated automatically for you at the time of setting up your encrypted home.\nIf your system can boot normally it will already have the mount passphrase in a \"wrapped\" format stored on the drive, and will only need your login password to complete the decryption.  However if your system becomes corrupted and you need to recover files from another OS (such as a Live CD) then you will need this mount passphrase as well as your login password.  So if this mount passphrase is part of your system that has become corrupt, and you didn't take a backup of it, you may be completely out of luck.\nNonetheless, it's possible that the wrapped version of the passphrase may still be on your drive somewhere an will have survived corruption, in which case you're in luck.\nThis page details how to recover files on an encrypted home from an Ubuntu Live CD.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/116297/how-to-recover-an-encrypted-home-directory-on-ubuntu/\nIt involves using a helper tool:\nsudo ecryptfs-recover-private\n\nThis will try to find all the encrypted home directories on the system and their corresponding wrapped mount passphrases.  If it does, all you will need to decrypt them will then be your login password.\nIf it doesn't find a surviving wrapped mount passphrase, and you don't have a backup of it, you are likely to be out of luck.\nIt it does work, it will temporarily mount the decrypted contents into a mount point inside /tmp.  Then you should copy the decrypted files from there onto another device.  See the whole article for more information.\n\nNote: to anybody wanting avoid this problem, if you set up an encrypted home directory make sure you save a backup of the mount passphrase somewhere.  You may be prompted to do this when you first set up the encrypted home, but if not you can access it later - after you've successfully logged in - with the command ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase.  This will only work if you've logged in normally on the system - that is, it won't work when you need to recover as in this OP's situation.\n", "Q: Flash drive problem on USB 3.0 port I bought USB 3.0 flash drive Kingston DT R3.0 (http://usb.userbenchmark.com/Kingston-DataTraveler-R30-USB-30-16GB/Rating/1435&tab=Review), but when I connected the drive to USB 3 port on my laptop i doesn't work properly.

I was searching from a long time for this, but didn't find any adequate answers. \nIt is about the time duration of converted mp3s with ffmpeg or avconv. I'm using Download helper in Firefox to download and even convert any video file to mp3.. Everything is going fine except the duration time of the mp3s in any music player (i tried audacious, qmmp)... When I convert a video which is 3mins long in the player it shows around 18mins long. Another thing i noticed is the wrong bitrate. It shows something around 32kbps, but i'm using 192kbps when i convert the file... \nI tried VLC which i use for video files and it shows the time correctly, but the bitrate in the codec section is also showing 32kbps. I noticed at first when i open the file with VLC is little kinda buffering the time but at last it shows it correctly.\nAnother thing I tried is the command ffmpeg -i file.mp3 which also shows the correct time duration and bitrate.\nThe strange fact is when i export the same converted file with audacity without change anything it correctly appears in audacious with the correct time duration.

I was just wondering what \"Vi\" means in Linux (the command used for editing files)?\n\nA: Wikipedia has a concise and properly cited explanation:\n\nThe name vi is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation for the command visual in ex; the command in question switches the line editor ex to visual mode.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi\nNote that this does not mean that the full name of the text editor \"vi\" is still \"visual\" or, even, that \"vi\" currently stands for \"visual\" - the name of the editor is just \"vi\".  The above quote just explains how the name originally came into being.\nAs Ben Voigt helpfully points out, the people (and websites) claiming that it stands for \"Visual Instrument\" are confusing it with another product unrelated to the text editor.\n\nA: Vi is a screen editor for Linux, Unix and other Unix-like operating systems. Pronounced (vee-aye). Stands for VIsual.\nSources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi and http://www.techopedia.com/definition/10347/vi\n\nA: If one goes back and looks at an old man page for vi, such as the one for SunOS 5.10 from '07:\n\nSunOS 5.10          Last change: 16 May 2007                    1\n\nUser Commands                                               vi(1)\n\n     The vi (visual) utility is a  display-oriented  text  editor\n     based on an underlying line editor ex. It is possible to use\n     the command mode of ex from within vi and to use the command\n     mode of vi from within ex. The visual commands are described\n     on this manual page; how to set options (like  automatically\n     numbering lines and automatically starting a new output line\n     when you type carriage return) and all ex line  editor  com-\n     mands are described on the ex(1) manual page.\n\n\nOr from Ultrix (latest release '95):\n\nName\n       vi - screen editor\n\nSyntax\n       vi [ -t tag ] [ +command ] [ -l ] [ -r ] [ -wn ] [ -x ] name...\n\nDescription\n       The (visual) editor is a display-oriented text editor based on The com\n       mand and the command run the same code.  You  can  access  the  command\n       mode of from within\n\nAnd thus you have it: vi is from vi‍sual.  This matches the pattern its ancestor editors: ex is the ex‍tended editor and ed is an ed‍itor.\nThere is no indication that this stands for anything else.  Maybe V‍isual I‍nterface (what I learned it as back long ago), but there is no documentation that it stands for anything other than vi‍sual.\n\nA: Vi just stands for Visual, as in Visual Editor.

While installing it showed the partition menu, and I selected some options that were told to me by Ubuntu users on Ask Ubuntu.

Is the data gone?\nI have a 64-bit OS.\n\nA: Unfortunately, your data is most likely gone. Most likely your data drive was reformatted as a home for Ubuntu. This means that the actual Ubuntu installation could have been placed on top of other data, rendering at least some of it irrecoverable.\nThere is some limited good news however. There are a number of different programs that can be used to recover data. The Ubuntu DataRecovery Community Page should be a good start to recovering what can be recovered.\nA final bit of warning if you choose to recover the data. Avoid using your newly installed Linux, as writes to that partition will possibly minimize the chance of successful recovery.\n", "Q: Data recovery from erased external HDD NTFS partion I have erased my 1TB NTFS external HDD using Startup disk Creator accidentally. Is there any possibility I can get back my data.\n\nA: Probably the most powerful recovery software for most tasks is Testdisk which is free and open source and can be found in Ubuntu's software catalog, but can also be run from Windows or Mac as well.\nIts interface is relatively complex but its recovery is top-notch - in case of accidental formatting or destroying of a partition you probably want to use one of its advanced modes where it can recognise a destroyed partition:\nThis is the exact procedure to follow for doing this for an NTFS partition.\nTeskdisk's \"simple\" mode will use a more naive recovery type that doesn't necessarily take the partition format into account and therefore doesn't necessarily recover fragmented files or certain file types, or get the folder structure.  So you want to follow this NTFS based advanced recovery if it works for you as it will be much better.\nIf too much of the NTFS structure such as the master file table are corrupted or missing, then you may not be able to recover with this method and you may need to use the more naive methods in Testdisk (or as recommended in their documentation, use photorec, also open source).  Hopefully you don't need to resort to this as it can be very patchy to recover based on file signatures.\n\nA: I used \"power data recovery\".

Now I can't start Windows, but Ubuntu works pretty great. \nInitially I could view the other Windows partitions in Nautilus (C:, D:, etc.) and I could view the files in them. (I never tried accessing any, :( ). But now only Home and File System are shown in nautilus. I ran this command: \nsudo lsblk -o NAME,SIZE\n\nand it shows all the partitions correctly. So this means they exist. How do I get them to show up in nautilus? I really need to access some of the files until i get windows up and running( Which might take a while...). Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: You can install PCMANFM, and use it as your fav file manager to browse all your partitions.

it's trying to create  log somewhere where you have no write access. If so, you should also be able to get it to work using an absolute path:\nadb logcat > /home/username/log\n\n", "Q: Change default user folder paths in Xubuntu How do I change default user folders location in Xubuntu?  I have a Dropbox, and I keep all my documents and music on it.  I want to set it up so that by default all my documents and music in /home/sam/dropbox/Documents and /home/sam/dropbox/Music.\n\nA: In principle, it is very simple: move the Documents folder and the Music folder to your Dropbox folder. However, some applications will assume the folders exist in ~/home, so you should create links in your home folder to the \"real\" folders.\nyou do that by the command:\nln -s ~/Dropbox/Documents ~/Documents\n\nand\nln -s ~/Dropbox/Music ~/Music\n\n(after you moved the folders to the Dropbox folder)\nThese links act as if they are actual folders, but the files will be stored in the Dropbox folder.\nIn my opinion, this would be the most elegant way. There is however a more drastic way to set the default paths to your user's directories:\nmousepad ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\n\nyou would see the contents of the file like:\n# This file is written by xdg-user-dirs-update\n# If you want to change or add directories, just edit the line you're\n# interested in. All local changes will be retained on the next run\n# Format is XDG_xxx_DIR=\"$HOME/yyy\", where yyy is a shell-escaped\n# homedir-relative path, or XDG_xxx_DIR=\"/yyy\", where /yyy is an\n# absolute path. No other format is supported.\n# \nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Bureaublad\"\nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\"\nXDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/Sjablonen\"\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME/Openbaar\"\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documenten\"\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$HOME/Muziek\"\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/Afbeeldingen\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/Video's\"\n\nI would suggest the first option, because it gives you what you describe, without changing default settings.\n\nA: alternately you can also set new folders bookmarks along with the existing folders. or edit the bookmarks. in 14.04 beta that i am using, it is in the menu bar. in 13.10, i remember it to be beside the search button in the settings.\n\n", "Q: Windows 8 / Ubuntu 13.10 in dual boot - how to make Grub by default to manage it good afternoon every.\nas it's said in the title, I have Windows 8 and Ubuntu on my laptop (EFI) and it boots automatically on Windows 8. To boot on Ubuntu, I have to change the boot order with the F9 key.\nit's annoying so I want Grub manage it, what must I do?\n\nA: You probably have Windows installed in EFI mode and Ubuntu/GRUB installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. If so, either of the following should fix the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager, boot it, and test its ability to boot both Windows and Ubuntu. If it works, boot to Ubuntu and install the Debian-package version of the program. This procedure will cause the computer to boot via rEFInd, bypassing GRUB.\n\n*Boot an Ubuntu live CD or USB flash drive in EFI mode and run the Boot Repair tool. This should fix the problem properly if you boot in EFI mode. If not, it may apply a hackish fix that might work, but could cause problems down the line.\n\n\nIf you try both of these solutions and neither works, post back with the URL that Boot Repair displays. If you prefer to determine if the assumption in my first sentence is correct before proceeding, run the Boot Info Script, post the RESULTS.txt file that it generates to a pastebin site, and post the URL to your document here.\n", "Q: New to the Ubuntu Game any one want to help me with an AMD install?

I disabled the Fast Startup option in Windows 8 and Secure Boot was also Turned Off as my Model doesn't support UEFI. Now I inserted the USB Stick with Ubuntu Installer and Selected 'Try Ubuntu Without Installing'.\nMy Problem is that the Ubuntu running from USB Stick does not recognize any one my existing partitions which I created using Windows 8. Further while installing Ubuntu 12.04, the Installer shows the entire space as Unknown type.\nAny help Regarding this problem would be much Appreciated. \n\n\nA: As per you screen shot, your drive is set as dynamic (see below disk0 in image).\nUnfortunately this dynamic disk and partition are only recognizable in windows OS.\nNot only ubuntu, no other OS will recognize the partition. Linux boot loaders can not be installed in dynamic disks.\nThe only way is to convert it basic driver. But for that you need to delete your existing partition. Thus deleting your data which may not be recoverable. \nAlternate solution is use ubuntu in virtual environment (using virtualbox, vmware)\nA ref link : How to convert dynamic disk to basic\n\nA: I can only speculate, but my 2 initial thoughts would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*You might have an unsupported storage controller. Try connecting a usb stick and see if it's partition table / filesystem is readable. Since the usb stick will be using the usb controller not the sata/ide/etc controller it might show up properly. It would be helpful to note if you are using any kind of pci storage controller like a raid card even it it's not running in raid mode. To find out use Windows and open \"control panel/system and security/administrative tools/computer management/system tools/device manager\". If the storage controller is just using the basic Windows driver then your device will probably also be supported by the Linux Kernel (Ubuntu), but if it's using something it might not be, or may require a driver to be installed. Keep in mind that if your computer is very new support may have been added in a more recent kernel release so your storage controller may be supported in Ubuntu 13.10 or 14.04.\n\n\nScreenshot Of Device Manager:\nhttps://copy.com/ojnY81nXBiVM\n\n\n*\n\n*You might be using a disk that has been formatted dynamically, but what you need is a basic disk. To find out use Windows and open \"control panel/system and security/administrative tools/computer management/storage/disk management\" and see if it lists the disk as \"Basic\" or \"Dynamic\". While an option to convert dynamic to basic is listed do not attempt it or Windows won't work anymore.\n\n\nScreenshot of Computer Management:\nhttps://copy.com/sEQZBHlaWw0P\nEDIT: your disk type is listed as dynamic.\n", "Q: Having trouble installing Ubuntu Phone SDK I've been trying to install Ubuntu Touch development software, and tried installing the packages by trying these two commands:\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa\n\nas well as\n    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk\n\nAfter it the shell prints a bunch of outputs, I get these two error messages:\n    E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily      unavailable)\n    E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nI also tried using this command with it:\n    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nbut to no avail.\nI am using a Samsung ATIV Book 7 740U3E laptop,  and am running Ubuntu through a live disk, which is loaded with Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander. Could the live disk be the problem? Do I need to fully install Ubuntu on my system for the SDK to work? Do I need to download anything else before the SDK and IDE? Is this normal? \n\nA: In your case, it seems that another process (another package manager) uses the dpkg lock file. Try to close the Software Center or Synaptic and try again.

I've been trying to change the ownership and permissions and discovered in my research that NTFS partitions aren't fully supported by Ubuntu's permissions software. If this is the case, what format should I change it to? I understand that will require moving everything off and back on, but I need ownership.\nThanks,\nTyler\n\nA: If you share a partition with Windows, you have no other choices than NTFS or FAT. Both do not support setting permissions like in Linux. ext3 or ext4 are not supported by Windows.\n\nA: you may try installing ext partitions reading utilities on windows and use a pendrive with ext4. but remember that you need to install those software on every pc that you want to access your pen drive\n\nA: \"NTFS partitions aren't fully supported by Ubuntu's permissions software\"\nNo, Windows does not support Linux filesystems. It is the other way around.\nIf you want to share between the 2 operating systems go for ntfs. Ubuntu will mount the partitions and let you read, write to and from it out of the box.\nThis image is 14.04 with windows 7.

I know this question has been asked many times before but every answer I found is from years ago, which none seemed to have worked for me, and I’m not sure if their even applicable to newer versions of the distros I've used.\nI don't have access to a cd burner and I can't order a disk with a specific distro installed, so this common answer is out of the question for me.\nI'm currently running on Windows 7 on an acer aspire.\nI've tried 5 distros (ubuntu, zorin, puppy, fedora and mint), same outcome in all of them.\nI’ve tried creating my live usb with unetbootin and pendrive, same outcome and I’ve checked MD5SUM, everything’s fine.\nI used 3 different usb sticks, an hp 10 gig, a sandisk 8 gig(i've read sandisk usb's have issues and I’ve tried the fixes for it, still nothing), and a 7 gig with a worn off label.  \nI've tried formatting these stick in FAT32, exFat, and ntfs (these are the only options I’m given when I format them) same outcome every time.\nI've tried with partitioning my system (with windows disk manager and again with gparted) and without partitioning anything, no change, and I cant even get to the point to let ubuntu's partitioner start up.\nI used the solution at Wont boot from USB, stops at SYSLINUX copyright and can't install with usb pen drive, SYSLINUX problem, same results. \nI have been able to get ubuntu to install using wubi but the 30 gig partition it does is nowhere near enough memory for me.\nI just want to be able to use my usb to install a distro, I’m not trying to make a persistent usb to carry all my data with it or anything like that.\nCan anybody tell me what I could try next, or what additional info I should try and give?\n\nA: have you tried using dd command. the usage is sudo dd if=< /path/to/your/iso > of= < /your/target/device >.\nlet me warn you firsthand, you can recover a partition accidentally deleted but, if you write your iso to the wrong drive using dd, you cannot recover the data from the overwritten partiion.. use it with caution. to find out which device you want to write on, type 'lsblk' in terminal. it will give you the list of devices. for example, if it says that /dev/sdb is 3.73 gb with a partition sdb1, with ubuntu.iso in your home folder, your command should be\nsudo dd if=/home/username/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdb\nif you want to reuse the pendrive, go to gparted and select your device correctly and in menu bar click device >> crate partition table. it will create a ms-dos partition table which is what we need. now, we can create partitions on it. click on new and then select ntfs and name it. i think you can understand the later steps.\n", "Q: Fans are always running Whenever I turn my laptop on my fans are running as if I was playing a game.

I tried the following small simple script:\n#!/bin/bash\n$1=\"bar\"\necho $1\n\nBut when I run ./script foo I get error and the value is not changed:\n/home/mika/script: line 2: foo=bar: command not found\nfoo\n\nI know $1 is the first argument you pass to your script. But even like this I want to change its value. \n\nA: You can't change those variables directly.  You could say:\nx=$1\necho $x\n\nThen you can use $x instead\nUsing $1=bar will immediately substitute the first parameter for $1, and you are essentially stating \"foo=bar\", and it is interpreted as a command \"foo\", not a variable \"foo\";\n\nA: Don't use use $1 for this, in bash, and other shells, $1 is the first argument you pass to your script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho $1\n\nIf you run the above as foo.sh hello, it will print hello since that is the 1st argument. Also, you refer to a variable as var and to a variable's contents as $var. So, to get the behavior you are expecting, just use another name for your variable and don't use a $:\n#!/bin/bash\nvar=\"bar\"\necho $var\n\n\nA: You can use the builtin set:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -- \"bar\"\necho $1\n\nSource and more about: Change a command line argument - bash.\n", "Q: Where can i ask to increase space quota for launchpad ppa?

PPAs are meant to have open-source software, where the sources are uploaded, and binaries are built on Launchpad's servers. If you want to use this software on your own computer, you don't need a PPA for this.\nI know for a fact that Android Studio is open-source, and gem5 is also open-source (although it has some closed-source parts), so one of your reasons is invalid.\nAnother reason source packages are built for each Ubuntu release is because there are different libraries and library version in each release, and so a binary that works on one release may or may not work on another release. Source packages are also built for each architecture because while an i386 application can technically run on amd64, it requires the use of i386 libraries, whereas an amd64 application only requires amd64 libraries (amd64 applications cannot be run on i386). In addition, different architectures have different \"defaults\" (an int may be 2 bytes instead of 4 bytes), and each application has to be built on each architecture to account for that.\n", "Q: format a flash drive to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) Is it even possible to do that on Ubuntu?

Apple provides mkfs and fsck for HFS+\n  with the Unix core of their operating system, Darwin.\nThis package is a port of Apple's tools for HFS+ filesystems.\nFor users, HFS+ seems to be a good compromise to carry files between MacOS X and Linux Machines, as HFS+ doesn't suffer the\n  problems of FAT32 like:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*huge space waste (in slack space as devices grow faster);\n  \n*bility to create files that are more than 4GB in size (especially good for those working with multimedia and that need to carry large\n  ISO files);\n  \n*ability to use case preserving (and even sensitivity!);\n  \n*ability to use uid's and gid's on the filesystem.

The problem arises from moisture in the circuit layer sheets of the keyboard.  That is great news, as it is really easy to fix with small screwdrivers and a soft cloth.  Here is how:\n\n*\n\n*Search Youtube or another source on how to properly disasemble your keyboard model.\n\n*You will find three clear sheets of circuitry under the keys. Be careful, as the sheets may be clipped together.  Don't rip them appart.  Also, avoid folding, scratching or stretching them.  You may need to remove all other components before being able to lift the sheets out.\n\n*Use a dry soft micro-fiber cloth or q-tips to dry any moist spots between the three sheets.  If there is a gooey or sticky substance, use only water to moist the cloth or q-tip to disolve it.  Be gentle. Avoid cleaning agents. Isopropyl alcohol may work, but I avoided it, fearing it could also disolve the circuitry lines.\n\n*Re-assemble your keboard. Enjoy... and don't let it get wet again.\n\n\nSide Note: Duplicate strokes on n/q, Backlash/Backspace, b/PgUp, and Period/LessThan indicate that the moisture is probably somewhere above the \"F2\" key in most Logitech whireless keyboards.\n\n", "Q: Libre office Calc - tables, numbers and formulas?

It would be a bonus to have instructions for that too.\nAfter 3 weeks of combing the web and seeing contradictory advice and approaches, I found this thread and links which look like the most promising and in depth analysis:\nLINK:askubuntu.com/questions/367254/how-to-upgrade-from-refit-to-refind\nI have no valuable contents in my current ubuntu partition, so I am planning on starting from scratch.  The current issues I am experiencing are:\n1) rEFIt shows a confusing population of \"bootable\" images despite there being one Mac and one linux partition;\n2) I believe I installed grub into my ubuntu partition, and it probably was a mistake; 3) when using ubuntu, sometimes the screen will dim and all interaction fails for ten or so seconds, then the screen will brighten again and interaction returns (BIOS issue?); 4) I attempted to remove the tiny partition at the end of disk multiple times, but it always returned (is this the HFS+ partition?).\nWhat must work when I finish the reinstall in both OSX and ubuntu:\n1) wireless network;\n2) speakers;\n3) camera;\n4) gpgpu;\n5) thunderbolt monitor and network support;\n6) suspend/resume with all devices restored;\n7) with ubuntu running, shut lid and have exterior apple icon light turn off;\nHere is my intended course of action:\n1) destroy all partitions except for the tiny first and last ones and the Mac partition;\n2) remove rEFIt or preempt it with rEFInd then remove rEFIt;\n3) recreate the two partitions (1. Windows 100G, 2. ubuntu 128G);\n4) boot into USB flash with non-MAC ubuntu 13.10.\n5) then perform installation.\nBut here are web-sites that conflict from which I need to choose instructions:\n1) LINK:www.betweendots.com/topic/28-how-to-install-ubuntu-on-a-macbook-pro-retina-2013/\n2) LINK:help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro11-1/Saucy avoiding grub;\n3) LINK:www.rodsbooks.com/refind/\n3.1) LINK:askubuntu.com/questions/367254/how-to-upgrade-from-refit-to-refind\n3.2) LINK:www.rodsbooks.com/linux-uefi/\n3.3) LINK:www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/\n3.4) LINK:www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/bootrepair.html\n3.5) LINK:www.rodsbooks.com/refind/\n3.6) LINK:www.rodsbooks.com/refind/bootmode.html\n3.7) LINK:www.rodsbooks.com/refind/using.html\nNumber 3 has a deep and careful analysis of rEFInd, part of which I have shown as links.\nIf you were to make an optimal dual boot on my machine, are there any other actions you would suggest?  Are there adjustments to the instructions you would make?\nI am a bit weak in configuration, and although I've done a lot of research, I feel I need a helping hand getting this just right.\nSo, here is the question.\nWhat is the exact sequence of steps to partition, EFI, and install ubuntu such that I avoid all those little gotchas that plagued me for the last few weeks?\n\nA: First, if you really meant Ubuntu 12.10, that version reaches end-of-life (EOL) status next month, according to this site. I therefore recommend updating to 13.10, or perhaps even 14.04 LTS (which is in beta-2 now, and will reach final release status next month).\n\nThe current issues I am experiencing are: 1) rEFIt shows a confusing population of \"bootable\" images despite there being one Mac and one linux partition\n\nThat's not much to go on. rEFIt shows a description when you highlight any given item, and those descriptions may provide clues about what each entry does. With that information, as well as observations of what happens when you select each entry, you may be able to figure out why there are so many entries and what you can do to remove unwanted ones. (Typically, removing an EFI boot manager file will remove its entry. If they're BIOS-mode entries and you're not booting anything in BIOS mode, you can disable BIOS-mode booting in rEFInd, but I believe not in rEFIt.)\n\n3) when using ubuntu, sometimes the screen will dim and all interaction fails for ten or so seconds, then the screen will brighten again and interaction returns (BIOS issue?)\n\nIn recent versions of Ubuntu, this can signal that the system is under heavy load -- a program may be chewing up a lot of CPU time, for instance. I'm not sure with what version this feature was introduced, though, so I'm not sure if it was present in 12.10.\n\nI attempted to remove the tiny partition at the end of disk multiple times, but it always returned (is this the HFS+ partition?).\n\nPartitions vary from one computer to another, so your description is inadequate. If you want to discuss your partitioning scheme, include the output of a partitioning tool, such as gdisk, parted, or GParted. Sometimes the output of other commands can be useful, too, such as df -h or sudo blkid.\n\nWhat must work when I finish the reinstall in both OSX and ubuntu: 1) wireless network; 2) speakers; 3) camera; 4) gpgpu; 5) thunderbolt monitor and network support; 6) suspend/resume with all devices restored; 7) with ubuntu running, shut lid and have exterior apple icon light turn off;\n\nEach of these is an independent issue. You should ask separate questions about each one -- but be sure to search the site for similar questions first. I suspect that some of them have already been answered.\n\nHere is my intended course of action: 1) destroy all partitions except for the tiny first and last ones and the Mac partition\n\nWithout detailed information about your current partitions, I can't comment on the wisdom of that course of action.\n\nBut here are web-sites that conflict from which I need to choose instructions\n\nConflicting advice on different Web sites is the nature of the Internet. I'm the author of some of the pages you referenced (the ones under http://www.rodsbooks.com), so obviously I think they provide useful and accurate information. Note that just because two sites give conflicting advice doesn't mean that either of them is necessarily wrong; it's often possible to achieve a given goal in multiple ways, or one procedure might be optimal for one situation and another might work better for another situation.\n\nWhat is the exact sequence of steps to partition, EFI, and install ubuntu such that I avoid all those little gotchas that plagued me for the last few weeks?\n\nI'm afraid that I can't answer that question, and in fact, nobody can. You haven't really said what \"little gotchas\" are bothering you (unless perhaps you're referring to that list of unrelated things you said \"must work\" -- but those are post-installation issues that don't relate to installation procedures). What's more, you've presented insufficient detail about your current setup. To top it off, whether you know it or not, you're asking for a personalized set of installation instructions for your computer. Macs in particular tend to be quirky; what works on one model fails on the next. Thus, unless somebody has installed precisely the OSes you want to install on your exact model with your exact goals, any step-by-step solutions are likely to fall down somewhere along the line.\nI recommend you look over the sites to which you linked and do one (or both) of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Come back with more specific questions, such as \"will such-and-such a partitioning plan work?\" (with detailed existing partitioning information presented) or \"will such-and-such a set of boot loaders work?\"\n\n*Try to perform an installation and come back with questions about specific problems you encounter.\n\n\nI'm sorry if this isn't what you want to hear, but I'm afraid your questions are rather vague and open-ended.\n", "Q: Nvidia DVI/VGA problem I have a Nvidia GT 630 with two LG Flatron E2242 screens connected.

I'm thinking of keys such as those increasing or decreasing screen brightness; displaying all open windows; searching etc. These keys cover F1 to F12 on the keyboard.\nThank you.\n\nA: The Lenovo w540 has function keys are overloaded with 2 functions per key.  The way this works is they have either the \"standard\" F1-F12 mode or they have the alternate features of dimming the screen, increasing or decreasing the volume, etc. \nTo toggle between the modes you need to use the \"Fn\" key in the lower left hand corner of the keyboard.  For instance Fn+F5 (the Fn and F5 key at the same time) will dim the screen, or issue an F5 command (that refreshes the browser page).  \nThe Fn key can be locked (indicated by the green LED on the key) by hitting Fn+Esc keys at the same time.  Then the function keys will act as if the Fn key is pressed.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: In addition to Matt's answer, it should also be noted that the Fn and Ctrl key usage can be swapped in BIOS (see image below). This may have been set if the Fn key doesn't seem to behave as you may expect. It may also be very useful to know, as at least personally having Ctrl nearest the edge is more practical than having the Fn key there.\n\n\nA: Sadly it gets even more complicated than just the FnLk button. The volume mute and increase/decrease buttons correctly send XF86AudioMute, XF86AudioRaiseVolume, and XF86AudioLowerVolume. The brightness up and down keys send XF86MonBrightnessUp and XF86MonBrightnessUp, respectively. The wireless one (F8) looks like it correctly enables and disables my wireless, as well as sending XF86WLAN. The rest are more tricky.\nMic mute, the camera one (F7), and whatever F9 through F10 are all are on /dev/input/by-path/platform-thinkpad_acpi-event (a symbolic link to /dev/input/event5 on my system), instead of the normal keyboard (/dev/input/by-path/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd, a link to /dev/input/event3). I'm actively working on getting those five keys to work on my system, the code will live here once I'm done: https://github.com/AlexWillisson/tp-w540-keys I'm also documenting some of my work on getting parts of the W540 working on http://oldspeak.us/\nThere might be better ways to fix those keys, but I'm much more familiar with my code than with correctly configuring X devices.\nThe four buttons above the numpad are very strange, I'm not sure if I want to tackle them yet.\n", "Q: Rename new files as the old ones I have a large music collection, and a good number of playlists that I have formed over the years.\nAll the music is neatly organised in a folder hierarchy.\nI have managed to get my hands on higher quality versions of multiple albums, and would like to replace the low quality ones with these.

I am not talking about blur effect. When I set no blur then the Unity dash looks fully transparent. To reduce the load I want to disable the blur effect as well as set the opacity to 100. I am using Ubuntu 13.10 64bit.\n\nA: Not sure how useful this is, since you might not like your Dash to be black...\nSetting the Dash to no blur with the CompizConfig Settings Manager used to do this, but no longer. Using Unity Tweak you can make it opaque, but with the caveat that the Dash must be black. Selecting any other color will mean it's still transparent. \nTo install Unity Tweak, copy this into a terminal: sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\nOpen the program, and in the Unity section click on Launcher. Then move the transparency slider to the left, and select a custom color. While any color will make the launcher opaque, only black will allow the Dash itself to be opaque. \n\n", "Q: viewing ip address table of a belkin router I have two computers, each with their own respective internal ip address e.g. 192.168.x.xx.

I wanted to install Ubuntu 12.04 on this , but when I get to the install part, it does not show any free space available at all.\n\nA: From that freespace, you have to create a separate ext4 partition for Ubuntu.So that the installer will detect your ext4 partition after choosing the something else option during installation.\nTo create an ext4 partition from the free space, you have to boot from Ubuntu live disk.Then click on try Ubuntu option on startup.\nAfter that, a desktop like screen will appear.Search for Gparted Partition Editor in dash.Gparted allows you to create ext4 partition from the free space(aka unallocated space).\n\nDoes this have anything to do with 3 Primary partitions?\n\nDisk with MSDOS partition table allows 3 primary partitions and an Extended partition.But the disk with GPT allows upto 128 partitions.\nIf you can't able to create a partition from the free space, it means you have a disk with MSDOS partition table and it already contains 4 partitions(3 primary+1 extended).So you have to move that unallocated space into extended partition.And then create a new one from that space.\nThis answer will help you to move the unallocated space into the extended partition.\n", "Q: Broken Package, Unable to install anything.!

I am relatively new to Ubuntu so if any other info is needed please ask.\n\nA: when you do a fresh install, there are two ways of using custom partitioning. if you simply say install ubuntu and pull the slider, it slices the ntfs partition of your system. the ext4 partition remains unaltered.\nthe second way of doing it is choosing something else and then in the next step, your partitioning scheme will be visible. you have to select the partition for installing linux and click change in the bottom. choose the type of file system(in your case ext4) and select mount point as / . (/) is the root partition which means your ubuntu is installed there. you can add swap as well as seperate home partiion basing on your intentions and proceed with the installation.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to add the space of /dev/sda5 to /dev/sda6.For this, you have to boot from Ubuntu live disk.So that only, you can  able to resize your / root partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Ubuntu live disk and then choose Try Ubuntu option on startup.\n\n*Open gparted from dash.\n\n*Make sure that all the partitions are unmounted and then take a backup of important datas.\n\n*Delete /dev/sda5 partition.\n\n*Then right-click on /dev/sda6 partition and choose Resize/Move option.\nNow you can be able to add that free space which was just above to the /dev/sda6 partition by moving the left arrow to extreme left.\n", "Q: Launcher and some icons do not appear This is the first time I use Linux (Ubuntu - 13.10 )\nAfter installation, there is no Launcher bar and some icons, like minimize / maximize and close, are missing in any window.

It does not make any changes to the boot menu, even though it shows that it has made changes to the boot menu.\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: Re-installing Grub Customizer might help.  To do so, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall grub-customizer\n\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to focus on (idle) terminal I would like to know, if there is possible to use keyboard shortcut to focus on first idle (non working) terminal window in unity (13.10)?

Can we resume partial torrent downloads using the default transmission software?\nI started 500 mb download which was downloaded half way. Now I can't seem to resume the download. \n\nA: Transmission should verify the local data automatically when the torrent started again. In case you have moved the data on another folder, you can use the set location option and point to the folder where the file is. (not the torrent file but the actual file - music,movie,iso whatever).  \nSo, first attempt would be: \nremove the torrent (not the data, the torrent file only) from transmission and add it again. It should check the data and resume automatically. Be aware that the torrent file should be exactly the same. If you don't have it, download the torrent file again(from the same site).\nsecond attempt: \nAdd the torrent file manually to transmission and stop it. Then right click on that file and click the set location. Browse and point to the folder where the actual file is. Then click the verify local data option and wait until complete. Then start the download again.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu in Google Nexus 7 Tablet i would like to install Ubuntu in my new Nexus-7 Tab, can you please help me with complete installation procedure?\n\nA: Please follow this procedure to install Ubuntu Touch on your Nexus 7 tablet:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install\nNote: only the Nexus 7 2013 WiFi (codename flo) is supported.\n", "Q: Can I Use Ubuntu Server As A Desktop? an older relative of mine still has Windows XP. The hardware is ok for XP, but definetively too weak for Windows 7. Also, I think, Ubuntu would be a nice OS for him to work with, since it's easy and has a great feel.\nHARDWARE\nThe machine has 1 processor with one core (3 GHz) [Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz], 1,5 GB RAM, 80 GB HDD. But it has some weird VGA-Chip [VIA/S3G UniChrome Pro IGP]\nPROBLEM\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04, Lubuntu 13.04, Xubuntu 13.10 and even Linux Mint: I simply cannot get a desktop. All the installations run without problems, but I keep getting stuck with The system is running in low-graphics mode. I tried all the answers to this problem (since there is a good thread concerning this error here), but I think, the VGA-Chip simply doesn't do it (someone wrote \"Unity requires: Any graphics card with OpenGL 1.4 support\"). I spent two days, trying to get to a desktop, I couldn't succeed.\nSOLUTION?\nOut of curiosity, I installed Ubuntu 8, which worked fine. Of course, I couldn't update it. Then, by accident, I installed Ubuntu Server 10 (instead of Ubuntu Desktop 10). After the installation, I installed a desktop (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop). Then, I updated to Ubuntu Server 12.04, still with desktop. Everything works fine. I have an Ubuntu LTS with a working desktop.\nQUESTION\nIs there any serious reason, why I shouldn't run a Ubuntu Server as a Desktop?\nThe guy, I'm doing this for, just wants:\n - open office or libre office\n - internet browser (firefox would be good)\n - thunderbird\n - skype (yeah, it's Microsoft... but some of his relatives are outside the country and using skype)\n - software for viewing and collecting photos\n - to use a HP laserprinter, a standard-webcam (for skype) and card-reader\nEverything shouldn't be a problem, as far as I see it.\nIf there IS a problem with running a Server OS as a Desktop: Is there any other way to install Ubuntu Desktop and tell the OS not to use any kind of desktop-features, that need newer VGA-cards (kind of like the windows 2000 theme)?\nYeah, I could make him buy a new pc, but I just hate to waste. This guy doesn't want to play the newest games, cut videos or render 3D-graphics.

Before I removed Windows 7 from my computer and replaced it with Ubuntu, I had over 257 threats that never would go away. I don't know if the trojan horse I had also could transfer over to Ubuntu. Can my computer be infected? I'm trying to be very careful when I use my computer, because I don't want to get a new computer.\nI've only had Windows 7 and my PC, for only a few years. First, I took it to Best Buy and they said a trojan horse is supposed to be on the computer. The man only \"looked\" at it and since he put it in factory settings, it hid and stole my PC twice in a row. Then, I took it somewhere to someone I know and they re-built it. But it had tons of issues again.\nMy anti-virus and my programs and other files were disappearing right before my eyes. My Wi-Fi was turned off, and I couldn’t turn it back on. It even shut down by itself. And it never did that before.\nWill my infections from Windows 7 transfer over to Ubuntu? Just remember I don't have windows 7 any more, I only have Ubuntu.\n\nA: Your operating system is neither the first code that executes on your computer, nor is it the code with the highest level of access. Malware loaded into the bootstrap code (including BIOS, video BIOS, RAID BIOS, NIC BIOS, UEFI, UEFI modules) not only will not be erased by installation of a new OS, it can hide itself from detection by the OS (although not perfectly, it will slow things down1 and timing analysis may be able to detect that).\nOnly a small fraction of all malware operates at this level, but multiple cases have been documented. Here are just a few examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*New BIOS Virus Withstands HDD Wipes\n\n*Blue Pill is the codename for a rootkit based on x86 virtualization\n\n*Rootkit Detection Framework for UEFIWay Back Machine \"UEFI has recently become a very public target for rootkits and malware. Last year at Black Hat 2012, Snare’s insightful talk highlighted the real and very significant potential for developing UEFI rootkits that are very difficult, if not impossible, to detect and/or eradicate. Since then, a couple of practical bootkits have appeared.\"\nAlso, Stack Exchange site Information Security has several relevant questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to detect a virus in a network card?\n\n*Viruses on video cards?\n\nTo be pedantic, these wouldn't be called \"Windows viruses\", although they may be carried inside Windows malware which served as the infection vector.  And they wouldn't be said to \"transfer to Ubuntu\".  My point is that if you had asked the right question, which I feel is \"After formatting my Windows partition and installing Ubuntu, might I continue to be affected by malware?\", you would learn that the unfortunate answer is \"Yes that is possible.\"\n\n1 But malware that infects a coprocessor, such as the Intel Management Engine which has recently come to mainstream attention due to a critical vulnerability in the way Intel does remote authentication would not spend processor cycles.  At best it might cause some timing variances due to bus and memory contention.  Malware that infects a management subsystem is basically a worst-nightmare scenario, for both detection and removal.\n\nA: No\nIf you installed Ubuntu over windows and deleted all the Windows files the virus can not spread. \nYou can get Windows viruses on Ubuntu if and only if you install Windows software via programs like Wine. \n\nA: There are a few parts to the answer to your problem:\nThreats don't transfer from one OS to another\nThreats that work on Windows usually don't work on other OS (there might be some that do, but I have never heard of any) because they both work very differently. That way, a virus that looks for your C:\\Windows\\System32 folder on windows won't find it on Ubuntu as it doesn't exist.\nThreats don't survive a total wipe of your hard drive\nIf you erase your hard drive and install a fresh Windows on top, any existing threats would have disappeared, as they are just regular programs. I don't know if best buy employees did a simple rollback to factory settings or a full re-install of windows, but in the case of the re-install, you shouldn't have had any remaining problem.\nAs a conclusion, no, your viruses won't transfer to Ubuntu.\nHowever, your problem might be related to hardware problems. If you still have issues with your Ubuntu, you might want to ask support to look at your hard drive and motherboard and see if there is any problem there.\nNote: If you still have viruses after a 1st Windows re-install, you should seriously check if websites you visit regularly are not infected or install a better protection software.\n\nA: Some comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*There are false alerts, too. Virus scanners often use very crude heuristics. For example, when you have multiple virus scanners, they may detect each other as malware, too! And of course, false alerts can easily carry over to other platforms, if you take data with you.\n\n*In theory, Wine can also be used to run a Windows virus.\n\n*There could be a virus that has support for multiple platforms. Eventually there will be one, written in JavaScript and infecting Node.js webservers, for example.\n\n*Some tools scare Windows users, and report every web tracking cookie as a threat.\nIn practise, I have not heard a convincing report of this happening.\n\nA: Although I don't know any actual virus that does it, I have to say:\nYes, a Windows malware can do harm under Linux.\nInfection of files\nLinux does not magically remove viruses. If you use Linux as a file server and the HDD was infected, it will spread the Windows malware although Linux is not affected.\nWine\nYou can execute windows binaries with wine. Although not every malware might be effective this way, some could still work with wine.\nHoneypots / Java\nIf you have some malware that you don't see as malware, this could work on any system. Let's say you have a game that is a real game at the first glance, but does also use your computer for DOS attacks. You might even make it work on a new system.\nAn easy way to do this might be Java applets. They work on many systems and Java has lot of security issues.\nAnother hot candidate might be JavaScript or Flash. Both are available on many systems and you might use sites that deploy this malware (eventually without knowing).\nThe complicated way\nCombined vulnerabilities\nSuppose you had Windows and a virus that allowed the attacker to execute arbitrary code. Then the attacker could know vulnerabilities (eventually allowing him to execute arbitrary code when the system gets mounted) of Linux. Of course, he can load this. \nMBR viruses\nSee Boot sector viruses\nNote\nBy the way, I think such questions might be better suited for Information Security Stack Exchange.\n\nA: I totally disagree with Ploutox's and Alvar's answers.\nOn one hand:\nThere would be a virus that can infect both Ubuntu and Windows! Simply the virus search for operating systems and infect them, even it can be more powerful because the virus don't need administrative rights when you use Windows to infect Ubuntu.\nIn conclusion: there could be a virus that runs on two different systems.\nOn the other hand:\nA simple format should kill all viruses on a hard drive. Antivirus programs are really powerful nowdays.\n\nA: In general: No\nNormally, this is not the case.\nDisc wipes\nA disc wipe (“format”) is something a virus cannot survive iff done on a clean system (e.g. a booting from a clean Live CD, not an infected system).\nSome viruses can be stored in the MBR, though this is a part of the disc that is also often overwritten during OS installation.\nHowever, some viruses can infect the firmware (OpenFirmware, OpenBOOT, BIOS, EFI). That is massively harder to get rid of. Changing the mainboard usually helps. The comments about a clean Live CD (or write-protectable USB stick) from above apply.\nVirus transfer\nI know of someone who “double-clicked” on an eMail attachment on his SuSE Linux KDE desktop, which “helpfully” (hah…) started the Windows® virus using Wine (a Windows® loader)… and the system integration of Wine was good enough for the virus to be able to read the person's KDE (Linux) address book and spread to their friends.\nBut that's been quite a while ago, and rare. Although, with all the user-friendliness and focus on getting former Windows® users to convert to Ubuntu®, it would not surprise me if it could still happen.\nStill, nothing you should worry about, I think.\n\nA: The answer is NO\nThreats that work on Windows usually don't work on other OS That way, a virus that looks for you folder on windows won't find it on Ubuntu as it doesn't exist or simply as a file or Folder\nMain reason is that in windows it will be .exe files which will run as the virus and that format is not supported in other OS. \nThough sometimes it may effect wine but don't worry about a crash because of that.\n\nA: What I am hearing you say is that you had problems with your computer that some program identified as \"threats\" and that your problems did not go away after a factory reset. I would be concerned as well that the installation of a new operating system might not remove the problems completely.\nIn short, it is very unlikely that a Windows virus or threat could infect Ubuntu since a Windows virus is typically hidden inside a Windows program and you cannot run Windows programs in Ubuntu (except in Wine or similar). It might possible that a virus inside a Word or Excel file could harm you if you open the file in Libreoffice but these do not generally hide inside hard disk partitions.\nThe Ubuntu installation should have replaced the boot sector with GRUB, so you should be ok here. If you want to be really sure what partitions are on your hard disk, install GParted and see what's there. If you don't need Windows any more, you can delete these extra partitions. Just don't delete the one that has as mount point / (This is your Ubuntu system)\nDo you know how to install a program in Ubuntu?\n\nA: As with almost everything in the computer world, nothing is impossible - but a lot of things are highly improbable. In theory it is possible to write a Windows virus that will also infect a Linux system but as the two use entirely different architectures and file handling systems, it would be difficult to say the least. \nAs many others have said, if you run some sort of Windows emulation like Wine, then you are running an effective Windows environment and it can be infected. If, as I do, you install both systems with a dual-boot loader (Grub) and choose which one to run at boot-up then any Windows virus cannot transfer from one to the other. I also run a full-featured commercial anti-malware program on my Windows system and have never had an infection find its way past that.\nFrom your initial post I'd say that the 'technician' who did the initial check didn't know squat! Your system should have been reformatted and a clean re-install performed; without this it's very difficult to be certain that even regular viruses and trojans are removed. However, even with this, it only needs one infected document, one infected site, or one vicious email and you're back on the same merry-go-round. The good thing is that if you install Linux, these most likely can't infect that. \nBest of luck.\n\nA: A windows thread almost never infects Linux. However a thread can survive usually these ways:\nBy having 2 partitions in which on the one infected windows are in\nThis is the way that most times make Linux users regret for using Linux. If you boot into windows with Linux installed on another partition the thread goes in the Linux partition and destroys files, programs and sometimes the Linux system. However if you do not boot into windows this problem will not appear in Linux\nBy keeping old infected files from windows and having WINE installed on Linux\nWINE, which is a compatibility layer for running windows programs on windows (wine Is Not Emulator), usually can't run windows threads and wine crashes in such situations, however sometimes it can, and the thread might be more harmful than in windows. And that's because, again, Wine Is Not an Emulator it can harm sometimes your system.\n\nSOLUTION\nInstall ClamAV and its graphical frontend, ClamTK, an antivirus for linux wich can't be destroyed by a windows thread. ClamAV can scan your files for infections (even for the \"windowish\" ones) and most times repair them. It is very easy to install them. simply run:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-clamav/ppa\n $ sudo apt-get update\n $ sudo apt-get install clamav gdebi\n $ wget https://bitbucket.org/dave_theunsub/clamtk/downloads/clamtk_5.09-1_all.deb\n $ sudo gdebi clamtk_5.09-1_all.deb\nand if you wand to remove them:\n$ sudo apt-get remove clamav* clamtk*\n", "Q: how to save changes in terminal im trying to configure my mouse speed I set it up to a speed that I like using the terminal but when I restart the pc or shut down it losses all the setting I had input is there a way to save the changes so why work all the time.\nps. ive only used Linux for a couple of days now so the answer may be really obvious and I just dont have a clue \nthanks in advance\n\nA: Open a terminal and Run this command: \nxinput --list --short\n\noutput :\nabcd@abcd-abcde:~$ xinput --list --short\n\nVirtual core pointer\n\n↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\n↳ Logitech USB RECEIVER                     id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nfor me my pointing devices are a Lgitech usb reciver and synaptic touchpad\nTo list out device Properties : \nxinput --list-props \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\"\n\nNow reduce it's Property values to suit your need :\nDevice Accel Constant Deceleration (267):   2.500000\n\nusing this command :\nxinput --set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 1.5\n\nYou may have to play around with this number a bit to set it exactly as you need.\nIf you need to set this value automatically every time Ubuntu starts then :\ncreate a .sh file\n#!/bin/sh\n\nxinput --set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 1.5\n\nchange the file to executable :\nchmod +x\n\nand Put this in the start-up applications list. \nThanks To : vikash-singh\nSource  : Configuring Mouse Speed manually\n", "Q: Always start google chrome in full screen Does anyone know a way to make chrome always start in full screen?

This lat-\n       ter return status is in the format  specified  in  wait(2).\n       Thus, the exit code of the command will be WEXITSTATUS(sta-\n       tus).  In case /bin/sh could not be executed, the exit sta-\n       tus will be that of a command that does exit(127).\n\n       If  the  value of command is NULL, system() returns nonzero\n       if the shell is available, and zero if not.\n\n       system() does not affect the wait status of any other chil-\n       dren.\n\nIt is not a hack to use a simple solution.\n\nA: The answer is libapt-pkg.

I'm the only user on my computer, but when I type in who | wc -l, it responds with 2. Why is that?\n\nA: This is because an open terminal (physical or virtual) is counted as a user logged in. So when you log-in to the account, you log-in once, when you open your terminal, either using Ctrl+Alt+t(hereon called as a virtual terminal) or using Ctrl+Alt+F{1-7}(hereon called as a physical terminal), you log-in once again, each time you log-in.\nThis is clearly shown in the output of who. The second column shows how the user has logged in. In case you have logged in using the virtual terminal, you will see pts/<no> which represents you have used /dev/pts to log in, which is used to log in using the virtual terminal. If you log-in using the physical terminal, you will see tty<no>, which represents you have used /dev/tty to log-in.\nTo clarify this, see the following situation:\nI have logged in once using the graphical interface, once using the virtual terminal, once using the physical terminal, so the output is:\njobin    tty1         2014-03-31 18:05\njobin    :0           2014-03-31 16:58 (:0)\njobin    pts/1        2014-03-31 17:25 (:0)\n\nThe first line indicates the physical terminal login, the second one the graphical and the third one the virtual one.\nSo the reason you see \"2\" is because you have logged in to the graphical interface as well as a terminal(not pretty sure whether you have a physical or virtual one).\n\nA: who gives the detailed information of currently logged in users one on each line, as following\naditya@aditya-desktop:~$ who\naditya   tty7         2014-03-31 16:45 (:0)\naditya   pts/2        2014-03-31 17:51 (:0)\naditya@aditya-desktop:~$ \n\nwc -l gives no of lines.\nIn who|wc -l we have piped the commands. That is, we forward the output of who to wc -l command. wc -l will measure the no of lines in the output given by who command, which is 2.\naditya@aditya-desktop:~$ who|wc -l\n2\naditya@aditya-desktop:~$ \n\nFor more info, you can read the manuals by typing man who and man wc\n\nA: From info coreutils 'who invocation':\n\n   If given no non-option arguments, `who' prints the following\ninformation for each user currently logged on: login name, terminal\nline, login time, and remote hostname or X display.\n\n\nSo if you are logged on more than one place and nobody else is logged, the output of who | wc -l will be the number of the places where you are logged. If you open more terminal windows, you will see that this number will increase. The same thing if you open more tabs in a terminal window.\nIf you are the only user on your computer and if you want to see the number of the unique users currently logged in your system you can use:\nwho is using_my_pc | wc -l\n\nNo, that's a joke (which is funny because it's working in this case). See info coreutils 'who invocation' to see exactly what it means. The right way to see the number of the unique users currently logged in your system is:\nwho | cut -d' ' -f1 | uniq | wc -l\n\n\nA: who command shows information about the users who are currently logged in.\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ who\navinash  tty7         2014-03-31 16:52 (:0)\navinash  pts/1        2014-03-31 17:59 (:0)\n\ntty7 represents the above user is running an X GUI session.And also the second one, pts/1 represents the above user is also running an gnome-terminal session.\nLike @Aditya said wc -l counts the number of lines in the standard input.who | wc -l in this command, the output of who command was fed as input to the second wc -l command.Thus inturn, wc -l calculates the number of lines present in the standard input(2) and displays(stdout) the final result.\nTo see the number of users who are logged in, run who command with -q parameter as below.\navinash@avinash-Lenovo-IdeaPad-Z500:~$ who -q\navinash avinash avinash\n# users=3\n\nFrom man who\n-q, --count\n          all login names and number of users logged on\n\n", "Q: Cannot recognize/format usb flash I had a Flash stick with Ubuntu to run as live USB.

When I press the power button I can hear the computer come to life but nothing activates on my screen?\n\nA: This is a known bug, read the workaround at this link\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfce4-power-manager/+bug/1259339\n", "Q: apt returns \"E: Unmet dependencies\" when I try to install a package, how can I diagnose the issue and find out why it occurs? I'm trying to install a package, but the package manager (apt-get, software center, etc.) refuses to install it due unmet dependencies. \nAre my attempts to install the package causing the dependencies issue? How can I tell what the issue is?\n\nA: If you are installing an specific package/program and you hit a dependency issue there are two causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your dependencies were already broken.\n\n*It isn't possible to install the package you want due to your current setup.\n\n\n\nThe first case is easy to figure out. Just execute sudo apt-get check. This will report you any problem with the already installed packages and you will know how to solve them. \nsudo apt-get check                          \nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these.\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libpurple-dev : Depends: libpurple0 (>= 2.10.9) but it is not installed\n                 Depends: libpurple0 (< 2.10.9+1~) but it is not installed\n pidgin : Depends: libpurple0 (>= 2.8.0) but it is not installed\n pidgin-whatsapp : Depends: libpurple0 (>= 2.8.0) but it is not installed\nE: Unmet dependencies. Try using -f.\n\nNormally if you didn't install any packages manually with dpkg, you have missing mirrors, broken PPA's or a mix of different version repositories (like Debian's and Ubuntu's or Precise and Saucy) this could be fixed with a simple sudo apt-get -f install. If that doesn't fix it, you may need to ask for help adding all the results of the operations you attempted plus the output of apt-cache policy for all relevant packages:\napt-cache policy pidgin-whatsapp pidgin libpurple-dev libpurple0\n\nNow, if that results clean and the dependency issue only happens when you try to install a package, you may need to know why apt is refusing to install the package. This is tiring to do and would pose a hurdle if you want to solve your issue fast, and each problem has it's own solution. Is recommended in such cases using aptitude. First we install it:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nNow you will ask aptitude why you can not install the package using:\naptitude why-not package\n\nIt will show you a nice list telling you why the package can't not be installed. It could be a missing package, that depends on a package that isn't available, or some other package that has conflicts/breaks it. Example:\naptitude why-not lsb-core:amd64\ni   lsb-security Recommends lsb-core (>= 4.1+Debian12)\ni A lsb-core     Conflicts  lsb-core:amd64\n\nIn this case, I have installed lsb-security package, which installed lsb-core 32-bits version, and doesn't allow me to install the 64-bit version.\n", "Q: Is there an RDP client that can work with a dual monitor setup?

This is a risk because this favorite user's password may be already known to the evil guy. \n\nA: The whole point of password changes is to help keep \"the evil guy\" guessing. This is especially useful if the system has unknowingly already been compromised as it will prevent that invader from being able to easily regain access. \nHow many passwords to keep in history would really depend on how often you demand a change in password.

I remember this as I was working in the university IT department and we discovered a user that would exhaust his password reset history so that he could keep his preferred password.\nHere is the recommended policy we settled on back then, which seemed to remedy the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enforce password history 5 passwords remembered\n\n*Maximum password age 90 days\n\n*Minimum password age 1 days\n\n*Minimum password length 7 characters\n\n*Password must meet complexity requirements\n\n\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: ubuntu 13.10 - language toggle keys don't work I've read some people have been having trouble with switching between languages and I'm also experience something similar.

Since I'm new to Linux I'm a little confused. Any ideas on how to go about this? Should I just start using /HOME or is there a proper way to reallocate space? \n\nA: The default Linux file system is case sensitive. You have defined a mountpoint at /HOME when instead, you should have used /home. Therefore, the /HOME is simply not used, it is not your actual home directory, that is in /home/username which is completely separate from /HOME.\nTo fix this and use the 874G partition you have created as your actual home directory (in the Linux world, your home dir is referred to as $HOME (note the $) or ~/), you will need to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your home directory on /HOME:\nsudo mkdir \"/HOME/$USER\"\nsudo chown username \"/HOME/$USER\"\n\n\n*Copy everything from your current $HOME to this new directory.\nmv ~/* ~/.* \"/HOME/$USER\"\n\n\n*Tell the system to mount the partition of /HOME in the right place, /home.

I just don't want to loose boot speed for mounting ntfs partitions.\n\nA: No you can't and neither you should.\nThe fastboot feature is called as hybrid shutdown. It can be seen as partial hibernation and partial shut down. In simple words, It takes a snapshot of current memory and stores to disk to be used on next start up. A good explanation can be found here - http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/how-windows-8-hybrid-shutdown-fast-boot-feature-works/ \nSo if it is allowed to make changes to the ntfs file system by any means, on next start up win 8 won't able to know what changes were made.

Ubuntu should (AFAIK) hibernate to SWAP partition, which is not used by Windows. Would it work? If not, why?\n\nA: Absolutely it should work. I was doing that ages for gaming purposes as well, although now with the Steam-Linux revolution I haven't booted Windows up for months.\nI had my OS partitions totally separate, as you intend to, and had no problems at all. There were no shared partitions. My swap partition is 36 GB, slightly more than twice my RAM (16 GB).\nThe only problem is that hibernate is slightly unstable on Linux sometimes. Probably 20% of the time, it would crash when hibernating or resuming. (This was a year ago, so things might have changed, or be different on your system. After I bought an SDD, and startup time were reduced greatly, I just restarted instead of hibernating.)\nI even have a script that might be useful. You might need to change the name and location of the Windows partition.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# hibernate and restart in Windows for only the next time.\n# requires /etc/default/grub has \"GRUB_DEFAULT=saved\"\n\n# get the correct name from /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nsudo grub-reboot \"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sdb2)\"\n\n# or use the number, i.e.\n# WINDOWS_ENTRY=`grep menuentry /boot/grub/grub.cfg  | grep --line-number Windows`\n# MENU_NUMBER=$(( `echo $WINDOWS_ENTRY | sed -e \"s/:.*//\"` - 1 ))\n# sudo grub-reboot $MENU_NUMBER\n\nsudo dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Hibernate\n\n# if this fails, you can try ---> sudo pm-hibernate\n\n\nA: I am probably repeating similar answers, but It should be possible as long as where your hibernation files are saved is separate from, as in your example Windows 7. (Windows 7 likes to take control of the partition, or disk it is on, so it is best to keep Ubuntu to it's own area anyway).\nI would test just a regular hibernation with a hard reset (or maybe even pull the plug/battery), and see if you can recover your hibernation \"before-state\" from that.\nFor more on hibernation for Ubuntu I looked here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/PowerManagement/Hibernate \n", "Q: How to edit a read-only archive?

Working with 12.04 here.\n\nA: In your mv command you are using a relative path for opt/shiny-server/ so this will only work if you current directory has opt as a subdirectory. To ensure that this isn't the issue use a full path /opt/shiny-server/.\nTo change permission of /opt/shiny-server/test/ use sudo chmod 777 /opt/shiny-server/test This opens up the permissions for everyone.\nA better solution is to change the permission to give You more access sudo chown <username>:<username> /opt/shiny-server/test/ \nTo work with files with strange characters in the name, wrap the filename in quotes, and escape single and double quote within the name \"this<>isn\\'t aNICE file.name\"\n\nA: Your problem is the difference between absolute and relative path. So opt/shiny-server/ is not the same as /opt/shiny-server/ ; the first starts in the current directory and the second starts at root or /\nSame problem with test and /test\nSee http://www.linuxnix.com/2012/07/abslute-path-vs-relative-path-in-linuxunix.html\n", "Q: sshd activation on ubuntu system I want to connect my work Desktop computer remotely from home.

Any help?\n\nA: My piece of advice is to go to www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop and download the 64-bit image :)\n\nA: It seems that the latest edition of Ubuntu Unleashed ships with a DVD that includes the full Ubuntu 13.10 distribution for Intel x86 (according to this site). I'm assuming that previous editions ship with x86, too.\nIn this case x86 stands for 32-bit binaries. So if you install from this medium, you'll get a 32-bit operating system. Ubuntu does not have binaries for multiple architectures (like for example Mac OS X), so there is no automatic selection on boot or even installation time. You have to choose your architecture by using the matching installation medium.\nFor 64-bit you need amd64 (also known as x86-64 or - rarely - EMT64, yes it can be confusing).

Removing the USB can keep most people out of my linux system and the bios automatically selects \"boot from other device\" when the usb is removed.\nIf the usb is installed at pc bootup motherboard bios recognizes it and bios allows me to alternately select \"boot from other device\" instead of boot from usb which is set to raid drive and contains most of my hard drive space (raid spanning which is in other bios settings). This setting boots directly to xp (no grub involved).\nThe answer may be that it depends upon your bios.\nOne other thing that I did was to install xp first.\nWhich makes grub act independently.\nIf your grub is to be installed on your \"D\" so that you can dual boot you may be able to set your bios to boot to \"D\"\nFor this to work, you may also need to remove the physical wiring connections from your \"C\" and then install ubuntu to \"D\".\nHowever, removing \"C\" means that grub will not ,without some editing, recognize the \"C\" operating system.\nAnd most likely windows won't be able to see linux, however, when running linux you can see and even edit windows stuff and partitions, etc. Also be careful.\nBe sure to completely power off to make any wiring changes.\n\nA: Well with all due respect I'll have to say that although the first part of user2654514's answer sounds right, as well as a pretty cool way to set up a machine, The part about installing Ubuntu on a drive that is temporarily isolated, will (although perhaps necessary) not lead to a need to edit the grub boot-loader.\n\nOnce you finish the install(s), boot and press F12 to enter your boot-device menu.

If I install Ubuntu as an OS on a Windows XP system (not as dual-boot), what happens to the functionality of the other programs already installed inside Windows XP? Do they continue to function on Ubuntu or will I need to reinstall them on Ubuntu?\nI've seen questions regarding partitions, but not about the programs themselves.\n\nA: If you are installing Ubuntu to fully replace the operating system you already have in place, then depending on your choice on how to handle the partition question (which your question says you've already read up on) your programs will either be deleted, if the partition they were on was deleted during the install process, or they will stay on the disk.\nHowever, Ubuntu is not compatible with Windows XP software and unless you intend to use compatibility software such as Wine, you will not be able to use your old software at all, regardless of whether they remain on the disk or you try to reinstall them.  The installation software is also windows-specific and will also not function.  You will need to find (generally open source and therefore free) alternatives.\nIf you do wish to use Wine (software which lets you run some Windows software on Linux), you are strongly encouraged to reinstall your applications through Wine itself and not try to operate the old software in-place.\nUbuntu system requirements are flexible because almost all parts of the system are componentized and can be replaced with smaller or older software packages with reduced system requirements.  A rough guideline is that if you have a 1ghz or faster processor, 1 GB or more memory, and 5 GB or more disk space, then you should be able to use Ubuntu on the default settings, possibly excepting graphics effects depending on your graphics card.  According to this wiki page you can skimp by on a 700mhz or so processor and 512 mb of ram, but at that point it is likely to be quite slow and you might benefit from a slimmer configuration than the default.\n\nA: I'd recommend installing Lubuntu which is a slimline version of Ubuntu but has all of the same functionality and software available in the Software Centre and will run on older laptops and computers a lot smoother...\nDuring install it would be better to let Ubuntu REPLACE the current Windows XP installation so that you have a clean single-boot system, here is an install guide showing you the process: Installing Ubuntu\nLastly, the Software Centre has access to a lot of free software and some you can pay for so you wont be left short if you need a specific program, if you wish to run something specific to Windows like a game their is a program called WINE that can assist in running those on your Ubuntu system, but remember.. not all Windows programs will work...\n", "Q: Side by side Operating System I have a PC with MS-W7 installed.

My suspicion is that your icrnl setting is not set and will be shown as -icrnl (the minus sign means that it is turned off) instead of having its usual setting of being on. Here is how my terminal is normally set up when I log in:\n$ stty -a\nspeed 38400 baud; rows 45; columns 80; line = 0;\nintr = ^C; quit = ^\\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;\neol2 = <undef>; swtch = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R;\nwerase = ^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O; min = 1; time = 0;\n-parenb -parodd cs8 -hupcl -cstopb cread -clocal -crtscts\n-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -ixon -ixoff\n-iuclc -ixany -imaxbel iutf8\nopost -olcuc -ocrnl onlcr -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel nl0 cr0 tab0 bs0 vt0 ff0\nisig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt\nechoctl echoke\n\nAnd I have no problem with line endings: either return (^M) or enter (^J) will end input lines. But if I turn icrnl off then ^M codes suddenly appear each time I am talking to a program and hit enter:\n$ stty -icrnl\n$ read line\nLine of text^M^M^M^M\n$ stty -a\nspeed 38400 baud; rows 45; columns 80; line = 0;\nintr = ^C; quit = ^\\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;\neol2 = <undef>; swtch = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R;\nwerase = ^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O; min = 1; time = 0;\n-parenb -parodd cs8 -hupcl -cstopb cread -clocal -crtscts\n-ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr -icrnl -ixon -ixoff\n-iuclc -ixany -imaxbel iutf8\nopost -olcuc -ocrnl onlcr -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel nl0 cr0 tab0 bs0 vt0 ff0\nisig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt\nechoctl echoke\n\nThe code icrnl means “turn carriage returns into newlines” and hides from the running program that you might be typing ^M when Unix really wants ^J. Old keyboards used to have a separate Return and Enter key (where Return typically advanced you through a form and Enter submitted it), but today we generally have only one line-ending key and so this terminal setting helps combine the two meanings.\nAdd the stty icrnl command to your .profile or .bashrc if you find that this is indeed the problem setting.\n\nA: In case anybody else has this problem, it is most likely a problem with the stty terminal line setting rather than a TERM problem. If this happens to you again, try running stty sane and let us know if that fixes it.\n\nA: I just ran into this problem with zsh on Ubuntu 20.04 and neither tty sane nor stty icrnl worked.\nAs it turns out it was caused by disabling NumLock.\nOnce I re-enabled it the Enter key behaved normally again.\n\nA: My solution:\nCTRL+Enter is gonna solve your problem.

On Ubuntu 12.04, I can find Upstart log messages in /var/log/syslog.\nCommands:\n# initctl log-priority info\n# initctl emit hello\n\nLog:\nApr  1 01:56:56 precise64 kernel: [ 8365.820425] init: Connection from private client\nApr  1 01:56:56 precise64 kernel: [ 8365.821130] init: Handling hello event\n\nOn Ubuntu 13.10, the messages do not appear in syslog or anywhere else under the /var/log directory, although commands like logger hello work as expected. Should I be looking for them somewhere else? Is there a configuration setting I need to change somewhere?\nThere’s a question on Server Fault from somebody who seems to be having the same problem on Ubuntu 13.04, and more here and here that may also be describing the same problem. Unfortunately, these questions offer no leads for the problem.\n\nA: Edit 2016-06-02\nIf you're trying to find \"Upstart log messages\" in general, check /var/log/upstart/. That's where Upstart saves stdout and stderr from Upstart services. Thanks to leopd's answer for pointing this out.\nIf you're looking for log messages from Upstart itself, that are configured by initctl log-priority and emitted by initctl emit, read on!\nShort version\nThe log entries should actually show up in dmesg. Despite that, they do not show up by default in /var/log.\nIf you want them in /var/log too, add $KLogPermitNonKernelFacility on to rsyslogd's config. I suggest creating a custom file like /etc/rsyslog.d/60-custom.conf to avoid editing /etc/rsyslog.conf, since that's managed by dpkg. Now Upstart messages should show up in /var/log/syslog, once you set Upstart's log-priority to info or so.\nLong version\nThis took me days to track down, but apparently Upstart (1.5) does not log to syslog, that is, it doesn't call the glibc function syslog(). Instead, Upstart logs to the kernel ring buffer, which is what dmesg reads. Now, I didn't think it was possible for user space processes to write to that buffer, but apparently they can by writing to /dev/kmsg, and that's exactly what Upstart does. So that's the first part of the puzzle.\nThe second part is that there's a widely-held belief that messages written to the kernel ring buffer are automatically copied to syslog by the kernel (at least that's what I always thought). Turns out this is actually done by a user space daemon, traditionally klogd, which operates in tandem with syslogd. Obviously rsyslogd replaces syslogd but apparently it replaces klogd as well (sort of: see notes at the end).\nThe third part is that messages written to the kernel ring buffer from user space actually look different from messages written from kernel space: they have a different facility. dmesg has a few options that interact with this: -x will show the facility (and the priority), while -u and -k tell dmesg to show only user facility messages and kernel facility messages, respectively.\nNow here's the clincher: by default, rsyslogd ignores messages with a non-kernel facility when it's reading messages from the kernel ring buffer. The relevant config option is $KLogPermitNonKernelFacility, which is off by default and needs to be turned on if you want rsyslogd to process these messages. Note that the rest of rsyslogd's config will treat all messages from the kernel ring buffer as having the kern facility, irrespective of the facility they had in the kernel ring buffer.\nMore information\nsyslog\nCode can write to syslog by calling the glibc function syslog(), described in man 3 syslog. Apparently these functions write to /dev/log. Code can read from syslog by reading /dev/log, and this is what syslogd and its replacements do. rsyslogd reads /dev/log using its imuxsock input module.\nKernel ring buffer\nKernel space writes to this buffer by calling the kernel function printk(), so it's sometimes called the printk buffer. User space can write to it by writing to /dev/kmsg. User space can read from this buffer by several methods: it can read from /proc/kmsg (what dmesg does by default), or it can read from /dev/kmsg, or it can call the system call syslog(), which is described in man 2 syslog and is completely different from the glibc function syslog() described in man 3 syslog. glibc actually provides a wrapper to the system call syslog(), called klogctl(), to help alleviate this confusion.\nTraditionally, klogd reads from one of these interfaces, then calls the glibc function syslog() to copy them to the syslog. rsyslogd reads one of these interfaces through its imklog input module but AFAIK doesn't bother calling the glibc syslog(), which is why it's not exactly like klogd; it just processes the output of imklog just like it processes output from any other input module. There is the added caveat that all imklog output has the kern facility irrespective of the facility messages had in the kernel ring buffer.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#initctl-log-priority (Incorrectly states that Upstart logs to syslog)\n\n*https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/dev-kmsg\n\n*http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Overview-of-Syslog.html\n\n*http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v5-stable/configuration/modules/imklog.html (Note that this is for v5, used in Ubuntu 12.04.

I have installed Steam and then I installed Counter Strike source from Steam. But now I'm not able to figure out how to uninstall Counter Strike Source. I can't find it on package manager or Software Center, or where it has been installed. However, I can find Steam on Software center to uninstall it. \nI want to delete all files related to Counter Strike Source, so that next time if I install it, it wouldn't keep the settings from previous installation. \nPlease help me with this. Thank you. \n\nA: This is technically a Steam question, not really an Ubuntu question, but here goes!\nSince Steam is a game manager, all installs and uninstalls can be done directly inside the Steam itself. Here are the steps to uninstall a game:\nOpen Steam and click on the big 'Library' button at the top of the window (you will see it in-between 'Store' and 'Community').\n\nOn the left side of your window, there will now be a list of the games you have purchased through Steam (including Free-to-play games). Just to be thorough, let's make sure we are looking only at the games you have currently installed on your machine by switching what is displayed of your Steam Library. Let your mouse/cursor hover over the big Library button you clicked on before. A pop-up menu should appear right underneath the word Library - click where it says 'Installed'. You can get the same pop-up menu by clicking the button directly beneath the big \"Library\" as shown below:\n\nNow find the title you want to uninstall from the list shown on the left side of the menu, and right-click on its name. Then click on 'Delete Local Content'.\n\nYou will then be asked to confirm the process. Once Steam has finished, your game has been uninstalled.\nNow, regarding the deletion of all files \"related to Counter Strike Source, so that next time if I install it, it wouldn't keep the settings from previous installation\" - this is not how Steam works. Steam is a game manager. In Linux you can do anything, and certainly you can remove any trace of Counter-Strike Source from your hard drive, but that is not the same as uninstalling it. At the end of the day, if you don't uninstall through Steam itself, there will still be a reference to the game inside Steam, and you will still have to do the process we have just gone through above to 'Delete Local Content' even if it is just to remove the reference to the game from inside Steam. And unfortunately as far as game settings go, those aren't always just stored locally on your machine, they are sometimes also stored on Steam servers (particularly for save game files of a Single-Player game - but this is a good thing!). However, I have never noticed a multiplayer Valve game that actually does this. Any time I re-install Counter-Strike or Team Fortress I have to go through the process of reconfiguring controls and display settings so I think you are completely safe.\n", "Q: can't access drives with persistent liveUSB Due to Windows 7 boot error I've decided to make a liveUSB as a possible fix method. I used a 4 GB USB stick and dedicated 1 GB as persistent. On first boot everything was fine but from the second boot onwards I haven't been able to access any of the 'drives'. That includes both hard drives (one is malfunctioning anyway but that's another story), the two Windows partitions and even Casper. I can access an SD stick only if it was present during boot. If I remove and reinsert it, I get an error message. \nWhen trying to access the main Windows partition I get this error message:\nError mounting /dev/sdb2 at /media/ubuntu/Windows7_OS: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=999,gid=999,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sdb2\" \"/media/ubuntu/Windows7_OS\"' exited with non-zero exit status 21: mount: according to mtab, /dev/sdb2 is already mounted on /media/ubuntu/Windows7_OS\n\nThis is like with the two other HDD partitions/drives, only with different locations.\nFor Casper I get:\nDevice /dev/loop1 is already mounted at `/media/ubuntu/casper-rw3'.\n\nWhen loading the live USB I've tried \"check disc for errors\" and it found two errors. It didn't tell me what those were and it didn't seem to fix/change anything, since it gave me the same message the second time I ran \"check disc for errors\".\nHow can I regain access?\n\nUpdate: It's been over a week now and still no improvement, things are just getting worse. Since the system seems to have problem accessing the persistent partition on the USB flash drive, various changes cannot be saved properly, like Firefox crash screen (and other various crashes when HDMI cable is plugged/unplugged).\nIs there anything i can do besides a reinstall of the LiveUSB?\n\nA: I had the same problem.

If I go into the /root directory and type in ls the terminal does not even respond. So I'm confused with this.\nAny suggestions will be helpful.\nThanks.\n\nA: For your first question, df -h reports the file system disk space usage in human readable form. Human readable because it reports size as in kb, mb or gb and not purely in bytes, whereas df -i reports the inode information instead of block usage.\ninode in layman's terms is data about a file. Some space is required to store the data about the files in your filesystem. So if this space is full, you can't store files in your filesystem even though you may have space because there is no space to store data about the file you want to store.\nSecondly, you need superuser permissions to see what is stored in /root folder, so I am not pretty sure how you got into the /root folder. The reason why ls is failing is because it doesn't have read permissions to read the contents of /root to report it to you. To see why /root has occupied to much space, you'll need superuser permissions to investigate and unless you have that, I am not sure you can even read what is inside that.\nThe size of folder is 4096 because that is the minimum size it requires to store information about its contents. If it exceeds this size, it means it has a lot of files whose information requires that amount of space.\nI would recommend you investigate the contents of /root folder since that seems to be the reason why your df -i shows 100% utilization.\n\nA: Alright, I figured out the problem and here is the explanation:\nWe have some crob jobs running that run PHP scripts and we used wget -q. This for some reason creates a log file by the name of the php script in /root and the file name would be just 0 bytes.\nRegarding the files being *.php. not sure why that happens. But we need to fix the way the cron is running. Since I fixed the problem yesterday already few thousand files already created :/\nThe cron job had about 10 scripts that it would run every minute. Which means 10 line entry every minute. So over the year it created:\n10 x 60 x 24 x 365 = over 5.2 million files. This caused that exceptionally big directory size (130MB) for /root\nThis also explains why df -u showed that there were available \"space\", but no more nodes were free to write the filenames itself.\nThen using find . -name '*.php*' | xargs rm -v I deleted all the php log files.

They both make the window resize to a 50/50 split for each side.\nNow, I have a 26\" monitor and I find the best setup when coding is a text editor taking up 75% of the width with a terminal taking up the other 25%.\nIs it possible to somehow make it so when I drag against the right side, the window resizes to the right 25% of the monitor, and against the left side the window resizes to 75%?\nSurely the 50/50 ratio must be stored somewhere? Can I just edit that to be 25/75?

It's easier to remember when having multiple virtual hosts, and needing to stop/enable one of them. Since you wouldn't need to remember what is the number preceding the file.\nThe use of that number prefix is mostly to make apache load the Virtual Hosts at specific order.\n", "Q: Login goes nowhere after upgrade to 13.10 After upgrading to Xubuntu 13.10 I rebooted once and found that after login, regardless of account, I end up stuck after the login window disappears, with a movable pointer and the background from the login screen.

In Firefox, you can open the Console by pressing Ctrl + Shift + K. In Chromium, simply press F12. Paste it and gain coins!

In the \"details\" section, there was something about \"/usr/lib/ibus/ibus-ui-gtk3\".\nAfter a while, I decided to try booting with an older kernel version. So I forced grub to show up by editing the /etc/default/grub file, and running sudo update-grub.\nEvery time I use the latest kernel (3.11.0-19-generic), I encounter the same problem.\nEvery time I use the previous kernel (3.11.0-18-generic), it works.\nHow can I make it work with the latest kernel version?\n\nA: There was another update yesterday, and now it works.\nHere's what I can see in the history:\n\nThe problems started after the updates on Tuesday (\"mardi\", Apr 1 2014), and were solved after yesterday's updates (\"jeudi\", Apr 3 2014).\n", "Q: Why do some packages have extra numbers before a colon on the front of their version string? I have just noticed that Wine (and a number of other packages) have shifted their versioning scheme to something like:\n1:1.6.2-0ubuntu3\n\nI understand everything after the 1:... But what does the 1: refer to?\nIt doesn't seem to mirror the major version. Looking at a list of pending upgrades, there are versions like: 2:4.1.3... and there are plenty of packages without the #: prefix.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: From man deb-version:\n\nNAME\n       deb-version - Debian package version number format\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       [epoch:]upstream-version[-debian-revision]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Version  numbers as used for Debian binary and source packages\n       consist of three components. These are:\n\n       epoch  This is a single (generally  small)  unsigned  integer.\n              It  may  be omitted, in which case zero is assumed.  If\n              it is omitted then the upstream-version may not contain\n              any colons.\n\n              It is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers\n              of older versions of a package, and  also  a  package's\n              previous version numbering schemes, to be left behind.\n\n\nSo, that extra number (in your case 1) refers to the epoch component which may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed. And so, if you see a version string which looks like 1.6.2-0ubuntu3 you can think that in fact it looks like 0:1.6.2-0ubuntu3. How is this helpful and how does this comes: It is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older versions of a package, and  also  a  package's previous version numbering schemes, to be left behind . To understand better, take a closer look at the following explanatory paragraphs from Debian Policy Manual - Control files and their fields:\n\nWhen comparing two version numbers, first the epoch of each are\n  compared, then the upstream_version if epoch is equal, and then\n  debian_revision if upstream_version is also equal. epoch is compared numerically.\n\nAnd:\n\nNote that the purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind\n  mistakes in version numbering, and to cope with situations where the\n  version numbering scheme changes. It is not intended to cope with\n  version numbers containing strings of letters which the package\n  management system cannot interpret (such as ALPHA or pre-), or\n  with silly orderings.\n\n\nA: Concrete example\nHere's a concrete example to maximize your understanding speed.\nSuppose that the original package had versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*2019.1\n\n*2019.2\n\n*1.2 (original package decided to randomly change the release naming scheme)\n\n*1.3\nThen Debian treats those as:\n\n\n*\n\n*0:2019.1 (commonly known simply as 2019.1 because the leading 0: can be omitted)\n\n*0:2019.2\n\n*1:1.2 (Debian bumps the epoch from 0 to 1 to deal with the new naming scheme)\n\n*1:1.3\nThis way we can still know the version order clearly from the package version string, or be able to differentiate them at all if the original package makes the cardinal sin of actually reusing an old name release in the new scheme.\nCan you imagine the type of Hellish things that Debian developers have had to accommodate for? :-)\n\nA: This is the epoch. It overrides the version in determining which of two packages is newer:\nFrom the deb-version man page:\n   epoch  This is a single (generally small) unsigned integer.  It may  be\n          omitted,  in  which case zero is assumed.  If it is omitted then\n          the upstream-version may not contain any colons.\n\n          It is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older\n          versions  of  a  package,  and also a package's previous version\n          numbering schemes, to be left behind.\n\nSource\n", "Q: Bash - executing commands in current shell I was reading the O'Reilly book \"Unix in a nutshell\", and I saw there that commands can be grouped and executed in the current shell using the following format:\n{ cmd1 ; cmd2 }\n\nI didn't understand how this is possible, as I knew that a call to exec replaces a shell's data, and therefore the shell can't return from an exec system call.\nSo I tested the command and I can't understand what happened. I entered into a command line and I'm not sure to what does the command line belong.\nIs it just the terminal emulator's command line, stripped down from the shell?\nAlso, how is executing commands in the current shell in any way useful?\n\n\nA: To exec or not to exec\n\na call to exec replaces a shell's data, and therefore the shell can't return from an exec system call.\n\nBut not every command is the name of a program to execute. So often there is no exec call involved. The key distinction is that in contrast to ( cmd1; cmd2; ), you don't get another shell process. Or perhaps more correctly, the shell will only fork to execute child programs, not to execute shell processes.\nStrange prompt\n\nwhat does the command line belong.\n\nAs other answers have pointed out, your command was incomplete. So the command line belonged to bash itself, which was waiting for the end of your group.\nUses\n\nAlso, how is executing commands in the current shell in any way useful?\n\n… as opposed to subshell grouping\nThe most prominent example is setting variables in that subcommand. Thy this:\nfoo=1; { foo=2; echo $foo; }; ( foo=3; echo $foo; ); echo $foo\n\nThis will print\n2\n3\n2\n\nSo although you set foo=3 inside one group, that group was executed in a subshell and its settings didn't propagate to the parent.\nAnother thing worth considering is current working directory. { cd foo; make; } will leave you in directory foo whereas ( cd foo; make; ) will not alter the current working directory of your main shell.\n… as opposed to ungrouped commands\nThe grouping is mostly useful if you have other code outside, e.g. conditionals\ntest -f foo && { echo \"Foo exists.\"; rm foo; }\n\nor redirections\n{ echo \"Content of $PWD:\"; ls; } | gzip > dirlist.gz\n\n\nA: The help builtin can be useful even for the { keyword. From help -m {:\n\nNAME\n    { ... } - Group commands as a unit.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n    { COMMANDS ; }\n\n\nSo, the semicolon (;) is mandatory after each command.\n\nA: It is because you don't terminate the second line: { cmd1; cmd2; } is correct. The semicolon means \"end of command\". \n", "Q: Why does apt-get clean requires a reboot before taking effect Sometimes when my disk is full I apt-get clean to free up some space. When I check my free space with df I have no space left, but after a reboot df tells me disk is being used for 52%. Why do I need to reboot before it the clean operating takes effect?\n\nA: The reboot you do only flushes the file system buffer.

Unfortunately, there are still a number of packages out there that are only distributed in RPM format.\nThere’s a utility called Alien that converts packages from one format to the other. This doesn’t always mean that an rpm will work on your system, though. You will need to install some prerequisite software packages in order to install alien, however. These packages include gcc and make.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/install-an-rpm-package-on-ubuntu-linux/\n", "Q: OEM Server www directory permissions I am building a simple LAMP that records factory automation data and serves that info locally to tablets and PC's via wifi. I have it set to boot-up automatically when power is applied and log-in automatically to start Apache and MySql. All of that works great.\nMy problem is that, after the auto log-in, the WWW directory is exposed and anyone can view and modify those php & html files.\nHow do I set the WWW directory permissions such that Apache works, but you can't view or modify these files?\nTo say it another way: I am giving my customer the physical computer box, but don't want them to view or modify my web programming.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I've covered something similar here before but it's never enough. It only takes somebody with physical access a small amount of knowhow expertise to get root and get access to your files. You can take a few steps to make that as hard as possible though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does the system need to auto-login at all? The default settings for the lamp-server task launch the LAMP servers in the background. There's no system access other than by httpd. You don't need to \"log in\" for those to fire off and if you've somehow cocked things around so that you are logging in as a particular user to launch a web server, you're doing it wrong.\n\n*Next up, if you do need a desktop user, why does that have to be the same person as the user running the web server (www-data by default)? Simply keep them separate and make sure your files' permissions aren't too open. Something like sudo chmod 750 /var/www/ should be enough to stop others reading.\n\n*Cripple Grub to remove recovery mode.\n\n*Password lock BIOS (usually won't protect against a BIOS/CMOS reset)\n\n*Hot-glue the CMOS battery in and cover the CMOS reset jumpers\n\n*Melt the SATA cable into the disk and motherboard using a soldering iron or tons of glue.\n\n*Obfuscate and watermark your files on each deployment so that if they do get nicked you can trace it back to one client so that you can sue them.\n\n*Physical access restrictions are important too.\n\n*Perhaps most importantly, if you're going to deploy your software somewhere, make sure the person it's going to knows they are responsible for its safety. I sounds weird but it's not uncommon. Have a contract with them that outlines their liabilities if their copy of your code is leaked out.\nDo all that and it might take somebody good about ten minutes longer to work out how to get access to the files. That's mostly the time to warm up glue to remove it.\nIf you don't want them to ever get access, don't give them the files.

Can it be the kernel treads (whose amount of memory is not displayed) or a leak in Ubuntu itself?\nSomething which may be relevant is that the ammount of used memory shown by XFCE task manager is significantly lower than what free -m shows.\n\nA: By default, freeshows also memory used by cache and buffers\nIn the free -m output, as already said in the comments, you have to look to the line \n-/+ buffers/cache:       1106       2842\n\nto see exactly the quantity of memory used by applications, kernel and modules. In this case, you are using 1106 MB, which is almost 28% of the total memory. The rest is taken by the usual buffers and cache that helps the kernel to access files quicker.\nThe ps output shows the memory used by process\nIn the ps output I see that you still have the whole graphical desktop running, with a lot of components running. They take about 13% of the memory. \nAnd the modules...\nThe delta between the ps calculation and the free is constituted of the memory taken by the kernel and the modules loaded.\nAs the size column of the lsmod output only displays the size of the module on the filesystem (so the syse of the .ko file from which this module is loaded) it is not reliable to measure the memory used by them.\nA more reliable approach to measure the memory used by modules is to use the slabtop utilities (installed from the procps package.\nAlso see the content of /proc/meminfo, it gives the total usage of the Slab memory, the memory used to efficiently allocate memory to kernel objects. (See Wikipedia for more details on Slab).\nIn conclusion\nMemory usage is a complex domain, and you will need more than one tool to see in details which piece of memory is used by what. free, ps, slabtop, /proc/meminfo content, top, vmstat, htop, ... all they can bring a piece of information helpfull to build the full picture on your particular memory usage.\n", "Q: Logon screen forever My ubuntu is in trouble,\nI changed my graphic card, tryed some manipulations, and now I get some problems with the login-screen.\nI have the login-screen, normal, but when I type on password ( I am sure it's the good one, ssh work fine ), after I valid I get a black screen, some rapid text in textmode, but I can't read, and next the login-screen again.\nI tryed to find something strange in Xorg logs, but I don't found.

Can I install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on it? Any specific steps I need to follow?\n\nA: Yes, of course you can.\nUbuntu can be installed on any laptop.\nThe only steps you have to follow are normal ones which you can easily google\n", "Q: Having major issues when trying to install Ubuntu, both 12.04 and 13.10 This is going to be rather long...\nI've used ubuntu for a while now and know my way around it pretty well. But my last install was 12.10 LTS and I used wubi to install it. It ran pretty well with only 30 GB.\nTo start off, I upgraded to a new PC and the motherboard has the new UEFI BIOS(if thats what it is called, I can use the mouse in it and it seems to be a much better GUI than before)\nI now have a new computer and I installed windows 7 first as it seemed to be the safer way, once I was done setting that up I downloaded 13.10 to install and created a separate partition through windows's partition manager as suggested by the wiki. I proceeded to create a bootable usb and it started the installation well. After I got to the language selection page I selected english and it proceeded to reboot and then nothing happened. I tried to do it again but after I hit install ubuntu in GRUB it would do the same thing over again. \nOnce I did that I thought I should install using wubi again, but once I was done installing with it I noticed that there were a lot of problems with the way things were rendering on my screen, the mouse left long trails and input was laggy. I thought it might be a driver issue and started the updates, once those were downloaded(all 190 MB) and installed I rebooted and selected ubuntu from windows's boot menu. But I got the same problem all over again.\nSo I uninstalled it by using the wibi-uninstall and decided to use the partition manager while installing ubuntu itself. Again selecting install Ubuntu in GRUB was not working, so instead I selected try Ubutu and then hit install on the desktop. It did not recognize my windows install so I selected others and I made the proper partitions and allocated swap space and proceeded to install. Once that was done I rebooted and now my pc wasn't booting. Even the windows boot menu wasn't coming. I was glad I made a backup of windows before hand so I recovered that and got windows running again. But in the process I managed to create two versions of windows, one a clean new install and the other the recovered one which I am using right now.\nDeciding that 13.10 was not working out, I downloaded 12.04 and tried installing that though wubi but it did not even get to the installation screen after I was done inputting all the details in windows and restarting.\nI really would love to use  ubuntu as I do all my programming and tinkering on it. I really wonder what I have been doing wrong all this while.\nIf you read all of this then you are awesome! And Thanks!\n\nA: The way I've installed a dualboot system for others, is that I install Windows first, using small partition. I leave the rest unpartitioned and boot Ubuntu from a bootable USB stick, choose \"Use free space\" and let the installer care about the rest. I don't use Wubi for anything, and I suggest you do the same. :)\n", "Q: Can not switch language with keyboard I have added the locale language at installation.

The reason it is working with sudo is because the root user has those permissions regardless of the owner/group.  In fact, that may be the root cause here - when you run the mongod process with sudo it will create the files with root:root ownership which the normal mongodb user cannot access.\nThe user:group for MongoDB on Ubuntu is usually mongodb:mongodb, hence just do the following:\ncd /tmp/arb\nsudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb .\n\nSince you are running an arbiter here I would also recommend the following options in your config file (note: not for use on a regular data bearing node - arbiter only):\n\n\n*\n\n*nojournal=true \n\n*noprealloc = true \n\n*oplogsize = 1\n\n*smallfiles=true\n\n\nThese settings will minimize the footprint of the arbiter on the host.\n", "Q: pip install ...

For example:\nsed -i -r 's/<!--(UpdateAccountGUIDs.+?)-->/<\\1>/' File.XML\n\nHere, the -r enables extended regular expression syntax so we can use () to capture a group (without needing to escape the parentheses) and then refer to the captured text as \\1.

However when they click on firefox's \"File\" Menu and click open or save page as, the file dialog show up so they can explore the file system including my back end application files and mapped network drive which I seriously want to hide for security reason. I've found methods to hide those in nautilus using the .hidden file but it doesn't work in file/save dialog.\nAs I'm very new to Linux, I created user accounts for them as standard users and I think all user has read access to file system by default (and should they need it to make operating system and application run properly?) Then can't I take read permission out from them? Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nSo can i just prevent users from open file dialog? An approach i can think now is that are there any file system or library file that handle those file/save dialog? so that i can edit permission of them and the users will get permission denied dialog instead. \nFor example, in the case below\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1363852\nthey remove the file: /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/printbackends/libprintbackend-file.so to disable \"print to file\" function.\nAnd another case\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+question/186540\nthey edit permission of the folder: /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfsd-smb-browse to prevent users from clicking \"Browse Network\" button in Nautilus.\nIf not possible, any suggestion to hide file system and mapped network folder in file dialog? Please help every suggestion will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The simplest way to do this is to use permissions. The permissions for files and directories on Linux and similar systems have 3 basic levels, the permissions of the file's owner, their group and everyone else. \nFor example, on my system, I create a new user called foo:\nsudo adduser foo\n\nThis newly created user belongs to the group foo only (sudo -u foo lets me run commands as the user foo, in this case, groups which lists the groups that a user belongs to):\n$ sudo -u foo groups\nfoo\n\nSo, let's create a file:\nsudo -u foo touch /tmp/file\n\nAnd have a look at its permissions:\n$ ls -l /tmp/file \n-rw-r--r-- 1 foo foo 0 Apr  2 17:49 /tmp/file\n---------    --- --- =================================> The file's group\n |  |  |      |=======================================> The file's owner\n |  |  ------> Others (everyone else): read only\n |  |--------> Group permissions: read only\n |-----------> Owner permissions: read/write\n\nSo, as you can see in the example above, a file has 3 levels of permissions. Since that was created as the user foo, my regular user terdon cannot write to it:\n$ echo \"hello\" > /tmp/file\nbash: /tmp/file: Permission denied\n\nIn order to list the contents of a directory a user needs read permissions and in order to move into it, they need execute permission. Therefore, to hide the contents of a directory, simply remove the read and execute rights. Taking /media as an example:\n$ ls -dl /media\ndrwxr-xr-x 9 root root 4096 Mar 25 20:15 /media\n\nAs you can see above, the owner, the group, and everyone else all have execute rights to the directory (that's what the x means). What we want to do is make it so that only the owner and group members have access to it, so we will need to remove the read and execute rights from the \"other\" field:\n$ sudo chmod o-rx /media\n$ ls -dl /media\ndrwxr-x--- 9 root root 4096 Mar 25 20:15 /media\n\nAs you can see above, /media now has no execute right in the \"others\" field which means that only members of the group root and the user root themselves can access it. \nWhat all this means, is that you can create users and fine tune them to have access to only specific files. However, be very careful with permissions, changing the permissions of system folders is very dangerous and should not be done. Instead, if you have specific directories you want to hide, just change their permissions and leave the system directories alone. So, in your case, if you have the backend files in /backendan d your mapped network drive somewhere in/media`, just run this command to block read access to these directories:\nsudo chmod o-rx /media /foo/\n\nFor more info on how permissions can be set, see man chmod or any of the many tutorials you can find online, this one for example.\n", "Q: Cant change size of wallpaper (stock or from home/pictures) 13.10 using gnome3 Anyone got any idea why there are no options to adjust selected desktop wallpaper (ie Zoom / scale etc) in ubuntu 13.10 and gnome3 (works fine in unity but i really dont like using it).\nSame issue for stock wallpaper and my own photos in /home/pictures:\nGeneral system specs\nPentium E2160 @ 1.8Ghz x 2\nGeForce 7300GS/PCIe/SSE2\n64Bit\n2.0Gb Mem:\nDual monitor setup using 2 x acer LCD screens (AL1716 and AL2202W) latter is selected as main display\nSystem updates all done\n\n\nA: You can adjust  your gnome desktop  wallpaper  using dconf-editor tool.\nOpen it by pressing alt + f2 and enter dconf-editor .

Ubuntu is now set as default OS (it automatically loads Ubuntu). \nMy question is how can I reinstall Windows XP without removing Ubuntu? Windows XP is installed in separate partition. I am concerned that if I start reinstalling Windows XP, Ubuntu will be deleted.\n\nA: You'll have to check how your disk is set up. If you don't have any NTFS primary partitions, you'll have to make one (or resize the one with the most free space). Then you install Windows XP on that NTFS partition. Once you've done that, boot into a live system (live DVD, or USB flash drive), then run grub-install During the install, GRUB will detect your Windows and Ubuntu partitions and create entries for both. Afterwards, you can change the configuration of how you want to boot your system (the length of the auto-boot countdown, and what's the first boot option if countdown is reached).\n\nA: At the disk setup screen when installing Windows you will need to choose the partition where Windows is currently installed and leave the Ubuntu partition(s) alone. Windows will override the grub boot loader. After you install Windows you will need to do as ki2ne suggests: run grub-install from a live Ubuntu CD/DVD/Flash drive. \n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 booting from a thumb drive - how to reasonably safely eject the drive after boot?

Any other ideas?\n\nA: After the machine comes up, you should be able to use something like\n# Remount as read-only\nmount -o remount,ro /\n\nAlternatively, you can set it to read-only in the fstab and use something like\n# Remount as read-write\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n", "Q: Setting path in ubuntu 13.10 In Ubuntu 13.10 I installed :\nstable_Ubuntu-13.10-i686.deb and Ubuntu-13.10-i686.deb, but when starting GNURadio the following message appears : \nCannot import gnuradio.\n\nIs the python path environment variable set correctly?\nAll OS: PYTHONPATH\n\nIs the library path environment variable set correctly?\nLinux: LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nWindows: PATH\nMacOSX: DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I set python path and the library path environment variable to the correct value?\n\n\nA: First try running this command to configure the libraries:\nsudo ldconfig\n\nIf that doesn't solve it, you'll need to add these lines to ~/.profile file:\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib\n\nThis assumes that you actually have python2.7 installed and that /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages is not empty.

If not, it should fail.\nI cannot find a way to differentiate the live session and a \"normal\" user session, as the live session has a look-and-feel very close to the installed system sessions. The only thing I can tell so far is that live sessions always have ubuntu as the hostname, but I cannot rely on that since the user can choose this when installing Ubuntu.\nIs there a way of identifying this in a shell script / command line?\n(I hesitated between posting on Ask Ubuntu or Stack Overflow, I can delete the post and re-post on Stack Overflow if more appropriate)\n\nA: There are many distinguishing features between a live session and normal session. At the first shot it comes in my mind that there is no real user in a live session. One can exploit this. \nSo, there would not be any gid greater than 999 in /etc/passwd corresponds to any real user except nobody user.\n$ awk -F: '($3>=1000){print $1}' /etc/passwd\nnobody\n\nThe following script should work,\n#!/bin/bash\n\nvar=$(awk -F: '($3>=1000){print $1}' /etc/passwd | wc -l)\nif [[ $var -gt 1 ]]; then\n    echo \"normal session\"\nelse\n    echo \"live session\"\nfi\n\n\nA: No, the name is arbitrary, you can't assume anything based on that. However, the Live session does have a few quirks such as:\n$df -h | grep -w /\n/cow        2.0G   42M   1.9G  3% /\n\nAs you can see, the special device /cow is mounted on /. I'm not sure how portable this is, I doubt it will be the same for non Ubuntu Linuxes and it may also change in future releases but as long as it's not an actual device in /dev you can test for this very easily:\ndf | grep -w / | grep -q 'cow' && echo \"Live session\" || echo \"Normal install\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*df : print mounted file systems\n\n*grep -w / : print only the line that shows what is mounted on /. The -w option matches whole words only so that only / and not for example /home will be printed.\n\n*grep -q cow : The -q suppresses output, grep will exit with status >0 (error)if cow was not found and 0 (correct) if it was.\n\n*&& echo \"Live session\" : PrintLive sessionif thegrep` was succesful\n\n*|| echo \"Normal install\" : Else, print Normal install.\n\n\n\nEDIT BY THE OP\nIn the end, here is the solution I implemented in my script, if it's somewhat useful:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ ! $(df | grep -w / | grep -q '/cow') ]; then\n  printf \"This script must be run from a live session.\\n\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n", "Q: Debian Unstable equivalent in Ubuntu I want use Ubuntu with the latest stable software instead of latest stable packages. As far as I'm aware the Debian equivalent is the Debian Unstable version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the daily live images released by Ubuntu equivalent?\n\n*Does it continue updating with the latest stable software after a new stable Ubuntu version is released? As in, with the daily live installation of Trusty, does it continue updating with development software after Trusty goes golden?\n\n\nI'm not sure, but I think I read on Mark Shuttleworth's blog that the development version of Ubuntu is stable enough to use on desktops. I'm neither trusting nor doubting the statement, but that post seemed to imply of continuous development releases like a rolling release.\nPlease enlighten me.\n\nA: For developement releases, the vast majority of Ubuntu packages are imported from Debian Unstable/Testing:\n\nPrior to\n  DebianImportFreeze, new\n  versions of packages will be automatically imported from Debian where\n  they have not been customized for Ubuntu, that is when the version\n  number of the package in the current Ubuntu development branch does\n  not contain the substring \"ubuntu\" and there is a newer version in\n  Debian. Imports from Debian are either from the unstable or testing\n  branch, depending on the release (see \"Derives from:\" field on\n  http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/ for more information).\n\nFor LTS releases, not only there are SRU for important bug fixes but point releases are\nalso a way to get new hardware support, new drivers:\n\nOn a regular basis, the LTS release gets a point update which includes\n  access to a new, current kernel (supporting new hardware without\n  regressing the old hardware on the previous kernel, which remains\n  supported), new OpenStack (via the Cloud Archive), and various other\n  elements.\n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1246\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\n\n*What is hardware enablement (HWE)?\n\nA: To answer your question directly: there is no equivalent to unstable ( where developers upload new packages all the time and you get them right away, never having to dist-upgrade ) in Ubuntu.  The closest thing is the current development release, which behaves as unstable does, until it becomes a stable release, at which point, you have to dist-upgrade to the new development release if you don't want to remain stable.\n", "Q: Surfraw configuration files missing I recently installed surfraw on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nsurfraw documentation and web help suggests that these two configuration files should be present:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/surfraw.conf\n\n*~/.surfraw.conf\n\n\nBut neither are present on my PC.

You can use a separate /home partition for sharing large data like music,files, videos between installations, and then add multiple smaller root partitions with completely separate operating systems on them (12.04/13.10 etc) so that if you want to get rid of one or replace one with a different version or operating system altogether, your personal files don't get deleted because they are on a separate partition.\n", "Q: How can I disable quick search in unity file explorer?

But now that I have replaced xubuntu with ubuntu, with the same root password and name, the encrypted drive is visible again! Doesn't this imply that the encryption key is replaced (or diminished in value) by my mere 6-character password?\n\nA: I might be resurrecting the dead, but I guess a late answer is better than no answer.\nThe way ecryptfs works is that the actual files are encrypted with a proper key, however this key is then stored encrypted by your user password in a file 'wrapped-passphrase' in the ~/.ecryptfs directory.\nAlthough I'm no crypto expert, this does seem to suggest that your password is replaced by a mere 6 character password, so I would suggest to replace it with something strong.\nWhile i'm not aware of the actual encryption scheme used in encryptfs, this doesn't have to mean that your 6-character key can actually be brute-forced. The key derivation method could be made prohibitively expensive as this only has to be done once for the correct password (by requiring thousands of decryption cycles for example), but doesn't impact the performance of the actual decryption of the files as this can be done with the longer secure key, once it is decrypted.\n", "Q: 12.04 desktop is frozen.

All of these presentation programs are great when used consistently, but they run into issues when trying to interpret closed formats that aren't made by the company that develops them.  \nIf you can't make one of those programs your standard everywhere (you do realize there's Libreoffice and Kingsoft for Windows, right?) I'd recommend exporting it into a PDF and presenting it from that.  You won't be able to edit it, but that's what I'd do if all you're trying is to show it. \nIf the only problem is the background opacity (I doubt it, there's probably all manner of weird glitches), you can change the opacity of the background in Libreoffice - go into 'Master View' to edit the slide templates, and you can mess with the uneditable background content as if it were just text and images.  \n\nA: If you are using a .pptx file format you should export to Libreoffice format. Then you can open it good.\n\nA: If you want 100% compatibility, either ditch MS-PPT or create all your presentations using LibreOffice. LO support for special and rarely used features, is far from perfect. If you need your presentations to be compatible, I would recommend using Wine or create your presentation in LibreOffice from the start.\nI would also recommend to fill a bug report in LO bug tracker so they know which features are missing.\n", "Q: Steam does not start after install in 13.10 I have installed steam on my Laptop running 13.10, When I click on steam icon, it wont launch,So I have given \"steam\" command in terminal.Following is the output \nRunning Steam on ubuntu 13.10 64-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(0_client)\nUploading dump (out-of-process) [proxy '']\n/tmp/dumps/crash_20140402034337_1.dmp\n/home/saikiran/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 755:  6814 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $STEAM_DEBUGGER \"$STEAMROOT/$PLATFORM/$STEAMEXE\" \"$@\"\nmv: cannot stat ‘/home/saikiran/.steam/registry.vdf’: No such file or directory\nInstalling bootstrap /home/saikiran/.local/share/Steam/bootstrap.tar.xz\nReset complete!\nRestarting Steam by request...\nFinished uploading minidump (out-of-process): success = yes\nresponse: CrashID=bp-1e1a9170-2ae6-46c1-bc74-3c0db2140401\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 13.10 64-bit\nSTEAM_RUNTIME has been set by the user to: /home/saikiran/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(0_client)\nUploading dump (out-of-process) [proxy '']\n/tmp/dumps/crash_20140402034339_1.dmp\n/home/saikiran/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 755:  6943 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $STEAM_DEBUGGER \"$STEAMROOT/$PLATFORM/$STEAMEXE\" \"$@\"\nFinished uploading minidump (out-of-process): success = yes\nresponse: CrashID=bp-06b25061-5bb4-42c2-b835-bc2e92140401\n\nI have tried removing ~/.steam/steam/appcache as indicated in other threads\nI have installed Steam on Xubuntu 14.04 beta, still same thing happens.\n\nA: I have raised a steam support ticket for this.

I have an Apache server running on Ubuntu, and by default it is using name-based virtual hosts. For some reason I have to make my local server publicly accessible, but the problem is that I am running internet with WLAN router, and my WLAN router allows IP forwarding only to local IP addresses (not name-based hosts), so I can't forward HTTP request to my external IP address to e.g. localhost, but I can forward to, say, 192.168.x.x.\nSo my question is, can I make my Apache server run on some 192.168.x.x address to make it possible for router to forward HTTP requests to my local server.\nSorry for my amateur naive language, I am quite new to networking and stuff.\nThanks in advance!\nEDIT\nip route output:\ndefault via 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0  proto static \n192.168.0.0/24 dev wlan0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.101  metric 9\n\nA: You can. Apache server represent himself with ip address from nic card. If you configure apache server to listen on port 80.

My Dell Vostro 1500 laptop has both Vista and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and a Broadcom Wireless 1390 WLAN Mini-Card. I have not been able to get wireless working, but it works fine in Vista. I installed the additional Broadcom STA wireless driver, but still not able to get wireless.\nDuring boot up, a message briefly appears saying that \nfirmware files b43/ucode5.fw and b43-open/ucode5.fw not found. Go to\nhttp://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/b43#devicefirmware and download the \ncorrect firmware for this driver version, carefully read all instructions on the  \nwebsite. \n\nMy question is will adding wireless firmware have an effect on wireless in Vista? \n(I was not able to successfully install ndiswrapper using the Software Center, so I am back to trying to get wireless working with the Broadcom STA wireless driver). \n\nA: In this context \"firmware\" refers to code essential for the running of the device that is loaded by the device's driver when it's initialised.  It isn't actually stored permanently on the device.\nThis is often referred to as \"microcode\" (cleverly abbreviated to \"µcode\") instead of firmware because it's small enough that it can be loaded onto the device each time it's powered up.\nThe \"firmware\" or microcode you load on one OS shouldn't affect the operation of that device on another because booting the other OS will load microcode from its own driver.\nObviously there are some devices which have a permanently flashed \"firmware\" on it, like complex self-sufficient devices such as routers, smartphones, NAS devices etc, but in those cases the firmware is pre-loaded onto the device already, rather than loaded on at boot via a device driver in the OS.  Such firmware can be \"updated\" by obtaining a special firmware update and installing it in the way recommended by the manufacturer but it then replaces the permanent firmware that was already on the device.\nA Wifi adapter, such as a PCI/PCIe/USB based one, is almost certainly not storing any permanent configuration settings or firmware on the actual device and all code will be loaded by a driver on the PC each time the device is initialized.\n\nDuring boot up, a message briefly appears saying that firmware files b43/ucode5.fw and b43-open/ucode5.fw not found. Go to http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/b43#devicefirmware and download the correct firmware for this driver version, carefully read all instructions on the website.\n\nThis might not actually be the best way to install the firmware. This is a general Linux-based message that isn't tailored specifically to Ubuntu.  Ubuntu actually provides some easy-to-install firmware packages for common devices that you can simply install with apt-get, and may be a more robust alternative to downloading the raw firmware files from upstream.\nIn this case you may be able to install the b43 firmware with the Ubuntu command:\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\nShould this command not work for you there is some more information about that model of wifi adapter in this question.\nThe reason it's not installed by default but needs to be installed this way is almost certainly due to licensing restrictions; the microcode part of the driver is not open source and probably has a license that restricts it being distributed with Ubuntu - but the user (you) are allowed to download and install it yourself.\n\nA: If you have tried ndiswrapper unsuccessfully, I suggest you remove it so there is no conflict:\nsudo apt-get purge ndiswrapper*\n\nThe firmware may be conveniently installed with:\nsudo apt-get install linux-firmware-nonfree\n\nAs has been noted, the firmware is not flashed to the device. It is called by the driver b43 as needed. In fact, I believe Windows uses a very similar system with .inf and .sys files.\n", "Q: A broken Wubi has been detected. Ubuntu is unable to boot from hard disk I've installed Ubuntu 12.04.04 alongside my Windows XP from USB, but it won't boot from hard disk, only from the USB.\nI suspect that the reason is because I am unable to change BIOS to boot from dev/sdc since BIOS only offers the hard disk that corresponds to dev/sda.  \nI have tried running Boot-Repair to no avail. The most recent boot info from this http://paste.ubuntu.com/7189172/  for this one, I set the boot to go to sda and then point to sdc6 for Linux.\nThere is also the following cryptic message from Boot-Repair: \nA broken Wubi has been detected. Please fix it this way:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#Cannot_boot_into_Ubuntu\n\nThat URL told me to close down Windows properly. However I can't boot into Windows, so that is pointless advice.\nI also tried telling Boot-Repair to boot into Windows from the hard disk, but that made it so I couldn't even boot from the USB.\nI appreciate any help that anyone can give. I don't know much about Linux, but I'm willing to learn.\n\nA: If you boot from drive that is sdc or the 120GB drive does not grub boot Ubuntu?\nYou also should use advanced options in Boot-Repair and restore a Windows boot loader to sda. That should boot the Windows in sda if that is a bootable Windows.\nOn sdc use gparted to move boot flag from sdc8 to sdc1. Windows uses boot flag to know what partition to boot, what partition to repair to what partition to istall into. So boot flag needs to be on primary NTFS partition with Windows. Grub does not use boot flag. And if booting with grub you do not have to have boot flag on sdc1, but if you need to repair it or install a Windows  boot loader you will need boot flag on sdc1.\nIf you have any data in wubi you want to save, back that up.

I couldn't open my computer using Windows 7 operating system and I didn't have my files backed up, so I opened it using ubuntu,stored in a usb stick, without installing. I(a friend of mine, I am just a noob) created a partition that used to contain all my files, with the name \"161 GB Volume\"(my hd capacity is 1TB). \nOnce I accidentally started the installation of Ubuntu, but not in the \"161.. \" area.

When I turned it back on, Ubuntu failed to work period. I can get control of the mouse, but it's just a blank screen, nothing to click on, no keyboard commands are working.\nNow, I'm not too worried about this -- a reinstall will probably fix that.  The issue is that I have a brace of about twenty OpenOffice files that would make my boss very grumpy if I lost. Is there any way to recover them?\nI've made a boot disk using a USB drive, but even when I boot from the flash drive, I can't see the files that need rescuing.  Is there some way to recover them? Please explain it in simple language for an inexperienced Linux user.\n\nA: If you have a 13.10 Live USB, you should be able to boot from it and do a repair install. During the installation process, if you select this, it will reinstall Ubuntu but keep all your original files that were in the home folder.\nIf you open the file manager while in a Live USB session, you should see your Ubuntu installation in the shortcut panel on the left. The users' files are in the home folder.\nAlso, if you have everything backed up to some place like Ubuntu One, it should be no trouble to restore the files.\n", "Q: Which of the filesystems supported by Ubuntu is the most resistant to file corruption? I want to ask wich file system is the most damage and file corruption resistant. I mean the most secure for my data preventing data loss and such in case of a blackout or power failure. \nFor example: I want my data to be safe if someone disconnects my Ubuntu machine from the power outlet by accident.\n\nA: There are various levels of corruption resistance in file systems in the event of loss of power, from least to most corruption-resistant.\n\n\n*\n\n*File systems with no journalling.\nExamples: ext2, fat32, fat16\nSuch file systems have no protection against file system corruption due to loss of power.  After a power loss during a write, the metadata for the file may be in an inconsistent state, meaning that the file system is effectively corrupted and needs repair.  A repair won't necessarily be able to successfully recreate a file's metadata from a single point in time.  In some cases, for example, a repair tool may not be able to know certain details about a file.\n\n*File systems with a writeback journalling mode.\nExamples: ext3/ext4 with data=writeback, NTFS\nWrites to the metadata for files is journalled.  After a power loss during a write, the metadata for the file can be rolled back leaving the file system in a consistent state requiring no repair.  However, any changes to the actual data of a file won't be able to be rolled back and the file may be left in an inconsistent state.\nA file may even be left with old data from before a write operation even if its metadata is successfully committed.\n\n*File systems with an ordered journalling mode.\nExamples: ext3/ext4 with data=ordered \nPretty similar to the writeback mode.  Writes to the metadata for files is journalled, and the system ensures that the file data is written before the metadata change is committed in the journal.  After power loss during a write, the metadata can be rolled back leaving the file system in a consistent state requiring no repair.  Any changes to the actual data of a file won't be able to be rolled back and the file may be left in an inconsistent state.\nWhere this differs from the writeback mode is that you at least will never be left with older data in a file than its metadata, and will never be left with data that previously didn't belong to that file.  If metadata is committed, then it is guaranteed that the file data is at least up to date with the metadata, though it may still contain some newer data from part of a later write to that file.\nHaving this constraint can improve security and improves the ability for applications to implement their own data integrity measures that rely on the metadata for the file at least reflecting a write that was made to the file at some stage.\n\n*File systems with full journalled mode.\nExamples: ext3/ext4 with data=journal, Reiser4\nWrites to both the metadata and all file data are both journalled.  After power loss during a write, both the file's metadata and all its data can be rolled back to the state it was in prior to the failure.\nThis mode has the highest performance penalty because all data must be written twice, effectively cutting throughput in half.  Thus, it is rarely used.  Applications that rely on data integrity can take their own measures to ensure file data can be recovered from an inconsistent state, as long as they can trust the metadata on files.\n\n*Special mention: log-structured file systems or copy-on-write\nExamples: btrfs, ZFS\nSome file systems such as btrfs offer similar protection to a full journalled file system without as much performance penalty.  btrfs is a log-structured file system.  Writes to both the metadata and all file data are written to a big long write log which allows both file metadata and contents to be rolled back completely, but this requires no separate \"commit\" step for the file data, as the file data is duplicated as it's written to, allowing for rollback without writing twice.  If a write fails due to a power loss, the log is only replayed to the last successful write prior, which will still provide access to the old version of the file in its fully consistent state.\nZFS is a copy-on-write filesystem which has similar benefits to a log-structured file system.\n\nNote: Write caching and Barriers\nRegardless of the file system, write caching on the drive itself may optimise performance by performing queued write commands in a different order to their place in the queue.  However, this would effectively render all journalling useless, or at least all journalling modes other than writeback which is unlikely to be affected much by this optimization.\nTo combat this however, drives have implemented a concept of \"write barriers\" where the computer can tell the drive that it must complete all previous writes before a particular write can begin.  Modern operating systems use write barriers to ensure that journalling file systems benefit properly from the integrity offered by journalling.  In typical file write operations write barriers lose most of the performance benefit you would have gained from the drive's ability to perform writes out of order, but certain applications such as some database servers may still benefit from this even with write barriers enabled.\nWrite barriers can be disabled in the mount options for a partition but you probably don't want to do this if you are using one of the better journalling modes such as ordered or full journalling.\nSome disk drives are designed with their own dedicated back-up-battery which can be used to finish any writes in the write queue in the event of a power loss.  If you have such a drive and trust the back-up battery to do this, you can safely disable write barriers and benefit more from out-of-order writes in the drive.\n\nThe current default for Ubuntu is ext4 which has an ordered journalling mode.  This is much better than no journalling at all, because the file system itself won't be left in a corrupted state, and it's a step up over writeback, because it guarantees that if a file's metadata is updated, its contents have been updated.  Note that the default for ext3 was changed to writeback a few years back.\nbtrfs was designed as a replacement for ext3/4, and future Linux distributions may switch to it as a default, though that is not a certainty. If this does happen, it will bring better ability to cleanly rollback with no significant performance penalty.\n\nA: The default filesystem, ext4, will be just fine in the event of a power loss, in terms of the filesystem itself, as is any journaling filesystem.  If you were thinking about individual files that were not completely saved at the time of the failure, then no filesystem can help those.\n", "Q: Create browse-files Button in quickly app How can i set the \"add button\" i have created using quickly application developer to pop up a regular \"browse to open files\" window whenever it is clicked ?

I've got a new laptop on which I've installed 13.10 and I use XFCE as my desktop. I want to use the laptop with an external monitor, and that works fine, mostly. However, when I use the \"Display\" settings control to select the screen to use, the blue box that shows up to tell me that my external monitor is \"HDMI1\" does not go away after I've set things up. Here's what it looks like:\n\nIt won't go away. I've dismissed the \"Display\" settings application, but the thing is still there. What is going on?\nOverall the XFCE display chooser seems to work much, much worse in 13.10 than in 13.04. It's a crapshoot whether it can re-enable the laptop display or not. I can do it reliably with xrandr, so I don't think it's a low-level problem.\nedit If I turn the external monitor off with xrandr and then back on, the stupid thing comes back.\n\nA: Ah. I found it.

I would like to get ride of the Windows OS but my problem is that all the tutorials I saw, are requiring to boot from a burned DVD or from a USB flash (to then install the \"OS-Uninstaller\"). My internal DVD drive is not working, and I use an external DVD drive. But my laptop model doesn't allow to boot from an external source (DVD drive or USB flash). I checked the laptop BIOS and the forums on HP, and it's a known limitation.\nIs there any way to install the \"OS-uninstaller\" straight into the hard disc and run it from there?\nThanks!     \n\nA: What have you been smoking? ;-) You are making your life way too difficult: Just install gParted in Ubuntu and you can remove any partition that is not mounted. That, ofcourse, includes your XP partition. From gParted you can also merge the removed partition into your current one or create a separate partition for Ubuntu.\nOnly if you want to delete the primairy operating system do you need your dvd/usb installer. \n\ngParted \n\nAfter installation it will be included in the launcher. Click it and you'll get an overview of all your discs, partitions on those discs (and labels identifying those partitions). Mark the XP partition for deleting or for formating to ext4 if you want to include it into Ubuntu. \nYou can identify Windows partitions due to them having NTFS (or older: FAT) as a filesystem but do take care not deleting any directory that holds personal data if there is a 2nd Windows partition (Ubuntu will mount such partitions so you can extract the data from it to your Ubuntu)\n\nA: Its just something comes into my mind, a bad Idea may be...\nJust FORMAT the drive that contains the windows, Most probably C drive\nPlease comment the result if somebody had allready dont this.\n", "Q: Running game server from bash without waiting for input I have a simple script which takes commands to start, stop, restart and return the status of a game server (SA:MP).

However, I would still like to use the VPN service for some programs, but not all.\nWith my current set up, on the computer I am keeping, I can click on the network icon in my panel (Gnome Classic) and toggle my VPN on and off. However, this is global and affects all internet connections from all programs. This is not ideal.

I intend to use a 120GB SSD for the OS's and most applications, and to store other data on a 1TB HDD. \nAfter scouring forums on the topic of partitioning drives for this sort of dual boot, I've come up with the following partition scheme, and I am looking for feedback on it:\nSSD - 120GB (Samsung 840 EVO):\n\n\n*\n\n*[C:] 60GB (NTFS) -> Windows system partition\n\n*[sda1] 20GB (ext4) -> /\n\n*[sda2] 10GB (ext4) -> /home ...

Am I missing any other advisable partitions or including unnecessary ones?\n\n*I've read conflicting advice about leaving unallocated space on SSDs. Is this necessary? Would I be better off allocating some/all of that space to Windows, or something else?\n\n*Is it a better practice to create a separate NTFS partition on HDD for data sharing between the Windows/Ubuntu than to just access the \"Windows data\" NTFS partition from Ubuntu?\n\n\n\nIf I am misunderstanding anything please let me know that too.\nNotes about my usage: I will be using Windows 7 for most day-to-day work as well as 3D computer graphics work (applications such as Maya, Unity).

The recommended way to upgrade Kubuntu versions is using kubuntu-devel-release-upgrade, which opens up a GUI window.\nIs there a purely command-line method for distribution upgrades?\nBackground\nWhen attempting to upgrade using the GUI, it progressed through \"Preparing to upgrade\", \"Setting new software channels\" and \"Getting new packages\", and then stalled on \"Installing the upgrades\". A window popped up saying:\n\nCould not install the upgrades. The upgrade has aborted. Your system\n  could be in an unusable state. A recovery will run now (dpkg --configure -a).\n\nI clicked \"OK\" (or was it \"close\"?), and the GUI now was stuck at 45%. I could no longer scroll the in-built terminal output, and the GUI window appeared to be stuck.\nLooking at the terminal from which I launched kubuntu-devel-release-upgrade, I can see\nConfiguration file '/etc/apport/crashdb.conf'\n ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.\n ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.\n   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:\n    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version\n    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version\n      D     : show the differences between the versions\n      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation\n The default action is to keep your current version.\n\nThis launch-terminal did not accept input. I killed the GUI process from the launching terminal, then ran dpkg --configure -a, which seems to continue where I left off, presenting me again with the above query.\nFrom the GUI, it seemed like there were two more steps: \"Cleaning up\" and \"Restarting the computer\". Is the former merely sudo apt-get --purge autoremove and sudo apt-get autoclean?\nI presume that this hang was due to the GUI \"Distribution Upgrade\" window being unable to accept text input. \nIn the future, is there a purely command-line method for distribution upgrades?\n\nA: sudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nI used this to upgrade to 14.10, and it worked fine, including allowing me to respond to prompts such as in the question above.\n", "Q: I can't install Ubuntu from iso but can from magazine cover disks I have an old Win XP with Celeron processor. I have tried to install numerous flavours of Linux and the only one I can get to install from an iso on DVD is Puppy, but I want Ubuntu. Strangely I can install from the free disks given away with Linux magazines. (The problem isn't with my iso discs because they work on my Win 7 Laptop) On the PC I am having problems with, I get as far as the boot choices screen then it starts loading for a few minutes & then goes to black flashing screen with cursor. I have tried all the usual suggestions such as Nomodeset etc all to no avail, yet install is straight forward off a magazine disc. Any suggestions? \n\nA: If it fails to install by a \"normal\" ISO, you will probably be able to install it from an alternate installer CD. It is text based, but straightforward and, apart from the nice GUI of the \"normal\" installer, it works the same.\nAfter that you will be able to use Ubuntu as if you installed it by the usual CD.\nYou can download the aternative installers here (not the network installers, but further down on the page)\n\nA: If I remember correctly, they have the nasty habit of setting up monitor frequency to 85Mhz after each fresh install with the nouveau driver activated. Minimum setings for video card resolution are usually 1024x768. I suppose your monitor cannot handle 1024x768_85mhz settings, and this is the reason you get the blank screen.\nYou can still login by exiting to the terminal console (press Ctrl+Alt+F1), and login with your username and password. Next you can change your root password by typing in this code:\n sudo passwd\n\nProvide your password, and enter a new UNIX password which will be your future password for root.\nYou can login as root next by typing this code in the console:\n su\n\nAnd enter your unix password. Once you are logged in as root you can try activating one of the following video drivers:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-96     or\n\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-173\n\nAfter reboot you should see the login greeter thus being able to login as user with your username and password. Next step would be to blacklist the nouveau driver if it is not already blacklisted in the /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf file. If the file does not exist you have to create it, add the following lines, and save the file as 'nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf' without the quotes:\nblacklist nouveau\n\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\n\nblacklist nvidia-current\n\nalias nouveau off\n\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\nFinally, after a second reboot you can run this code in a terminal to save your nvidia settings:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nIf you have an Ati Radeon video card, you should check which driver is suitable for your card and activate it in the same manner, I mean try to install it from the terminal console.\n", "Q: How to access personal ubuntu computer remotely Currently I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I want the steps to access my personal computer remotely without using team viewer.

Secure shell crypt traffic, also you can with option  -X from client start, on client, app from server.\nDetailed manual have on link here.\nIf you access ubuntu from win you can use putty.\n\nA: There is no standard way to login remotely to Ubuntu with GUI.\nI don't know of any good non-standard ways as well.\nYou cannot connect to an offline host because it is not online, obviously. However, if it's just turned off, it may be possible to setup the wake up on LAN/WAN feature on your network card. Consult manual for your BIOS for the details.

How much disk space is allocated in Ubuntu 12.04 if new user is added? I have 500GB completely allocated for Ubuntu. If a new user is added then how much disk space will be allocated for him?\n\nA: When a new user is created some KByte for his personal folder are allocated. \nWhen the users uses his account some more space is used for config files, caches etc. Depending on the programs used and their settings (like browser cache size) this may grow into a few GByte.\nUsually the biggest thing are the personal files a user stores in his account.\n\nA: In a default Ubuntu install everything is installed into one big partition (after setting aside some for swap), so the system and all users will share the one big space.\nThere are no per-user limits by default except that regular users are not permitted any more space once 95% of the partition is filled.  This leaves the remaining 5% usable only by system processes such as temporary files, logs etc.  On a modern drive of multi-terabyte size this 5% is usually overkill and you can reduce this as described here although hopefully there is no need.\nAs mentioned in the other answer you can turn on quotas in Linux which does allow you to configure per-user quotas but I've found this to be quite complicated.  There may be a graphical front-end that I'm not aware of that may make it easier.\n\nA: There is no limitations by default. The new user can take all of free space unless you install special quota program. To install it in Ubuntu, you have to write in Terminal:\nsudo apt-get install quota\n\nThere are plenty of tutorials on how to use quota in Linux around the Internet, just search \"quota ubuntu\".\nFor quick start, you may use this tutorial.\n", "Q: Remote invocation of shell script There are two systems A and B.

Or better to say what is the priority of the arguments which comes after a command?\n\nA: You saw the same result because I'm sure that you test those commands from your home directory which is /home/your_username equivalent with ~ - see Tilde Expansion, or $HOME environment variable. To test properly, you should use:\ncd / ; cd . ~\n\nand:\ncd / ; cd ~ .\n\nIn general if you use:\ncd first_directory second_directory\nyou will change the shell working directory to first_directory, not to second_directory, so the second argument in the cd command is ignored (see also help cd to understand better).\nAnd the . (dot) in this case is equivalent with the path of the shell current working directory which is given by pwd command (see Commandline shortcut for current directory similar to ~ for home directory?). \nSo cd . ~ is equivalent with cd . which is equivalent with cd $(pwd) and cd ~ . is equivalent with cd ~ which is equivalent with cd $HOME.\n\nA: It gives the same result because you're running them from your home directory.

I have a folder named ~kernel-ppa inside ~/Downloads.\naditya@aditya-desktop:~$ cd Downloads/\naditya@aditya-desktop:~/Downloads$ ls\n~kernel-ppa\n\nNow when I type cd ~k and press Tab for automatic expansion, the shell expands it to cd ~kernoops/ instead of cd ~kernel-ppa/ although the folder with same starting characters is already present.\nFor automatic expansion to work, I need to escape it with \\. Thus using cd \\~k and pressing Tab correctly expands it to cd \\~kernel-ppa/. Even using cd \\ and pressing Tab does the trick.\nWhy is it so and why do I need to escape? Moreover, what am I escaping since even ~ is not required for automatic expansion?\nIf I go with the flow and run cd ~kernoops/ and press Enter, the terminal status changes to //:\naditya@aditya-desktop:~/Downloads$ cd ~kernoops/\naditya@aditya-desktop://$ pwd\n//\naditya@aditya-desktop://$ ls\nbin   cdrom  etc   initrd.img  lost+found  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var\nboot  dev    home  lib         media       opt  root  sbin  sys  usr  vmlinuz\naditya@aditya-desktop://$ \n\nThis looks like the / directory, but pwd says it is //. What exactly is it?\n\nA: The tilde character (~) has a special meaning in the shell. When it is seen in any command, it is expanded to the name of your home directory.\nDoing cd ~ or cd /home/aditya is the same, it ends up in your home directory.\nBy putting a backslash character (\\) in front of the tilde, you tell the shell to not do the expansion of the following special character (this is what is called shell escape).\nBy doing cd \\~ you ask the shell to move to a directory called ~ that would be located under the directory you are doing the command.\nSo doing cd \\~kernel-ppa will change you to the directory called ~kernel-ppa, which is the normal behaviour.\nEDITED: more on ~\nIf you write a username of your system after the ~, you are moved to the home directory of that user. Doing a Tab expansion after cd ~ will expand to usernames existing on your system.\nIf do Tab completion after cd ~k, it expands to ~kernoops because there is user named kernoops in the system user, with a home directory of /.\nAs the expansion of cd ~k results into cd ~kernoops/ with a trailing slash and the home directory beeing /, you are moved to //. \nBut this is strictly the same as / as someothers already said earlier.\n\nA: As you know, ~ expands to your home directory. But what you seem to have missed is that ~john expands to the home directory of the user named \"john\".  \nCheck your /etc/passwd file:\n% grep ker /etc/passwd\nkernoops:x:107:65534:Kernel Oops Tracking Daemon,,,:/:/bin/false\n\nIt has a \"system user\" named kernoops (for internal bug reporting reasons). So when you type cd ~kTab the shell gives preference(1) to user name expansion before local directories expansion, and you have cd ~kernoops. Now  it results that user \"kernoops\" home dir is /, so it cds to it.\nIn my shell, zsh, I have no double slash(2):\n[:/] % cd ~kernoops/ \n[:/] % pwd\n/\n[:/] % cd //\n[:/] % pwd\n/\n\nAs an aside, this directory name is not well thought. It will need triple care in scripts and whatever. The only worst idea I can think is embedding a tab in it... \n\nFootnotes:\n(1) In zsh, even if I have a directory named ~xdir and no user starting with x; doing cd ~xTab does not expand and not quoting the ~ gives error:\n[:~/tmp/x] %  mkdir \\~xdir\n[:~/tmp/x] % ls\n~xdir\n[:~/tmp/x] % cd ~xdir  \nzsh: no such user or named directory: xdir\n[:~/tmp/x] 1 % \n\n(2) I seem to remember that posix made an exception for the initial // in a path --- it should be maintained because some old unix variant (I used the apollos with Domain/OS that had that) used //machine-name/... to seamless access other machines' filesystem in the local network (security was not invented yet). So probably bash is right here. If you do cd /// you will have the normal / in both shell, though.\nYes, found on unix.se!\n", "Q: Failed Ubuntu install - installing newer version I have been using 12.04 for the last couple of months and just tried to update to 12.10 ( via the update manager).

They offer UNLIMITED transfer and storage space; it works just like Dropbox.\nThe ONLY downside is that it is indeed BitTorrent; one computer has to be on with the files. I just let it run on my laptop. It's multiplatform, and its incredibly sharable. \nTher's also Dropbox, which I highly recommend. \n\nA: I use Google Drive with Insync. I think Insync is the most decent cloud service client for Ubuntu, as you can leave your files where they are, because Insync can follow symlinks.\n\nA: OneMediaHub (Funambol) is a good one. It's supported by large amounts of different hardware and operating systems. I sync my Android device with Google, Evolution, my Nokia N8, etc. It's really quite good. It's open source as well, so you can run it yourself if you want to. \nIt supports notes, contacts, calendar, todo, pictures, video, music and other files. \n", "Q: Coruppted Jenkins need to reinstall My jenkins looks like corrupted.

IMO you are better off building from source or using a ppa.\nFrom your description of the problem, your config file was somehow corrupted. simply removing and reinstalling a package will not fix the problem (it rarely does in Linux) because apt-get remove foo removes the libs and binary, but leaves the configuration files in place. When you then install apt-get install foo the config files remain.\nTo resolve this problem, IMO it is best to purge rather then remove a package (although if you prefer you can edit the config files to modify the behavior of apt-get).\nsudo apt-get purge jenkins\nsudo apt-get install jenkins\n\nIf the problem persists you may need to file a bug report against jenkins.\n", "Q: AMD Turbo Core not working - Change CPU driver?

(Archwiki has it all =-) https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powernow#CPU_frequency_driver )\nAccording to Phoronix (http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amd_fx8150_features&num=1) your CPU should be running at it's full speed, but the turbo frequency is just not displayed on linux for some strange reason.\nThe article is kind of old now (from 2011), and I expected that that sort of issue would have been solved by now, but I guess I was wrong...\nHere is another example that it is working, but the values are not being outputted correctly:\nLaunchpad Bug #1071434, comment 50\n\nA: [Update 2014-Aug-07]\nI published a detailed analysis over at unix-stackexchange.com which contains (at least for me) a few surprises. Such as the ondemand governor potentially being worse than performance (at least with the Richland A10-6700) and fglrx apparently using some questionable tricks to improve short-term boosts, abruptly having to compensate for that in the long run. I'm glad I had a closer look at this.\n[Original Answer]\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of cat /proc/cpuinfo does not, and will not, reflect any processor boost. The boost is an autonomous decision on the chip based on potentially complex criteria. Read about it here.\n\n*The output of cpufreq-info will not show available boost frequencies, but the output of cpupower frequency-info will.\n\n*The output of cpufreq-aperf (after modprobe msr) is comparable to the output of cpupower monitor. The frequencies shown by these tools are supposed to reflect boosts.\n\n", "Q: Is there another option besides MythTV for watching video files with remote control access? For one computer I have, I'd like to be able to watch videos I have in a local directory on the monitor, but be able to control which files play, and be able to pause, rewind, fast forward, and so on, from my Android tablet.\nI have set up a Mythbuntu computer before, with Android remote capability, but that seems overkill with so many features, when all I want to do is to be able to play video files.\nI looked into VLC Remote, but after some investigation, I'm unclear if the VLC remote allows me to control what's on the main computer monitor (which is what I want), or plays video on the Android device (which is not what I need).\nIs there some set up that will allow me to remotely control videos on my Ubuntu computer monitor from my Android device?\n\nA: You could take a look at XBMC. From what I gather from your post, it has everything you want.\n\nA: I've settled on using VLC, with VLC remote, to watch videos. It's simple to set up, and some automatic features are quite good.\n", "Q: How can I self-host Ubuntu One? The Ubuntu One service is closing and being open sourced:\n\nAdditionally, we continue to believe in the Ubuntu One file services,\n  the quality of the code, and the user experience, so will release the\n  code as open source software to give others an opportunity to build on\n  this code to create an open source file syncing platform.\n\nHow can I self-host the server and set up my Ubuntu One clients to use this server?\nI looked at the Launchpad project site, but it seems that all the server-side code is still hidden.\n\nA: You cannot self-host the server currently. It will be released as open source, meaning, some time in the future. There is still some work to do to make it possible to run it on arbitrary systems. When that happens, it should simply be a matter of using JuJu to deploy the service, or pulling it from the bzr branch and running it yourself.\nUntil then you will have to just wait, or write your own server based on the protocol, which is already open source.\n", "Q: Find the location of an installed application to type in the Launch Application window Many times I get this dialog when opening some files. It asks me to choose a program. I don't know where all programs reside and what to select? Where to find installed applications in Ubuntu?\n\n\nA: You need to choose the appropriate program to open that file. Most of the programs on Ubuntu are installed in /usr/bin/ directory. So, once you click \"Choose\" and the window pops up for you to  navigate to the program, navigate through /usr/bin/ and find the appropriate program. For example, if you have clicked on a torrent/magnet link, you would select transmission-gtk. To open an application installed in a custom directory, you need to navigate through that directory and select the program.\nIf you can't find the application in /usr/bin/; then the other appropriate directories to look out for are /bin/, /usr/share/, /usr/local/, /opt/.

Windows will not support PAE so you will be limited to 4gb of accessible ram, but many versions of the linux kernel available in distro repos have PAE built in, and by default the Ubuntu 32bit kernel comes with PAE out of the box so you will have access to all 8gb while using the linux install so you should not be worried about that. \n", "Q: do I have to download a full 800-900 MB setup or only a smaller specific upgrade? When the TT 14.04 is released, on upgrading from SS 13.10, do I have to download a full 800-900 MB setup or only a smaller specific upgrade? I'm only asking this out of curiousity anyway, but bandwidth back here in my country is pretty limited so better to know beforehand.\n\nA: It is hard to say. The upgrade process will calculate how much needs to be downloaded. \nIt may be larger, if you have installed some application X (where X is any application) that was at version n in the Saucy repository and is at version n+1 in the Trusty repository, then an upgrade will download that as well. If you do a fresh install, you will need to download that application X separately and install it again.\nIt may be smaller, if you uninstall some of the default applications in Ubuntu 13.10 that you don't need, such as Mahjong etc. Those applications won't be upgraded to the newer versions that will come with 14.04. There are some downsides to upgrade. \nAs @user205301 has pointed out. You can also upgrade from the LiveDVD/USB. This option will keep your /home folder and all the data in it while removing some (if not all) of the user installed applications X.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I upgraded to beta a few days ago. It took me 1 GB of data compared to 932 MB iso and 5 hours to be upgraded. It is definitely slower than fresh install. You should do upgrade only when you have tons of programs which otherwise would need re-install. By the way, a friendly suggestion. Create a separate /home partition so that if you do fresh installs, you can keep all your data without wiping it away.\n", "Q: How can I show all file types contained in a directory? Is there any command which tells me in the specific directory which types of files exist?\nI can find out the file type by using a command like od -c myfile | less.\nBut I don't know how to do it for all files in a directory.\n\nA: I would probably do something like this -\nfind . -type f -exec file {}  \\;\n\nThat will search from the current path, for files (e.g. no directories) and then execute the file command on each file.\n\nA: Although od -c will indeed show the contents of a file, it is not a good way to get its file type. While some files will contain a header with the file type, not all will. A better way is the command file:\n$ echo \"hello\" > foo.txt\n$ file foo.txt\nfoo.txt: ASCII text\n\nSo, to get a list of all file types in a directory, you can do:\nfor file in dir/*; do file \"$file\" | cut -d: -f 2; done | sort -u\n\nExample output:\n PNG image data, 1500 x 500, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced\n ASCII text\n directory\n GIF image data, version 89a, 22 x 22\n ELF 64-bit LSB  executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=becf821e4d814fdb69306d0b3f686eb06992f5e5, stripped\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*for file in dir/*; do ... done; : iterate through everything in dir (dir is just an example, you should change this to the name of the actual directory you want to search through), saving each item in turn as $file\n\n*file \"$file\" :  run file on each of the items found. \n\n*cut -d: -f 2 : print only the second field (fields defined by :)\n\n*sed 's/^ //; s/ +/ /g' : remove spaces from the beginning of the line and convert consecutive spaces into a single space.\n\n*sort -u : remove duplicate file types\n\n\nA: Try this:\nls | xargs file -b | sort | uniq\n\nHow it works:\nls: list directory contents\nfile -b: determine file type; do not prepend filenames to output lines\nsort: sort lines\nuniq: omit repeated lines\n", "Q: Have I installed ubuntu?

When we install a package in Ubuntu using apt-get install, where can we find the .deb files ?\nI installed Python using this method but I did not find its .deb file in /var/cache/apt/archive/.\n\nA: By default, apt stores the .deb files in /var/cache/apt/archives. If you can't find them here, you or someone else or something else(a software like Ubuntu tweak) may have run a clean-up command like sudo apt-get clean to clear up the .deb files. However, you can manually search all .deb files in your system by doing the following(may require superuser privileges):\nsudo updatedb\n\nThis will update locate's database to search for newly created/removed files, this may take a while depending upon the difference in time when the last time updatedb was run(it is usually run as a cron job daily) and then\nlocate *.deb\n\nwhich will search your / folder recursively for all files ending with .deb.\n", "Q: How to copy app ( installed from software center) and send to another ubuntu computer I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and my friend also has Ubuntu 12.04, he does not have internet so I want to send my apps to his computer (apps that I have downloaded from software center).

I don't know why, but you may try.\nps: my Gparted is Gparted-live.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove items from \"System Settings\" I would like to remove or disable some unused settings panels in system settings/gnome-control-center to keep my more \"ambitious\" users from messing with them.\nSpecifically, I would like to disable/remove the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Printers (because we don't have any attached to these machines) \n\n*Details (because it lets you set actions on removable media)\n\n*Keyboard (because it lets you set shortcut keys - not a dealbreaker)\n\n\nThis seems like it should be pretty straightforward (I can remove them from the Applications menu by setting Hidden=true in the .desktop file associated with the panel), but they stubbornly remain in System Settings when I do that.\nAm I missing something, or are we stuck with these panels in the Settings application forever?\n\nA: OK, I think I found a workaround -- gnome-control-center doesn't respect Hidden=true in the gnome-whatever-panel.desktop file, but it's not smart enough to display a panel if you completely remove the associated .desktop file.\nSo for the panels I've listed you can remove/disable them by deleting the following files:\n/usr/share/applications/gnome-printers-panel.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/gnome-info-panel.desktop\n/usr/share/applications/gnome-keyboard-panel.desktop\n\n\nAs MikeyB noted in his comment making these files unreadable by \"other\" is also an option - I tested this (chmod 640) on a spare box and it appears to work, disabling the panels for \"normal\" users while still leaving them available to root and members of the root group.\n\n\nThere are two notable disadvantages to this approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*This completely disables those panels for ALL users.\nYou can't even invoke them manually by running gnome-control-center info or similar as Radu Rădeanu mentioned - They just won't launch.  \n\n*Updates to gnome-control-center & related packages may bring the panels back.\nThis basically means checking after each software update to be sure they're still gone (or have appropriately restrictive permissions), and deleting/chmoding the .desktop files again if necessary.\nFor my purposes neither of those are a huge issue since I configure these machines from the command line anyway & the system settings panels are just for users to make minor \"personality tweaks\" so unless this workaround\n\nA: No, unfortunately you can't remove any of Printers, Details, or Keyboard from System Settings. These are called \"PANELS\" and are hard coded in the gnome-control-center package. If you remove this package, you will not have System Settings anymore.\nLet say that you remove those icons and names from the main panel of System Settings. Anyway, a user can open any one of them from terminal using one of the following commands:\ngnome-control-center info\ngnome-control-center keyboard\ngnome-control-center printers\n\nSee man gnome-control-center for more info.\n\nA: Given that changing the permissions accomplishes your goal, check out this magic:\ndpkg-statoverride --update --add root root 640 /usr/share/applications/gnome-printers-panel.desktop\ndpkg-statoverride --update --add root root 640 /usr/share/applications/gnome-info-panel.desktop\ndpkg-statoverride --update --add root root 640 /usr/share/applications/gnome-keyboard-panel.desktop\n\nYou can remove the overrides with:\ndpkg-statoverride --remove /path/to/file\n\n(but note this won't reset the original permissions)\n", "Q: line 45 Syntax error: unexpected end of file Now no matter what I do it just always says that even with a fi it doesnt do that help me debug the code please. also this has 44 lines of text and it says line 45 also the ascii art is just a dog it might look odd though since we are in a smaller area.\n#!/bin/bash \nclear \n\necho \"Hello Sir How are you?

Then, you should quote the variables and strings inside the [ ] test construct, and you should also be aware that your script will break on spaces and unexpected input.\nA working version of your script would be:\n#!/bin/bash \nclear \n\necho \"Hello Sir How are you?

Even if I enter date, you might want to add some exit calls in there.\n\nA: You missed a fi here, and I cleaned it up a little (e.g. disposal) - \nif [ \"$word\" = \"picture\" ]; then\n  echo \"These are the following pictures I have at my disposal: Dog\"\nfi # <-- Right there.\n\n", "Q: Power Saving mode after start-up (12.04.4) I have and issue that I can't seem to find right answer to. Immediately after purple loading screen I get an notification \"Entering power saving mode\", and I can't do nothing about it. If it's of any help I had graphic driver issues that I solved right before power saving issues. I can access command line over tty and give more info, just tell me what info please. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: I managed to fix my issue. I reinstalled xserver-xorg (sudo aptitude reinstall xserver-xorg). I dont't know how was issue fixed by performing this action, but it's fixed. It would be nice if someone could provide enlightenment regarding this issue and this solution.\nIf you ask me why I reinstalled xserver-xorg, the answer is because I previously had issues with proprietary graphic drivers, and after I fixed them, I reinstalled xserver-xorg. Everything worked fine until first restart, and the rest is start of this thread. That is the reason for my action.\nAgain, this is just a solution that helped me solve this threads issue, it might not be recommended or even right, I think I owe an answer since I found one.

You should be able to fix it with this command:\nsudo chmod 1777 /tmp\n\nThat will set the permissions to 777 (rwx for everyone) and also set the sticky bit which is recommended for the /tmp dir. As explained in man chmod:\n\nRESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT\nThe  restricted  deletion  flag  or  sticky  bit is a single bit, whose\n  interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it  prevents\n  unprivileged  users  from  removing or renaming a file in the directory\n  unless they  own  the  file  or  the  directory;  this  is  called  the\n  restricted  deletion  flag  for the directory, and is commonly found on\n  world-writable directories like /tmp.  For regular files on some  older\n  systems,  the  bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so\n  it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.\n\n\nA: The reason for this is that your /tmp is symlinked to another location, /home/tmp. But MySQL is armored by AppArmor, which does not allow writing freely to /home/tmp. To remedy the situation, you can edit the /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/user-tmp and add the /home/tmp there appropriately; for me the extra lines\n  owner /home/tmp/**    rwkl,\n  /home/tmp/            rw,\n\ndid the trick.\n", "Q: I have updated GCC, but g++ still seems to be using the stl files from the old GCC I run ubuntu 12.04.

While the specific limit temperatures will depend on your hardware, the output you show states that the critical temperature is 100°C. Since you are at approximately half that, I wouldn't worry about it.\nNote that this does not apply across the board. Just in this particular case where you know the critical temperature. Anyway, 55 is low for just about anything, I don't think there is any component that will have issues with such a low temperature. \n\nA: Check out this link for temp_throttle script CPU overheating.

A couple of months ago the camera spontaneously stopped working; I'm not sure what the trigger was, but it could have been an update.\nNow I see that the Bluetooth is not working either.  Neither of the devices seem to be recognized (e.g. there is no /dev/vid*).\nOutput of lsusb:\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 0eef:790a D-WAV Scientific Co., Ltd \nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\n\nThe devices work fine in both Windows 8 and the Live USB that I used for the original 13.10 install.  Here's the output of lsusb from the Live USB version:\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

Why do they not appear above?  Could they be connected through the \"Integrated Rate Matching Hub\", which is also missing? \nI upgraded to 14.04 beta today hoping that a bug might have been fixed, but the problem persists.\nEdit: The Live USB I mentioned is running the kernel from linux-image-3.8.0-19-generic.  I just booted that kernel with the installed version of Ubuntu, but the same problem persists, so it's not obvious to me whether or not this is a kernel issue.\n\nA: I managed to fix the problem.  Looking at the output of lspci, lshw and dmesg, I eventually determined that all of the USB root hubs were being detected, but there was an issue with interrupt requests that was preventing some of them from working.  The Bluetooth, camera, etc., were failing because they were connected through one of the hubs that wasn't working.\nThe solution was to remove all instances of the string acpi=noirq from `/boot/grub/grub.cfg'.\nThings probably went wrong when I was editing the grub configuration a couple of months ago trying to fix a separate issue.  I didn't notice the problem right away because I don't use the devices in question all that often.

Everyone keeps mentioning 'Motion' however I it seems VERY complicated. \nIf Motion is the best way to go, could someone please take the time to insctruct me on how to set it up to capture video ? \nI have read THIS tutorial on setting it up, but there is no mention of capturing video files.  I also have read this FFMPG article but have no clue how to set it up  ( I do have it installed). \nI am running UBUNTU 12.04\nThanks for your time. \n\nA: If you're looking for a simple program to do motion detection I would choose a script using OpenCV like this one:\nhttps://github.com/RobinDavid/Motion-detection-OpenCV\n\nOr just download the first script and install python-opencv:\nsudo apt-get install python-opencv\n\nTo run the script just type in a terminal:\npython ./MotionDetector.py\n\n", "Q: Exiting scrollback mode in byobu In byobu, I am able to enter scrollback mode with F7. However, I am not able to exit by pressing ESC as documented. Nothing happens when I press ESC. In contrast, when I am in screen, I am able to enter scroll back and exit by pressing ESC. (Oddly, I also can't access scrollback by hitting alt-pgup. Maybe a terminal emulator issue?)\n\nA: I was able to exit scrollback by pressing ctrl+c or Enter.\n\nA: Pressing q aborts the mode as well.\nDiscovered it via tmux man page, but it also works for session backed by screen.\n", "Q: how can I customise the launcher icons and add a few files to the homedir of the to-be-user? I've looked at In OEM Installations can we edit final-user applications setting? and How do I pre-install Ubuntu for someone (OEM install)? The latter offered an amazing guide on how to perform the actual OEM install, but doesn't answer \"how can I customise the launcher icons and add a few files to the homedir of the to-be-user\". \nNeither of them offered the answer I fear.\nThe OEM setup is fine, works well too. I just can't get a few dot files made for the to-be-user.\nOne is a config file for our VPN client (server name and the likes) and the other are config files for our vmware view client. It's for a-technical users, hence the OEM option being so nice. \nI assumed at first, since you can change \"settings\", I'd add them as oem user, but since its homedir gets removed - no dice.\nI tried via upstart and init.d several times but I couldn't get it to execute. I also tried to use the System Prefs > Startup Applications. I've tried looking at oem-config/late_command but it's beyond me. I am sorry. \nI've been looking for the answer for over 2 days now, tried everything I could find - but I've come up empty handed. \nI forgot to mention: My attempts (and a few versions for various alternatives to the OEM install) can be found here https://gist.github.com/moonwitch\n\nA: The directory to use in this case is the /etc/skel. Here you can create all files that you want your users to have once they create their accounts. This directory already have files that you can modify too:\nls -al /etc/skel\ntotal 28\ndrwxr-xr-x.   2 root root  4096 mar 24 11:46 .\ndrwxr-xr-x. 174 root root 12288 abr  2 19:15 ..\n-rw-r--r--.   1 root root   220 dic 31  2012 .bash_logout\n-rw-r--r--.   1 root root  3392 dic 31  2012 .bashrc\n-rw-r--r--.   1 root root   675 dic 31  2012 .profile\n\n", "Q: Installing new icons/themes/etc I'm trying out 14.04 beta. When I used 13.10, I found a way to access the root folder, which I seem to have forgotten - I did that in order to add icon themes and cursor themes to Ubuntu, as there does not seem to be a user friendly way to do this---everything I read tells me to extract what I've downloaded to the icons folder, but there is no such folder I can get to without being told I do not have permission. When I had root access, I simply would open the root folder and extract the cursor/icon themes in the appropriate sub folders there. Is there a simple way to do what I want? I really don't think it should be this difficult.\n\nA: Just put the folders in ~/.icons and ~/.themes, which is the way to install them for your user specifically.\n", "Q: dnsmasq unrecognized command I'm attempting to run a script which calls service dnsmasq restart\nservice dnsmasq restart\ndnsmasq: unrecognized service\n\nNo matter what I call for dnsmasq, it gives me the \"unrecognized service\" error.\nAlso if I type dnsmasq restart I get\ndnsmasq restart\ndnsmasq: junk found in command line\n\nI have tried autoremoving and reinstalling dnsmasq.

Is this a bug? How can I disable an account which has no password? Is there a workaround I can use?\n\n\nA: You can use usermod command to his account, just type on terminal:\n# usermod -L <username>\n\nOr take a look for more command by opening help.\n# usermod --help\n\n\nA: I have to use this:\nsudo usermod --expiredate 1 ruben\n\nBecause that account had NO password\nFrom man usermod\n-L, --lock\n           Lock a user's password. This puts a '!' in front of the encrypted\n           password, effectively disabling the password.

The bug occurs only when you change the user from Login without password to Disable this account.\nYou can avoid the bug entirely by first using the User Settings dialog to a add a password before disabling the account in User Settings.\nI added a note to the bug report.\n\nA: After running this you can disable LighDM Login for ruben not tty login,\necho 'allow-ruben=false' >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf && echo 'allow-guest=false' >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n   This will hide login option for ruben.\n\nTo show a manual login option you can run this [generally for root login],\necho 'greeter-show-manual-login=true' >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n   after this you can log in to ruben by typing ruben into Login option and pressing enter two times\n\n", "Q: How to make xterm to send the Alt key to emacs as Meta? I see that this question has been asked multiple times. The solutions given there in does not seem to apply to my setup. Here is my story:\nI use ubuntu 12.0.04 LTS, with xmonad (not over gnome), and use xterm for my work. I would prefer to use xterm rather than a different terminal or emacs own window. When using emacs -nw, I see that Alt is not recognized. I verified using xev that Alt is indeed getting generated. Further, if I am using rxvt, I see that Alt is getting recognized by emacs -nw. I am using evil mode (as a long time vim user, and an emacs newbee), and I would really prefer not having my escape key rebound as alt (which was the solution given in another thread). What should I do? (If it helps, Alt-x on the xterm window without emacs running generates \"ø\" or if I run emacs -nw -Q).\n\nA: There is an interesting alternative to managing your .Xdefaults / .Xresources files by providing the resource string directly as xterm command line option:\nxterm -xrm 'xterm*VT100.metaSendsEscape: true'\n\nThis is handy, for example, if you have a custom alias for x-terminal-emulator anyway.\n\nA: If updating ~/.Xresources doesn't work for you, do as the documentation says and update it in ~/.Xdefaults\nhttp://frequal.com/linux/XTermMetaSendsEscape.html\n\nA: As seen in the Arch Wiki, you need to make Xterm to send the correct escaped key to the program:\n\nIf you use the Alt key for keyboard shortcuts, you will need this in your resource file:\nXTerm*metaSendsEscape: true\n\n\nSo, just do:\necho 'XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true' >> ~/.Xresources\n\nAnd restart your Xterm session.\n", "Q: How to install complete, easily updatable LaTeX system with text editor front-end? I'm new to Xubuntu, having used Windows XP for many years.  On Windows I ran MiKTeX, with editors/front-ends WinEdt and TeXworks.  I found the MiKTeX Package Manager and Update tools to be especially useful.\nI'm now running Xubuntu 12.04 LTS.  How should I install a complete, easily updatable LaTeX system with text editor/front end?\n\nA: You can try sudo apt-get install texlive. The updated packages are usually available in the distribution repo, current version is 2013. However, there are other packages (other than the default install set) that you might need to install depending on the latex package you want to use in your document. You can use Synaptic to search for and install necessary packages. \nAs for editors, you are spoilt for choice. You can use emacs, kile, etc. You can also use eclipse with texlipse. Even gedit comes with a latex plugin.\nThere are a couple of other ways to install latex support on your system, which are more involved. You can manually download desired (or missing) packages from CTAN, place them in $HOME/texmf/tex/latex/. Place the desired package directory there (the directory is expected to contain the .sty file, and other optional documentation or source files). Then, execute sudo texhash.\nOr you could download the latest TexLive distribution from the project page, and install  using tlmgr.\n\nA: I would recommend to have a look at Eclipse (I use Juno) with the texlipse add-on.\nIt will work and look the same in Windows and Linux. This is independent from your package manager. For that I would follow the latex-project recommendation.\n", "Q: problem with gcov, cannot run So i'm trying to optimize a file called linpack.c. I have to use gcov to find the 10 most executed lines. I've been given these compiler options:\n-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -O2\n\nSo i ran this\n$ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -O2 linpack.c\n\nthe output was linpack, linpack.gcno.\nNow when I try to run gcov linpack.c in order to generate linpack.c.gcov I get an error:\nlinpack.gcda, cannot open data file.\n\nCan someone tell me what I'm doing wrong? This should be straightforward but I have been struggling for more than an hour now.\n\nA: The linpack.gcda file should get created when you execute the program that you compiled with the profile flags. Since you didn't supply an output file name (using the -o option) on the gcc command line, you will need to execute it as a.out. For example:\n$ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -O2 hello.c\n$ ls hello.*\nhello.c  hello.gcno\n$ \n$ ./a.out \nHello world!\n$ ls hello.*\nhello.c  hello.gcda  hello.gcno\n$ \n\n", "Q: Can't find org.gnome.shell.recorder in gsettings I am trying to do screen recording on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and supposedly pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+r will do it.\nIn order to get audio I found on a different post that I need to run the command:\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.recorder pipeline \"queue ! videorate !\n  vp8enc quality=10 speed=2 ! mux. pulsesrc ! audio/x-raw-int ! queue !\n  audioconvert ! vorbisenc ! mux. webmmux name=mux\"\n\nHowever when I run this I get No such schema org.gnome.shell.recorder.\nHow can I fix this?
