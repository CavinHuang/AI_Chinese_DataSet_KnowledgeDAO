["Q: Tracking a Powered off iPhone My husband misplaced his iPhone and then he left out of town and I found it. I turned it off and sent it overnight to him and it is now lost in the mail.  Can I track his iPhone if it is turned off?\n\nA: You cannot track it if it is not connected in some way to a data network, either over your mobile connection, or WiFi.  If it's turned off, or out of reception, you cannot track it.\nDepending on what version of the OS is installed, then when the phone is turned on again and gains reception it should start to be traceable, and you can put it in Lost Mode in the Find my iPhone app so that it will alert you and optionally display a message on the device, however you need to have turn this feature on in the device first for this to work.\nIf the unit is running iOS6, then anyone who eventually finds it will be able to wipe the device and restore a blank OS without having to turn it on thus bypassing this security, but if you are on iOS7 then this is not possible, and the unit is worthless to anyone finding it.\n", "Q: No exportfs CLI on OS X On Linux, there is exportfs CLI tool which can be used to export NFSs without modifying /etc/exports file. However, I can't find it on OS X 10.8.\nWhy is it missing? Is there any way to install it or simulate its functionality: dynamically (un)export filesystems?\n\nA: There are no cli tools for this (not in homebrew, fink or MacPorts). Even the Apple documentation on configuring NFS exports talks about using a text editor to manipulate /etc/exports directly.\nThere is an older user created shell script for exportfs for Mac OS X. The download link on that page is broken, but the script is available on the archive.org page at mac exportfs. One issue that I noticed is that this script uses the outdated (and unavailable) niutil command for the NetInfo database. You could try using this script as a starting point and modify it to use dscl instead of niutil.\n", "Q: How does emu4ios Transfer cracked Apps with out jailbreak? Today I came across a strange kind of website that helped me save an app from Safari, to my iPhone 5 on iOS 7. The point being I didn't authenticate the App in the App Store, still it's there. Also fiddling a bit with the mechanism it used I was able to port an other cracked app to my iPhone. So my question being, How is it possible when my OS is not jail broken?\n\n\nA: When it asks you to change your date before 2012. reason why is before 2012 there was a update that validates cracked apps to be downloaded. When you set it before its sort of removing some of the validates. When it first downloads it downloads a provisioning profile which allows the cracked app to download due to the profile permissions.\n\nA: I haven't tried this specific site and have no intention to do so, but it appears based on how-tos and screenshots that they are using some variation of the Enterprise Distribution Profile.  (Though I'm not sure how they avoid UDID registration.  It may have something to do with the notion of the requirement to roll your device's date back?)\nInstalling such an app looks like this, from this article which explains how to use it to distribute beta apps:\n\nInstalling an app in this fashion, which I understand is a violation of Apple's developer policies if done to publicly distribute an application, does not require you to go through the App Store.  However, by doing so, you're explicitly circumventing Apple's vetting and, in my opinion, increasing your risk.  I recommend avoiding such downloads except in the context of internal enterprise software distribution or beta testing with a developer.\n", "Q: Login as TeamsServer system user How can I login as the _teamsserver user?

When I type ⌥→, I'd like my cursor to stop at periods, and perhaps other characters.\nDoes anybody know of a defaults configuration, or System Preferences setting, that changes which characters are considered to be ‘word characters’ by OS X?\n\nA: You can choose from five different word break settings in System Preferences:\n\nI haven't tried the Finnish, Greek, or Japanese settings, but I have found only two differences between the Standard and English (United States, Computer) settings: period and colon are part of words between alphabetic ASCII characters in Standard but not in English (United States, Computer).\nASCII special characters that are part of words between alphabetic ASCII characters:\n\n\n*\n\n*'.:_ in Standard\n\n*'_ in English (United States, Computer)\n\n\nASCII special characters that not part of the ends of words next to alphabetic ASCII characters:\n\n\n*\n\n*$+<=>^` in Standard\n\n*$+<=>^` in English (United States, Computer)\n\n\naa.11 or aa'11 are not treated as single words with either setting. 11.11 and aa_11 are treated as single words with both settings.\nIf you change the word break setting, you have to quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.\nIf the region is set set to English (United States, Computer) in the third tab, the Standard setting acts like the English (United States, Computer) setting.\n\nA: Some apps/editors allow you to choose what characters should be considered to separate words.

There are over 100,000 of them. I need to keep the directory containing these files in sync. I thought Git would be a good solution, and it was, until I discovered that Git has stripped the resource fork off of every file on the remote machine(s).\nSo now I'm looking for another solution. Considering rsync but thought I'd ask here to see if anyone has experience with old Mac OS Classic files in a modern Mac OS X environment.\n\nA: Just in case anyone stumbles upon this in the future:\n\"rysnc -E\" as of Version 3.1.0 means \"preserve executability\".\nThe flag to preserve resource fork / extended attributes is now \"-X\"\nOn MacOS / OS X the command line tool \"ditto\" does copy the resource fork (unless told not to ..).\n(I am aware that this is not an \"answer\" to the asked question.

If you run Netatalk on your target server, it will work quite well if you use either of these, since Netatalk preserves the resource fork in local metadata (moving between different installations of Netatalk, though, can be QUITE a headache if they have different resource fork metadata schemes and you don't realize until too late).\nMeanwhile, I want to find out how to MAKE git work with resource forks, as I have some classic software to maintain and need to keep the resource forks in the repository.  I'm exploring some avenues with metastore, but you're probably looking for a solution more like the ones mentioned above if you're just trying to share files (e.g. a vintage software repository, like I have at home).\n", "Q: How to script number pad key We use an auto login script using ARD to avoid visiting each station in our lab.

After much messing around, I figured out THESE ARE NOT PART OF MAC OS X, unfortunately.  They are part of the \"XITS Math\" font collection.  This is listed as the font's \"description\"...\n\nArie de Ruiter, who in 1995 was Head of Information Technology Development at Elsevier Science, made a proposal to the STI Pub group, an informal group of publishers consisting of representatives from the American Chemical Society (ACS), American Institute of Physics (AIP), American Mathematical Society (AMS), American Physical Society (APS), Elsevier, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). De Ruiter encouraged the members to consider development of a series of Web fonts, which he proposed should be called the Scientific and Technical Information eXchange, or STIX, Fonts. All STI Pub member organizations enthusiastically endorsed this proposal, and the STI Pub group agreed to embark on what has become a twelve-year project. The goal of the project was to identify all alphabetic, symbolic, and other special characters used in any facet of scientific publishing and to create a set of Unicode-based fonts that would be distributed free to every scientist, student, and other interested party worldwide. The fonts would be consistent with the emerging Unicode standard, and would permit universal representation of every character. With the release of the STIX fonts, de Ruiter's vision has been realized.  \n\nWhat a weird.. and fabulous font.  More info can be found here.\n\n\n\n\nA: They are mathematical alphanumeric characters, which look like glyph variants of basic Latin letters but have been encoded as separate characters, due to their special use in mathematical notations. Italic, bold face, and even use of a sans-serif form vs. serif form may carry an essential difference of meaning in mathematics. For example, a bold italic “a” may denote a vector, in a context when a normal-weight italic “a” denotes a scalar variable. Normally, such distinctions are made with styling or with markup, but the mathematical alphanumeric characters let you make the distinction in plain text, when desired or needed.\nThe shapes of these character vary by font, even though the basic idea allows less glyph variation than for normal letters. A mathematical italic letter can still take different shapes. So no, they do not look the same to everyone else. See e.g. some samples of mathematical italic a in different fonts.\nMoreover, not everyone sees them at all. Few fonts contain them, and it is quite possible that someone is using a computer where no font has them.\nSo it’s a matter of characters, not fonts. And these characters “are intended for use only in mathematical or technical notation, and not in nontechnical text” (Unicode Standard, chapter 15, page 481).\nThey are not used much, but people might be using them without knowing what happens. If you use a sufficiently new version of Microsoft Word and enter a formula, using the formula mode, and type an “a”, Word will actually convert the character to mathematical italic a.\nNormally, you cannot type these characters directly. You would need to use a character picker like the one mentioned, or some input method based on the Unicode number of a character. But it is possible to create a keyboard driver that lets you type these characters using normal keyboard keys and some special keys – or to programmatically convert normal characters to these characters, as Word does.\nThere is nothing Apple-specific about this. Input methods vary by system and software, of course, like for other characters.\n\nA: If you go to the gear wheel at the top left of the Character Viewer and select customize and then check the box for Unicode and then select Unicode and go to 0001D400 Math Alphanumeric Symbols you should have them.  There is no practical way to type them with the keyboard, you have to double-click or drag/drop from the Character Viewer.\nSee also\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols\n", "Q: Can a Verizon iPhone 5s use T-Mobile LTE? I'm planning to purchase a new iPhone 5s outright (ie, not on contract) for use with one of T-Mobile's prepaid plans.\nI'm wondering if it makes more sense to buy a Verizon iPhone 5s, just in case T-Mobile's service is unacceptable.  I know that Verizon phones come unlocked, due to the terms of a recent spectrum purchase, but I don't know whether that applies only to the 3G bands.  I also know that if I buy an unlocked T-Mobile iPhone, Verzion will not allow it to be used on their service.\nDoes anyone have experience with this?  I'm certain the Verizon 5s will work on T-Mobile 3G/HSPA+, but I'd really like to have LTE.\n\nA: Short answer, yes (assuming you have LTE coverage in your area by T-Mobile). But you should get the iPhone 5s from Verizon instead of getting it from T-Mobile. Also, carrier unlocking has nothing to do with 3G or LTE.\nLong answer follows below.\nThe iPhone 5s models A1533 (GSM) and A1533 (CDMA) support the LTE bands that both Verizon and T-Mobile use. \nIf you look at the technical specifications for these two iPhone 5s models (A1533 GSM and A1533 CDMA), you'd notice that:  \n\n\n*\n\n*The LTE band coverage is the same across these two models\n\n*The GSM model supports only GSM (so you cannot switch to Verizon even if you want to, since Verizon is a CDMA carrier)\n[Model A1533 (GSM): UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 17, 19, 20, 25)]\n\n*The CDMA model supports both CDMA and GSM\n[Model A1533 (CDMA): CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B (800, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz); UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz); GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz); LTE (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 17, 19, 20, 25)]\nSo you would be better off going for the iPhone 5s CDMA [Model A1533 (CDMA)] on Verizon and then move to T-Mobile.\nAlso see:\nThe Verizon iPhone 5s comes unlocked just like the Verizon iPhone 5\n\nA: I just purchased a Verizon iPhone 5S gold and am running it on T-Mobile. I get 4G and LTE wherever it is available.\n\nA: I have the Verizon 5S and I swap my T-mobile sim and Verizon sim with no issues. I get all T-mobile bands. I am grandfathered into Verizon Unlimmited data so I have to buy all my phones full retail. Recently I decided to give T-Mobile a test run to see if it would work for me and save me a boat load of cash every month. So far I have had no issue on any T-mobile bands Edge,HSPA,LTE. \n\nA: What the specs say is irrelevant in this case since Verizon won't accept a phone that wasn't sold to run on Verizon.\n\nA: For what it's worth, I'm using a Verizon 5s on the Rogers GSM network in Canada. LTE all the way. No issues. \n", "Q: How to store photos in iCloud? There's been a few posts on this topic, but none answered my questions (at least the several I took a look at).\nI'm trying to figure out how to store photos from my iPhone 5 to iCloud (via Wi-fi). From what I've read so far, it seems that one has to use Photo Stream. But if I'm on a trip for more than 30 days, does that mean they will all be deleted by the time I get back? I don't care for sharing the pictures-- in fact, I don't want my pictures to be shared -- I just simply want to take pictures and\n\n\n*\n\n*store it in iCloud, and \n\n*also have it save to my computer, which is constantly on while I'm on my trip, so that Time Machine can serve as another redundant back up\n\n\nThen when I get back, I would sort through all the pictures when I get back. So, what I'm unsure of is whether or not the photo's will be saved in both iCloud and my Mac. Apple's website hasn't really provided much help with this. I just see multiple instances stating Photo Stream holds the photos for 30 days (or 1000 pictures). It sounds to me as though one MUST share their photos.\n\nA: Prior to a recent change, Apple's solution for this would be to ensure that iPhoto was running and you have configured iCloud to automatically import all photos into your library.\n\nNow that there is no limit to the number of photos, you just need to remain under the current upload limits to avoid having photos that are only on your device and not backed up to Photo Stream:\n\n\n*\n\n*25,000 photos per month\n\n*10,000 photos per day\n\n*1,000 photos per hour\n\n\nOther than temporary pauses, you should be able to store as many photos in the cloud as your have bandwidth and time to upload.\n\nA: There are four places your pictures can be\n\n\n*\n\n*locally on your iPhone\n\n*in your Photo Stream (which is not shared)\n\n*in any shared stream\n\n*On your computer\n\n\nSo if you have set up your iPhone to push all pictures into Photo Stream and also have iPhoto/Aperture on the Mac configured to copy all pictures from Photo Stream into your library on your computer, you will basically use Photo Stream to copy any taken picture to your computer.\n", "Q: MacBook pro freezes my computer sometimes freeze for no apparent reason When it freezes: nothing respond, I got a black or grey screen, nothing else.

The best clue from the logs may be this line (which could be indicative of OpenGL graphics context problems):\n9/10/13 10:42:57.764 AM SystemUIServer[271]: It does not make sense to draw an image when [NSGraphicsContext currentContext] is nil.  This is a programming error. Break on void _NSWarnForDrawingImageWithNoCurrentContext() to debug.  This will be logged only once.  This may break in the future.\n\nHowever, your description of the problem symptoms (the screen going black/grey; a red line appearing during boot) may point directly at graphics (video card) issues. Although it may be possible for you to perform some tests to pinpoint the problems, it may be worth having the machine examined by a qualified technician.\nUsing the Apple Hardware Test may help you to diagnose why the crashes are occuring. Alternately, there are some good freeware diagnostics available for OS X (Rember will test the RAM in your Mac).\nIf the problems are graphics/video related, you may be able to reproduce the issues by pushing the machine's graphics processor to perform. This can be accomplished by using some sort of high-end graphics application (one that heavily utilizes OpenGL). A potentially helpful option may be Cinebench\nIt's also possible that you're having problems related to graphics context switching. I might recommend trying to disable that option in the Energy Saver System Preference to see if the symptoms subside. More info on How to set graphics performance.\n\nA: If you're getting kernel panics (which is what it sounds like to me), I'd try testing the RAM first. What I normally do is switch in some known good ram and see what happens, if you don't have access to different ram you can try memtest86, though I've seen it throw false fails when used on Macs. \nI'd also use disk utility to check your hard drive - outside of bad ram and/or logic board, a failing hard drive can cause kernel panics. Even if disk utility says your drive is fine you can use a program like Data Rescue to analyze the hard drive and run some long read tests as I've seen failing drives pass as good in disk utility.\nIf the RAM is good and the hard drive is good, I'd recommend either a) backing up and doing a fresh OS install or b) if you have an external hard drive do a fresh install to that and boot from it. If the issue persists with a fresh install then you're guaranteed to have a hardware problem. \nIf your RAM is good and your hard drive is fine, then your last steps are to isolate the machine - disconnect optical drive, see if that makes a difference. Isolate bluetooth/wifi, see if that makes a difference. Disconnect display and connect to external monitor, see if that makes a difference. At this point you're already long-shotting though honestly, most of the time if your hard drive is fine and RAM is fine you're looking at a problem with the logic board. Good luck!\n\nA: If it is a MacBook Pro with silver keyboard, it might be a case of graphics card failure.\nApple issued a REP (Repair Extension Program) to fix the issue but it expired at least one year ago.\nApple Service Providers and Apple Stores should be able to run the GPT Test to ascertain if your computer is affected. In case it was, you'll get a quote for replacing the logic board (the graphics card is part of the logic board and cannot be replaced separately). You get a 3 months warranty on the replaced parts after such repairs.\n\nA: You may want to run:\nsyslog -k Sender kernel | tail | open -ef\n\nand post the output, this may help the analysis.\n", "Q: Blocking messages on iPhone and iPad If I block someone on my iPhone will I stop receiving their messages on my iPad as well or do I have to block the number on both?\n\nA: If both of your devices are syncing to the same iCloud account, your \"Blocked\" contacts will sync across both devices.\nThis also holds true if you wipe either device and restore it with your iCloud contacts. I believe this is a contacts configuration so it comes with your contacts.\nBlocked numbers on a device will block both SMS, iMessage, and calls, however last I knew if a voicemail is left it will still be received because that is a wireless company end receiver. Apple cannot block that feature as they aren't your provider.\n\nA: Blocked numbers do appear to sync—I’m not sure if that’s an iCloud thing or something internal to iMessage, but if you have both enabled then you shouldn’t have to re-block the numbers on your iPad.\n", "Q: g-5 2005 or 2006 is dual core intel a 2005 or 2006 G-5 dual core a intel can snow lep be loaded on it or is quad core intel can snow lep be loaded thanks just need to no the answer \n\nA: From Apple's Support Article:\nMac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard system requirements\nTo install Snow Leopard for the first time, you must have a Mac with:\n\n\n*\n\n*An Intel processor\n\n*An internal or external DVD drive, or DVD or CD Sharing\n\n*At least 1 GB of RAM (additional RAM is recommended)\n\n*A built-in display or a display connected to an Apple-supplied video card supported by your computer\n\n*At least 5 GB of disk space available, or 7 GB of disk space if you install the developer tools\n\n", "Q: Search files across folders and move recursively to new folder I need a way to search from a base folder, all the folders inside of that one recursively, and find all photos of JPG and PNG that were created before a certain date (01.Feb.2013) and then move them to a particular folder.\nHow would I go about this?\n\nA: You could use find:\ntouch -t 201302010000 /tmp/a\nfind ~/directory \\( -iname \\*.jpg -o -iname \\*.png \\) -Bnewer /tmp/a \\\n    -exec mv {} ~/directory2 \\;\n\ntouch -t normally changes only the modification and access times, but it also changes the creation time if the target time is before the original creation time or when you are creating a new file.\n-Bnewer (for birth time / creation time) is not supported by GNU/Linux platforms which don't have metadata for the creation time.\nThe parentheses are needed because -a (and concatenating expressions without -a) has higher precedence than -o.\n", "Q: Mac App Store, reuse apps after changing country The answer of this question explains that it is to install apps bought on the Mac App Store on multiple computers.\nMy problem is a little bit different. I moved to another country and I had to change the country also in my iTunes profile, due to my new credit card. As a result my iTunes store, App Store and Mac App Store are now associated to the new country.\nHow can I access and download my purchased Apps on my new MacBook Pro?\nProbably one solution would be to change again the country, but it wouldn't be optimal.\n\nA: For App Store, see this answer for \"Do I need to repurchase apps if I moved countries?\":\n\nAll the apps you bought in country A are permanently assigned to your AppleID. Once you move to country B and you updated your details (billing address) you:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*still can use them  \n  \n*you cannot re-download them  \n  \n*you cannot update them  \n  \n*you cannot convert your music to iTunes Plus (but still can listen, obviously)  \n  \n  \n  There are two solutions to this:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Switch Store's country and update your billing details each time you want to get your apps up to date (or re-download them). But this is a rather painful process, so a better solution is to...\n  \n*Create a new AppleID with the billing details for the country B. Switching between AppleIDs is much easier and quicker than switching Store's country and updating your billing address.\nLet me quote why it has to be this way:\n\n[...] this how iTunes has been designed.\n\n\n\nFor MAS - recover purchased apps on Mac App Store (formatted better and corrected typos):\n\nDah•veed\n  Re: recover purchased apps on Mac App Store.\n  Sep 14, 2013 10:16 AM (in response to Mariokart) \nWhen you switch regional/country stores your Purchases list does disappear and the MAS will no longer alert you to an update that may be available for an app.\nHowever, all is not lost. But the one caveat is that is an app that you bought in a particular store is not sold in the new store then you cannot update it. Apps that are available from both stores can be updated, it's just that you basically need to hear through the grapevine that there is an update for the app. Then you go through the steps of buying the app and in the final steps the MAS recognizes that you have previously bought the app and downloads it for free. Once you have done this with an app it again appears in your purchases list for the new store and you are alerted to any further updates as before. You have to go through this process with each app.\n\n\nAlso see iOS: Changing the signed-in iTunes Store Apple ID account\n", "Q: Latest OS X update causes Finder crash (SIGSEGV) Does any one know how to fix an error like this?\nException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)\nException Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000102e50cf2\n\nMy Finder keeps crashing after updating my Mac this morning.

Your appleid must have a US address. I use an Apple store address ;-)\n", "Q: Icon associated with extension I'm running Mountain Lion, and my question is how to \"attach\" an icon to an extension? For example, I want all .adm files has an icon like on the picture below. Unfortunately all I can is just attach an icon to proper file, not to all files that has such extension. Thus I want .adm extension has their own icon. .adm is opening in TextEdit, so please don't suggest me to open it in right app. Thank you in advance!\n\nA: See this detailed answer for \"How to set an icon for a file type on Mac?\" on superuser.com.\nIn this case, you need to update TextEdit's resources and plist to get it to use your custom icon for a file type it does not know about. The LaunchServices database also needs to be updated for the changes to be seen.\nHere's a small snippet from that answer (bold emphasis mine):\n\nIcons for file types are handled by Launch Services (the service determining, among other things, which application handles a file type). The file icon is always provided by the application handling opening a file by default. This way, e.g. Preview provides PDF icons by default, and PNG icons, but if you change all PNG files to open using Pixelmator instead, these files get a Pixelmator-style icon afterwards.\nWhat you need to do is add your file type definition to the application that opens it by default, or create your own \"dummy\" application for the file type.\n\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone 4S showing so much \"Other\" data in iOS 7? I've upgraded to iOS 7 on my iPhone 4s, cleared photos, cleared and turned off Photo Stream, deleted large apps, books, etc… and this is the 4th time I've installed iOS and started from scratch since the release of the new OS update, and yet I still get minimum of ~10GB of this \"Other\" data on my phone which doesn't let me include the data and files I want to have on my phone. \nAny ideas or suggestions?\n\nA: When you say that you've installed from scratch do you mean you restored the device and set it up as a new device without restoring from a backup? If not, try that.\nThe \"Other\" category for iOS storage contains a number of things including email, caches, settings, and so on. For >10GB of data I would guess its email attachments or the like.\nIf you have tried to set up the phone as a new device in iTunes, try resetting the iPhone from the phone instead:\nSettings → General → Reset → Erase All Content and Settings\n\nOnce the phone reboots go through the setup on the phone, and then check your usage in:\nSettings → General → Usage\nThat will tell you how much storage is available. It should be a more palatable number then what you've been seeing.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with iOS 7.0.6 on an iPhone 4 and it appeared to be a failed iTunes sync, the Other data was exactly the size of the music I'd tried to add and I'd seen copy but never showed up on the phone. The only thing that seemed to fix it was to backup, restore the iPhone then restore the backup. I did try using a newer cable in case my old dodgy cable had caused the sync to fail in the first place.\n\nA: Use PhoneClean to clear temporary files and others instead of restore and clean install.\nIt could also remove old jailbreak messes left after updating to a non jailbrooken system.\n", "Q: What can *.itc files contain when not PNG or JPG? Yesterday I was a bit curious what iTunes .itc (by default in ~/Music/iTunes/Album Artwork) files were.\nAfter a bit of research, I made a script to convert .itc to images (JPG & PNG).\nFor 1913 itc files : I get 467 png & 636 jpg files.\nI was wondering what the other itc could be. Any idea ?\n\nA: Well thanks @beroe for the link. \nAfter some digging I wrote a little documentation of .itc files. \n.itc files are actually wrapper of images that are either PNG, JPG or ARGB raw files. .itc files can hold multiple images with different size. Most of the time there are 3 images of (128*128, 256*256 & 400*400).  \nI wrote a little bash script that convert all .itc files into jpg or png and puts them in ~/Music/iTunes/Album Artwork/Images. \n", "Q: Activating Quick Look Using The Trackpad In OS X? Quick Look is very useful when wanting to preview documents and files without opening them in separate applications.\nI know that you can trigger Quick Look by highlighting a file in Finder and pressing the spacebar.\nCan it be activated using the trackpad on my Macbook Pro instead ?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click and enable the \"Look up\" checkbox. You will then be able to do a Quick Look with a three finger tap on the trackpad.\nSee:\nHow to Activate OS X’s Quick Look Using Your Mac’s Trackpad - August 30, 2013 11:46 AM\n", "Q: iPod Touch 4th Gen iOS 6 update I have an iPod Touch 4th Gen that has iOS 5 by default. Now that iOS 7 has been released and this device does not support iOS 7, can I still update my iPod Touch to iOS 6 (i.e., is iOS 6 still available)?\n\nA: Yes, Apple is still signing iOS 6.1.3 for the iPod Touch 4th Gen. So you should be able to upgrade to it through iTunes when it prompts you to update it.\nOr you can also manually update it through iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the iOS 6.1.3 firmware (from the above link)\n\n*Connect the iPod to the Mac and run iTunes\n\n*Go to the device screen\n\n*Press Option and click the Update button to open a File Browser window\n\n*Choose the IPSW file you downloaded\n\n\nA: Yes, you can update to the maximum supported iOS your iPod, as soon as you connect to the iTunes you will see there the latest version available for your iPod.

However, I'm still seeing the JAMBOX by Jawbone as a Bluetooth output and input in the System Preferences panel.\n\nI tried to delete these using the command:\n$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/jawbone.kext\n\nBut received the error message:\n(kernel) Kext com.aliph.driver.jstub not found for unload request.\nFailed to unload com.aliph.driver.jstub - (libkern/kext) not found.\n\nHow can I delete these Bluetooth inputs and outputs?\n\nA: Delete the JAMBOX from the Bluetooth Prefs Pane in System Preferences.\n\n", "Q: Error when installing matplotlib I tried to install matplotlib on OS X Lion with the pip install command, but I get the following error: \nerror: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1\n\nDoes anyone have a solution? \n\nA: matplotlib is part of the python 2.7 installed with El Capitan, no need to install it.\n", "Q: Can iOS apps be safely deleted from iTunes? On my PC, the iOS apps synchronized by iTunes take up a pretty substantial percentage of my total disk space.\nSince most, if not all of them, can be recovered from the App Store, is it safe to delete them on my PC?\nI've already verified that removing apps does not affect any apps currently installed on my device; now I'm wondering if it might cause problems once I have to restore from a backup.\nIt seems as if the backup itself only contains the data of the applications, and not the apps themselves. What happens when restoring a device with most or all .ipa files missing in the iTunes folder; will the missing apps be downloaded from the app store, or will restoring the apps and their data fail?\n\nA: The apps can be safely deleted from iTunes without affecting either the apps currently on the device or your backups. When you perform a backup, all of your data is backed up regardless of the apps you have in iTunes.\nHowever, when you restore from a backup, apps are re-download from the iTunes Store. If one of your apps is no longer available on the store for some reason, that particular app won't be restored. If you still have a copy of the app on your computer, you'll be able to install it on your device from iTunes. (I'm not sure what happens to the app's data in this case, however. I suspect it depends on whether you're restoring from an iCloud backup or a local backup, but I've never had the chance to test it.)\n\nA: When restoring your phone from a backup the applications, music, address book etc all get uploaded. If you do lose your apps they are always saved to your Apple Account so you can just re-download them, however sometimes you may lose the data saved within them i.e. a place in a game where you left of before.\n", "Q: Mysql process takes 500 mb of primary memory I have a MBA 2013, and its not more than few days that I installed MySQL. I have not created any database in mysql yet, but still it takes a lot of memory on RAM. I have configured it to start automatically on boot up. So i would be glad if anyone can help me out with understanding why is that MySQL takes so much of memory and what is the solution to tune it?\n\nA: You can get exact memory allocation of any process with a quick command:\nsudo sysdiagnose PID\n\n(Where PID is the process ID of the mysql binary or the name of the mysql process you want to inspect deeply). There is a manual page and you will want to start with vmmap.txt and all memory files.

Anything you can lock with special permissions, that admin user can unlock so what I'm guessing you ask is not possible.\n\nA: You can change the root password by using the Directory Utility.

I was attempting to call the shell script from launchctl which just adds layers of complexity.\nInstead, calling the perl script directly from the .plist and giving the keep alive key allowed it to run constantly after boot.\nFinally, I had to make sure to add the perl directory to the .plist above the location of the script since launchd doens't have a PATH the same way a user does.\n\nA: You need to add <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/> to run the program when the job is loaded (or at login). See man launchd.plist:\nRunAtLoad <boolean>\nThis optional key is used to control whether your job is launched once at\nthe time the job is loaded. The default is false.\n\nIf you want the program to be ran again if it terminates, also set KeepAlive to true.\nYou can apply changes to a plist by unloading and loading it.\n", "Q: How do I tap multiple images to share them all at once with iCloud Photo Sharing? I can't reproduce Apple's first tip on their iPhone tips and tricks page. When they say tap multiple images I assumed them mean tap the 'Select' button in the upper right then select photos one by one but their screenshot shows photos selected while not in selection mode. The only way this screenshot makes sense to me is if they photoshopped the nav bar with the rest of the screen while in selection mode. Am I missing something?\n\nA: Indeed, the screenshot does appear to have been edited.\nThe correct way to select multiple photos is to press the Select button, then tap the pictures.\nAs far as I know, it is impossible to select images without pressing the Select button, and pressing the button changes it to a Cancel button, and the navigation bar title changes to Select Items (or the number of items selected), as well as removing the back navigation button.\n\nOn the left: Apple's screenshot; On the right: how it should appear when selecting multiple pictures.\n\nA: Though I don't have my iPhone on me, here's what I found on my iPad.\nIf you go to an existing Photo Stream and tap the '+' button, it will bring you to moments. You can tap \"Select\" for all or just individual moments.

Up until recently, embedded YouTube videos on Safari pages on my first-gen iPad (iOS 5) worked as you'd expect, with the video duration and draggable time bar shown at the bottom, and the ability to send the video to my AppleTV via AirPlay.\nToday I tried for the first time in a couple of weeks, and while the videos still play fine, the duration is shown as '--', the draggable time bar is disabled, and although the AirPlay icon still appears, I can now only send the audio to my AppleTV. This appears to be the case on any embedded videos I could find, such as those on my own homepage and this scrapbooking page (which my wife frequents!)\nHave YouTube just changed something about the way they deliver embedded videos to iOS devices to cripple them in this way, or have I inadvertently changed something on my iPad that could have caused this?\n(I have at least discovered a workaround, that I suspect might only work on iOS 5 older: tapping the title at the top of the video opens it in the original YouTube app. And from there, AirPlay works fine, as it does in the Google YouTube app.)\n\nA: (This info is in response to a slightly different question on this forum)\nI don't know what the actual answer is, but I am having the same issue. The page https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/AudioandVideoTagBasics/AudioandVideoTagBasics.html\nhas some good info.

Video is not presented within the webpage. The height and width attributes affect only the space allotted on the webpage, and the controls attribute is ignored. This is true only for Safari on devices with small screens. On Mac OS X, Windows, and iPad, Safari plays video inline, embedded in the webpage.\" -\nWhich, I believe, means on the iPad, that the video plays at the resolution of the initial window (determined by the programmer), and does not naturally play on the YoutTube player, or at a higher res if you enlarge the video.\nThis seems to be the \"problem\" that we're encountering - that its a \"feature\" specific to Safari on the iPad. Why they do this, I dunno. In my case, the video plays at a higher res (and better) on my smaller iPhone than does on my iPad mini with Retna. Go figure.\nI came upon this post, hoping to find the answer and a work around. If you get the Youtube app, and find the video through that, it will play at the highest resolution, but not through Safari. So far as I can tell.\nEnjoy\n\nA: That has happen to me a bunch of times on safari on my iPhone 5s, but the funny thing is that the same videos play just fine if you browse the same page using Chrome iOS.

Is there a safe way to move a Time Machine backup on an external USB hard drive to a Time Capsule?\n\nA: Yes, it's straightforward to do it, even though it would take quite sometime to complete depending on the size of your current backups. Follow the detailed procedure at Copy  Local  backups to be used on a  NETWORK.\nHere's a summary of what's required and the steps.\nThe backups go into a sparsebundle on a Time Capsule. So you need to create that sparsebundle on the Time Capsule, mount it in Finder and then copy over everything from your USB drive into the mounted volume.\nHere are the basic steps with some additional information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure Time Machine to back up to the Time Capsule and start a backup. This will make it create the sparsebundle.\n\n*Cancel the backup once the copying starts (as seen in the progress window).\n\n*Mount the Time Machine Backups sparsebundle in Finder by double-clicking it (or using Cmd+Down Arrow)\n\n*Delete the Backups.backupdb folder inside this volume (you'll be replacing it with the backup you already have).\n\n*Open your current Time Machine backup USB drive in Finder and copy the Backups.backupdb folder from it to the Time Machine Backups partition (mounted from the Time Capsule).\n\n*Enter your administrator password and accept the prompts (this may happen a couple of times).\n\n", "Q: How do I fix non-responsive keyboard and trackpad after sleep on MacBook Pro Retina 15?

I know mountain lion is not 'supported' on this platform, but there is no reason it won't run.  I've replaced my mezzanine video card with a mountain lion (and lion) supported gt 120 from a mac pro.  I've installed mountain lion to a 500gb drive via USB off of my macbook pro, and edited the PlatformSupport.plist file to contain the proper board id from my Xserve.\nHere is where the issue is: If I try to boot to Mountain Lion off this drive via USB on the Xserve, it boots and runs mountain lion buttery smooth.  When I place this drive into the first drive bay (internally) in the Xserve, it wont boot.  Its as though it cannot find the drive or boot partition.  It sits at a white screen and I eventually get a blinking folder with a question mark on it.  I feel that I'm so very close to getting this to work, and its driving me crazy.  Anyone have any insight?\nAdditional Information: \n\n\n*\n\n*booting holding option or to the recovery partition while the drive is installed internally does not work either.\n\n*Installing Lion internally works fine, so I know its not a hardware issue.\n\n\nA: I was able to get it to successfully boot by creating a Time Machine Backup, then restoring that to an internally formatted disk.\n", "Q: Error Opening Image File in Terminal Much like: How do I cat a deleted file which is still open by its inode?.\nI am using 'Sleuth Kit' command line tool, to gather relevant data from the disk. But I keep on getting:\nError opening image file (raw_open: file \"/dev/rdisk1s2\" - Permission denied)\nThis is so, whether or not I included r. How can I solve this problem?\n\nA: In order to access a raw disk device /dev/rdisk1s2, it should not be mounted. Open Disk Utility and unmount it first. Otherwise you would get a Permission denied error when you try to access it as a raw device.\nIf you wish to (or need to) have it mounted and use the block device, remove the \"r\" from the disk name, making it /dev/disk1s2 (notice the missing \"r\" before \"disk1s2\").\n", "Q: How to delete the iOS7 install package on iPhone? Some days ago I realized, that Apple automatically stored the iOS7 install package on my iPhone 4S with iOS6. The package uses about 2 GB of free space, which is inacceptable for me. \nHow can I locate and delete this file? \n\nA: I did not have this issue and so didn't have to deal with it. But there is a solution posted on the Apple Discussion Forums that you could try. If it doesn't work, you could follow up there (and subscribe to that thread to get updates). Make sure you have a backup (along with Time Machine backups of your previous backup and this one).\nHere are the instructions from that post (with better formatting and some typo fixes):\n\nPart 2.

The airport express is said to support 50 users, yet in my case (when bridging WiFi to ethernet) it only serves up to 4 clients on the LAN port. A fifth client is not able to obtain an IP address nor ARP requests or anything else. It's completely ignored by the airport express.\nSo: How many ethernet clients does the airport express support concurrently when bridging?\nNote: This applies to bridged mode (ProxySTA) only, where one bridges an existing WiFi (connected to the internet) into an ethernet.\n\nA: I get the same results. Only 4 clients receive an IP from the the main AP. Seems to be an undocumented hard limit on the Express when in client / proxysta mode\n", "Q: How can I process/read checkmarks on a paper form?

On my Mac, I used Time Machine to backup to a Drobo that was directly attached. I've now connected this Drobo to my TimeCapsule. I however want to continue backing up to the Drobo, not the TimeCapsule. \nI have told the TimeCapsule to share its disks, and can mount the Drobo Disk fine, and it appears under /Volumes as \"Drobo\".\nHowever, when I tell TimeCapsule to use the new disk, it does not recognize the presence of the old backups on the disks. Instead of using the machine directory present it starts a new sparsebundle. This is not what I want.\nHow do I get Time Machine to continue backing up in the original machine directory?\nI've tried\ntmutil inerhitbackup <machine dir>\n\nbut this didn't work... Anything else I can do?\n\nA: I think I have found the answer. The following site was very helpful:\nhttp://pondini.org/TM/18.html\nThere are important differences between how Time Machine backups to local disks, and tonetworked disks. In the first case the backup goes to a \"Backups.backupdb directory, in the second case to a \"sparsebundle\". \nSo my solution will be:\n\n\n*\n\n*First have Timemachine start a new back up to my now networked\nDrobo. \n\n*Interrupt the backup after the sparsebundle has been made.\n\n*now move the Drobo temporarily back to my Mac, mount the sparse bundle, and use diskutil to erase it.\n\n*Copy the existing back up in to the monted sparsebundle.\n\n*Attach the Drobo again to the Time Capsule once this is finished.\nHowever I can't try this out yet.

I was searching for an answer and found this. As you can see, this answer suggests me to do what I've already done. So I hope you know the different solution for this problem.\n\nA: You also need to have write permission to the directory the file is in:\nsudo chown $USER /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist\nsudo chown $USER /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents\n\nAfter you have edited the file, change the owner of the plist and the directory back to root:\nsudo chown root /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist\nsudo chown root /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents\n\nYou could also run cp /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist ~/Desktop/ (which changes the owner to you), edit the file on the desktop, and then run sudo cp ~/Desktop/Info.plist /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist (which changes the owner back to root).\nOr use another editor:\nsudo nano /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\n\nA: After all these steps, open Terminal and run\nsudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app\n\n", "Q: Dictionary not remembering my selected dictionaries When I select a word and use Define, I have to readd the same dictionaries that I've previously enabled.

I am seeking for the equivalent of\nrvm implode\n\nIn the Ruby rvm world rvm implode completely uninstalls everything ruby related installed via rvm, including rvm too.\nIs there anything similar for homebrew? Or do I have to remove each package, then remove /usr/local/Cellar and look around for any other remains that have not been dealt with automatically?\n\nA: Use this script to uninstall homebrew completely. It's safer to run each command separately, especially the cd `brew --prefix` to check if it suceeds.\nFrom the homebrew FAQ:\n\nHow do I uninstall Homebrew?\nIf you installed to /usr/local then you can use the script in this gist to uninstall — it will only remove Homebrew and the stuff Homebrew installed leaving anything else in /usr/local alone.\nProvided you haven’t put anything else in Homebrew’s prefix (brew --prefix), you can generally just rm -rf that directory.

How should I do it?\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend that you try to put in such a scheme. If you wish to use restrictions, you would generally not want the restricted user to install any application either (for security reasons).\nNormally, a non-admin user cannot install applications in the system applications folder at /Applications since it's owned by user root and group admin. However, a non-admin user can install applications under the home directories (~/Applications), but those applications would be available only to that specific user (certain applications that are designed to be in /Applications or those using installer packages to write into system locations may not work well in such a case).\nIf you wish to allow a non-admin user to install applications into /Applications, then you can add that user to the admin group from Terminal.app (instead of going to System Preferences and allowing the user to be an administrator). Keep in mind that a user who can install applications into /Applications can also remove applications from there (intentionally or unintentionally).\n", "Q: View .mkv in quicklook Is there any plugin (or other way), to add support for mkv files in quicklook?

I installed the latest version 11.1.1 and still the same. Here is the crash report.\nThis happens over and over again. I fixed disk permissions, reinstalled iTunes and still the same problem. I even tried creating a new music library but to no avail.\n\nA: After several days of trying all possible solutions I just restarted OS X in safe mode (restart and hold shift) then started iTunes just fine. Then when I restarted again everything was working as expected.\nHope this helps someone else having the same problem.\n\nA: I would simply say that your Library is corrupt for some reason. As your library is a virtual reference lookup to your actual music files, if it has a problem it is possible that it will either give you issues at program startup or perhaps when you add something to your library as it will read the reference file and encounter issues when trying to add to it.\nI first of all tried all the obvious, Disk Util repair, permissions, deleted and reloaded Itunes etc etc however all of that will still use the original Library file so it wont solve the issues so many are having with Itunes.\nThe simplest yet time related route is to rebuild your library. What this means is that you need to create a new one, and import all your content again.\nYou may be thinking - oh my god, forget that! however its not that bad!\nIt will take you 30min but your computer 10 hours.\nAs its your library thats corrupt not the actual files / file structure that is the problem you will be able to import all of your music again together... 95% of your ablums will be kept together although in some ocassions with downloaded albums their reference name will not match that of the official release so it may be seperated and in need of the artwork but neither is a big take to sort out.\nIts the same deal with your movies.\nSo to do this, quit ITunes... then hold Alt and click Itunes again, select new Library (dont worry your old one is still there and will not be deleted).\nThey you can start to rebuild. You can always go back to your old Library by closing Itunes, holding Alt and clicking on Itunes.\nTo select which library to open - you will see that in your Music/Itunes folder there are now two libraries and the xml library file is in the sub folder for each for you to select if you cant find it... give yours a simple name when you create it such as 'ITunes Libray 2' that way you can search for it too if you cant find it.\nThe only issue with this method is having to backup your Iphone / Ipad or other device in your old Library as it can only be sync'd with one library... however once you are happy with your new library you can Erase your device and sync it with your new Library.\nFear not, when you erase your Iphone for example; it will only wipe / erase the content (Music, Movies etc) it will not delete Apps, Messages, Bookmarks, Photos etc.\nI hope this helps, as it not only sorted my Itunes issues for good but also made my IMac a hell of a lot faster in general as Itunes is not struggling and does not crash any more.\nGood luck!!!!!\nColin.\n\nA: *\n\n*Move all your Media to an External Drive.\n\n*Move all the Playlist Files out of the iTunes Folder, to somewhere else (for Storage).\n\n*Reinstall the Latest Version of iTunes.\n\n*Open the Newly-installed iTunes with No Media in it.\n\n*Now, slowly import small parts of your Media Library back into iTunes.\n\n*Check for Problems--maybe some Media Files are Corrupted from where you got them...\n\n*Be sure to go into iTunes Preferences to tell it where to look for your Media Files (the External Drive).\n\n*Obviously, the External Drive must be on to be accessible--in other words, if you leave your E.H.D. at home and go to the office and open iTunes, iTunes will Default to Storing Media Files Back in the Music Folder/iTunes/iTunesMedia Folder.\n\n*iTunes is a Great Program for Managing your Audio and Video Library. Don't give-up on it. It's probably an issue with the Media Files themselves (being corrupted).\n\n", "Q: How to isolate apps from the internet?

The only solution would be to cut the Internet connexion of your computer.\nYou can block incoming connexions though, using the standard Mac OS X Firewall (accessible in the Security & Privacy panel of the System Preferences). When activated, when an application wants to start listening on a certain port, you are prompted to allow or deny the listening.\nWith additional software, you can use the excellent Little Snitch application that allows blocking outgoing connexions as well.\n", "Q: imessage won't send or receive on my mac I am trying to link up with my wife at home (send IM).

I purchased an app that didn't initially work and I requested a refund which was promptly processed by Apple. Then I couldn't find a better app for my needs and figured out some workarounds for the initial app. Now I still have the app installed on my phone and the honest thing to do is repurchase it. How can I do that?\n\nA: It's not possible. Once an app is refunded, you cannot re-purchase it, for all eternity. I've spent about 2h with various levels of Apple support without success.\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that you cannot get updates for a refunded app (makes sense). \n", "Q: Apple TV conflict Hey I seem to not be able to have airport express and Apple TV connected and the same time.

I have also tried changing settings via airport utility with no success...  Seems ridiculous that I have purchase AirPort Extreme to make these too work together . If anyone has any suggestions on how I can fix my deliemma it would be greatly appreciated?   Taylor\n\nA: I have an Airport Express and 2 ATV's, and they all get along fine, so it is possible.  First, can you take you AE out of the equation?  Does the ATV work fine (wired or wireless) without the AE?\nIf so, add the AE into the mix.  You haven't explained what you're using it for.  I can't think of a valid reason to have them in the same room, so I'm going to assume you either need to extend your wireless range to reach the ATV in a remote part of the house or you just want to hang some speakers on the AE's audio port.  \nIn either case, this works for me.  Setup the AE in the Airport Utility's \"Wireless\" tab (in Mac OS X) to \"Extend a wireless network\", and make sure to send the AE's network name to the SAME as the main wireless network.  This works really well to extend you wireless network into remote parts of the house!\nI guess you could be using the AE as the (only) wireless router, connected to an Ethernet-only router, and connecting the ATV to this (only) wireless network.  In that case you'd select \"Create a wireless network\", and join the ATB to this network.\nIf you could provide more info about your setup, it might help with more suggestions!\n", "Q: Your iPhone could not be activated because the activation server is temporarily unavailable My iPhone 5 that has been running iOS 7 since beta 1 suddenly wants to be activated.

Try connecting your iPhone to iTunes to activate it, or try again in a couple of minutes.\nIf this problem persists, contact Apple Support at apple.com/support\n\nHas anyone encountered this problem before? Is there a solution to it?\n\nA: I have done some research after experiencing the same issue (iPhone 4), however there has been mixed reviews.\nWhat Apple suggests:\nThis Apple thread on troubleshooting activation issues gives you a couple of options to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the iPhone\n\n*Try another means of reaching the activation server (over wi-fi or connecting to iTunes)\n\n*Restore iOS software - but see my first point under \"What I have tried,\" which leads me to try the next point,\n\n*Perform a recovery-mode restore (factory reset)\nEDIT\n\n\n*Some people have reported that if you wait long enough and keep trying to activate, it will eventually go through.\n\n*Other people have reported that you need to download the latest version of iOS (7.0.2) - namely from the Apple iOS Dev Center. Note that you need an Apple Developer account to see both these links.\n\n\nWhat I have tried:\nThis Apple support thread says you need to restore the phone to a previous backup, from a fresh factory reset.

It may be worth to wait an hour or so to see if the activation lets you through after a while (if Apple's servers are really the issue).\n\nA: I found a tip for you. Try to activate your device via Wi-Fi. Just connect to the Wi-Fi (Don't connect to iTunes) and start the activation steps.\nSource: http://www.unlockboot.com/2015/10/fix-iphone-activation-error-after.html\n\nA: The two major causes of this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Network related - change the network used to connect\n\n*iOS related - something is amiss with the code signing / provisioning\n\n\nThe most likely cause of software is a beta. Apple disables the iOS betas soon after the release happens. If you never manually installed the official release, this can happen. If not, consider backing up your device after checking a couple networks and reinstalling.\nIf you need to get a beta off, do the following to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the Power and Home buttons until the phone reboots and you see the Apple logo.\n\n*Release the Power button but keep holding the Home button.\n\n*Release the Home button when you see the iTunes logo and the connector below it.\n\n\nDo this while connected to iTunes. Click Restore. Hopefully you have a recent back-up.\nNote: It is a large update and will take a while. Apple servers are currently getting slammed.\n\nA: I followed the instructions to perform a recovery-restore mode here and it updated to iOS 7.0.2 for me. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1808\nThis article also talked about recovery mode and explained what happened:\nhttp://mn-ml.co/?p=7081\n\nA: Okay everyone, this is what it is. In order to get access to the iOS 7 beta, developers often sell \"slots\" on their developer accounts and allow people to get the beta for a fee, usually about 5 dollars. Naturally, Apple doesn't like this. They decided to crack down on this. They just now deactivated all iPhones running the iOS 7 beta, and the only way to reactivate them is to reactivate them using a developer account. If you were one of the people that paid for a slot, your only option is to restore. However, you can only restore if you place your phone in restore mode by doing the following:\nHold the Power and Home buttons until the phone reboots and you see the Apple logo.\nRelease the Power button but keep holding the Home button\nRelease the Home button when you see the iTunes logo and the connector below it.\nPlug phone into computer and restore through iTunes.\n\nAlso, you cannot backup your phone while it is in this deactivated state. \nUnfortunately for me, I have two Apple ID's. One is a developer account and the other is not. My phone is registered under the non-developer account. So there is no way for me to unlock my phone. I've been on hold with Apple support for the past 2 hours.\n\nA: HERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN TRY! I never downloaded ios 7.0.2 SO if you are a developer, log in to the account and download the new IPSW for the 7.0.2. Open iTunes, hold ctrl and alt and click check for update. Select the IPSW and let it install... its worth a shot!\n\nA: I just had the same issue with having to 'activate' my iphone. I followed the steps here and it restored my i5 for me > http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1808\n\nA: I had this problem and I was afraid that I had lost some of my data. However I found a neat little way of doing this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the 7.0.2 ipsw (Link)   \n\n*Connect to your iPhone via USB to your computer   \n\n*Hold alt and press the update button in iTunes\n\n*Select the downloaded IPSW\n\n*Wait until your phone is updated\n\n*Activate again\n\n\nIt worked for me, but as a little safety I downloaded ifunbox, and transferred my photos.\nGood luck.\n\nA: You can try to activate it via WiFi. Just insert the original sim card, Connect to WiFi, Then follow the steps to activate your device. If still not work - try to restore & update the device via iTunes.\n", "Q: Can iOS' builtin dictionary be accessed/browsed as an independent app? If you select some text in whatever application, there's a \"define\" option that will open a builtin dictionary screen:\n\nCan this dictionary be accessed/browsed? As in, an actual application?\niOS 6.0\n\nA: You can access definitions from the phone’s search (Spotlight):\n\nOccasionally you’ll have to scroll lower and expand the list of definitions to see more dictionaries:\n\nA long time ago used to be a nice little app (that luckily I still have) that did exactly that: let you search for definitions directly. It was called Dictionary+ (link no longer available), Apple removed it reportedly for violating the UIReferenceLibraryViewController's terms of use, which states that it should not be used to display wordlists, create a standalone dictionary app, or republish the content in any form.\nThere's a replacement open source app that you can build, sign and install it manually, I haven't tried it, though: https://github.com/josh-/DictionaryPlusPlus\n\nA: In iOS 12 Apple provided the free Shortcuts App. You may have to download it from the App Store if you've deleted it. Shortcuts can do what you need and a lot more.\nThe following simple shortcut is a wrapper to the in-built dictionary and accepts a typed-in word from a prompt. But you may define the workflow to accept text from the clipboard or from a share sheet. You can also add the word to a note in Notes, email it, and so on.\nYou can finally add the shortcut to the home screen as an icon that can be clicked like any other app.\nIt's fast.\nThis is what Shortcuts looks like:\n\nThis is a simple one-step shortcut definition, called \"Dictionary\":\n\nWhen run from here or from an icon it looks like so:\n\nPress \"Done\" and the definition appears, respecting your dictionary choices:\n\nAnd of course don't forget to add the icon to your home screen. I named this one \"Look Up\" but of course you could name it anything and even give it a custom icon:\n\n", "Q: How to make a Mac (Macbook Pro) not hibernate? I have already set in the Energy Saver of System Preferences that \nComputer sleep: on Battery Power, Never\n                when plugged in,  Never\n\nso if I close the cover of the Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion, so that it sleep, then if I open up the cover within a few hours, then it wakes up right away -- which is all fine.  However, if I open up the the cover and not touch it, then after some 12 or 24 hours, then it will wake up from hibernation, taking about 2.5 minutes before any password can be typed in. (update 2015: this Macbook Pro was running with a non SSD hard drive. The wake up time is a lot better if it is an SSD drive).\nThis is all when the Macbook Pro is plugged in (powered by the power adapter).  Is there a way to make it not hibernate?\n\nA: This behavior is documented by Apple at Mac computers: Progress bar appears after waking from sleep:\n\nWith the release of the OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 supplemental update 2.0, a new feature was introduced to enter safe sleep after four hours of the computer being connected to AC power. This is an effort to comply with the European Energy Standards (ErP Lot6). This will only occur if there is no wireless or Ethernet activity and no activity from external devices such as USB storage devices. \nThis is normal behavior for the following units: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 and later)\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012 and later) \n  \n*MacBook Air (Mid 2012 and later)\n  \n*iMac (Late 2012 and later)\n  \n*Mac mini (Late 2012 and later) \n  \n\nTo disable this, turn autopoweroff in the sleep settings by running the following command in Terminal (under /Applications/Utilities):\nsudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0  \n\nThe -a option disables auto poweroff for the Mac while on the charger as well as on battery. Use -c (instead of -a) to disable auto poweroff only when it's plugged in.\n", "Q: Clearing cache and cookies freezes Firefox on Mac Every time I try to clear my cache or cookies, the system freezes and crashes. The spinning wheel continues and I have to force quit/reboot.\nHow can I clear my cache & cookies without Firefox freezing?\nMacBook Pro, OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion\n\nA: Reinstall Firefox by deleting it from /Applications and copying it from a fresh download.\nIf that does not help (which is likely), you may have a corrupt Firefox profile. To fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Firefox Profile Manager, create a new profile and see if it works without crashing.\n\n*If it does, then transfer data to the new profile from the old one.\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4S I did upgrade and hate it, want to go back If I can't go back I'm getting rid of iPhone for droid, any help would be appreciated. My iPhone and all upgrades are legal, just hate new upgrade...\nPlease help me\nTerry\n\nA: I am sorry to tell you that there is no official way to downgrade from iOS7 to iOS6 anymore as Apple stopped signing the 6.1.4/6.1.3 firmware. Every time a software-upgrade is done iTunes asks for a verification of the firmware. As of 21st of September Apple stopped signed the 6.1.3/6.1.4 firmware and therefore iTunes will refuse a downgrade to iO6. For more information see the following blog for more information.\nupdate: this question has already been answered over here: Can I undo the upgrade to iOS 7 by restoring to iOS 6.1.3?\n", "Q: Can I use an old TV as a monitor for Mac Mini? I have an old TV with following sockets:\nFront:\n\nBack:\n\nCan I use this TV as a monitor for Mac Mini (2012) ? If so, do I need any adapters?\n\nA: The Mac Mini sends out digital video through HDMI or the Thunderbolt port. Your old TV has Composite ports, which take analogue signals.\nYou could theoretically use something like this: ViewHD Universal HDMI to Composite / S-Video Converter, but I havent tested it myself. The picture quality would probably be really bad.\n\nA: An \"old TV\" that appears to lack any ports other than composite video will most likely not be able to display a computer image at a resolution greater than 640 x 480. (It is a 480i image.) \nI'm also pretty sure that Mac Minis made after 2009 (Intel Core 2 Duos) have a minimum resolution of 800 x 600. They don't go down lower than that.\nCheck your own Mac Mini by going to System Preferences > Displays > Display > Scaled and look for the lowest available resolution to confirm this.\nYour best bet would be to buy some kind of intermediary device like an AV receiver (Yamaha, Denon, Pioneer) to take input from your computer and send output to your TV. \n", "Q: Numbers spreadsheet can't be imported I have a spreadsheet I have been updating in IOS Numbers for several months and I sometimes update it with OSX Numbers\nHowever when I did a recent update in OSX I get the error message Spreadsheet couldn't be imported.

See my workaround here.\nHope this works for you too. :)\n", "Q: Mac Mini 2011 - monitor wakes up messed up I have an Mac Mini from 2011. Sometimes (I would say 80% of the time) when I wake up the monitors, after they've been sleeping, my main monitor (a Benq G2220HD 22″, connected via DVI → Mini Displayport) wakes up with just noise. Its like a grey background with black, white, red, green and blue dots all over. To solve this I have to power off the monitor, and power it on again.\nI also have a second monitor plugged in, through the included DVI-HDMI adapter (doesnt make a difference if I hook up my Benq using this method.) The second monitor works fine (I can see/use it while my other one is messed up), but it will also get the same issue if it is the only monitor hooked up. \nI'm running OS X 10.8.5 (this was also on Lion and all other versions I've tried), I've done a SMC reset, and I've updated the EFI to MM51.0077.B10, which is said to fix an HDCP authentication thing, but it doesnt fix my problem.\nMy current solution is to just never sleep the monitor, instead have a screensaver running, but I want it to sleep because it gets really hot otherwise.\nThis doesn't happen in Boot Camp (Windows 7). It works fine there, so it has to be something with OS X I'm thinking.\nUPDATE 26-10-2013 : This still happens in 10.9 Mavericks.\n\nA: I've experienced the same issue on a friends mac. \nIf he switches spaces (swipe with 2 fingers on magic mouse - but i suppose opening mission control via a shortcut does the same) it's back to normal (until the next sleep)\n\nA: Neither of the 2011 Mac Mini models have displayport capability. It sounds like you may be trying to plug the DP->DVI into the thunderbolt port. That's not going to work.\nWith an apple thunderbolt to DVI-D adapter you should be golden.\n\nA: try pulling the following files to see if it makes any difference--\n/library/preferences/com.apple.powermanagement.plist\n/library/preferences/com.apple.autowake.plist\n~/library/preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist\nas well, you could try resetting the pmu. http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300574 and you could boot to the install disk and run disk repair to see if you have any directory damage which could be causing this. http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106214\n\nA: My monitor (Mac Mini 2012 10.10 connected to Samsung TV with straight HDMI) does the same thing occasionally, with the static you describe.   From various behaviors, I've come to the conclusion that it must be the graphics driver failing.  I've been unable to solve it completely for the past year; perhaps my info might point you in more fruitful directions.\n\nA: I don't believe it is a hardware issue because everything seems to work fine on Bootcamp. The only variable now is the OS.\nWhat happens if you unplug the adapter from the MacMini then plug it back in?  Does it work?\nTry using a different DP to DVI adapter.   I never had good results using the genuine Apple products, but I used this to connect to a Dell 3007wfp and all the problems similar to what you described went away:  Kanex iAdapt Mini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt to DVI Adapter\nThat may very well solve your issue.  If not, Amazon has a generous return policy if the device doesn't work - I went through two before I found this one that solved the issue.\n\nA: It's an Apple OS problem that I also now have on a MacBook with my two Samsung monitors. Tried swopping cables and monitors. The only solution that works for me is to hit \"Sleep\" - then just wake the computer again. Hey presto! - both monitors work fine. Annoying but only takes a second.\n\nA: Make sure all the ports don't have any dust In them and that all the cords work\n\nA: I have the same problem on my Mini 2012, both with HDMI, and VGA adapter, and a third party monitor. Put an Apple monitor on it, and the problem seems to go away. I believe it's something to do with the graphic card used, and it's configuration. You can't change the card, but you may be able to afford an Apple monitor?\n", "Q: Free Mac database software similar to FileMaker I am used to using FileMaker on a friend's computer, but I don't have it on mine, and at the moment I can't afford to buy it. Is there anything free out there that is similar?\nI am in the process of making a database of job applicants on Excel and it is getting rather large and complicated. I like the way you can change from list view to document view on FileMaker.\nOS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard\n\nA: I feel your pain.  I've not found a single app equivalent to MS Access for the Mac.  There are some decent online services like Zoho Creator (free) and TrackVia (not free) but if you MUST have something very close to Access or FileMaker installed on your Mac natively, I can offer the following suggestion.\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Mac, you can install and run MySQL.  That'll be your database engine. Installation is beyond the scope here but there's tons of help via Google search.  Alternatively, you can use a separate computer or virtual machine (on your local network) with MySQL installed.\n\n*To design new MySQL databases like a pro, download and install the free MySQL Workbench.  http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/\n\n*Building reports as good as FileMaker's or MS Access was a difficult find for a long time until I ran across the free Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT) built into versions of Eclipse.  I opted for the development kit version - an enormous 220 meg download, but worth it. Check into it here: http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/ \nBIRT can connect to a variety of data sources and is intended as a Java application reporting tool, but it will also render/export reports in a lot of formats including PDF and DOC.  It's every bit as good as the report builder in MS Access.\nPLEASE NOTE: BIRT requires a pretty significant learning curve but you will not regret it.  The thing blows my mind all the time because it is so mature of a product.  Like it knows what you want to do. There's lots of tutorials for BIRT on the Eclipse page above.  You'll need them.\nIf you desire to use a BIRT defined report in a web application, good luck.  I'm not very fluent with the Java web platform. I just haven't had the patience or need.\nAll in all, this combination of MySQL, Workbench, and BIRT is the closest thing I've come to that makes me feel like I have a good native database on the Mac.  \nAll the best.\n\nA: There are lots of free databases similar to FileMaker.\n\n\n*\n\n*Wavemaker\n\n*VFront\n\n*Kexi\n\nA: FREE - Open Office has a database that is useable and you can build FORMS, and VIEWS of your data as well as table views, queries, reports, etc.  It is an MS-Access alternative and there is a version of it for OS X.  You will need to have a Java Runtime installed to use the database functions.  This should not be a big deal as JAVA RUNTIME packages are easy to install and available for Mac.\nBest of all - FREE!\n\nA: Kexi is not MAC!!!!!\nVFront, who knows. Looks like a kluge of an interface for MySQL. There are plenty of SQL apps on the App Store, if you want to fool around with that crap.\nStill checking our Wavemaker, looks like you have to run from their servers and deal with other difficulties, if you want to run locally.\nThe reason Filemaker works so well, is that you don't have to be a propeller head to use it. The moment you want me to start installing servers on my Mac, etc. it becomes PAINFUL.\nPlug and play. \nGlad you are into that kind of thing, but all of these seem like they are more of a headache than something your secretary can learn in one hour, like Filemaker.\n\nA: Open Office has a database for MAC OS X.  I run it all the time.  Looks like Access - openoffice.org from Sun.\n\nA: Tap Forms is also a Mac database app you can try. It's not free, but it's much cheaper than FileMaker Pro and it has iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch versions. You also don't need to be a programmer or know anything about databases to use it. You can build custom layouts, add relationships between forms, perform calculations on your data, print reports, barcodes, and labels and a host of other things.\nFull disclosure, I am the developer of Tap Forms. But don't take my word for it, go to www.tapforms.com and download the Mac trial and try it out for yourself. \n\nA: Mac and iOS users might want to look into the Ninox Database. At $35 for the Mac version, it is far cheaper than Filemaker and the iPhone and iPad versions are free.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ninox-database/id901110441?mt=12\n\nA: MAMP https://www.mamp.info now includes SequelPro, a front end for mySQL. This is a heavy weight solution - setting up an Apache Server and MySQL environment but it is also a simple, free, and effective solution. I used to use Filemaker but I was not using it enough to justify the licence and find Sequel Pro is nice programme to use with the benefit of learning mySQL - and if it does not do everything you need there are plenty of other mySQL front ends.\n", "Q: iOS 7 Activation Error (legal) I was on the iOS 7 beta in it's entirety and updated to the public version via my phone.

Any ideas on how to fix it?\n\nA: I know this was from a while ago, but I had a similar issue and stumbled across this temporary fix. By default, Chrome launches with the wrong audio buffer rate. You can manually set it to the right one by launching Chrome through terminal, but that's a pain in the butt to do every time.

The Frequent Locations setting explains itself quite vaguely:\n\nI see the service polling my current location often*  but I don't see any concrete benefits having this option turned on.

E.g. It's monday morning, I'm at Location A, I go to work in Location B, my iPhone can now tell me that because it's X o'Clock, and I'm at Location A, it will take 30 minutes to commute to Location B.\nI still can't see any benefit of using the frequent location data for any other reason, other than to link with maps and calendar events.\n", "Q: Wrong function key layout on a Mid 2011 MacBook Air My wife just got a used Mid 2011 MacBook Air.

Since the mid-2011 Air models seem to have numerous trackpad problems, it is possible your wife's used one had had the trackpad replaced.\n", "Q: MacBook Air/Pro: run script upon lid close? How can one configure MacOS (10.8 or higher) to automatically and immediately call a user-designated script (probably a bash script) upon the user closing the display lid of a MacBook Air or Pro?\nDetails.\nI want to do this because in some scenarios my MacBook Air 2013 running 10.8.5 does not immediately sleep/lock the screen upon lid close (possibly because a VPN client is trying to open a connection).  As such, I want the system to immediately execute a script which calls this screen-saving-and-locking procedure upon lid close.  However, I don't know how to call scripts upon display-lid closing.\n\nA: There does not seem to be a way for a program to get notified when the lid is closed. However, the state of the lid can be monitored periodically (and in this particular case, every second) and actions taken based on the lid state.\nI do not know of any program that can provide a complete solution for your need, but you can use the following information to build a solution yourself.\n\n*\n\n*Download this clamshellstate.pl perl script\n\n\n*You can run it in Terminal (under /Applications/Utilities) like:\n./clamshellstate.pl 1  \n\nto get an output like \"Open\" or \"Closed\" indicating the current lid state\n\n\n*Create a shell script like (substitute script-to-run with a shell script you'd like to run):\n./clamshellstate.pl 1 | grep Closed > /dev/null && *script-to-run*\n\n\n\n*Configure this script to run once every second using launchd.plist. Or use Lingon to easily configure launchd.plist.\nNote: Instead of clamshellstate.pl, you can also use the following command in Terminal:\nioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState | grep AppleClamshellState | cut -f2 -d\"=\"\n\nto get a \"Yes\" for the closed state and a \"No\" for the open state.\n\nA: You could also try using SleepWatcher. See the readme for instructions:\n\n1. Install the SleepWatcher software:\n$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share/man/man8\n$ sudo cp ~/Desktop/sleepwatcher_2.2/sleepwatcher /usr/local/sbin\n$ sudo cp ~/Desktop/sleepwatcher_2.2/sleepwatcher.8 /usr/local/share/man/man8\n\n2. Read the man page and think about the features of SleepWatcher you want to use:\n$ man sleepwatcher\n\n3. Write small shell scripts that perform the actions you want to trigger by SleepWacher and test them.\n4. Test your scripts in combination with SleepWatcher, started in the foreground in a Terminal window, e. g.:\n$ /usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher --verbose --sleep /path/to/your/sleepscript --wakeup /path/to/your/wakeupscript ...\n\n5. Put your SleepWatcher command line into a launchd agent configuration file. As an example you can use one of the plists from ~/Desktop/sleepwatcher_2.2/config. For more information about launchd and its configuration, see the man pages for launchd and launchd.plist and http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html.\n6. Copy your launchd agent configuration to /Library/LaunchDaemons or ~/Library/LaunchAgents, depending on whether you need a system wide daemon or a user agent. \n7. Load the launchd agent configuration using launchctl (see examples above and the launchctl man page).\n\n\nA: You could try using the ControlPlane app which can act on various state changes on your Mac including whether the lid is closed or not.\nAlso it is possible to use Hammerspoon to activate specific scripts on waking and sleeping as mentioned in my answer to another question. The lua scripts could be augmented to check for the lid state using the ioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState test mentioned in M K's answer here.\n", "Q: Upgrade from non-server to server? Is it possible to upgrade from a non-server (desktop) edition of OS X to the server edition? I currently have a Mac Mini running standard ML but I'd like to upgrade it to the Server version as I use it for a home fileserver and the connections frequently get maxed out. Preferably I'd like to go straight from ML -> Mavericks Server, but I don't even know if the desktop-to-server path is possible on any edition without a fresh install (I hope it is).\n\nA: OS X Server, from OS X Lion onwards, is just another app you buy from the Mac App Store and install. You do not need to do a fresh install of the OS. There are generally no special hardware requirements for OS X Server compared to the client edition either.\nTo move from OS X Mountain Lion client to OS X Mavericks server, you would first have to upgrade to OS X Mavericks client, then buy and install the Server App from the Mac App Store.\nThe General Requirements section on OS X Server Technical Specifications page currently states:  \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Mac computer running Mountain Lion.\n  \n*2GB of memory.\n  \n*10GB of available disk space; some features require additional disk space.\n  \n*Some features require an Apple ID; terms apply.\n  \n*Some features require a compatible Internet service provider; fees may apply.\n  \n*Some features are not available in all countries.\n  \n\n", "Q: Can't delete stuck app from home screen How does one delete Bingo Bash from apps screen. Somehow it is stuck on the apps screen when I go to apps. I have no idea how it showed up there since I was going to look for another app.\n\nA: When you open the App Store application, it usually shows you the last page you were in (as opposed to other stores-android,anyone?-starting from a \"fresh\" home screen by defaule).\nIf anywhere in the past you searched for a particular app (in your case, Bingo Bash), the App Store application politely reminds it to you, in case you still wanted to download said application.\nTo erase a previous search, just tap on the x symbol on the right side of the search field. Your previous search should disappear. You could also tap on \"Features\", or \"Update\" at the bottom of the screen, but that will not erase your previous search, just point the App Store to a different page.\nAnswer refers to an UN-jailbroken phone, with NO additional applications installed (i.e. Cydia)\n", "Q: Is it legal to use content from Apple developer site for internal training documents? Apple developer site has lot of content for someone who is learning iOS/Mac Development. Is it legal to use that content to prepare a training document for freshers in our company to help them learn things better? The use of the content will be completely non-commercial.\n\nA: Well, not a lawyer here, but you could infer that your use would be considered acceptable use based on the following information, as long as you don't use any paid content (content obtained as part of a paid developer program) in these presentations:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Support Center - Registered Apple Developers has a question titled \"What are the terms and conditions of being a Registered Apple Developer?\", the answer for which points to the Registered Apple Developer agreement (PDF).\n\n*The agreement PDF talks about publicly available information and confidentiality here:\n\n4. Confidentiality.\n  You agree that any Apple pre-release software and/or hardware (including related documentation and materials) provided to you as a Registered Apple Developer (“Pre-Release Materials”) and any information disclosed by Apple to you in connection with Apple Events or Paid Content (defined below) will be considered and referred to as “Apple Confidential Information”.

However, you are allowed to disclose Apple Confidential Information to other employees/contractors who are also registered Apple developers.\n\n*The agreement PDF also deals with Apple Confidential Information disclosure here:\n\n5. Nondisclosure and Nonuse of Apple Confidential Information. Unless otherwise expressly agreed or permitted in writing by Apple, you agree not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than to other Registered Apple Developers who are employees and contractors working for the same entity as you and then only to the extent that Apple does not otherwise prohibit such disclosure.

Any ideas how to get out of it? I'm on an  IPAD\n\nA: I'm working on a iPad version and some bug fixes for the iPhone version. The iPad version is almost ready so this is a known bug of the app.\n", "Q: What do I do when OS X freezes? It happened to me twice recently. I was just using my iMac normally, like browsing the web, and it suddenly freezes. I can move the mouse, but I can't click on anything. Keyboard not functioning at all. I couldn't figure out what to do except for pressing the power button and reboot. What else can I do? Is there a way to diagnose and find out what is causing it?\n\nA: A strategy to try when the freeze is actually happening is holding ⌘ Cmd and ⌥ Opt, then hitting ⎋ Escape.\nIf your keyboard input is still working, this should bring up the force-quit dialog (which can be navigated using the arrow keys and Enter).  This may allow you to close problematic applications without a hard shutdown using the ⌽ Power button.\n\nA: Usual troubleshooting steps for similar cases are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean system and user cache (slightly dangerous procedure if you don't know what you're doing) there is a program called CleanGenius that might help, but it's been severely limited due to the new sandboxing policies introduced with OS 10.7\n\n*repair Disk Permissions (easy, you can do it with Apple's Disk Utility, which is installed by default in the Utilities folder)\n\n*Reset PRAM (easy, you need to start up your computer keeping four keys pressed: command, option, P, R and release them AFTER you heard the startup chime TWICE)\n\n\nThose steps should solve the problem.\nDifferential diagnosis would be checking the RAM for a defective bank and checking internet plugins (but in that case, I suppose not all the system would lock up, just the browser) and processes running in the background. But for this kind of diagnosis, I would suggest entrusting your Mac to a specialist.\n\nA: Try cleaning the dust bunnies out of the video card. After months of making me crazy I think I tracked it down to dust blocking the heat sink channels on my video card. I was blaming my freezed on Flash, but I realize that was working my video card just hard enough it got hot and quit. Haven't had a freeze in days.\n", "Q: Block access from WAN but not from LAN I have an OSX Lion box behind a router (firewall on in the router). On the OS X, if I switch the firewall on, I'm unable to access the web server running on this box from outside the network (i.e. WAN). This is as expected.\nHowever, if I try to access the web server from within the network (i.e. LAN), my requests are still blocked.\nTwo questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this the expected behavior?\n\n*If (1) is true, can I do/get something else that can enable me to do what I want i.e. block access from WAN but allow access from LAN?\n\n\nEDIT:\nI have \"Allow Incoming Connections\" enabled for \"Web Sharing\" in firewall options.\n\n\nA: Solved the problem:\nIn the firewall options dialog (attached along with the question) there's another entity 'httpd' which was set to \"Block incoming connections\". Setting it to \"Allow incoming connections\" did the trick.\nI do not know where it's coming from though.\n", "Q: OS X software RAID 0 with 6x SATA SSD? I will be able to use a former video editing \"Mac Pro\" :) for a bit, free to configure anything I want in software.\nI would like to experiment with setting up OS X software RAID 0 with 6x SATA SSD.\nNo data reliability required, I will have to relinquish the box after a few tests.\nIs this the very best I can get from the storage layer of this machine? Does it make sense to RAID 0 6x SSD drives? Will I be able to install OS X on the software-striped logical volume?\nIf you have theoretical arguments in favour or against, please explain your rationale. If you have practical experience with OS X software RAID with no parity, that would be ideal!\n\nA: I suspect that 6 SSDs can provide more bandwidth than the SouthBridge Controller on the MacPro can support (maybe 8Gbit/s or 1GB/s)? This may also depend on the model of MacPro that you're using.\nThe throughput supported by the drives themselves may also come into play...Some SSDs achieve reads of about 250MB/s, while others support rates around 480-500MB/s. Your 3Gb/s SATA ports will probably top out at 375MB/s\nMy money's on a benchmark of about 1GB/sec for your 6xSSD RAID-0 volume's read rates...Probably a little less for writes...You can probably attain the same speed by striping 3 or 4 drives together.\nYou can definitely install OS X on this striped volume, but you may not be able to put the recovery partition onto that drive.\nRegardless, the AJA Kona System Test is a good utility to use for this benchmarking. I'd be interested to hear what you find.\n", "Q: From where to download xcode 5? I am using xcode 4.6.3. and now i want to download xcode 5.\nBut i dont want to download it from itunes / mac store or apple developer site.\nSo what are the other sources to download the xcode 5 ?\nPlease provide me links for this..\nThanks.\n\nA: Xcode 5 can be downloaded only from the Mac App Store or from the Apple Developer site. \nYou could create an Apple ID and use the Mac App Store to download it.  \nOR  \n\n\n*\n\n*You could create a free developer account at the Apple Developer portal\n\n*go to the downloads section\n\n*check only Developer Tools under Categories on the left (uncheck others, to make it simpler to find)\n\n*then download the Xcode 5 DMG file.\n\n\nA: You don't need to 'configure iTunes' to download software or use the Mac App Store, but those are the official download channels.\nIf you really need to use a straight HTTP style download then you can get previous versions through being a registered developer https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?q=xcode which might help, the most recent version available at the time of this post is V5 (September 18) which you can pull down in .DMG form.  Note that this is the free membership program, not the $99/year Mac Developer Program.\nSee more here https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\n\nA: XCode 5 can be downloaded from the Mac App Store for free. This of course requires an Apple ID but this can be set up in a few minutes in case you don't have one yet.\n", "Q: Needing FTP Software with editing and hides system files? I am looking for FTP Client software for Mac that \n\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't show hidden system files on the server\n\n*Can edit files using MS Office and then save them back onto the FTP site automatically without the user having to download the file, edit the local copy and then upload the local copy and replace the remote copy.\n\n\nI have tried various FTP software and only a handful don't show hidden system files on the server which is good, and some automatically open files when they are double clicked using the correct software (Word, Excel etc..) but then when you save it doesn't update the remote copy.\n\nA: I believe that Transmit from Panic Software will meet all of your needs. \nThere is a menu option that toggles the visibility of dot (.*) files. View menu (Hide/Show) Invisible Files.\nTo edit a remote file in Word, right click on the remote file and select \"Open With...\" and select Word from the context menu to edit the file. Edit and Save the file within Word and the file will be uploaded as soon as the save completes. There is nothing else to set up.\nI usually use this method with BBEdit and Text files, but I tested and it works with Word files.\n\nA: *\n\n*Within ForkLift (a paid application), you can use View > Hide Invisible Items (Option+Shift+Cmd+I) to hide hidden files on the FTP server.\n\n*You could use the Disklet feature in ForkLift to use remote locations like they were local locations (so you can open files and save them within an app without downloading, saving locally and uploading):\n\nQ: What are Disklets and how do I use them?\nA: Disklets allow you mount any of your remote connections, making them appear to your Mac as local drives. Once mounted you can directly access your files on the server from any app.\nTo mount a remote connection as a Disklet right click on a remote favorite in the favorites manager or in the sidebar and choose Mount as Disk.\n\n\nOther applications that allow you to edit remote files directly without an explicit \"download, edit, save locally and upload\" workflow are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cyberduck (free and open source)\n\n*Flow (paid app)\n\n", "Q: I loaded iOS7.0.2 on my iPhone and all of the purchased apps I had have disappeared from the screen I finally downloaded iOS7.0.2 on my iPhone 4s (I didn't want to do it because I expected something to go wrong).

If you go to the app store I can open them I just can't get them to reappear - how can I fix this? \n\nA: Settings > General > Reset > Reset Home Screen Layout Should sort you out.\n", "Q: How do I include my own zone file in /etc/com.apple.named.proxy.conf When I enable internet connection sharing, a local named DNS nameserver is started that uses the file /etc/com.apple.named.proxy.conf for configuration.\nMy internet connection sharing is configured such that my Mac gets address 192.168.2.1\nOn my Mac, I have a local web server with several development vhosts. I would like to make their names known to devices that connect through the shared internet connection. I try this by including this section into com.apple.named.proxy.conf:\nzone \"local\" IN {\n    type master;\n    file \"vhosts.zone\";\n    allow-update { none; };\n};\n\nMy problem is that the file /etc/com.apple.named.proxy.conf gets recreated on every new sharing session and any modifications I make to this file are lost.\nIs there a source or template file from which com.apple.named.proxy.conf is created?\n\nA: You need to add to the file /etc/hosts - this is read by the DNS server before it goes to any other source.\nYou will need to add a line\n192.168.2.1   machine alias1 alias2 alias3\n\nObviously replace \"machine\" and the other items with the correct values.\n\nA: I am looking to do exactly the same thing so if you have found a solution to this and could publish it that would be great.\nSome investigation I have done:\n- I have added the entry manually to the file only to have it blown away trying to re-read the file by starting and stopping sharing\n- Starting and stopping sharing regenerates the /etc/com.apple.named.proxy.conf file. You can see this by looking at the file creation time. It will correlate to the time you started sharing.\nSo the trick then becomes where is the default or template file for this. It doesn't look promising that when you cat the binary of InternetSharing you can see the proxy conf within the binary\nsed -n 555,599p /usr/libexec/InternetSharing \nfor me shows pretty much the same content as \ncat /etc/com.apple.named.proxy.conf \n", "Q: How to report security issues to Apple?

I have using an iPhone 5 upgraded to iOS 7. Is it possible to turn off vibrations for alarms? I am currently using a song as alarm sound, the vibration is annoying.\n\nA: It doesn't seem so.  \nA workaround would be to turn off vibrations when on silent (Settings > Sounds), and have it set to silent (either by the button or a Do Not Disturb).\nMaybe another app would do the trick.\n\nA: Close... in Sound options you can set it to vibrate or not when tone... phone calls and alarms.\nWhen \"silent\" it will be sound alarm and vibration, but in \"tone\" it will have sound but no vibration.\nThe only thing is that you can miss calls if you don't hear it cause it will no longer vibrate, just sound (loudy place)... but in silent there will be vibration and no sound.\n\nA: Leave all your settings as is. Leave it on ring at night. Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control Center and then activate Do Not Disturb.\n\nA: For jailbroken phones, you can use NoVibratedWakeup.\n", "Q: Camera not working again on mid 2013 Macbook Air after the second 10.8.5 upgrade As mentioned here, the first 10.8.5 upgrade made the camera unavailable for Skype. This being totally unacceptable to me, I applied the fix that was around on macrumours, I backed up the AppleCamera.plugin under /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/, deleted it, and put the 10.8.4 version of the file there. This fixed it until yesterday, when I applied the second 10.8.5 update. The update didn't complain about anything, but now the camera doesn't work again. I've tried using the backed up file, the 10.8.4 again, and the new version that a friend who didn't apply the fix got from the new update (which I didn't). His AppleCamera.plugin is 2.3MB in size, while mine is 2.2MB or 2.4MB (backed up / 10.8.4).\nI'm sure everyone who applied that fix is now with the same problem, but I can't find anyone mentioning anything anywhere. Help!\n\nA: So, if I understand correctly, you did these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgraded to 10.8.5\n\n*Found the camera didn't work in Skype\n\n*Backed up /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin\n\n*Put AppleCamera.plugin from 10.8.4 in its place\n\n*Camera worked\n\n*Upgraded to 10.8.5 Supplemental Update\n\n*Camera broken again\n\n\nThe Supplemental Update does include a copy of AppleCamera.plugin (see below), so one quick thing to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put your copy of AppleCamera.plugin from step (3) back into place\n\n*Download the 10.8.5 Supplemental Update again.  You can get it as a DMG file from Apple DL1686\n\n*Re-run that update (double click the .pkg file in the DMG)\n\n\nBy the way, you can see what files are contained within the update: double click the .pkg file, then choose File > Show Files from the installer.\n\n\nA: The safest route would be restarting your Mac from the Recovery Partition (hold Command+R at startup) and reinstall OS X. You need an active internet connection, but you get a full install of the last available OS version in one step. Then you should download and install a fresh copy of Skype.\nMore info about OS X Recovery: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\nThe general idea is: if an OS update breaks an application, the best course of action is waiting for the developers to fix it. Also, I would recommend using Time Machine: it is not perfect, but it is a quite convenient safety net should anything like this happen to you again.\n", "Q: OS X 10.8.5: Can I move icons around in the dock and not have them stay there when the apps are closed? Whenever I drag an open application's icon in the dock to another place in the dock, it thinks that means I want it to stay in the dock even if the app closes.\nIs it possible for me to change this behavior? I like to arrange my icons in a certain way, but I don't like icons in the dock whose apps are not open.\n\nA: You can remove all closed apps from the Dock (even if they are set to 'Keep in Dock') with the following command:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock static-only\n\nYou can assign a hotkey to run this, or set up a launch agent to run this regularly.\n", "Q: Same external hard drive for time machine and storage I have a MacBook Pro (250GB with about 100GB free). I'm planning to get an external hard drive (1 TB). Is it possible to use the external hard drive for both time machine's purposes and as a general storage device (for movies and games)?\n\nA: Yes, That is exactly what I have done.\nThe important thing to be aware of is that Time Machine will try to manage itself using all of the volume it is on. \nWhat you need to do is decide how large a TM you need to hold your data together with old versions of it. Then partition the disk using Disk Utility so the TM is on one partition and the movies etc are on the other.\n\nA: Depends on your setup. But most likely it will work. \nYou can also have your data and backups in the same partition, as long as it is properly formatted. \n", "Q: Read epub book purchased from iTunes on Windows I have purchased a book through iTunes, it is formatted as an epub. Is there anyway I can read it in a Windows PC?\n\nA: Depends on whether it's protected by DRM or not. If it's not DRM protected, you can use free software like Calibre. You can also read the ePub books in Firefox using the EPUBReader extension and in Chrome using the MagicScroll eBook Reader extension.\nTo know if your eBook is DRM protected (fixed the description to correctly say \"DRM\" instead of \"copyright\"):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open iTunes.\n  \n*Select the target ebook.\n  \n*Choose File.\n  \n*Choose Get Info.\n  \n*Look at the “Media Kind” field.\n  \n*\n  \n*If it says “book,” it is a web download.\n  \n*If it says “purchased book,” it’s a DRM free iBook purchase/download.\n  \n*If it says “protected book,” it has a DRM attached.\n  \n  \n\n\nA: To read ebooks on a PC, it's best buy them from one of the stores which provides a free ereader app for that platform, probably Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Googlebooks, or Sony. \nThere is no indication Apple will join that group (it took 3 years to extend iBooks from iOS to OS X), but there are some publishers, like O'Reilly, who sell unprotected books on the iBookstore, and these can be read on a PC with the apps described by M K.\n\nA: You can open your epub files with any of these programs:\n\n\n*\n\n*EPUB Reader\n\n*Adobe Digital Editions Home (recommended)\n\n*Okular\nYou can read which one is best for you.\n\nA: On a Windows7 machine I right-clicked the ibook in the iTunes application window and COPIED it via the pop-up menu onto my Windows desktop (you could copy it into any folder of your choosing). I then changed the extension of the copied file, which is a .ibooks-file, to .epub (just simply renaming the extension of the file name). I then could open the renamed file with the Calibre E-book viewer as well as with Adobe Digital Editions. Give it a try!\n\nA: In order to read Ibooks in your computer, you need to install the Adobe Digital Editions software (free). In ITunes, I right click on the book that I want to read then right click and paste it on my desktop. It will be paste with an epub extension. then I use the Adobe Digital Editions to open it. I have read a lot of books using this software with no problem.\n\nA: The ePUb files bought from iTunes are DRM protected, no open source readers could let you read the books.

I'm running into an annoying issue with OS X's automatic spelling correction where the word nala gets automatically corrected to napa.\nI've tried adding nala to my custom dictionary under ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary but it still reliably makes the correction anyway.\nHow do I configure OS X to not automatically correct a given word short of turning off automatic correction entirely which is not really desirable?\n\nA: Yes you can do it.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Text.  \n\n*Click the + sign on the bottom left to add a new text replacement.\n\n*In the Replace column, put the word you want OS X to stop autocorrecting (no spaces are allowed).\n\n*In the With column, put the exact same word you put in the Replace column.\n\n\nVoila.  You're done.\nThis has worked flawlessly for me every time.\n\nA: If you hold the option key when you hit the space bar after typing the word autocorrect will not change the word.\n\nA: When typing the word, right-click it and choose Spelling & Grammar → Show Spelling and Grammar. This will bring up a window similar to the one below. It should say that the word was not found in the spelling dictionary.\nClick Learn to teach the word to the current dictionary.\n                   \n\nThe file ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary only contains some of your corrections. This depends on which language you have currently selected. For example, my ~/Library/Spelling/ folder contains multiple custom dictionaries depending on the language that I have currently set.

It has the same effect as hitting the X button on the suggested \"correction.\"\nIt's not a permanent fix for a word you need to use consistently, but it should help avoid you adding hundreds of words to the dictionary or turning off autocorrect completely.\n\nA: This has been driving me crazy for weeks (on and off for years) until I had time to sit down and briefly brute force find a solution. I figured that there must be a solution - there just must be.\nHere is the solution - it works and has been tested on different versions of MacOS. It may be that it was not designed to be a solution to this particular problem and it could be a coincidental answer but it is an answer.\nWhen you have typed the word and before pressing space hold down option (⌥) and the escape whilst pressing space. The word will not be autocorrected.\nAn occasional side effect of this solution is that subsequent spellings of the word may temporarily also not be corrected but this is not consistent.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences → Language & Text.\nChoose the Text tab. There you can see all of the auto-correct words - just disable\\delete nala.\n\nA: Right click on the word and choose Learn Spelling.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Keyboard . Go to text tab.

Safe? My friend is currently running the default firewall with \"Block all incoming connection\" (except the basic ones like 80).

You can find the names of the programs that are listening at these ports using the following command in Terminal (under /Applications/Utilities):\nlsof -i :3128\nlsof -i :8080\n\nThe first column of the output would be the program name.\n\nA: Ports 3128 and 8080 are typically used by HTTP proxy software, such as squid (which uses port 3128 by default.)\nPort 8080 is also often used by a local web server used for development or similar, typically because the root account is generally required to listen on port 80.\n\nA: Neither of those ports is opened by the OS. You will want to run a command like sudo lsof|grep LISTEN to figure out what processes have opened those ports on the Mac.\nSee http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1629 for documented ports that Apple uses and note that neither are used other than 10.4 server and earlier where port 8080 was part of jboss as a stock component of server. \n\nA: If this is OS X, it is quite possible the system has running virtual machine such as Parallels or VMWare running Windows. Windows runs bunch of open ports that are not used by OS X.

I'm looking for a specific email I may have deleted, but I don't remember when I received it (it was at least a couple months ago).  Digging through my Mail history in Time Machine for a single email would take forever - why isn't there an obvious search function for Time Machine?\nDoes anyone have a technique or strategy for searching past emails in Time Machine?\n\nA: Emails are stored in sub-directories located in ~/Library/Mail/V2 in .emlx format. This allows you to do a global plaintext search within a specific time machine backup folder.\nI wrote a shell script to search for text within all .emlx files in a specific time machine backup.\nAlternatively you can do a drive search in terminal (what my script automates). Replace Search Query with what you want to search for:\nfind \"/Volumes/Time Machine\" -name \"*.emlx\" -exec grep -l \"Search Query\" {} \\;\n\nOr also replace /Volumes/Time Machine with a more specific directory to speed things up e.g /Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/stan/2014-09-16-084603/\n\nA: The recommended way to search through Time Machine is using Spotlight.\nFrom Apple Support - Recover items using Time Machine and Spotlight:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open a Finder window and type a search word or phrase in the search field in the upper-right corner.\n  \n*Select a location to search in the location bar.\n  You can search your entire computer (This Mac) or the folder that was selected in the Finder when you started your search.

In iOS 7, some apps can now update their data even when the app is not open. This feature is called \"Background App Refresh\". How often does each app update their content using this method? Is it up to the app to determine the frequency, or does iOS 7 limit them?\n\nA: This depends on several factors and is not generally tied to a fixed time schedule - active usage of the device, push notifications to apps, location based updates and iOS 7's learning ability to optimize based on your usage patterns for apps.\nFrom iOS: Understanding multitasking (bold italic emphasis mine):\n\nCertain tasks or services can continue to run in the background. To lessen the affect on battery life, normal app background refreshing is scheduled for efficient times, such as when your device is connected to Wi-Fi, plugged into a power source, or being actively used.\nYou can adjust your apps' background activity in Settings > General > Background App Refresh.\nWhen Background App Refresh is on, apps that take advantage of this feature can refresh themselves in the background. For example, an app can check if new content is available and download the updates, or retrieve the updated content in the background when it receives a push notification, so the new content is ready for viewing when you launch the app. Apps can also schedule background refreshing based on your location. iOS learns patterns based on your use of the device and tries to predict when an app should be updated in the background. It also learns when the device is typically inactive, such as during the night, to reduce update frequency when the device not used.\n\nTo improve battery life, you could selectively turn off background refresh for certain apps from Settings > General > Background App Refresh.\n\nA: This depends on system as was said before. For me it was typically 20 minutes (I set min time to 60 seconds) for new app.\n", "Q: Texting from iPad to Android device Can I send a text message from my iPad (iOS7) to someone with an Android device?

I have an AT&T iPhone 4 running iOS version 5.1.1. My contract with AT&T is complete, and they have authorized my unlock. However, the process is to backup and restore from iTunes, according to the instructions they sent.\nIt seems like an obvious question, but I couldn't find the answer searching. Does going through that process upgrade the operating system? I do not want to upgrade the OS because I am concerned it will make the phone slow.\nUPDATE:  I followed the instructions from M K, with the results described EXCEPT no iTunes unlock message.  \nHowever, even though I had received an immediate response on the AT&T portal with instructions how to unlock, 24 hours later I received an email from AT&T, containing the same instructions as the portal, but now asking me to wait 24 hours after receipt of the email.  So I will wait and try again tomorrow.\nUPDATE #2: I followed the instructions from M.K. again on the following day, 48 hours after I had submitted my request, with the results described EXCEPT that when I reconnected the phone, iTunes gave me a spinning beach ball, and then crashed.  Then I got a message box telling me that iTunes quit unexpectedly.  I took the \"restart\" option.  iTunes came up, processed for about 20 seconds, and then gave me the message that my iPhone had been unlocked, in the main iTunes window.  No OS update (still version 5.1.1)  Thanks!\n\nUPDATE #3: The unlocked phone is, in fact, unlocked -- I took it to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  In each country, I was able to buy a cheap GSM card, only about $3 in Sri Lanka, which let me surf the Internet and make and receive local calls for the week I was there.  And I am still running iOS version 5.1.1\n\nA: Yes, a backup and restore will force iTunes to update the device with the latest version of iOS. In order to get around it, follow a slightly different procedure described at How to restore iOS without updating (edited instructions here):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Backup the iPhone in iTunes\n  \n*Disconnect the iPhone from the computer\n  \n*On the iPhone, go to Settings > General > Reset and select \"Erase All Contents and Settings\"\n  \n*Wait for the phone to display the swipe to setup screen\n  \n*With iTunes already running, connect it to the computer \n  \n*iTunes will display the unlock message\n  \n*Click on Done\n  \n*iTunes will present the option to restore from a backup\n  \n*Restore from the recent backup you made\n  \n*iTunes will also sync all your apps after the data and settings restore is completed (the entire process may take a while depending on the amount of space used on the iPhone)\n  \n\nSee:  \n\nA: My experience is also that you do have to perform a full restore of your device to have it check for and implement a carrier unlock. Since the signing window is closed for iOS 5 on iPhone 4, you won't be able to avoid updating to iOS 7 the next time you restore that device. It's not that the unlock needs theograde, just the flash of the device firmware and radio software. \nAlso, I haven't seen the untethered erase all content and settings help for properly unlocking, but if you have a good backup, you stand to lose nothing but time in trying that. \nThe good news is you don't have to erase the device now - once the unlock is entered in the system, it will trigger the next time you restore while connected to iTunes. \n", "Q: case mismatch in Mail.app between raw and displayed from fields I notice that Mail.app (version 6.5) sometimes displays the from field of a message in a different case from how it is written in the raw message source. This seems to account for why some digitial certificates are listed as invalid (\"Unable to verify message signature\") by Mail. If the certificate lists the RFC 822 Name in lowercase, and the raw source of the message lists the email address in lowercase, but Mail is displaying it with initial capitals, then the certificate is listed as invalid.\nI've anonymized the particular example I'm working with -- let's say the address is foo.goo@blah.com.\nFor example, I have a message in which the from line of the raw source -- and all other references to this email address in the message header and body -- are in lower case (foo.goo@blah.com), and yet Mail displays the from field with initial capitals (Foo.Goo@blah.com).  Not only that, but control-clicking on the from field also yields the capitalized version (Foo.Goo@blah.com).\nSo my question is: what is causing Mail to capitialize the email address?\nI have smart addresses turned off in Mail viewing preferences. My address book only lists the person in question's email address in all lowercase.  And I don't have a certificate from the person in my keychain that's not in lowercase.\nClearly Mail is looking somewhere else, but where?.\n\nA: Just a quick idea: have you checked Window > Previous Recipients?\n", "Q: Disable the Command-Tab shortcut from Dock I have the following problem:\nI'm an extensive Quark User since the 90's and recently updated\ntwo of my Macs at work to OSX 10.7.5.

When creating services in automator, the topmost options is \"Service receives selected...\" Is there a way to create a service that just works on the currently open finder window, without having a file selected? The reason why this would be nice to have is the following:\nI have my unit tests in a directory tree that duplicates that of my source code. I wrote a service using automator, applescript and php that makes it possible to toggle back and forth between the source directories and my test directories. Currently I have to select a file in the directory to activate the service.

According to MATLAB, the solution is:\n\n1) Install/activate manually without using Internet. MATLAB will work\n  fine even if you have JDK 7 installed because it will still be using\n  Apple's Java 6 that does not get removed when JDK 7 is installed.\n2) Alternatively, you may uninstall JDK 7 which will let you install\n  and activate MATLAB using Internet.\n\nI need an internet connection, so number 1 won't work.  I need JDK 7 as well, so I was wondering if I would be able to uninstall JDK 7, then install MATLAB, then reinstall JDK 7 without breaking MATLAB.  Is this possible, or are there any other workarounds?\n\nA: Short answer: Yes. It'll work fine if you put JDK 7 back after the installation. Though you might have to do the same thing if you decide to de-activate Matlab at some point.\nYou've got a few options.\nOption A: Use a newer Matlab\nAn easy fix could be to use Matlab R2014a. It supports Mavericks and comes with its own bundled JVM so it doesn't use the system JVMs. I just installed it on my Mavericks machine last week, which didn't even have Apple's Java 1.6 installed, and it worked fine. (I also looked at the source to confirm its \"Activate\" uses the bundled JRE.)\nOption B: Temporarily Uninstall JDK 7\nIf that's not an option, it sounds like removing the JDK 7 is only needed during the installation process. I'd guess because it shells out to the default java for the software activation program instead of using the Matlab app's normal JRE detection and embedding logic. \"Activate MATLAB\" is a separate Java program, not part of the Matlab executable, so it's run using java. So you can put JDK 7 back once Matlab is installed; normal Matlab execution won't use it.\nYou can conveniently temporarily uninstall the JDK 7 by just moving it out of the /Library/Java directory so the system doesn't see it. Then you don't have to go through the whole download and installation process again.\ncd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines\nmkdir ~/disabledJVMs\nsudo mv jdk1.7.0_51.jdk ~/disabledJVMs\n% also change the JAVA_HOME definition if you set it in an rc file or /etc/launchd.conf\n\n% ... now install Matlab ...\n\n% And restore the JDK\nsudo mv ~/disabledJVMs/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk .\n\nYou can confirm the uninstallation worked with /usr/libexec/java_home.\nOption C: Hack the Matlab Installer!\nIf you want to get fancy, you could actually hack the Matlab installer to force it to use Apple's JDK 1.6 for activation.\nDuring the installation process, once all the files are copied in to /Applications but before you launch the Activation dialog, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go in to /Applications in Finder, right-click MATLAB, and choose \"Show Package Contents\".\n\n*Start an admin-enabled text editor from the Terminal with sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit. \n\n*Open bin/activate_matlab.sh in that TextEdit. Find where it's setting the paths to java and hardcode them to point to the Apple 1.6 JDK, which is in /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk. In the R2014a activate_matlab.sh, it's in functions setVMenvironment and setVMpath, and it sets up a JRE_HOME variable, which needs to be set to /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home.\n\n*Do the same to deactivate_matlab.sh\nAnd then you can proceed to the software activation step in the Matlab installer you left running, and I bet it will work even with JDK 7 in place.\n", "Q: Can I map a character to a different key? I am using a British IBM model M keyboard with Mountain Lion. I have selected the \"British - PC\" input source and it is working well, except for one key: the pipe.\nIf you consider what is printed on the key-caps to be correct then the keyboard is mapped correctly, but there is one difference to what my muscle-memory expects and how the keyboard works in Linux.\nThe key with the \"¦\" symbol (a \"broken pipe\"?) on it lies immediately to the right of the left-shift key. I am used to getting a \"|\" symbol (the \"pipe\") if I use this key with the \"Shift\" key.\nThe key with the \"|\" symbol is the one immediately to the left of the number 1 key. It emits a \"|\" symbol when used with the \"Alt\" key.\nNow, I would like to press the key immediately to the right of the left-shift key (marked \"¦\") and to get a pipe \"|\" output when used with the \"Shift\" key.\nI have tried using the OSX \"symbol and text substitution\" feature and this works, except it does not work in the terminal (which is the only place I really need to use this symbol).\nSo, how can I change the keyboard mapping so that the \"¦\" key emits a \"|\" character ?\n\nA: Revisiting this four years later, now with macOS Sierra.\nIf you have a non-Apple keyboard then you may want to use a more appropriate keyboard mapping. You can select keyboard mappings through the keyboard tab of the System Preferences dialog. Select Input Sources and use the + button to select a mapping appropriate for your keyboard. (You may also need to use the - button to delete the mapping that you do not wish to use before your chosen mapping becomes fully effective.)\nIf you find the mappings provided by Apple to be unsatisfactory (Apple's British - PC keyboard does not map the pipe to the correct key - adjacent to the left-hand shift key) then you may install third-party layouts or create your own.\nHere is a ZIP file containing two alternative layouts files for UK 105 key keyboards. You should unzip the files into /Library/Keyboard Layouts (use sudo).\nThe new layouts won't be available in the abovementioned Input Sources until you log out and back in. After that, you can select them like any other layout (they may be listed in the others category).\nYou can edit your chosen layout if it is still unsatisfactory (I chose the British (PC 105 alt) layout but found that Alt+3 emitted cent (¢) instead of the expected Euro (€) symbol). Layout files are simple XML text files. I identified the relevant key code and replaced its unicode output character:\n<key code=\"21\" output=\"&#xA2;\" />\n\nwith\n<key code=\"21\" output=\"&#x20AC;\" />\n\n(The change was applied in two places: keymap index 3, for anyOption key (Alt to PC keyboard users), and keymap index 5 for the same with CapsLock on.)\n(Once again, a log out/in cycle is required for the change to take effect).\nThe key code for the 4 key (which, when used with Alt should produce €) is 21. Should you wish to discover the key code for a physical key then you could use the Key Codes app, available free of charge from the Apple App Store.\nShould you desire a more GUI way of customising your keyboard then you could look at Ukelele [sic] or Karabiner, formerly known as KeyRemap4MacBook (although the website states that Karabiner doesn't currently work on macOS Sierra at the moment.)\n\nStill unresolved I wanted to identify keycodes without installing anything (think X-Windows xev) and I could not find Apple's standard key layouts (they aren't in /Library/Keyboard Layouts). I guess they are in /System/Library/Keyboard Layouts in a different format. It would be nice to be able to use a standard layout as a starting point for custom edits made as described above.\n\nA: Edit: I didn't notice that you were already using the British - PC input source.\nYou can flip the  ` and \\ keys (§ and ` in the Mac British keyboard layout) by using a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, KeyCode::UK_SECTION</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::UK_SECTION, KeyCode::BACKQUOTE</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n", "Q: How To Securely Erase Free Space Using Terminal? A friend told me that when you delete a file on your Mac in the normal way it actually stays where it is, but it is just no longer usable by your Mac. The addition of more files to your Mac causes them to overwrite the space taken by those unusable files that you deleted previously.\nIf this is true then I'm thinking if your Mac got into the wrong hands, that individual(s)  could actually recover files that you have deleted previously (which could be potentially harmful).\nTherefore how do you delete them securely first to prevent such potential catastrophe (preferably using the Terminal command) ?\n\nA: From the Terminal app you can use the program srm (secure remove).\nSimply start Terminal, then type:\nsrm <filename>\n\nFor more info, take a look at the man page.\nExcerpt:\n\nsrm  removes  each  specified file by overwriting, renaming, and truncating it before unlinking. This prevents other people from undeleting or recovering any information about the file from  the command line.\n\n\nA: If you have an HDD, you can also erase free space from Disk Utility:\n\nIf you have an SSD, it is not possible to erase free space from Disk Utility in 10.7 and later. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3680:\n\nNote: With OS X Lion and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault 2 encryption when you start using the SSD drive.\n\nI don't know if it is possible to use an application like Data Rescue to recover files from an SSD though. diskutil secureErase freespace can also be used with an SSD, but I don't know if it makes files any more difficult to recover.\n\nA: You can refer this page to see the steps to delete the free space from the hard-drive securely.\n\nP.S, the commands mentioned on that page will only erase the free\n  space available. It will NOT erase the contents of your hard\n  drive. You should only run commands like these on drives that are\n  healthy. Running a command like this on an older or unhealthy drive\n  can cause further damage to a failing drive.\n\n", "Q: Is AppleCare Transferable on iPhones? A friend of mine purchased an iPhone 5 a couple of months ago which she now wishes to sell. She said she has contacted Apple with regards to the AppleCare warranty and selling her iPhone and was informed that the AppleCare that was purchased with the handset cannot be transferred to the new owner OR to a new iPhone 5S.\nShe would like to know is this true (and isn't it therefore a rip off), as she is only a couple of months into the agreement and therefore would think twice about upgrading at all ?\n\nA: AppleCare protects the item and is fully transferable to any new owner of that existing phone. Also, the full terms and conditions are at apple.com/legal in case your country specific details differ from the USA. \nYou can also cancel AppleCare for a pro-rated refund at any time so if after three months, you wanted to sell your iPhone 5 to someone that didn't want to pay for AppleCare coverage - you could get the majority of the cost back.\nI agree with what you reported, you can't in general just move AppleCare to another device whether it's the same owner or a different owner. The move in that case is to get a refund in my opinion. The power to decide is in your friend's choice - sell the iPhone 5 with coverage if that raises the sale price (or value to the next owner) or get a refund which will defray all but the few months of coverage that has been used when buying coverage for the iPhone 5s.\n\nA: Contact Apple with the information below. Apple officially says you can transfer it (to another person along with the phone or to another device within 30 days for the same owner).\nThe customer can also get a full refund if it's canceled before 30 days from the purchase date and a pro-rated refund, less cancellation fees, if it's canceled after 30 days from the purchase date.\nFrom AppleCare Products FAQ:\n\nIs the AppleCare Protection Plan or AppleCare+ transferable?\nYes. If you choose to sell or give away your Apple product, you can also transfer the ownership of the AppleCare Protection Plan or AppleCare+. Please see the Terms and Conditions for complete details.\n\nFor transfer, the terms and conditions PDF (for iPhone - USA) states:\n\n10.

Verbose mode shows a load of I/O errors. Disk Verify/Repair run via recovery partition completes successfully, as does fsck terminal command in single user startup mode (it modified the files on first run but not second). I reset the NVRAM too.\nHowever none of these have helped, same I/O errors afterwards. Thinking it might be due to OS files being corrupted I created a USB drive with installable version of OSX (actually 10.9 Mavericks), but it crashes during install.\nI wanted to try Apple Hardware Tools diagnostics but the startup shortcuts D or opt+D don't work - I read it's been removed so presumably I'll need to find a way to reinstall it first. I've tried the usual fixes such as safe mode (won't boot), removing all peripherals, even the RAM sticks.  I can't hear the drive making any grinding sounds.\nIs there anything else I can try to fix this? Is it likely the HD has died even though Disk Repair is returning success?\n\nA: Disk I/O errors literally translate to input / output errors, which occur when the system is unable to communicate properly with the hard drive.  This is very indicative of a hardware failure, whether it be with the hard drive itself, the logic board or the SATA data cable that runs between the two.  Given the age of your Mac (5~ years) I would assume that the hard drive is to blame.  Disk Utility repairs the volume on the disk at a software level,  often it will report when hard drives have a hardware failure but there are also times when it repairs correctly despite communication errors still being present.  \nApple Hardware Test (AHT) IS pretty good at giving you a solid answer but as you've found out it's no longer on your hard drive, likely lost during an old upgrade or re-install.  You should be able to boot to it using the gray restore discs that came with your iMac.  Discs from another iMac/Mac will not work unless it's identical to yours, these are very hardware specific.  AHT should be on the disc labeled \"Applications Install DVD\", with a small mention of AHT and its version number.  Holding down D while booting with that disc inserted should boot the Mac to AHT.\n", "Q: Blink / fade out to where the text-cursor is - Effect? I just installed an application (MousePosé)(which many of you will love) to show me where my mousecursor is, after pressing a shortcut,\nHowever: very often when I'm programming, especially after CMD-Tab, I can't remember/see where my text-cursor is. \nDoes there exists an application that fades out the screen, until at the point of where the text-cursor is, like MousePose does with the mouse cursor?\nIn fact, it's like an Lightbox effect, where your whole screen gets fade-out and only the thing that matters (your text-cursor) shows in perfect glory, with no dimmed light.\nJust like this, but when with the text-cursor, instead of the mouse-cursor\n\nThanks!\n\nA: I don't know of a program that works system-wide, but if you use the terminal moderately, iterm2 has this feature. Pressing Command-/ once will show the cursor with some screen fade, and pressing and holding it will white out everything on screen but the cursor.\n\n\nAlternatively, not the same as fading, but there might be a way to have your text editor highlight vertical and horizontal columns.

After following a tutorial I managed to update to PHP 5.5, and then started having problems. I went to downgrade to PHP 5.4, but then I had more problems, so I tried to re-update to PHP 5.5 and now it's saying it's already installed. However, when I reload my my_phpinfo.php (localhost address) in Firefox, it only shows that I'm running PHP version 5.3.15 which is what I started out with originally.\nCan someone give me step by step instructions on how to go in and delete all the PHP 5.4 and 5.5 files I've updated so I can just start over with a clean slate and re-download PHP 5.5 and start again?\n\nA: I'm assuming that the deployment/install script was put at /usr/local/packager/packager.py when it was installed. Apparently, you can use this script to list the packages that are installed:\n/usr/local/packager/packager.py list\n\nUnfortunately, the script that you used to install PHP doesn't appear to have an uninstall feature. However, you should be able to remove the installed content that was installed from /usr/local. It is probably a good idea to examine the contents of the /usr/local directory first to confirm the contents:\nls -al /usr/local\n\nFrom what I can see, the script is installing the software with prefixes like \"php5-*\", and is linking to the 'current' version of that software using a symbolic link named \"php5\". The commands below will unlink the symlink, and remove the installed versions of PHP that were installed using the script mentioned above:\nsudo unlink /usr/local/php5\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/php5-*\n\nTo remove the supplemental configuration file that was installed with the updated PHP software, you may be able to remove the config file at /etc/apache2/other/+php-osx.conf:\nsudo rm -rf /etc/apache2/other/+php-osx.conf\n\nThen restart Apache:\nsudo apachectl restart\n\nNote: the /usr/local folder shouldn't have much inside of it unless you've installed 3rd party software there. You may find a few PHP installs there that have names like \"php5-5.3.x...\", \"php5-5.4.x...\", and \"php5-5.5.x...\". The rm command above should remove any variants of this naming scheme. Removing the additional Apache configuration file should allow Apache to start normally after the module has been removed.\n\nA: You need to delete the file /usr/local/packager/registry.log.\nIf you open the file you should see it just contains the different versions of PHP you have installed from php-osx.liip.ch. Type sudo rm /usr/local/packager/registry.log in the terminal window to do this.\nWhile the steps given in Eddie's instructions are all important (https://php-osx.liip.ch/#uninstall has the official uninstall instructions), you must follow the extra step of deleting /usr/local/packager/registry.log in order to successfully reinstall a version that you've previously installed from that site.\n", "Q: CMD + tab not working between apps I recently upgraded to OS 10.8, and now when I try to switch between apps using command + tab the quick switch menu (not sure what its called) to the app after toggling to it, but it never actually switches over.  I then have to click on the app in the dock.  I tried looking in the keyboard menu, what is causing this?\n\nA: I believe that the Dock is the process responsible for running the application switcher. It might help to remove the Dock preferences (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Dock.plist), and log out/in. However, this may require you to repopulate your Dock with the current Applications and settings.\n", "Q: How can I \"go to page\" in preview via toolbar?

I want to copy an folder which may contain lots of folders from Dropbox to iBook, and keep the folder hierarchy correct. I used to use GoodReader and works fine, but it crashes a lot under iOS 7.\n\nA: No, this is not possible since iBooks does not support bulk importing of content from other applications on an iOS device. The three ways to add books to iBooks are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase from the iBooks store and download\n\n*Sync books through iTunes\n\n*Send a single book (not several) from another application on the iOS device with the Open In...iBooks option\n\n\nAlso, iBooks does not have the concept of folders and folder hierarchies. It does have Collections, but there is no way to map folders to Collections from iTunes or any other source.\n\nA: You can try https://chib.me/dropbooks/\nIt allows you to sync iBooks with any folder on your Mac.

I have changed my passwords and it's still being hacked. This happened when I was in England and also in Santa Barbara,  sending out messages, deleting sent messages.  Is this a Yahoo thing or is it something that can be fixed? How to stop this?\n\nA: You can delete the yahoo account from your iPad to rule it out as a cause of your loss of control over the account. You'll probably need to work within Yahoo's password reset / linked account controls since it's almost certainly something you'll need to reset things on the server end to prevent.\nAlso, signing out of all computers might be good since they are more likely to have a virus or trojan than iOS.\n", "Q: Share shell script: file permissions question I'm on Mountain Lion 10.8.5 and recently I've made a small shell script which just shows a message on the screen.

If so, how can I prevent it?\n\nA: You can instruct your friends to run it using sh ./test-script.sh. That would not require a chmod +x to be done.\nIf your friends also use OS X, another alternative is to package it as an app with Automator using the Run Shell Script action and share that with your friends. In this case the user can run it just like any other application on the system.\nSee Creating Shell Script Actions in the Automator Programming Guide.\n", "Q: Boot screen has wrong display resolution I recently used my MacBook Pro (OS X 10.8.4) with a projector using a mini display port to VGA adapter.\nThe resolution of the screen was modified from the use of the projector from 1680x1050 to 800x600 but it did not return it back to the original resolution. I therefore changed it back manually via the System Preferences \"Displays\" dialog.\nHowever, whenever I boot the system, the initial boot screen (pale grey screen with the centred white apple logo) has a very small resolution (my guess is 800x600) with black vertical bars either side.

I like to use the desktop app from getpocket.com which is called Pocket. I would also like use the app from lastpass called Pocket. I can't use both with out overriding the other. Is there a way that these two apps can live in harmony?\n\nA: Since pocket for Mac comes from the Mac App Store, you might let that exist in /Applications. The other app from Lastpass might be better if you place it in a folder ~/Applications or perhaps /Applications/Lastpass so that you don't have a collision.\n", "Q: Publishing to folder on iWeb produces strange A^ symbol I published a website to a folder using iWeb following the proceedures indicated on this posting.\nAfter publishing, I clicked on VISIT SITE NOW and everything looked fine.\nI then proceeded to upload it onto my server and I now see a strange phenomenon occurring.\nOn almost every carriage return, the new line begins with a strange \"A^\" symbol.\nYou can see the results of this on this website.\nIs there something that I'm doing wrong?

Everything works fine for couple of days until I turn on my mac and this image comes up:\n\nWhat I'm doing wrong why now keeps showing this window instead of booting to Mac OS X.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Your machine is booting into Recovery mode for some reason.  The logical reason would be that there is some fault on your usual OS volume that prevent it from booting, or it is being instructed to do so.  Given that you state that you get to this recovery screen regardless of what volume you select to boot from, it seems the former is more likely.\nYou should enter the Disk Utility program at the bottom of the list in the screenshot, and perform a check on your chosen startup volumes permissions, see instructions here.  This may or may not solve the problem, but it's a first step.  Even if it does solve the problem, it would not explain the repeated problem on a clean OS install.  Perhaps this problem is merely the symptom of an underlying hardware failure on your drive.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and my IT guy told me to reset my NVRAM. \nJust hold down ⌘ CMD+⌥ OPT+p+r on restart and keep the keys held down until it  chimes 3-4 times.

I have attempted to delete video files from All My Files but they won't delete. I also found that several files with just audio from many of my videos are also there. When I try to move them to the trash, they go to the trash but then another copy is made. How do I permanently delete video and photo files? \n\nA: *\n\n*Open Finder and go to your Home folder (named after your User Account).\n\n*Find the Movies folder.\nYou can drag it into Finder's Sidebar for convenience.\n\n*In the Movies folder, you can delete anything.\n\n*Make sure to quit all programs before deleting something, so that the files are not in use. In other words, don't be listening to iTunes or whatever while you're deleting media files.\nIn some cases, a file may be in use, even if you've quit the relevant app. If this happens, log out and back in, or reboot the computer, then attempt to delete the files.\n\n*Be sure to empty the Trash after you delete the files, otherwise the space will not be regained.\n\nA: I know this is a old thread but many land up here I suspect that have the same issue so I managed to get to the bottom of the problem and solve it like this.\nThe photos app has its own trash so if you have deleted photos and video then launch the app again and in the left pane go to the trash tab and empty it from there. If you dont have a left menu pane then go to view and enable the left pane menu view. \n\nA: Your computer needs to have spare disk space to do things, so if it is 100% full you may not be able to even delete things. \nYou could try to connect your computer to another Macintosh and boot it in target disk mode (by holding down T at start-up). It will then appear as a external disk on the second computer and you should be able to delete some files and make some space.\n\nA: I had this same problem. Tried enabling left tab to find trash, but there was no \"trash\" tab in photos to be used. Then as I was wandering around the app in file and I found the words \"Show Recently Deleted\" at the bottom of the pull down tab. I clicked on it and all of the videos I was trying to permanently delete were there with the number of days left before the computer would permanently delete them. In the upper right corner was a delete button. I clicked on it and got a warning that what I was doing was permanent I clicked on it and the box went empty. I closed out of photos and opened the about this Mac box in the Apple icon, checked the storage and I now have space!!! Hope this helps!\n\nA: sorry this only partially answers the question. I have the same problem: my SSD drive on my MacBook Pro is completely FULL - not a kb of space left. I cannot PERMANENTLY delete the photos because they have to go to Trash first, but no space is available because I stupidly made the mistake of attempting to send 30gb of photos to Trash - it started the job then locked up completely when the drive filled up! I have emptied Trash but it is still locked up, I imagine because it's trying to finish the job of shifting the photos to Trash. In windows you can permanently delete a file directly without having to send it to the Recycle Bin. Is there a way to do this on a Mac? (And how do I undo the command to send the pics to Trash? I am a novice Mac user - been using windows on Bootcamp virtually exclusively since I bought my Mac and haven't set up Time Machine yet. I am travelling at moment and don't have my last back up on me either.)\n\nA: highlight folder, picture, file to delete. \nhold down option and command at same time and press delete. \nShould remove permanently without sending to trash.\n\nA: I had this problem.  I deleted 200GB of pictures and movies as my SSD was full and it didn't delete.  I went into \"Photos\" and there was no option to \"see deleted photos\" and there was no way to \"emtpy a special trash in the Photos application\" as many have suggested on other forums.  Ultimately we have used the following solution hundreds of times to solve for customers.  Removes all photos and movies.  So if you want to archive them, copy them to an external drive or fileserver, then do the below.\nApple has explained that in order to save space, when you copy a picture they actually link back to a \"Master\" copy in the system and you cannot actually delete a picture until all \"links\" to it are deleted as well.  This is a neat idea but very hard to deal with you.\nYou can permanently and quickly delete every photo/movie by deleting the \"Photos\" folder in your $HOME directory.  If you cannot do this from the finder, you CAN do it from the shell, but may have to install extra utilities to get a shell.  \nThen create a new \"Photos\" folder and re-run \"Photos\" and it will say that it can't find the \"Photos....library\" folder and ask if you want to pick a new location.  Say \"yes\" and pic the new \"Photos\" folder you created in your $HOME directory.\nI don't know if you can delete everything through the FINDER or if the FINDER will prevent you, but you most certainly can (as I did) remove the \"Photos\" folder and create a new one in a a shell prompt.\nHope this help.  I have not found anybody else with this answer and this absolutely will work (have done it on hundreds of systems for customers).\nThanks,\nDavid\n", "Q: Update to Apple TV 6.0 has stopped certain movies from being shown from my itunes After updating to the latest Apple TV software 6.0 certain seemingly random movies are now no longer available.

This means that the network will not sync and you won't get a signal. Therefore the automatic date setting will not work either.\nThe only way I have managed so far is to literally scroll through everyday of every month of every year up to the present day until it is correct. This is naturally tiresome and also impractical as often in swiping you drag up the quick menu from the bottom.\n\nA: Try connecting to iTunes, it automatically syncs to the current date.\n\nA: I suppose it's something you need to do repeatedly, if it were just once, you could just deal with it. \nAs an Apple-Certified Mac Technician I should advise that unauthorised hardware modifications will permanently exclude the device from the official circuit, meaning that your customers won't be able to benefit from Apple's limited warranty, AppleCare or Out of Warranty service.\nThat said, and assuming you are doing something entirely innocent, you should try hooking up your device to a computer.

I have installed Shrew Soft and set up the VPN, and I am able to connect to it receiving the messages below. However I am still unable to SSH to any of the servers on the VPN getting errors like the ones below…\nSSH Error:\nmacbook-pro:~ andre$ ssh root@prismweb5\nssh: Could not resolve hostname prismweb5: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n\nVPN Messages:\nconfig loaded for site 'andre test'\nattached to key daemon ...\npeer configured\niskamp proposal configured\nesp proposal configured\nclient configured\nlocal id configured\nremote id configured\npre-shared key configured\nbringing up tunnel ...\nnetwork device configured\ntunnel enabled\n\nI am assuming that my traffic isn't being routed through the VPN, but since I am using a third party client, I'm not sure how to make sure. Has anyone else had any issues like this with Shrew Soft on Mac? If so, what did you do to resolve it?\n\nA: You're referencing the SSH server with the name \"prismweb5\" - that name will likely only work if you have \"search domains\" setup for the network interface that you're using. The search domain would be appended to the hostname that you're referencing above, so if your search domain is \"example.com\", the FQDN would be prismweb5.example.com.\nIt's also possible that the DNS name \"prismweb5\" cannot be resolved from outside of the network. This setup may be referred to as \"split-DNS\", and the private name \"prismweb5\" may not be something that can be looked up on your 'normal' DNS servers (those provided by your home ISP).\nA workaround for this would potentially be to set the DNS server that is at the remote office as the primary DNS server for the network interface (Ethernet, Wi-Fi) that you're using to connect. This will allow your machine to perform lookups of 'internal' names. I'm not sure about Shrewsoft, but many VPN clients allow DNS server settings to be changed to specific servers when the VPN connects.\nAlternately, you can avoid using DNS names to connect to the server, and simply use the IP address to connect. However, this would require that you know what the IP address of the server \"prismweb5\" is (or be able to perform a lookup to retrieve that address).\nIf you are still not able to connect to the server using the IP address, see if your machine can ping that IP address (assuming prismweb5's IP is 192.168.1.5):\nping 192.168.1.5\n\nIf the machine is responding to pings, you should be able to connect to it...However, if you're not seeing IMCP (ping) responses, it's possible that your machine doesn't know the route to that computer (i.e., the VPN interface.) See what 'route' reports for that IP:\nroute get 192.168.1.5\n\nThe route should report an interface that is being used to connect to that device. Often, you'll see something like \"ppp0\" or \"gif0\" (or some other interface, other than en0/en1)\nIf the route for that device is not showing the correct interface, it may help to show all routes on the machine using netstat:\nnetstat -nr\n\nThe output of netstat may include an IP range/Destination for your remote network (e.g., 192.168/16), and may show the interface that should be used (Netif) on the right.\n", "Q: AppleScript: Check if \"System Events\" has loaded When an Active Directory (AD) user logs in, my AppleScript fires and attempts to put their AD home directory in the sidebar for easier access when opening and saving documents.\nIt works great, but about 10% of the time it fails because \"System Events\" hasn't loaded.  I've tried adding delays using:\ndo shell script \"sleep 2\"\n\nBut that doesn't solve the problem.  I've put the delay up to four seconds, and although it helps, it's certainly not ideal.\nIt would be a lot easier if I could somehow detect when the \"System Events\" process has loaded.  Does anyone know how to do this within AppleScript?\n\nA: The System Events process does not start at login, so the delay might be needed for some other reason. System Events also teriminates automatically if it is not used for a few minutes.\nIt probably won't help, but you could try launching System Events at the start of the script:\nlaunch application \"System Events\"\n\nYou could also try using a launchd agent like this to launch a System Events process at login:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>test</string>\n  <key>Program</key>\n  <string>/System/Library/CoreServices/System Events.app/Contents/MacOS/System Events</string>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key> <!-- run at login -->\n  <true/>\n  <key>KeepAlive</key> <!-- run the program again if the previous program terminates -->\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou can normally use something like tell application \"System Events\" to exists process \"Finder\" to check if a process exists, but it obviously requires talking to System Events. In this case you might also use a shell script like this:\nrepeat 100 times\n    do shell script \"ps -eco comm= | grep -x 'System Events'; exit 0\"\n    if result is not \"\" then exit repeat\n    delay 0.1\nend repeat\n\nps -e is identical to -ax (include processes from all users and processes without a controlling terminals), -c prints command names instead of absolute paths in OS X, and -o comm= prints only command names without the header row. You can replace the shell command with pgrep -x 'System Events'; exit 0 in 10.8 and later.\n", "Q: iOS7 Using own tags for the purchased music I decided to post because I have a problem. Unfortunately iOS7 handles the tags of purchased music differently than iOS6 did.\nMy problem is, that I often don't like the original tags from the iTunes store because they are so inconsistent . So I change them in iTunes on my Mac. Everything seems to be okay until I don't sync my music with my iOS7 devices, my iPhone and iPad and I don't check them on my device. Somehow iOS7 reverts the tags for some of music back to their original. I check my devices' content in iTunes as well and iTunes shows my tags correctly but there is also a downloadable file in silver which has the original tags.\nI've already tried different things to get rid of the original tags, deleted the content on my devices, synced automatically and manually as well, turned off the option to show all my music on my device but I'm still unable to list my tags instead of the original ones. The strange part is, that my tags are visible for some older purchases only.\nCan anyone help to solve this problem?\n\nA: I had this same issue too.  I read on another site to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have the song/album/artist labeled how you want it in iTunes.\n\n*Sign out of iTunes on your phone/device (settings, iTunes, Apple ID, sign out)\n\n*Swipe left on the incorrectly labeled/tagged song within the music app on your phone/device and delete it.\n\n*Connect phone/device to iTunes and sync.\n\n*After sync is finished you can sign back in to your Apple ID on the phone/device.\nI hope this helps cause it works for me.

Uninstalled Parallels & reinstalled, then reinstalled Windows 7 successfully.\nWhere does the Windows software go when Windows is removed? Is it also removed? …or is it still there somewhere - if so where would it be?\n\nA: Anything you install in Windows (on a Mac with an emulator) goes into a Virtual Hard Drive. That means a file (more exactly a disk image) containing your Windows installation AND programs.\nWhen you erase a virtual machine, you should be prompted to choose whether to erase the virtual drive as well. But since you don't have the password, that hardly matters.\nThe answer to your question is: if you erased your Virtual Machine because you couldn't remember the password, your programs are gone.

I know that the problem is not the internet, because the internet works fine on all my other devices, both Windows and Mac. I brought my MacBook in to the Apple Store this morning and they renewed the DHCP and deleted the internet plist files from my system preferences library folder. They ran a hardware diagnostic and my hardware is fine. At the Apple Store, the problem was duplicated also when connected via ethernet cable to the network - so it's not an airport problem.\nIt's very strange because sometimes the internet works and sometimes it doesn't, so it's very hard to know if a fix works or not. Renewing the DCHP seemed to work at the Apple Store, so I brought it home, and now can't get back on the internet here. I re-renewed the DHCP, re-added my network, manually entered the DNS, rebooted, and still not working. AirPort shows it is connected to the internet, but when I attempt to load a website, it \"thinks\" for a long time without loading anything and then eventually gives me a \"can't establish connection\" error message.\nMy network settings are as follows:\nIn the main Network window:\nStatus: Connected\nNetwork Name: ibahn\nAirPort is connected to ibahn and has the IP address 10.58.207.44.\n802.1X: WPA: Awarenet\nOn the \"Advanced\" window:\nAirPort tab:\nNetwork Name: ibahn    Security: None\n\"Remember networks this computer has joined\" is selected, all other options not selected.\nAirPort ID: 10:9a:dd:bb:25:7b\nTCP/IP tab:\nConfigure IPv4: \"Using DHCP\"\nIPv4 Address: 10.58.207.44\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.252.0\nRouter: 10.58.204.1\nConfigure IPv6: \"Automatically\"\nDNS tab:\nDNS Servers: only one in the list - 10.58.207.44\nnothing in \"Search Domains\" field\nWINS tab:\nNetBIOS Name: MACBOOK-5BF526 and next to it it says \"MACBOOK5BF526 is currently being used.\"\nWorkgroup and WINS Servers fields are empty\n802.1X tab:\nUser Profiles:\nWPA: Awarenet\nAwarenet Profile\n(both of those are boxes that are checked)\n\"WPA: Awarenet\" : User Name - egoodwin; Password - ?

It appears that the IP address your computer has allocated is being assigned as the DNS server? If you're not running DNS services on your computer, this won't work very well.\nTry to remove the single DNS server (i.e., your computer's IP address) from the list of DNS servers, and see if the machine populates that list with other entries (that were potentially provided via DHCP). If there are no DNS servers listed in that dialog box after you remove the single entry, I'd suspect configuration problems on your network.\nAlternately, it may help to manually configure that network interface to use Google's open DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) to see if they will respond correctly to DNS lookups.\nYou can use the Network Utility program at /Applications/Utilities to perform further network troubleshooting. For example, it should be possible to \"ping\" the DNS server, router (gateway) and some outside host from where you are. This lets you know that your machine can communicate with those devices. First, I'd recommend trying to use Network Utility to ping the DNS servers that are being provided via DHCP. Under the \"Ping\" tab, you can enter the IP address of each of those hosts, and click \"Ping\" to see if you get a response. If all of the DNS servers are responding to pings, see if you can ping the gateway (10.58.204.1). If you receive responses for pings to all of the 'internal' hosts, see if you can ping some outside host (gmail.com?) to see if your computer's network traffic is being routed to the Internet.\nIf all of the ping tests are passing, I'd recommend trying to perform DNS lookups on the servers that are showing up in the DNS table in Network System Preferences. You can use the Network Utility program to perform lookups, but it may be more helpful to diagnose the DNS servers individually using 'nslookup' through the Terminal program. Open Terminal from /Applications/Utilities. When the program opens, you'll see a command prompt. Type in the following queries, and observe whether or not you receive valid responses from all of the DNS servers provided:\nnslookup gmail.com 172.16.2.5\nnslookup gmail.com 172.18.82.11\nnslookup gmail.com 4.2.2.2\n\nThose servers should respond with some answer (and IP address for gmail.com) within milliseconds. If you're seeing the commands hang for excessively long periods, that particular DNS server may not be responding correctly.\nIt's odd that you're having intermittent issues when using Google's DNS servers...If you're on some larger private network (as it appears you are based on the private addresses being provided), it's possible that traffic is being filtered.\nLastly, the Awarenet profile that you're using is simply utilized for authentication to a wireless access point named \"Awarenet\" that uses 802.1x (WPA Enterprise) security to authenticate users (you're signing in as egoodwin). If you no longer use/join a Wi-Fi network named \"Awarenet\" (for work, or school?), the profile can likely be deleted.\n", "Q: How can I block a given DNS from being used? When I get a list of DNSs that OS X is using, it shows 3:\nTwo from my ISP, and one is 192.168.1.1.\nIs it possible to prevent OS X from using the third one?\n\nA: Since you have two other DNS addresses listed, you can click on the entry for 192.168.1.1 and click the \"-\" (minus) button to remove it (although it may not have any practical effect on connecting to sites).\nThe IP address 192.168.1.1 is your default gateway and is the address of your router or modem that you connect to for Internet access. By default, this address will be added in the DNS list in OS X, and the DNS lookups will be done based on the DNS servers configured within the router/modem (where again, the default would be what your ISP provides).\nThe order of the DNS server entries matters for how DNS lookups are performed. So OS X would anyway try the first two that you have from your ISP before going with the third one.\nIf you wish to check and find the fastest DNS provider for your connection, you can use the free namebench tool and reconfigure your DNS accordingly.\nYou can also check your router/modem configuration and configure it to use specific DNS servers if needed (note that any settings in OS X will override these settings):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a browser window and go to http://192.168.1.1\n\n*Type in the administrator credentials (check your router/modem manual or with your ISP for the credentials if you don't know)\n\n*Navigate through the settings, check and/or reconfigure DNS\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4S freezing after ios7 update My iPhone 4S is lagging/ freezing an unbearable amount of time, glad to know resetting will help. However, Will \nresetting the iPhone 4S cause any data loss?\n\nA: To simply answer you question: it may. \nThere are several different options for resetting your phone, but no matter which method you choose, it is absolutely recommended to perform a complete backup of your device. \nYou have two primary options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can \"Reset All Settings\n\n*\n\n*This will erase all setting that you have configured on your device. This shouldn't cause any data loss but is worth backing up anyway. It may not do much for your problems though, in fixing them. \n\n\n*The other option is to \"Erase All Content and Settings\". \n\n*\n\n*This will effectively wipe your iPhone and restore it like new (but still with iOS 7).

In the user Library, there is a Developer folder with about 3.2 GB of space (2.8GB from DocSets and the rest mainly from Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport). I had Xcode installed, I presume these are from that? I no longer use Xcode, is there any downside to erasing these folders? If I install Xcode again wouldn't it restore what is needed?\n\nA: If the only two directories you have in ~Library/Developer are Xcode and Docsets (or Shared/Docsets) then you should be safe to delete that folder. If you did re-install XCode you would get them (or updated versions) back.\n\nA: No its not safe to delete everything in: \n\n~/Library/Developer\n\nDoing so could cause you to lose backup snapshots, any generated Archives for applications and other customizations set in the XCode IDE.\nSpecifically within the Developer folder there should be two additional folders.\n\"Shared\" and \"Xcode\"\nShared contains documentation that you have downloaded using Xcode, depending on how you work and whether you have internet all the time you might not want to trash that, but worst case you can just re download it, so if you need space, and are not concerned about offline documentation, here is where you can grab back some space.\nThe Xcode folder contain a lot, and potentially some things you might not want to lose.\n\nArchives\n\nIf you use Xcodes Archives organizer feature, deleting this will wipe out any Archives you may have.\n\nDeveloperPortal 5.0.db \n\nContains information probably about using iTunes Connect in Xcode, I would guess its disposable, but you may have to reconfigure Xcode to talk to Apple for App Store distribution, etc.\n\nUserData   \n\nThis generally contains any changes you made to Xcode color schemes and font themes as well as any changes you may make regarding Key Bindings in Xcode, again this stuff should be pretty small and is probably something you don't want to throw away if you spent any amount of time tweaking those kinds of Xcode settings, you probably just don't want to trash those changes made.             \n\niOS DeviceSupport\n\nProbably some information relating to iOS devices that you have attached to and tried to use in Xcode, should be safe to delete.\n\nDerivedData\n\nStuff in the DerivedData folder is generally pretty safe to delete, it is all the stuff that gets generated every time you press the build button in a project. It includes the generated log and applications executables and libraries for all the products you build in a project. \n\nSnapshots \n\nIf you use Xcodes built in snapshot tools as a means of version control, wiping out your snapshots will wipeout the possibility of reverting to older snapshots.             \n\niOS Device Logs\n\nSafe to delete, unless you need your logs, you would know if you need to keep them.\n\nTemplates\n\nYour custom project templates, like a UserData you probably just don't want to trash those changes made.\n\nA: If you have installed 4.3 or later version of XCode, it should be safe to delete.\nIt's written here :\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_3.html\n", "Q: Move Microsoft Office 2008 to new hard drive I am installing a new hard drive on my Macbook Pro. \nI have a legitimate copy of Microsoft Office 2008 installed on my computer, but I've long since lost the install disk and license information.\nPerhaps complicating things is the fact that I've decided to do a fresh install, as opposed to using Migration Assistant or simply cloning my hard drive. \nI'm wondering: how can I get this software from my current hard drive onto my new one, whilst maintaining the license information?\n\nA: Since you say it's a legitimate copy (I'm assuming retail—if this is volume licensing, that's a whole other kettle of fish), one path that's open to you is contacting Microsoft.\nThey are equipped to deal with lost product keys, and in most cases can help you retrieve it. Worst case, they can sell you a new one at a steep discount. \nSee: How to locate your product key or obtain a new product key for Office for Mac.\n(And for the future, you might want to stash your product keys and serial numbers away for safekeeping. 1Password has a category just for this. If you don't use 1Password, Keychain Access's \"Secure Note\" functionality can be put to good use.)\n\nA: Pretty much any of the disk cloning or migration software for OS X will retain the license, unless you have an odd install (e.g. my brother had a MacBook with a school license for Office that didn’t get copied over because the license file was in a special admin account). Put your old drive into an external enclosure or dock, and use Migration Assistant, SuperDuper, Carbon Copy Cloner or Disk Utility to copy your old data to the new drive.\n\nA: MS sent me a replacement disk of Office 2010 for about US$20.

I have a bunch of Apple products. iPad, iMac, iPhone etc. And lately I've been noticing that some of my iMessages show up on one device and not the other. \nFor example: when my parents text me, I will be out and about. And when I get back home to my iMac, I will see that there were several texts that I didn't receive on my phone but they are on my iMac and iPad or vice versa.\nI have feeling this has something to do with what the address the iMessage clients are using on each device. How to figure out what the problem is?\n\nA: In Settings -> Messages -> Send & Receive, check which addresses/numbers under You can be reached by iMessage at are checked and that the same ones are checked on all your devices. If there are differences that can explain what you're seeing as depending on which address the sender is using will then determine which device(s) you'll receive it on.\nRemember that you don't necessarily know how the sender is choosing to contact you.  Are they starting a fresh conversation and choosing from one of your iMessage registered addresses?  Are they replying to one of your messages which may have been started by a different contact address etc?  It can get really confusing, but the key is to go through all your devices and ensure that they are listening to and sending from the most appropriate address.\n", "Q: \"New File\" feature for OS X? back in the day (2006-07), before the Intel Mac days, I used an application called NuFile which let me create a \"new file\" like Windows on the fly. Ever since i've been searching for alternative but have been unsuccessful. \nDo you guys know of any new apps that will allow this?\n\nA: Neu allows you to do this. It's shareware and is currently priced at $10. There is also a fully functional free demo you can use. You can purchase it from MAS or from within the demo version.\nAbout Neu:\n\nNeu is a simple application that makes it easier to create new documents in the Finder, without you having to open an application first.\nIt does this by adding \"Create Document...\" and \"Create And Open Document...\" menus to various places, including the main menubar, the Dock, and the Services menu that the Finder shows when you right-click on something. You can also trigger Neu from any application using a special key combination.\nNeu lets you choose what to make from a list of templates, which are simply existing files. Once you've chosen a template, Neu creates a copy of it, brings the Finder to the front, and selects the new file.\nNeu comes with some pre-defined templates, but you can add your own, so you can customise the types of new file available to suit your needs. It can make a blank text file, an empty letter, a shopping list, or anything else that you want. You can have one template, or a hundred - it's up to you.\n\n\nA: I'd like to point you to the following answer. Open up Automater and select \"Service\" in the \"Choose your type for your document\" Dialog. Afterwards use the apple-script in the linked answer and you can now run the service via: Finder --> Services --> Create new File\nSetup in Automator:\n\nCreate new file in service menu of finder:\n\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2013 rotate screen? I refer to How to rotate screens separately, and it is not working for me. When I clicked Displays with the other two keys on the keyboard, nothing happened. So I wonder how to rotate the screen on my Macbook Air.\n\nA: You can rotate your MacBook Air screen using the OS X system preferences. What you need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch System Preferences (first quit it if it’s already open)\n\n*Hold down Command Option and click on \"Display\"\n\n*Look for 'Rotation' on the right side of the Display window and take your pick\n\n\nIf System Preferences is already open then holding down Command+Option doesn’t seem to make the Rotatation menu appear. If you run into that, just quit out of System Prefs and relaunch it.\n(found on OS X Daily and found here on AskDifferent)\n\nEDIT:\nCave! I had serous troubles on my MacBook Pro retina. Do NOT try this method described above in Yosemite (and properbly newer systems as well)\nRead this:\nI recently tried this trick again to rotate my screen and got stuck in a nasty situation.

His display got stuck upside down and the error message \"could not open display preferences pane\" kept showing up. To fix it I reset his PRAM which seemed to do nothing, then I shut down the computer, waited a while, and booted it in safe mode. There I had access to all the display preferences and after restarting the computer the display was back to its default setting.\nTL;DR \n 1. shut down the computer\n 2. wait a minute\n 3. Launch in Safe Mode by holding Shift after the tone.\n 4. Correct settings and restart computer\n5. Feel the relief\n\nA: You can try entering Safe Mode by holding shift during boot. Usually, Safe Mode will clear caches etc and solve your problem. In my case, by simply entering Safe Mode and then restarting fixed this bug.\n\nA: I just had this same problem, the screen got stuck upside down after I rotated it and the options greyed out, then wouldn't even open again. I fixed it by connecting to a projector, and using the menus that appeared on the projected screen to fix the laptop screen. \nI have my projector display as a separate 'display', side-by-side and I think that really helped.\n\nA: I Found A solution.

When pressing the 'eject' button Finder warns me with the message:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"The volume can't be ejected because it's currently in use.\"\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*\"The disk \"Diskname\" wasn't ejected because one or more programs may be using it.\".\n\n\nor when trying to use the Terminal: umount /Volumes/Diskname\n\n\n*\n\n*\"umount(/Volumes/Diskname): Resource busy -- try 'diskutil unmount'\"\n\n\nAs far as I am aware, I am not using this disk but Finder says I do, so I must be wrong. I prefer a clean unmount of the drive. As I am in the middle of doing multiple tasks, logging out and logging in is not preferred as is the installation of third party software.\nTerminal command lsof might be of use here, but personally I think this is too complex for such a 'simple' problem and to be honest, I do not know how to use it properly.\nMy question: How do I know what program is using my drive so I can properly quit that program and eject my drive?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: You could try the donationware application \"What's Keeping me?\" that shows what process/application is using the volume/folder/file.\nThis program is certified by the developer for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, but the RoaringApps page for this application lists it as working fine on OS X 10.7 Lion and OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.\n\nAbout What's Keeping Me?\nHave you ever have the problem where you can’t empty the Trash or eject a disk because something is preventing you? Usually the reason is because some application has a file open, and thus you can’t get rid of the disk or trash the file. That’s why we made What’s Keeping Me! What’s Keeping Me will identify the application that is holding the item open. You can then use What's Keeping Me to quit the problem application (or kill it if needed) so you can perform your task. What’s Keeping Me includes an Automator workflow so you can perform searches directly from the Finder too!\n\n\nA: Have you tried $ diskutil unmount /Volumes/Diskname ?\nOr $ diskutil unmount force /Volumes/Diskname ?\nAs the manpage points out:\n\nDue to the complex and interwoven nature of Mac OS X, umount may fail often.  It is recommended that\n       diskutil(1) (as in, \"diskutil unmount /mnt\") be used instead.\n\nIf your volume has spaces in the name, be sure to escape the spaces with \\, eg:\n$ diskutil unmount /Volumes/Disk\\ Name\n\nOr use quotes to avoid confusion.\n$ diskutil unmount \"/Volumes/Disk Name\"\n\n\nA: I've had this message despite being sure there are no open files on the volume. I checked this with Why Not Unmount, a GUI tool that can indicate open files on a disk.  \nIn my case, it was a sign that the file system is corrupt. Running Disk Utility (or if that wasn't enough, DiskWarrior) solved the problem and made the disk ejectable again.  \n\nA: NOTE: fseventer works until OS X 10.10 Yosemite and the developer's page  http://www.fernlightning.com meanwhile got offline. Hence the product links were removed. With brew cask install fseventer it may still be available on elder macOS versions.\nThere is a GUI alternative to the CLI app lsof:\nfseventer is a great file system access monitoring utility for various purposes. It runs with super user permissions (sudo), so it sees all read/write access of all mounted file systems, and presents them in a very clear overview.\nMy experience: I had a Volume which constantly could not be ejected properly (as in the OP's screenshots), and always needed a \"force eject\", sometimes even a forceful physical disconnection (nor recommended! could damage your filesystem(s) on that disk) or a system shutdown to bypass that brute method.\nMy fix: Summarized: The ejection issue can be caused by corrupted or legacy file content on that Volume. Removing the troubled content can fix this permanently. In detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine which file is accessed (with lsof or \nfseventer). In my case it was a Classic Mac OS file with a resource fork that remained open, likely as some background disk parsing process (Spotlight, QuickLook, or thelike) hung on it.\n\n*Backup that troubling data into a file archive (which preserves (Classic) Mac specific resource data). I simply used Finder's native \"Compress\" function from it's context menu.\n\n*Delete the troubled file/folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*With Finder as usual. Likely this will fail, as it's a \"troubled file/folder\".\n\n*With Finder plus holding down ALT while emptying the Trash. This creates a little more force, but likely it will still fail.\n\n*Through the Terminal with sudo rm -R /path/to/troublesome/FileOrFolder. This eventually worked after Finder's delete attempts have failed.\n\n\n*Try unmounting the volume again. It may still fail, as the background processes, which failed, could be still in a irrecoverable state.\n\n*Restart. Then try unmounting again. From then forth the Volume worked fine again. Normal mounting, unmounting, read/write operations. Only when a file was indeed open by a user process, unmounting was prevented. Perfectly normal behaviour again.\n\nA: Try to relaunch the Finder. Here it works\n\nA: Both the command line solution and What's Keeping Me work great.\nTo recap, command line in terminal is:\nsudo lsof | grep /Volumes/myDrive\n\nThe GUI application is What's Keeping Me, ~~available at Hamsoft Engineering]~~ Thomas Templeman1.\nScreenshots of both with the same search going on.\n\n\nI prefer the command line just slightly, as it's always there with you. On the other hand, What's Keeping Me is quicker and easier to use if you've got it installed.\n\nA: Your problem is probably caused by the process mds : Spotlight indexing your disk.\nI have this problem, and I have not found a solution (yet).\n\nA: lsof is indeed your best bet. The fastest and easiest way would be this :-\nsudo lsof /Volumes/myDrive\n\nIt can take a couple minutes to run, but once it's complete, it gives you a list of open files on the disk. The output will look something like this:\nCOMMAND    PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF  NODE NAME\nmds         89  root   19r   DIR   52,3      432     2 /Volumes/Photos\nmds         89  root   23r   DIR   52,3      432     2 /Volumes/Photos\nFinder     681 alans   14r   DIR   52,3      432     2 /Volumes/Photos\nQuickLook 2158 alans    9r   REG   52,3  1141591 78651 /Volumes/Photos/_tmp_iphone_10_backup/APC_1546.JPG  \n\nIn this case, it's the QuickLook application that has a file open. Closing the application directly is the best way to fix the issue. However, that's not always possible. For example, QuickLook doesn't show up as an application you can get to in the Dock. \nIf you can't close the application manually, you can use the kill command to terminate it from the command line. To do that, use the PID from the second column as the ID to kill. From the above example, it would be:\nkill 2158\n\nNote that sometimes that doesn't work and a more aggressive form of kill must be used. Here's a series of escalating aggressiveness (using the example PID of 2158):\nkill 2158\nsudo kill 2158\nsudo kill -INT 2158\nsudo kill -KILL 2158\n\nYou should be able to eject the disk once the process/application has been killed. \nOne final note, lsof can take a minute or two. It can also hang, but you should give it at least a few minutes before you decide that's what happened. \nAlso, sometimes the base command sudo lsof /Volumes/myDrive won't find anything. If that happens, try adding the +D argument (i.e. sudo lsof +D /Volumes/myDrive). That will do a top down scan of the disk. It'll take longer, but it should pick up anything that's causing the disk to be un-ejectable.\n(Hat tip to Alec Jacobson's post for extra details.)\n\nA: Solution\nMake sure all programs are closed.\nClick the Apple icon in the top left of the screen, then click Force Quit.\nIn the list click Finder.\nNow click the Relaunch button.\nThen try ejecting the drive again.\n\nA: I restarted my Mac and that fixed it :-)\n", "Q: How to simulate middle-click You can simulate a right mouse-click with the magic mouse if you tap the right half of the mouse without touching the left half and THEN click.\nBut is it possible to achieve a middle-mouse-click with the magic mouse (on OSX 10.6)?\nAnd How?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool\nWith BetterTouchTool, you can create a Magic Mouse action to middle-click, such as this:\n\n\nFor trackpad users, BTT gives you the option to perform a 'special' middle click designed for CAD users (accessible through Advanced → Action Settings → Settings for Predefined Actions → Use special middle click mode).\n\nThis allows people who work with CAD software etc. to perform a real middleclick using the trackpad.

Availability (+Time Capsule; -iMac)\n\n\n*\n\n*With the libraries on the Time Capsule, you would have them available anytime since the Time Capsule would be on all the time.\n\n*With the libraries on the iMac, wake on network access, which is sometimes not reliable and breaks (and sometimes requires a patch from Apple) would force you to use other methods to wake the iMac manually (search through the Apple Support Community forums for wake on LAN or wake on network issues that have happened even recently).\n\n\n3. Speed (=Time Capsule; =iMac)\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not have any practical numbers, and do not understand why the Time Capsule shows up so slow over Gigabit ethernet on the thread you pointed, but it may be a matter of time and a firmware update from Apple to resolve it.\n\n*Although the native speed over SATA looks nice when the libraries are on the iMac, do you really need such speeds for music, photos and videos? I think not, even if you're planning for a future when 8K UHD videos become common (with Apple supporting it) and you plan to have large video files. Even 4K UHD (and the currently common Full HD 1080p) can be easily streamed at the lower end of the speeds you have noted.\n\n\n4. Cost\n\n\n*\n\n*You would have to work this out yourself and see what you can afford and what makes sense.\n\n\nWinner, in my opinion: Libraries on the Time Capsule with SSD for the iMac, plus another 2TB external drive connected for backups of the libraries on the Time Capsule. Back up the Time Capsule (entirely or just the libraries) from the iMac using a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner, SuperDuper! or Chronosync or using the Archive function from Airport Utility and an Automator script to make it periodic.\n", "Q: How to type numbers while using pinyin input on a non-qwerty keyboard? I'm using the pinyin input on an AZERTY Macbook Pro keyboard and when I try to type a number, it prints the associated symbol instead (i.e. for \"1\", it prints \"&\", for \"2\", \"é\", etc.).\nI've tried in combination with the Shift key, Fn key, Cmd key but it always only print the symbol and not the number.\nAny idea how to make this work?\n\nA: Could you use the numpad keys under fn?

Initially I was downloading Xcode 5 from the Mac App Store, but I found it extremely slow, and so I stopped the download. Then I downloaded it from the developer web site instead, which was much faster. I installed it without any problem.\nBut now I have two Xcode 5 icons in my /Applications folder. One Xcode 5 icon is from the Mac App Store install with a progress bar at the bottom (progress stopped at one fourth). I tried to delete it a few times, but every time I restart my machine, it comes back again. How do I delete this partial download?\nI am running OS 10.8.5.\n\nA: It may help to manually remove the Launchpad databases from your home directory. The databases should be located at ~/Library/Application Support/Dock...The files may have UUID names (long string of hex chars)...Removing those files, performing a logout/login (or a reboot) should allow those files to be rebuilt from the exiting applications in /Applications.\nYou can get into the Library folder by holding down the \"Option\" key on the keyboard, clicking on the \"Go\" menu (when you're in the Finder), and choosing \"Library\".\n\nA: kill -9 {1..700000} worked, when NO answer anywhere online did. \nMy computer was fine after, in fact, better. Again, open up terminal and type:\nkill -9 {1..700000} \nDon't be surprised if a bunch of naysayers start saying that's dangerous. That's just the macbook illuminati.

I enter the event on the date needed, set the time and press done.  Nothing appears on the calendar.  \n\nA: I had this problem. I drove 75 miles to nearest Apple store with an assigned appointment time just to have the \"tech\" flip a setting button from \"Show\" to \"Hide\".\nIn other words if you press \"Hide\" it hides the calendar, but in pressing \"Hide\" it changes the button to \"Show\". So when I was looking at the button which says \"show\", I assumed it was in show mode. Silly me. You have to press show to make it actually show, but then the button will display as \"Hide\", as if you're in hide mode, but you're not. It's an action button. Press for Show or Press for Hide. Whatever is displayed, your phone is doing opposite to that.\nThe button can be found by pressing Calendars to bring up a list of your calendars, then pressing the relevant Show button for the calendar. Alternatively, you can press the Show All Calendars button to unhide all the calendars at once.\n\nA: Go to the Calendar app on your iPhone. Once you are in, select Calendar from the middle bottom that is in between Today and Inbox. Select Show all calendars. Select Done.\n", "Q: FaceTime hijacked A friend of mine just called me to say she got a FaceTime call with my name showing. When she answered it was someone completely different. She called me asking who the person was calling from my FaceTime. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about. We then went on FaceTime so I could show her where I was. While on FaceTime she got another FaceTime call with my address showing. She hung up with me to answer it and it was the same person again. She even screen printed the person's image for me. \nWhat is going on?\n\nA: Your Apple account may have been compromised.

We have separate PCs. Can we have separate Apple IDs and connect the ipad to each computer under the individual ids? Example, I connect and back up etc under my Apple ID, then later she connects, backs up, purchases etc to her computer using her Apple id.\n\nA: The short answer is no.\nWhile all major desktop operating systems allow users to have multiple logins where their information is sandboxed, iOS doesn't have this concept.\nIt might make sense for this to be added, but I expected it years ago and it has still not arrived in the mobile market. With phones this doesn't make much sense, but with iPads it does. I've heard of people sharing iPads fairly often, but never phones.\n", "Q: How secure is Activation Lock on iOS 7 (and later)? Apple showed this new feature in iOS 7 called Activation Lock, that if you enable \"Find My iPhone\" on a device that is lost or stolen, a person that finds/gets the iPhone will not be able to wipe it or reset it. I'm curious whether the lock is designed to prevent these avenues to defeat the lock:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can they completely drain the battery and leave the phone in that state for a couple of months and then try it?\n\n*Or, can they use any third-party software that can access iPhone from outside the iTunes and wipe it that way?\n\n*Or, can they simply \"jailbreak\" it and forget about this Activation Lock?\nBy what methods can this lock be defeated or bypassed?\n\nA: Any method to restore a device, bypassing iTunes restrictions either by using DFU/Recovery or by not using iTunes, would still require that the device go through the setup process. It is during this process that the device is connected to Wi-Fi and verified with Apple servers. This checks the database of Find my iPhone devices, making sure that the device is not listed. If the device is linked to an Apple ID, with Find my iPhone enabled, then the device will show the Activation Lock screen, and the Apple ID of the account with Find my iPhone enabled on the device will need to be entered.\nCompletely draining the battery would not fix this, since the Apple ID and Find my iPhone state is stored on Apple servers and retrieved during setup, not from the device itself.\nTheoretically yes, 3rd-party software could gain access to a device and restore it, however as mentioned earlier the Find my iPhone state is stored on Apple's servers, so this would be of no benefit, and would not be different to restoring using iTunes when the device is in Recovery mode.\nEven though a jailbreak has now been released for iOS 7, a device with a currently active Activation Lock can't be jailbroken.\n\nA: Yes, it can be bypassed, due to a bug, which is in iOS thru version 7.1.  It may have been fixed in 7.1.1, and if not, will surely be in the next release.\nHere's a reputable source.\nBeware; lots of crooks using people looking for this as a vehicle to scam or install malware...  Then again, many of the people looking to bypass this are themselves crooks...\n\nA: Actually, some legit users of the new iOS 7 are not very happy with this new feature. Some users forgot their iCloud account, which makes it very annoying for them as well as frustrates them. I have read so many complaints on this.\nAnyway, this feature is still not secure. In my country, some hackers can bypass the activation process. You just have to pay around $200 or less. So, the thief can still gain from the stolen iPhone by just spending that little amount and selling it to a very high price. Also, what if that hacker is a thief? He gets more profits from it.\n", "Q: Window manager that will allow rules for specific applications? When I have a second monitor attached to my laptop I always have two windows in the second monitor.  My console takes about 1/3 of the second monitor while Sublime text takes 2/3 of the second monitor.\nWhat I would like to find is a tool that will allow me to hit a shortcut and have it take those two windows, where ever they are, and move them to the second monitor and size them correctly (regardless of what window I am currently on).\nThe closest I have found is Breeze.  Unfortunately Breeze requires that I select the window I want to resize and it only resizes on the current screen.  So if my console is on monitor #1, I have to manually move it to monitor #2 and then hit the shortcut.  Once I'm done with that I need to find Sublime Text and do the same.\nDoes anyone know of a tool that will do exactly what I need?\n\nA: Moom can be triggered using keyboard shortcuts and can deal with external monitors.\nIt can also save snapshots of given window arrangements, which can be triggered either manually or automatically. You can trigger a snapshot from any window and it can save snapshots with up to 5 external monitors at the same time.\nHere's a screencast by Don McAllister showing how this works: http://www.screencastsonline.com/mac/show/0333/\n", "Q: Why do some contacts on the favorites screen on Phone.app show initials and others an icon? In iOS 7 the contacts in my favorites screen in Phone.app that don't have a photo show either initials or a person icon. Why not just one or the other and what determines which image a contact will get?\nI think this is best shown with a picture:\n\n\nA: The icon is displaying because that contact's \"name\" is entered as a business name, and their \"First\" and \"Last\" names are blank.\n\nA: I think I figured out 3 different situations in which an icon instead of initials is displayed\n\n\n*\n\n*emoji in any of the name fields\n\n*The number is a business instead of a person (Thanks Eddie)\n\n*No name in the person or business fields of a contact\n\n\nI would think that it would still show initials in the first case if the emoji isn't the first letter in any of the name fields but that isn't the case.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro slows down from pressure on the bottom (messy solution included) I have some non-trivial problem. If my notebook stands on solid surface everything is fine, but if I put it on my knees (for example, it could be a book too) or just push the center of the bottom cover, the CPU usage immediately grows to 100%. It also causes issues with the WiFi.\nI have MacBook Pro mid 2010, which I manually upgraded to an SSD (optibay) + 8Gb DDR. I recently disassembled it and cleaned it, but the problem came yesterday.\nI tried to manually push some points on motherboard but failed to reproduce the problem, it only occurs when pushing the bottom cover.\nIn Activity Monitor, kernel_task is using greater than 170% CPU. There are no warnings or errors in logs during this problem. \nHas anyone else seen this? What can I do (other than going to a service center)? What kind of problem could it be?\n\n\nUPDATE\nI've done messy solution - place the steel coin between the bottom cap and the processor's fan. Now the bottom cap did not contact the cooler and everything's fine.\n\nA: I would re-seat all the temperature sensor connectors.\nI've read that when the machine appears hot, kernel_task slows the machine down in order to reduce the heat.  The way it does this causes the CPU usage of kernel_task to appear high.\nSo perhaps, when you press on the cover, this distorts one of the temperature sensor cables, causing some faulty temperature readings.  (I'm assuming the machine doesn't seem hot to you?)\nI did a search for [kernel_task CPU heat] and found this blog post, which describes a way to \"fix\" this issue by modifying the kernel_task configuration so it doesn't take this action.  I'd caution against this modification, though, as it doesn't fix the underlying hardware problem -- instead, it disables a (presumably important) software-based safety mechanism.\n\nA: If you replaced RAM in the machine, and the computer is having issues when flexing or pressing on the bottom case, I'd recommend re-seating the memory chips.\n", "Q: Is there any way to save the order of spaces in Mission Control? Is there any way in Mountain Lion to preserve the order of spaces in Mission Control?\nI use four different spaces for four fullscreen apps, and I like to keep them in a certain order so that I know where they all are in relation to each other.\nThe problem is that once these apps are quit, their spacial arrangement is lost, so I find that I'm always manually reordering them into the arrangement I like (since by default a new fullscreen app is tacked onto the end of the list of spaces).\nIn Snow Leopard and earlier (before Mission Control), it was possible to \"bind\" specific apps to specific spaces, so you could do things like always have Safari open in Space 2. With Mission Control, I don't see any way to do something equivalent.\n\nA: What Jay said in a comment...\nUncheck the second box here:\n\n\nA: It's possible to assign apps to spaces in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, but it does not work for full screen apps (bold italic emphasis mine in the Apple support document below).\n\nDecide which spaces to use with particular apps\nIf you work in multiple spaces, you can assign apps to particular spaces.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Press and hold an app’s icon in the Dock. You may have to first open the app from Launchpad to see its icon in the Dock.\n  \n*From the shortcut menu that appears over the icon, choose one of these:\n      To have the app open only in the current space, choose Options > This Desktop. From now on the app will open in the current space; if you are working in a different space, the app’s space scrolls into view.\nThis setting doesn’t apply to full-screen windows, which always appear in their own separate spaces.\n\nYou may have a better solution in the paid app TotalSpaces.\n\nA: Coming in 8 years late…\nYou cannot fix the positions of fullscreen Spaces. They don't have Space numbers & each sets up 'one to the right' of any existing Spaces. They are created as you go into fullscreen & destroyed when the window is closed or the app is quit.\n'Proper' Spaces aren't destroyed, so can be kept in a set order [assuming disabling of the 'automatically rearrange' pref, as mentioned in other answers.]\n", "Q: How can I create a personal Photostream with Manual Upload? My first time using Photostream. I saw that My Photo Stream automatically uploads photos the stream over wi-fi, but I do not want to do this. \nI want a personal stream with photos uploaded manually, and that they're not shared with anyone at all.\nPhoto Sharing states that I can create a stream to share with others, but what if I don't invite anyone, does that still make my stream public ?\n\nA: If you'd like to disable Photo Stream on your iOS device, go to Settings > iCloud > Photos and switch off \"My Photo Stream\".\nAs for the personal stream with photos being uploaded manually, you can, in fact achieve this.\nI find that the easiest way to do this is to first go into your Photo library and select the photos that you want to upload.\n\nAfter that, select the \"Share\" button (the one on the bottom left corner of the screen) and select \"iCloud\".\n\nYou'll be greeted with the screenshot below. Select the button that says \"Stream\", then \"New Photo Stream\".\n\n\nType out the name that you want to call your Photo Stream.\n\nYou'll now be greeted with the screen where you type in who you would like to share this Photo Stream to.

I'm selling my Macbook online and I want to reset the name of the computer to the generic name as if it's completely new from the apple store. In system preferences > sharing > Computer name. I forgot what the generic name is when you first buy the computer. \nIs it \"new computer\" or \"Generic\" or \"New User\"? I know it's completely 100% unnecessary but I want to do it as a nice touch for the next user. \n\nA: If you have time, you could reinstall OS X and quit the installer (and shutdown the system) at the point when it asks you to enter a username and password to create your first account.\nWhen the buyer powers it on, it will then display the OS X welcome message and allow the buyer to complete the setup as if it were bought new.\n\nA: The name is set when the first user is created. So it's directly XYZ's Macbook. \nIf you want a simple name, just call it Macbook. \n", "Q: Deleting photos on the phone - does it affect them on iCloud? Can you delete pictures from an iPhone and still have it saved in iCloud? If so, how?\n\nA: Whilst it does depend on where you delete the photo, it also depends on what you mean when you say 'iCloud'…\nHere are three scenarios involving deleting photos on your iPhone, and the result of doing so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete from Camera Roll\nDeleting a photo from your camera roll only removes it from your camera roll. The photo is left intact on Photo Stream if it has already been uploaded. A photo not yet uploaded to Photo Stream will not be uploaded to Photo Stream after it has been deleted, even if partially uploaded.\nHowever, deleting a photo from your camera roll, then using iCloud Backup, will delete the photo from your iCloud Backup. This means that the photo will not be restored if you restore a backup from iCloud. (If a photo does not exist on your iCloud Backup, and is deleted before it is uploaded, it will not be part of the next iCloud Backup).\n\n*Delete from Photo Stream\nDeleting a photo from Photo Stream will only remove it from Photo Stream. It does not affect the photos in the camera roll, or even Shared Photo Streams - they keep a copy of the photo separately.\nSince it does not affect the camera roll, it will not affect any iCloud Backups, both previous iCloud backups and future backups.\n\n*Delete from Shared Photo Stream\nDeleting a photo from a Shared Photo Stream will only remove it from that Shared Photo Stream. It will not affect other Shared Photo Streams, the main Photo Stream, or your camera roll.\nSince it does not affect the camera roll, it will not affect any iCloud Backups, both previous iCloud backups and future backups.\n\nA: It depends on where you delete them.\nIf you delete them from the camera roll, this will not affect the photostream in iCloud.\nHowever if you delete them from the stream then they will be gone from the cloud, but if the picture was also in the camera roll that will remain.\n\nA: No you cannot have the picture in icloud if you delete it from your device\n", "Q: VPN server authentication error I'm running 10.8.5 (not server) on my home laptop and wanted to set up a vpn server on it.

some system files which are actually 'shims', so even if you run that script to delete those files it overwrote, you will need to restore the original system files.\nFirst, run the script suggested in the other answer. Then:\nEither you can download and reinstall your OSX again, from the App Store.\nOr you could download the OSX Mavericks shims from this torrent, and copy them into your /usr/bin folder, overwriting those that are there:\nhttps://archive.org/details/completely_uninstall_osx-gcc-installer\nNote: This was the solution I found for OSX Mavericks (10.9) but it might work for you as well. Be careful in using these Mavericks /usr/bin files in your Mountain Lion. So you might want to download Mountain Lion again and use a procedure such as this: http://magnemg.tumblr.com/post/113260971290/how-to-extract-only-the-necessary-usr-bin-files\nPS: This answer should include everything you need to know, but if you still need more details, see: http://magnemg.tumblr.com/post/113251602430/how-to-completely-uninstall-osx-gcc-installer\n", "Q: TexShop typing German umlauts with US keyboard I am using OS X Lion 10.7 with an American English keyboard. For typing German umlauts I normally just press and hold the appropriate key until the little OS X popup appears and then I can choose the umlaut.\nIn the TexShop editor I can do the exact same thing. I press and hold \"u\" for example and the little popup appears. Then I choose \"2\" for writing \"ü\" but what happens is that instead of \"ü\" an \"u\" is inserted. I also tried the Cmd+U shortcut but it shows the same weird behaviour. I don't think that it is an encoding problem because I can copy and paste umlauts in TexShop. They get displayed and I can also compile to a pdf document.\nAny advice on what is wrong here?\nI just found a workaround. If you press and hold the letter and then use the cursor keys to choose the umlaut it just works fine. It seems like the problem is the number keys to choose the right Umlaut from the popup.\nExample for typing ü:\n[Press and Hold u]-[2] => Doesn't work!\n[Press and Hold u]-[->]-[->]-[Enter] => Does work!\n\nA: Alt+u for umlaut, then needed letter for putting under. Also Alt+y for acute, Alt+` for grave. You can see all combos on onscreen keyboard (\"Show Keyboard Viewer\").\n", "Q: Can't get rid of twitter from iOS7 lock screen Since upgrading to iOS7 on my iPhone the lock screen is bombarded with Tweets. I want to turn this off as I am sure it kills the battery and is annoying. I turned off twitter in the notification center but it had no effect.\nHow can I turn this off?\n\nA: You will have to disable notifications for the specific client that you are using by going to Settings → Notification Center and tapping on your Twitter client, then disabling Show on Lock Screen.\n\n\nIf you are using the official Twitter app, you can change notification settings by opening the app and going to Me → Settings button → Settings → Notifications.\n\n", "Q: Launch App with Automator when system is idle My idea is to dim the display when the system is idle for 10 seconds, and with a keystroke or trackpad activity revert to original (I want to preserve battery automatically and not using a screen saver - I need to monitor some activity but with low display light). I could not find such application so I decided to make solution with Automator.\nI found application Shady which can dim display when it start and if it is active (in front) with keystroke Q will quit.\nSo, how can I make a script in Automator to start Shady when the system is idle for 10 seconds and then wait for any keystroke or trackpad activity, then send keystroke q to quit Shady? The script should be active all the time, so when another 10 second idle time happens, start Shady again.\n\nA: If you want to actually save energy, use brightness.c instead of Shady. Shady doesn't reduce the backlight levels of displays, and LCDs usually require a similar amount of energy to display dark and bright pixels.\nYou can see the time since the last human input device (keyboard or mouse) action with ioreg:\nioreg -c IOHIDSystem | awk '/HIDIdleTime/{print $NF/1000000000;exit}'\n\nIf you are for example wathing a video with VLC, pmset -g assertions will contain a line like this:\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     1\n\nSo you might use a script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile sleep 0.5; do\n  idle=$(ioreg -c IOHIDSystem | awk '/HIDIdleTime/{printf \"%i\",$NF/1000000000;exit}')\n  current=$(brightness -l | awk '/display 0: brightness/{print $NF}')\n  if [[ $idle -ge 10 ]] && pmset -g assertions | grep -q 'PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep *0'; then\n    [[ $current != 0.000000 ]] && old=$current\n    brightness 0\n  else\n    [[ $old ]] && brightness $old\n  fi\ndone\n\nIt doesn't make any sense to execute over ten new processes every second though.\n", "Q: What setup to use with in a famliy with 2 (or 3) Persons? I get all confused about all these different IDs I have and need to use the iOS devices/iTunes. I want to use our devices in the family the best way.\nWe are three people:\n\n\n*\n\n*me -- currently the only one with a real Apple-ID\n\n*my wife -- currently without an Apple-ID, but with her own email\n\n*and my infant which does not have nor need her own ID at all, I think :-)\n\n\nThe devices we have are:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 iPhone for myself, (\"A\" = phone husband)\n\n*\n\n*1 PC+iTunes, which syncs my iPhone (\"PC-A\" = PC/iTunes husband)\n\n\n*1 iPhone for my wife (\"B\" = phone wife)\n\n*\n\n*1 PC+iTunes, which syncs hers (\"PC-B\")\n\n\n*1 iPod Touch 1G for my infant, which she just starts to appreciate (\"C\")\n\n*\n\n*I probably sync/fill this device with my PC+iTunes, too, for the time being.\n\n\n\nOf course I want to use the Apps and Music to by available on all devices. And as far as I understand this is allowed by apple, as long as its up to 5 devices, which its is. I was able to do this at least while I gave my old phone to my wife while both devices were connected to the same Apple-ID -- but I don't think this how it is meant to be set-up, right?\nVery important is that both iPhones are able to use their respective iMessage accounts, so I can recieve mine (and only mine), she hers (and only hers), and we can send iMessages to each other. During upgrading to iOS7 I managed to mess this up and we got all iMessages of each other ;-(. This is where I got confuded with iCloud-Account, iMessage-Adresses and Apple-ID, I think.\nNot as much important would be to share a Todo-List and/or Calendar over the phones, so we can put items and appointments into our own calendar, which then appears on the others phone.\n\n\n*\n\n*What IDs and Accounts do we need?\n\n*\n\n*and what device should be connected to which accounts?\n\n*What accounts should be the same on which devices, if any?\n\n\n*I am correct that I can legally access the Apps/Music family-wide, right?\n\n*\n\n*If the phones are connected to different Apple-IDs and synced with different iTunes', how can I use acquired Apps/Music on both?\n\n\n\nA: You need to understand that an Apple ID is not (or may not be) the same as an iCloud Account, which is not (or may not be) the same as an iTunes Store Account. An Apple ID is the credential set you use for accessing various services by Apple. Once you have an Apple ID, you can associate it with different services from Apple.\nAnyone can create an Apple ID by visiting My Apple ID. Once you have an Apple ID (or more), you can choose how you would wish to use it.\nFor your case, you need three Apple IDs to keep things simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*One Apple ID shared between all the members of your family for content purchases from the iTunes and App Stores\n\n*One individual Apple ID for your wife for iCloud, iMessage and FaceTime\n\n*One individual Apple ID for you for iCloud, iMessage and FaceTime\n\n\nHere's how you would use these Apple IDs on the devices and PCs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes Store Purchases - In the case of a family (and specifically for you), you would have one Apple ID whose credentials are known by all family members so that all content purchased from the iTunes and App Stores can be shared across all devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*You configure this on your iPhone, your wife's iPhone and your infant's iPod Touch under Settings > iTunes & App Stores menu option.\n\n*You configure this in iTunes on your PC as well as on your wife's PC from the Store > Sign In... menu option.\n\n\n*iCloud Services - In almost every case, this would be an individual Apple ID so that Find My iPhone, Mail, Calendar, Reminders, etc., are segregated by user.\n\n\n*\n\n*You configure your Apple ID on your iPhone under Settings > iCloud.\n\n*Your wife would configure her Apple ID on her iPhone under Settings > iCloud.\n\n*You do not configure this in iTunes on the PCs. However, if you use the iCloud Control Panel for Windows, you can configure it there.\n\n*You do not configure this for your infant at this point in time.\n\n\n*iMessage - In almost every case, this would be an individual Apple ID so that each person receives and manages messages intended for that person.\n\n\n*\n\n*You configure your Apple ID on your iPhone under Settings > Messages.\n\n*Your wife would configure her Apple ID on her iPhone under Settings > Messages.\n\n*You do not configure this anywhere on your PCs.\n\n*You do not configure this for your infant at this point in time.\n\n\n*FaceTime - To avoid confusion, this would be an individual Apple ID for each person.\n\n\n*\n\n*You configure your Apple ID on your iPhone under Settings > FaceTime.\n\n*Your wife would configure her Apple ID on her iPhone under Settings > FaceTime.\n\n*You do not configure this anywhere on your PCs.\n\n*You do not configure this for your infant at this point in time.\n\n\n\n\nOn content sharing between devices, you can use an account with up to 10 devices. Here's what iLounge says based on Apple's policy about \"More than five family devices sharing a single iTunes account\":\n\nActually, the limit of five devices per iTunes Store account only applies to authorizations for computers using iTunes. Apple actually allows you to have up to ten devices authorized in total for features such as iTunes Match and re-downloading previous purchases from iTunes in the Cloud, up to five of which can be computers running iTunes. So in other words, you could have anywhere from 10 iOS devices and no computers up to five computers and five iOS devices or any combination in between. You can view the number of devices that have been authorized for these features by going into your iTunes Store account information from within iTunes and choosing the Manage Devices option. \n\n\nTo share calendars, see iCloud: Share a calendar with others.\nTo share reminders, see iCloud: Share a reminder list.  \n\nA: You can configure different Apple-IDs for the App/iTunesStore and for iMessage etc.\nHere is what I use in my family:\n1 Apple-ID for the stores on all devices (this is actually my Apple-ID as that is the one that had most apps purchased)\n1 Apple-ID for my wife to use with iMessage/iCloud etc on her phone.\nIf you have more members in your family you would add a separate Apple-ID for each to use iMessage/iCloud with.\nMy iPad runs on my Apple-ID for the stores.\niMessage is not set up there and it basically is our computer for surfing the web in the living room that is free for everyone to use. So there is not much personal setup (mail accounts etc.) there.\nAnd yes: sharing an Apple-ID for app and music purchases is legal.\nWe have only one iTunes library that is located on an always on Mac mini.\nWe basically only sync with it if we want to update music that was not purchased through iTunes or to do encrypted backups before updating the phones.  \nSyncing with a second iTunes probably complicates things. Perhaps others can fill in info about this. If we had a second computer we probably would only copy the music to that machine but never sync any phones with that instance of iTunes.\nWe have a family calendar that is associated with my wife's Apple-ID and is shared with my Apple-ID.\nIt probably would be better to have a separate Apple-ID for myself instead of using the (now) shared store Apple-ID for myself.\nThat way the shared Apple-ID could be used as host of the family calendar which it would share with each family members personal Apple-ID. So if you are setting this up all from scratch that would be the best thing to do.\nWe currently don't share a digital ToDo list.\nGrocery shopping lists are shared via the \"Buy me a Pie!\" app.\n\nA: Let's make this simple...\nEvery individual person needs an Apple ID. Your Apple ID is your 'gateway' to, and identifies you for, everything in the Apple domain.\nYour Apple ID will usually be your personal email address - and you must have an email address to have an Apple ID.\nTherefore your wife, who will act on her on behalf, needs an Apple ID. Having her use yours on her iPhone - bad idea.\nFor your child it's up to you whether you want her to have an email account. Obviously you or your wife would be managing that. Again the question is uniqueness... so if you use your Apple ID to 'manage' your child's iPod touch then you will be getting all the kids stuff on your Apple ID. If you make an Apple ID for your child obviously you are not going to be giving her the password - just yet :-)\nAssuming you have all have Apple IDs, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Share app & iTunes store purchases - buy once the whole family use. \n\n*Have personal 'data stores' like contacts etc. but which you can share with each other as wished.\n\n*Have it clear which device is used by which family member.\n\n*Have music which you can share with each other via iTunes using Home Sharing.\n\n\nSetup everyone with Apple IDs, use those also for iCloud and connect the Apple devices to the Apple ID.\n\nA: in addition to @Tourismos answer I would add that you should just get your own domain. And then set up domain and email forwarding.  Depending on who you choose as your provider they will have tutorials on how to do this.\nThat way you can have two accounts one for you and one for your wife called (towdi is just for illustrative purposes, we have a domain with my wife's maiden name):\nmr@towdi.com\nmrs@towdi.com\nThen you can also have an account called mrandmrs@towdi.com and one mrsandmr@towdi.com Where any mail directed to those two accounts goes both to mr@ and mrs@ so you both get a copy. This is a joint catch all account, so that if anybody emails anybody@towdi.com you will both get it.\nThe fourth account would be your joint apple account which you could use for joint apps. We called this account itunes@towdi.com (except of course the domain is ours not towdi.com)\nKeep itunes logged in with the itunes account.\nMail and iMessage with mr@towdi.com for you and mrs@towdi.com for your wife.\n", "Q: How can I type the currency symbol for Costa Rican colón on my Mac?

Sometimes it crashes. Even App Store, Music and Voice Memo crash, but it does not happen frequently. Then there are about two times the phone freeze for a moment while I was browsing through my photo and when I was downloading app. Here is my diagnostic and usage screenshot:\n\n\nI have restored my phone to factory setting yesterday but the problem still persists, so is my problem serious or is it normal? Since the Apple Store is quite far from my house, is it worth my time travelling there?\n\nA: I would absolutely recommend a genius bar appointment if it's convenient and they can be sure your phone is reporting these crashes to Apple Engineering. That being said, you have a totally normal volume of logs and glitches for a new OS release that hasn't had time to have all these little bugs patched.\nOf the messages you listed, these are harmless and diagnostic whether you have an app crash or not:\n\n\n*\n\n*awdd-YYYY-mm-dd-hhmmss-whatever-else\n\n*log-aggregated-YYYY-mm-dd-hhmmss-whatever-else\n\n*LowMemory-YYYY-mm-dd-hhmmss-whatever-else\n\n\nYour phone is set up report each crash anonymously (they strip the identifier of the device from the reports intentionally) and the genius bar will ensure you are reporting these so that Engineering can make sure the most common crashes get sorted out.\nThe other benefit of the genius bar is they can run hardware diagnostics. You can also get these to run by seeking phone or web support in many areas:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/contact/\nClick the link that says you can get connected with an expert online.\nNow, if you can't get to the genius bar, I can also say that they won't likely be able to dig into any of the crash logs other than perhaps the LowBattery log and LowMemory log and they will just look at them with you. You can look at them and figure out mostly what is going by reading the english descriptions and ignoring most of the hex (0x2f8107c6) and UUID (3A197A6D-1D9B-4F1D-BE12-356F8D3F3C2B).\nLowBattery logs are how Apple (and the astute user) can tell if the battery needs replacing or if the programs are just using too much power in the background. LowMemory logs are just diagnostic - kind of like keeping your weight so that you can look back and tell when you were gaining, when you were holding steady and when you were losing.\nThese logs make the most sense when you track them over time and not so much that you have one now to 13 at this point.\n\nA: If you restored to Factory settings and then restored a backup then you have proven that he problem is probably somewhere in your backup. Try restoring to Factory settings and setting it up as a new phone. If it still crashes, then take it to the Genius Bar.\nI'd suggest adding back applications slowly and restoring any iCloud, Dropbox, etc... settings for your apps and if it starts crashing again, then maybe you can figure out what app caused it to start misbehaving again.\n", "Q: How to view all Software Update history, including ones when not signed in with Apple ID In OS X 10.8, for system updates that were installed without being signed into an Apple ID, how can I view the update history?\nI looked in Library/Logs for an update log, and also in the Software Update for an Installed Software pane, but I don't have either.\nWhere can I see the updates?\n\nA: It can be found in an easy to read format using the system information app:\nSystem Information.app > Software > Installations\nSystem information can be found in /Applications/Utilities/System Information.app or via Spotlight.\n\nA: Try:\n/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPInstallHistoryDataType\n\nAlso, try refining search terms using extended-grep's (grep -E) fuzzy-like search with the or/any operator.:\nsystem_profiler SPInstallHistoryDataType | egrep -A 5 \"(macOS|ConfigData|Configuration Data|Device|Xcode|XProtect|XQuartz|BootCamp|Core Services|Technology Preview)\"\n\nAnd see other SP datatypes, such as SPFrameworks.

We have a workstation that gets used sporadically, and I'm trying to setup a script that backs it up during shutdown.\nI created a LogoutHook in com.apple.loginwindow to a 1-line bash script, that triggers an Applescript that compares my own log entries to determine if the backup should run. If so, it calls the main Applescript which triggers a  Chronosync backup job.\nIt all works... except that I barely get the backup job started before the Mac terminates it and shuts down. I suppose SIGTERMs and SIGKILLs are being issued and all processes quickly comply.\nI also looked into the \"proper\" way of doing it with launchd (since LogoutHooks are deprecated). Launchd doesn't really support scheduling jobs upon shutdown: it requires starting the script at login, sleeping/waiting to trap a SIGTERM. Again, this poses the problem that the entire system is shutting down within seconds, from the network stack to the Chronosync daemon.\nThe man page for the shutdown command also states:\n\nUpon shutdown, all running processes are sent a SIGTERM followed by a SIGKILL.  The SIGKILL will follow the SIGTERM by an intentionally indeterminate period of time.  Programs are expected to take only enough time to flush all dirty data and exit.\n\n\nIs there a way to delay shutdown until my scripts are all done? Ideally I want the same behavior as Apple's Software Updater, which takes as long as it wants to install updates upon logout, before allowing the machine to shut down.\n\nA: Why not just change your users' behavior on the shutdown process to make this a lot simpler (with minimal effort on scripting/programming the shutdown hook)?\n\n\n*\n\n*Tell the users not to use the standard shutdown process (from the menu or through the keyboard shortcut) and instead use your backup AppleScript that's transformed into an app called something like SafeShutdown.app\n\n*Within the SafeShutdown app script, do the backup and then end it with a  \ntell application \"Finder\"\n    shut down\nend tell\n\nor with this (will prompt for password)  \ndo shell script \"sudo shutdown -h now\" with administrator privileges\n\nor with a\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    shut down\nend tell\n\n\nA: Does the script exit after it triggers the Chronosync backup? If it does, try blocking the script until the backup finishes.\nI just tried logging out after running these commands:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook ~/.logouthook\necho $'#!/bin/bash\\nwhile sleep 1; do say a; done' > ~/.logouthook\nchmod +x ~/.logouthook\n\nThe logout hook script was still running after about an hour, so there doesn't seem to be any time limit after which logout hooks are forced to terminate.\n", "Q: How do I copy files from Mac on Windows Partition to Mac Partition?

I upgraded my iPhone to iOS 7. Previously, when I clicked on a link from an e-mail telling me about a group discussion in LinkedIn, it opened LinkedIn in  Safari and took me right there. Now, Safari launches, but then as it processes, it then launches the LinkedIn app. The problem is, most times the discussion in LinkedIn is really just a link to a webpage. I'd rather just stay in Safari, especially since the LinkedIn app takes forever to load. I'm sure Safari does this with other apps, however, the circumstances haven't come up yet for me. I can't find it in the Safari settings or LinkedIn settings to stop this.\nUpdated to add:  I have found that if I go back to Safari after it tries launching LinkedIn and force a page refresh, Safari will load the mobile (rather than app) version of LinkedIn as desired.\n\nA: I would uninstall the LinkedIn app. That would solve the issue - however you may not want to do that.  LinkedIn data mines your phone, contacts and emails, I use linkedIn but do not trust the company.\n\nA: I found this post helpful, which is simple and easy to do:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to settings.\n  \n*Search \"guided access\" (or go to General > Accessibilty > Guided Access)\n  \n*Click on Guided Access\n  \n*Turn on Guided Access\n  \n  \n  Then just go to Safari and triple click home button to enable Guided\n  Access and surf any website without letting Safari to launch apps.\n\n\nA: Just use the workaround you found - going back to Safari after it tries launching LinkedIn and force a page refresh so that it loads the mobile (rather than app) version of LinkedIn.\nAlso contact LinkedIn about the slowness you see in the app.\nBut if you want the choice of not uninstalling the app and trying other solutions, then there is at least one very tedious (really, really tedious) way to deal with it. I'm listing these here more as an exercise in imagination (and humor) than as practical solutions.\n\n\n*\n\n*One tedious way is to tap on the link, and the moment you're in Safari hit the stop (x), modify the initial part to m.linkedin.com/ to go to the mobile site. I'm not sure if this works well all the time. You can also do this by copying the link, pasting it in Safari and modifying it.\n\n*Another tedious way is to follow this routine every time you open your mail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Restrictions from Settings > General > Restrictions and set a passcode.\n\n*Scroll down, go to Apps and tap Don't Allow Apps. This will hide all apps you've installed, including LinkedIn.\n\n*Switch to or open Mobile Safari, use the links and stay within Mobile Safari.\n\n*When done, exit Safari.\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Restrictions and turn it off using the passcode you set earlier.\n\n*Continue using other apps.\n\n\n\nA: Settings > general > handoff & suggested apps > turn off suggested apps\nWorked for me\n\nA: The easiest way to stop this automatic app launching in the browser is to hold down link until the action window pops up and then press \"Open in New Tab\" \n\nA: In iOS 9, I've had success doing a long tap on the link and selecting \"Open\" from the pop-up menu. That opens a link and keeps it in Safari rather than jumping into an app (recently tested with an IMDB link from Google search results).\n\nA: This also irritates me on iOS 9 which more aggressively tries to 'convert' urls to apps. Which is especially annoying on the iPad pro as the YouTube app cannot run partial screen at all, whereas a YouTube tab in Safari can. So the app is a worse experience.\nThe workaround of tapping cancel to the 'open this in the YouTube app' prompt then refreshing the tab does work for me, though.\nIf there is a better way to handle this in iOS 9 or later leave a comment and I can edit this answer to improve it -- or suggest an edit.\n\nA: Their are two ways to do it on the article your reading 1. Push the link to share and it links to safari. 2. At the bottom on the page on the iPhone there’s a square box with an up arrow, that loads the app. \n", "Q: Space Occupied By Other Files And Folders On Hard Drive I have been using VirtualBox to create a virtual machine to run Windows 8 on and after deleting the virtual drives and virtualbox due to having issues with Windows 8, I am missing a lot of memory from my hard drive.

I am looking for an editor that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free and easy to get started with\n\n*Support at least for Python syntax highlighting\n\n\nWhat are her options? Anything available in the App Store?\n\nA: My favorite editor for writing any scripting language, not just Python but Ruby, perl, etc… is Textmate. Since I do this for a living I am still using TextMate version 1 that I paid for ages ago.  Textmate version 2 is now open source software and as such is free to download and even change. Both versions can be downloaded from the Macromates Download page.\nI prefer Textmate to BBEdit for writing in scripting languages because BBEdit doesn't allow editing while it is running a script. For all of my other text editing needs I prefer BBEdit and it is set as my system default for most types of text files. Every Mac I have owned has had a copy of BBEdit, since about 1989.\nIf you want to get a taste of what BBEdit is like, your friend can try BBEdit's little brother, TextWrangler. This works the same way, and for scripting languages, has the same shortcomings as BBEdit. TextWrangler is available on the Mac App Store for free.\n\nA: I started web development using Aptana Studio. It is a great IDE, and is free. It's also nice that it has a white-on-black theme. They do well at releasing new versions with improvements. You can read more and download it at their website.\n\nA: MacVim is excellent and free! It has all the power of vim that is already installed and available via the command line on osx 10.8.5 if you don't want to install anything new, but the linked program has the niceties of Apple edit commands on top of the power of vi(m).\n\nA: For a free start, try:\nSublime Text - it's free to try for as long as she wishes, but requires a paid license for extended use. It is also something the user can grow with.\nKomodo Edit from ActiveState - this is limited in features compared to the commercial Komodo IDE, but it should do for someone starting to learn programming.  \n\nA: Emacs is free and includes python mode that does python syntax highlighting and also allows you to edit in emacs and interact with the python interpreter and allows use of the python debugger.\nThe version that comes with OSX and runs in the terminal does this. However for a GUI version that performs like a normal OSX app I would use Aquamacs which also has what I think is the better python mode\nYou can also get a fuller python development environment using suggestions from here. This includes fuller code completion, interfacing with ipython, use of virtualenv.\n\nA: PyCharm is an IDE for python. The free version (which I think is very recent) will work for many python projects it includes syntax highlighting, debugger and integration with version control.\nThe paid for version deals with web frameworks and databases.\n", "Q: \"open -t\" vs. \"open -ef\" the Command:\nsyslog | tail | open -ef\n\nworks perfectly on my osx 10.8.5 and opens the required lines from syslog in textEdit, however when I run\nsyslog | tail | open -t\n\nwhich should open the same lines in my default text editing program I get nothing and just the lines --No lines in buffer--\nI am using MacVim as my default text editor.\n\nA: The pipe (|) connect the standard output of a program to the standard input of another program. open does not read from stdinby default but from a file given as argument.

I have a MacBook Pro 13\", Mid-2009 and it came with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. As I understand it, that means I would have to use the DVDs provided by Apple\nto boot into Apple Hardware Test. The problem is I don't have my optical drive anymore since I swapped it out for an extra HDD. How can I run the Apple Hardware Test?\n\nA: This answer Diagnosis or Hardware Test on a mid 2009 Macbook Pro with MacOS 10.9.2 discusses a GitHub page https://github.com/upekkha/AppleHardwareTest which has assembled various versions of the AppleHardwareTest which you can download and install in a specific place on your harddisk.

The Air uses a portable home directory kept on the Mini.\nOver time, the two home directories have drifted, to the point where the home directories don't even get close to fully syncing overnight (through a gigabit switch and Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter). Even worse, when the sync daemon triggers it tends to resurrect old files which have been deleted or renamed. Basically, at this point the whole thing is just irrevocably broken.\nI think I'd like to just cut the connection between the two directories and move forward with separate home directories on the two machines. How can I get my Air to abandon the idea of syncing its home directory with my server?\nAlternatively, is there anything I can do that might fix my home directory syncing? I currently can't upgrade the server from Snow Leopard, but that's likely to change soon.\n\nA: A high level approach to make the network account on the server as a local account on the MacBook Air would be to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unbind the MacBook Air from the directory and delete this user from it.\n\n*Copy over the user's home folder from the server into /Users/ on the MacBook Air.\n\n*Create a new user with the same shortname as on the server.\n\n*Choose OK when OS X prompts you asking if you'd like to use the already existing home directory for this user.

If I don't use my MacBook on a battery, does it mean that it will last longer?\nI heard that when you have normal notebook from HP, Asus, Dell, Acer.... no matter if you use the notebook on battery or not... after 2 or 3 years it will be dead... lasting only like 30 minutes or maybe only 5 minutes... \nIs it the same with MacBook?\nI have a MacBook which is 6 years old and it still lasts 4-5 hours.... The Macbook has not been used on battery in those 6 years. ;o) \n\nA: Apple says that:\n\nRechargeable batteries have a limited number of charge cycles and may\n  eventually need to be replaced and disposed of.\n\nNaturally, if the battery has not been connected, no charge cycles have passed.\n\nA: The best way to use your MacBook Pro batteries is to have it plugged in most of the time, and use it unplugged regularly (or daily) to bring from 100% charge to 80% or so. If you don't use it for months, charge it till 50% and store it.\nHowever I strongly advise against Not using your macbook for weeks or months as you will lose some battery capacity. (Charge it and ask a friend to turn it on occasionally.)\nThe battery is like a thing that needs exercise.  Not using it is worse than using it.  If you use it daily (like I do) the battery remains excellent. If for three years you use it only occasionally the battery is going to be weaker than if you use it regularly.\nI had Sonys and Toshibas and the batteries were weak on those machines (1.5hrs). I had to buy a spare for the Sony (great machine otherwise), but of course, that Toshiba was less costly than a MBP. The newer Apple MacBook Pro batteries are very good. They are rated to retain 80% of the power after 1000 charge/discharge cycles.\nEven my previous White MacBook had excellent battery life when I sold it after using it for 3 years. 8 hours if just reading documents, 4.5 hrs Wi-Fi surfing, and I used that thing daily.\nMy 15.4″ MBP's battery is non removable, and I like it! The newer technology helps retain battery life. I use it daily and the battery life is excellent(mAh reading close to new).  The latest OS X (Mavericks) helps save battery usage time. It's a free upgrade and a must. In addition to lasting longer per charge, my MBP also runs cooler!   \n\nA: The short answer to your question is that all batteries will lose capacity with time, regardless of whether the batteries are regularly used/charged or not, and there are some potential dangers in leaving these batteries unused for long.\n\nYou can check the state of your unused battery with a free application like coconutBattery:\n\nWith coconutBattery you're always aware of your current battery health. It shows you live information about your battery such as how often it was charged and how is the current maximum capacity in relation to the original capacity your battery had when it left the factory.\nYou are also able to save the current maximum capacity of your battery. So you can see the changes of your battery health over time.\nAnd with the new online service \"coconutBattery Online\" you can now compare your battery capacity with others.\n\n\nThe statement about the loss of capacity over time applies equally to the Lithium based batteries that are used in MacBooks, other brand laptops, tablets and smartphones. See How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries.\nFrom Battery University - Is Lithium-ion the Ideal Battery? (emphasis mine):\n\nAging is a concern with most lithium-ion batteries and many manufacturers remain silent about this issue. Some capacity deterioration is noticeable after one year, whether the battery is in use or not. The battery frequently fails after two or three years. It should be noted that other chemistries also have age-related degenerative effects. This is especially true for nickel-metal-hydride if exposed to high ambient temperatures. At the same time, lithium-ion packs are known to have served for five years in some applications.\nManufacturers are constantly improving lithium-ion. New and enhanced chemical combinations are introduced every six months or so. With such rapid progress, it is difficult to assess how well the revised battery will age.\n\n\nIn the case of MacBook models, Apple recommends storing the batteries at 50% charge if you do not plan to use it for more than six months. Lithium batteries can also go to \"sleep\" if discharged beyond a set level and/or left unused for a long period of time. In certain cases, it may be dangerous to use such batteries.\nFor normal usage, Apple recommends that you run the laptop on battery once in a while and also do a full discharge and recharge to calibrate the battery (full discharge/recharge means running it down till the computer automatically goes to sleep or shuts down due to low battery and then recharging it completely to 100% in one go).\nApple laptop batteries - Standard Maintenance\n\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time. An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing. If on the other hand, you use a desktop computer at work, and save a notebook for infrequent travel, Apple recommends charging and discharging its battery at least once per month.\n\nSee Apple's guide on Notebook batteries for detailed information.\nReferences:\nApple - Lithium-ion Batteries\nBattery University\nMy answer to \"Keeping MacBook Air battery charged at certain level\"\nMy answer to \"Unsold iPhones & Battery Life\"\n\nA: The battery wears the least when it is kept at around 40% charge. Unfortunately, for most laptops there is no way to do this, the OS simply doesn't give you that option.\nKeeping it plugged in will certainly put wear on the battery, though it is not clear if that will wear it faster than always cycling, charging/discharging.\n", "Q: iTunes refuses to authorise with my UK iTunes account now that I'm in Ireland While I was in the UK on holiday I purchased a TV show from the iTunes UK site and got this on my iPod. It plays fine on the iPod. I would like to play these on my computer now I am back home in Ireland.\nI have managed to get the files on to my PC's hard drive but when I go to play them, iTunes launches and says \"this computer is not authorised to play this file\". Even when I use my UK iTunes account to authorise it keeps saying \"iTunes is unavailable at this time please try later\" over and over again. Is it because I have an Engligh and Irish iTunes account?\n\nA: You can have multiple iTunes Store Accounts across different countries or regions. That's not causing the issue for you.\nIn iTunes, go to the \"Store > Authorize This Computer...\" menu option and sign in with the UK account to authorize the computer to play content from that store.\nIf it still does not work (or you have already authorized the computer), then it's likely a temporary error with connecting to the Apple iTunes server.\nFor more information, see:\niTunes 11 for Windows: Authorize a computer to play iTunes Store purchases\n", "Q: How to read old Apple ][ 5.25\" floppy disks It's like Apple is a different company than it was when it produced the computer I'm talking about, so I'm not sure this is the intended topic of discussion here, but this is a question about Apple hardware, so here I go.\nI have an old Franklin Ace 2100 Apple-compatible computer that I'm about to send off to a museum, but I also have a bunch of homemade software that they're not interested in and can't help me recover. Before I send this off I'd like to know that someday I might be able to get at that software again myself. I thought I once saw 5.25\" USB floppy drives on Thinkgeek that might have been useful in such a data recovery process, but I can't find them any more. And even if I did, I know Apple 5.25\" drives are incompatible with IBM/PC drives possibly at a hardware level, so I don't know if it would have been useful.\nCan anyone help me figure out if there's a cost effective device for extracting the data from these old Apple ][ disks from the 1980s (they're almost all still functional - I just tried them yesterday again!)? I could elect to rely on a data recovery service, but then I would have to hold on to my system long enough to sort out what disks I want to recover data from before I send it away, so ideally, I'd like to be able to perform this recovery myself. My current system, BTW, is not from Apple (it's a \"PC\", and not an Apple-based one -- the term \"PC\" has always bothered me -- Apples were personal computers too).\n\nA: I've never done this myself, but I did a little searching to see what might solve your problem.  Stumbled across this:\nhttp://adtpro.sourceforge.net/\nIf you can connect to your modern computer using a serial cable (though even that's troublesome in this day and age…) this just might be your ticket.\n\nA: I'm looking into the hardware (floppy controller) available from deviceside.com at http://shop.deviceside.com/prod/FC5025\nAccording to the details at http://www.deviceside.com/fc5025.html it appears to allow Windows 7 systems to read Apple DOS disks (among many others) via USB port. Unfortunately, they don't seem to sell the 5.25\" drives that work with this controller.\n\nA: I'm considering resorting to some optical data transfer. I don't think I have the time, motivation or expertise to transfer all the software this way (I'd have to be able to read disks at a binary level and format up something like QR codes for the transfer) but I thought maybe I could do program listings on files that are pure BASIC code. Here's a sample:\n\nUnfortunately I have not found an OCR program that will do a good job transforming this back to text. Any thoughts on simple adjustments I could employ or specific OCR software to use to make this work better?\n\nA: Lots of work has been done in the retrocomputing community to allow transfer of 5 1/4\" floppies in all the major 8-bit formats to virtual disk images that can be used on a modern computer via emulation software.  For example, KryoFlux is a hardware interface that uses generic (cheap) PC-style floppy drives to read any disk format, including Apple II.  This is kind of overkill for doing what you want, but how valuable are your old BASIC programs to you?  Memories are priceless...\n", "Q: How to resize a photo in TextEdit? When I add photos to TextEdit, they sometimes  appear too big, and I want to make them smaller.\nHow can I resize or modify photos in TextEdit?\n\nA: TextEdit has no direct image editing options.\nYou can, though, once you've added an image into the document, double click it to open it with Preview. \nThrough Preview you'll be able to perform some basic image editing such as size adjustment (Tools / Adjust Size) or adding figures or text (View / Show Edit Toolbar).\n\nA: Like Thecafremo already said:\nYou can, once you've added an image into the document, double click it to open it with Preview.\nThrough Preview you'll be able to perform some basic image editing such as size adjustment (Tools / Adjust Size).\nMy addition:\nAdjust \"Resolution\" to something larger, i.e. 300 dpi and make sure you uncheck \"resample image\".\nNow save it (or quit preview: the image will be saved automatically) and the size will be adjusted right away in Text Edit!\n", "Q: Xserve CPU Status LED's under Mountain Lion I have a dual Xeon Xserve, and a nagging issue.  The Xserves have 2 small 8 LED arrays on the front, which show real-time cpu utilization (one array per CPU).  Under Lion, these LED's would not become active until after you installed the Server.app.  Currently under Mountain Lion, these LED's do not work at all, regardless if the Server.app is installed or not.\nI figure that there has to be a way to see, or find out what in the Lion Server app is enabling these (a kext or something perhaps?), but I cannot figure it out.  I tried comparing the system installed Kexts (/System/Library/Extension) before and after the server.app install, but did not find any new kexts.\nDoes anyone happen to know, or can provide any assistance in a way to dig down deeper on this?  I know its not a show stopper, but its one of those things thats bugging me and I cant stop thinking about it.\n\nA: It is possible to re-enable the front-panel LED array on the Xserve when running 10.8. It appears that the process responsible for displaying/updating the readout on the front panel is the hwmond process. Unfortunately, hwmond is not included with OS X v.10.8. However, it is possible to use the hwmond executable from a 10.7.5 system.\nThe hardware that I tested with was an Early 2009 Xserve. After copying hwmond from the 10.7.5 system into /usr/sbin, I copied the com.apple.hwmond.plist launchd configuration file from /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.hwmond.plist, and installed into /System/Library/LaunchDaemons on the 10.8.5 system. After a reboot (or a launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.hwmond.plist), the system identifiers are working normally.\n", "Q: TextMate recover after kernel panic I was working on an unsaved file when the kernel suddenly got a panic attack.

I have entered my password for joining the network, but cannot find the enter key. How does one access the enter key on the iPad keyboard?\n\nA: You probably have a Join key on the right of the keyboard. That's the enter key for joining the network.\nOn touch keyboards, it's possible to re-label the keys in order to match better the behavior of the key to the specific application or context. When hitting enter in the WiFi connection panel it's synonymous to trying to join the WiFi network. \n", "Q: no key repeat in Xquartz (x11) I don't think I've used x11 since switching to Mountain Lion (and thus Xquartz).  I recently tried to use it and my key repeat isn't working.

The OTA(over the air bit is important too since I am looking to implement it that way).\n\nA: If all you care about is enrollment - you should be fine. OTA supervision isn't yet being provided according to all the information I've seen as of late October 2013.\nThere is great confusion out there as Apple did promote the idea that OTA Supervision was coming with iOS 7. That feature was dropped from the public list of features about a week before release and there is no official word if or when it may come back.\nThere is a difference between iOS supervision and iOS MDM enrollment. The latter item is easy - most all MDM can enroll devices over the air on iOS 6 and that ability continues on iOS 7.\nOver the air supervision is not possible on iOS 6 and requires Apple Configurator to supervise devices before you choose to enroll them into MDM.\nOver the air supervision is not possible on iOS 7.0.2 and even the \n\"streamlined MDM enrollment\" that is still listed is either not working or waiting on the MDM providers to update their software to take advantage of those new settings.\nI would expect by late November, there would be good indications that we will or will not get OTA Supervision with iOS 7 this fall as well as which MDM providers (if any) work with the \"streamlined\" enrollment methods.\n\nAnd a footnote, there are several reports that a bug in iOS 7 upgrade has caused a portion (but even a portion of 7,000 iPads could run into a hundred devices) where supervised iOS 6 devices were removed from supervision as part of the upgrade process to iOS 7. Anyone affected should contact AppleCare for assistance if you don't want to simple re-supervise the devices.\n\nA: Using Profile Manager MDM (built into OS X Server), you can allow users to enroll devices OTA after deployment (but this does require some user interaction).\nThat interaction could be as easy as sending the user an enrollment profile through e-mail (or as a link to the profile hosted on an HTTP server?) Alternately, the users can visit the MDM enrollment portal (e.g., https://mdm.example.com/mydevices), and login with their domain (AD/OD?) credentials to enroll a device.\nAlthough you mentioned that you'd like to avoid the individual device management at the Apple Configurator level, that tool (Apple Configurator) can be a helpful resource to use for adding the enrollment profiles to the unmanaged devices. This would allow you to use the Profile Manager to push application and device configuration profiles OTA in the future, and just requires a one-time enrollment using Apple Configurator.\nAs far as I know, Profile Manager cannot automatically (without some administrator/user intervention) reach out and enroll any arbitrary device OTA (as this would require that the device have the enrollment/trust profile installed before allowing itself to be enrolled with an MDM solution).\n\"Streamlined MDM Enrollment\" is a service that may have been mentioned in WWDC 2013 seminar videos (based on cached versions of a particular session transcript). This service is purportedly available for Apple Education customers based on the release notes for iOS 7. Apparently Apple will configure newer iOS 7 devices for \"out of the box\" use in Education environments. Personally, I have no direct experience with this service - feedback from those who do would be informational. I assume that Apple is is simply pre-installing trust/enrollment profiles for the MDM solution that will be used. If you are in charge of unboxing your own iOS devices, you should have the same ability.\n\nA: Streamlined enrollment and OTA Supervision are still MIA, even for EDU institutions.  Last I heard from someone with Apple is un officially they are trying for sometime January to March 2014 and it's due to the major bugs they ran in to with supervision being lost for iPads upgraded to iOS 7 which originally used a backup to restore devices in configurator.  This is the fix that was in 7.03.  Personally, I'm not holding my breath which is too bad.\nVPP tokens just launched a few weeks ago without documentation for MDM's to enable it so as of mid-December only one besides Apple's has.\n\nA: OTA Supervision is supported starting with 7.0.3 by using an Apple-signed OTA supervision profile. The feature was added to 7.0.3 to fix a bug in iOS 7 that caused iOS 6 supervised devices to lose their supervision when upgraded to iOS 7. The profile can only be provided by your Apple representative and is hardcoded with the identifiers for your devices. I know for a fact that AirWatch (an MDM provider) supports this profile, but other MDM providers may support it as well. \n", "Q: How to swap command and option modifier keys with a script in OS X Lion I use a PC usb keyboard with my macbook. So, I've gone into System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys... and swapped command and option for the usb keyboard. This puts those keys in the \"correct\" position for a mac.\nBut, for part of the day, I remote desktop to a windows machine. So now, I need to swap the keys back, so the remote desktop client isn't confused.\nIt's easy enough to do this through the Preferences UI, but its cumbersome.\nI'd like to use a script of some kind (maybe applescript), so I could  quickly swap back and forth.\nI've found several scripts online, but none of them are for Lion.\n\nA: I was able to modify some of the scripts already out there, and get them to work in Lion.

Earlier today, I saw the icon still there, with a question mark on top of it, and I could not open the app. Now, there is just a question mark. How do I get the Notes App back on my Macbook Air?\n\nA: The easiest thing to do might be to check in Lauchpad (the silver rocket in the dock or in /Applications ) to search for notes.\nIf it's still there, it just got moved, so you can search in Spotlight to find it.\nIf it's really gone, you can restore it using Time Machine or another backup. Worst case, you would have to re-install the OS but that might need some details about how you purchased Mountain Lion (whether it was an upgrade or came with the Mac for instance).\n\nA: The question mark on the app means that the app cannot be found.

Since I have to plug in my external keyboard any way, why could I not buy a German external keyboard to plug in when I have a lot of German stuff to type? Where could I buy such a keyboard? \n\nA: You don't need a German keyboard to use the German keyboard layout. You can enable the German keyboard layout from System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources, and you can use the virtual keyboard viewer to look up the positions of characters.\n\nEven if you buy a keyboard with a German keyboard layout, the input source won't change automatically when you connect the keyboard or press some keys on it.\nYou can buy keyboards for different keyboard layouts from store.apple.com.\nNote that there are some differences between the Apple and standard PC versions of the German keyboard layout.

You can download a keylayout file for the PC version from http://www.nullpointer.de/stuff/keylayout/.\nISO (European) keyboards have one more key than ANSI (U.S.) keyboards. The extra key is a dead key for ^ in both the Apple and standard PC variants of the German keyboard layout. In the version of the German keyboard layout that is included in OS X, option-shift-6 enters the same dead key state as the extra key.\n", "Q: Phone app uses a single contact's image for all calls Since I've updated to iOS 7, there's something that has driven me nearly insane every time I make a phone call. Every time I receive or place a call, the background image for the call (which is supposed to be the contact's image) consistently shows up the same for all calls. This would be fine if it were my wallpaper, but it's actually a picture of someone that I used for their contact photo. I've since deleted the photo from my phone and from the contact, but it still shows up for every phone call I receive.\nAs you can expect, this is extremely bothering. Is there any way to clear the cache that is used for contact photos on phone calls?\n\nA: Try a reset all settings it worked fine for me.\nSettings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings.\nThe phone will reboot and the problem will be fixed but the custom settings like wallpaper and lock screen wallpaper will be reset to iOS 7 default.\n", "Q: How can I restore Spotlight to menu bar? I removed the Spotlight icon from the menu bar. I would like to restore it.\nI tried the recommended method: \nsudo mdutil -a -i on\nsudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search\nsudo killall SystemUIServer\n\n…which did not help. The command keys still work, but I would like to see the icon. I read the suggestion to reinstall the system and would prefer not to do that. \nDoes anyone have a different suggestion?\nProblem solved: The article from OSXDaily worked perfectly. Thanks to all who responded. \n\nA: Just to make an official answer.\nUser M K referenced an article in osXDaily that explains how to both hide and un-hide the Spotlight icon.\n\nShow the Spotlight Menu Again\nGetting the Spotlight icon back is a matter of bringing the permissions back to their default setting in OS\n  X. Go back to the Terminal app by relaunching it from\n  /Applications/Utilities/, and then enter the exact command syntax\n  below: sudo chmod 755\n  /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search\nHit the return key, then follow this up with killing the\n  SystemUIServer process again: killall SystemUIServer The system menu\n  bar will refresh, and the Spotlight menu will be visible again.\n\nI just tested this on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 with success.\n", "Q: Assign and recall windows with keyboard shortcuts I would like to be able to assign numbers to windows with a keyboard shortcut like:\nCmd+1 (different numbers for different windows or desktops)\nand then recall them with a keyboard like: \n⌘+1 \nThe specific modifier does not matter much. I used to do this with AutoHotkey in Windows. Can I do this in Mac OS X?\n\nA: You'll need a Mac-based macro program such as Keyboard Maestro by Stairways Software. Although its interface is very different, it's similarly powerful, if not more powerful than AutoHotkey. The program includes a tutorial and comprehensive documentation.\n", "Q: Why does Steam start when I login in 10.8? \"Open at login\" in the Dock is disabled, \"Run Steam when my computer starts\" in Steam options is disabled, and it isn't there in the User \"Login Items\" tab of the System Preferences.\nHowever it starts at login anyway.\nWhy does it so, and how do I stop it?\n\nA: When I logout \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" (a new feature that wasn't there in 10.6) was ticked.\n", "Q: Can you set a specific WiFi channel with an iOS/iPhone personal hotspot? Anytime when I using my iPhone as personal WiFi HotSpot (sharing 3G internet via WiFi) the iPhone selects channel #1 for this.\nIs possible to use another channel number because the channel 1 is already used by another cable modem / WiFi router and turning on (and using) the hotspot on the iPhone causes noticeable degradation of the speed on the cable-WiFi router.\nSo the question: Is possible somewhat enforce another WiFi channel number for the hotspot on the iPhone? (e.g. 11 or soo)\n\nA: No - the OS picks channels algorithmically so you get what iOS chooses each time you enable personal hot spot.  I've seen personal hotspot pick channels 1, 6 and 11 on iOS 7 when in moderately busy wireless environments like this one with 26 advertising base stations (and a few hidden ones as well).\n\n\nA: Whilst you can't enforce a specific channel on iOS, it does attempt to select the best channel for the situation. I have found that a combination of standing directly next to the router and enabling/disabling Personal Hotspot until you get a channel you want seems to work well enough.\nAlternatively, if you have control of the router, you could simply change the channel of the router to be 'out of the way'.\nAs well as this, if you have dynamic channel switching enabled on the router, turning on Personal Hotspot then standing next to the router for a bit should make the router change channel for you.\n\nA: Hmmm,\nYes  i have that channel problem too.  i reserched and found that inssider program.\nServing to find out which channel your phone using or other wifi spots. Bad news is u cant edit phones hotspot channel unless its  jailbroken.(i didnt try that)\nUsing my phone with stock OS.

What now?\n\n\nA: Try starting up from the recovery partition (by holding command-R), in single user mode (by holding command-S), in safe mode (by holding shift), or in Internet recovery mode (by holding option-command-R).\nIf you already have backups and you can start up from the recovery partition or in Internet recovery mode, try choosing the Reinstall OS X option. It downloads an OS X installer and installs it over the current installation, keeping user files and settings in place.\nIf you can start up from the recovery partition but reinstalling OS X does not work, try to erase and reinstall OS X.\nIf you don't have backups but you can start up from the recovery partition, you can save a disk image to an external drive with Disk Utility.\n\nA: This happened to me today too, on a Mac Mini Late 2013.\nI have many partitions on the only internal hard drive, with a multiboot configuration with macOS 10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13.\nI suspect this problem has been caused by the update of macOS 10.13.4 to 10.13.6\nHowever, this is how I fixed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the Mac, and as soon as you hear the boot sound, press and hold pressed Option, until you see the boot menu appearing\n\n*Select the disk named Recovery-10.9.5 (or whatever macOS version you have)\n\n\n*Update the Kernel Extension cache:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the Terminal (you can find it in the Utilities menu)\n\n*Identify the correct volume by typing\n\nmount\n\non the command-line\n\n*Find the right volume in the list, for me it was:\n\n/dev/disk0s2 on /Volumes/Mavericks (hfs, local, journaled)\n\n*Change directory to the volume root by typing\n\ncd /Volumes/Mavericks\n\n*Rebuild the kext cache by typing\n\ntouch System/Library/Extensions\nkextcache -f -update-volume ./\n\n\n*Reboot your Mac and voilà!

My daughter has about 20 gig of movies and photos from her iPad which I backup to an external drive via Windows. I don't want all this content uploading to iCloud and syncing to my other devices, but I would like apps to do that. Is there a way to make this distinction with iCloud? Can iTunes do it?\n\nA: In iCloud settings, you can select exactly what you would like to have in your iCloud Backup. Go to Settings → iCloud → Storage & Backup → Manage Storage → This iPad. There you can enable/disable various data sources that are able to be backed up by iCloud Backup.\nFor example, you can leave all the apps selected and simply disable the Camera Roll backup. Attempting to disable the Camera Roll backups after completing at least one backup will prompt you before deleting the existing Camera Roll backup:\n\n\nFor more granular control of exactly what is synchronised to iCloud other than app and device data, you can view and modify iCloud services sync settings by going to Settings → iCloud.\nAt the time of writing, there are 8 iCloud services that synchronise data: Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Safari, Notes, Photos, and Documents & Data. Each one of these services can be enabled/disabled independently. Tapping Documents & Data gives you granular control over exactly which apps can sync data through iCloud.\n\nYou can view exactly how much content is on your device by going to Settings → General → Usage. There, it details the cumulative space required by a certain app or service. Tapping on an app/service shows a breakdown of that space requirement. For example, tapping iBooks shows that the app is just under 60 MB, with the Documents & Data being almost 1.5 GB. If you selected to backup this app under iCloud Storage & Backup settings, then only the Documents & Data would be backed up - the app itself is not backed up by iCloud Backup. The second example shows an app where this is more useful: Real Racing 3. The app itself is almost 1.5 GB, however the data is 1.5 MB. During an iCloud Backup, only the 1.5 MB of app data is backed up. Since the app resides on the App Store, it is unnecessary for this to be backed up; during an iCloud Backup restore, the app is re-downloaded from the App Store.\n\niTunes shows you a brief breakdown of the content of your device as well. Connecting your device to iTunes (either by USB or iTunes Wi-Fi Sync) and going to the Summary tab shows you a graphical summary of the types of data, however (unfortunately) it does not give much detail about exactly what is in each category like the iOS Usage page does.\n\nYou mention that you don't want this content to sync to other devices - iCloud Backup will not restore data to other devices unless you specifically request it to. However, Photo Stream will upload your camera roll to iCloud and sync it to other devices. You can disable Photo Stream in Settings → iCloud → Photos → My Photo Stream.\n\n", "Q: What are the default special folder names for IMAP accounts in Mail.app (like Drafts, Junk, Sent)? I'm setting up my own email server. Clients will connect to this server using IMAP.\nNowadays it's possible to map the correct 'special' folders on the server to the local client (like Drafts, Junk, and Sent). However, because the majority of the devices connecting to my server will use Mail.app (or Mail on iOS), it'd be nice if the default folder names on the server correspond to the names Mail.app uses (so I don't have to remap the folders on all devices).\nTherefore, my question is: what are the special folders names Mail.app uses by default?\n\nA: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defines that in a proper RFC, the RFC 6154. There you will find a list of special use mailbox denominations:\n   \\All\n      This mailbox presents all messages in the user's message store.\n      Implementations MAY omit some messages, such as, perhaps, those\n      in \\Trash and \\Junk.  When this special use is supported, it is\n      almost certain to represent a virtual mailbox.\n\n   \\Archive\n        This mailbox is used to archive messages.  The meaning of an\n        \"archival\" mailbox is server-dependent; typically, it will be\n        used to get messages out of the inbox, or otherwise keep them\n        out of the user's way, while still making them accessible.\n\n   \\Drafts\n        This mailbox is used to hold draft messages -- typically,\n        messages that are being composed but have not yet been sent.  In\n        some server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox,\n        containing messages from other mailboxes that are marked with\n        the \"\\Draft\" message flag.  Alternatively, this might just be\n        advice that a client put drafts here.\n\n   \\Flagged\n        This mailbox presents all messages marked in some way as\n        \"important\".  When this special use is supported, it is likely\n        to represent a virtual mailbox collecting messages (from other\n        mailboxes) that are marked with the \"\\Flagged\" message flag.\n\n   \\Junk\n        This mailbox is where messages deemed to be junk mail are held.\n        Some server implementations might put messages here\n        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice to a\n        client-side spam filter.\n\n   \\Sent\n        This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that have been\n        sent.  Some server implementations might put messages here\n        automatically.  Alternatively, this might just be advice that a\n        client save sent messages here.\n\n   \\Trash\n        This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been deleted or\n        marked for deletion.  In some server implementations, this might\n        be a virtual mailbox, containing messages from other mailboxes\n        that are marked with the \"\\Deleted\" message flag.\n        Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client that\n        chooses not to use the IMAP \"\\Deleted\" model should use this as\n        its trash location.  In server implementations that strictly\n        expect the IMAP \"\\Deleted\" model, this special use is likely not\n        to be supported.\n\n\nA: I created an empty IMAP account and added it to Mail.app and Notes.app on my Mac running OS X Mountain Lion. After saving some messages, all default folders were created by Mail.app. Then I connected to the IMAP server using Terminal and listed all folders:\nA1 LIST \"\" \"%\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" \"Sent Messages\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" \"Junk\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" \"Archive\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" \"Deleted Messages\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" \"Notes\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" \"Drafts\"\n* LIST (\\HasNoChildren) \".\" \"INBOX\"\nA1 OK List completed.\n\nAs you can see in the raw output, the exact default folder names are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*INBOX\n\n*Drafts\n\n*Sent Messages\n\n*Junk\n\n*Deleted Messages\n\n*Archive\n\n*Notes\n\n\nAfter updating my email server to create these folder for new IMAP accounts by default, I connected a new account to my Mac. As hoped, Mail.app and Mail on iOS automatically used these special folders (I only had to enable \"Store junk messages on the server\" on Mac).\n\nFor those using Dovecot as well, this is the resulting configuration file with the default folders included (/etc/dovecot/conf.d/15-mailboxes.conf):\nnamespace inbox {\n  mailbox Drafts {\n    auto = subscribe\n    special_use = \\Drafts\n  }\n\n  mailbox \"Sent Messages\" {\n    auto = subscribe\n    special_use = \\Sent\n  }\n\n  mailbox Junk {\n    auto = subscribe\n    special_use = \\Junk\n  }\n\n  mailbox \"Deleted Messages\" {\n    auto = subscribe\n    special_use = \\Trash\n  }\n\n  mailbox Archive {\n    auto = subscribe\n    special_use = \\Archive\n  }\n\n  mailbox Notes {\n    auto = subscribe\n  }\n}\n\n", "Q: Firefox - Shortcut for activating bookmarks in Bookmarks Toolbar? Are there any keyboard shortcuts for activating bookmarks in the Bookmarks Toolbar for Firefox?\n(Similar to the +1, +2, ..., keyboard shortcuts for Safari.)\n\nA: Not built-in, but it is available through a no-restart extension called Bookmark Shortcut Keys:\n\nAccess Bookmark Toolbar items with a keyboard shortcut.\nThe default is Control+1-9. Change it in the preferences.\n\nNote that you have to organize your bookmarks toolbar with up to nine of your favorite links at the beginning of the list to use it.

But it did work with Alt+Shift+1-9.\nI didn't use the default Control+1-9 because that's mapped to switching spaces in OS X and I didn't want to re-map it.\n", "Q: How can I recover files from an iPod classic (when using as a hard disk) after reformatting? Recently, my 120 GB iPod classic was not being recognised by my MacBook and kept prompting to reformat. I have done this many times before but make it a conscious effort to back up my files before I do so. I genuinely forgot about the folder I had saved on my iPod classic (when using it as a hard disk) and went ahead to reformat it. A week later I realised I forgot to back up my files but it was too late. I want to retrieve the files really badly as they were pictures/memories!\nIs it possible to retrieve without paying for those softwares?\n\nA: If you are comfortable with the command line, try TestDisk\nIt's fairly intuitive for a command line program.\nThe basic steps are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download from above link.\n\n*Extract download.\n\n*Navigate to extracted folder in Terminal.\n\n*Run ./testdisk\n\n*Follow the onscreen instructions.\n\n\nNote: You may want to read the documentation before you do anything.

Such a function would be:\n$ function r { $@; beep; yourscript; }\n\nYour script will be automatically launched after Terminal makes a beep.\nUse the function to run those long commands like this:\n$ r longcommand\n\nYou can add the function to your .bashrc file to avoid defining it every time.\nIf you're not a fan of audible bells you can tell Terminal to flash instead:\n\n", "Q: How to see what process on iPad/iPhone is using data?

When to shutdown virtual machine? I run Windows 7 using Parallels in host operating system OSX.\nI have it configured to use 2GM ram and 2 cores on a Retina MacBook Pro with 8GB ram.\nI'm curious under what conditions I will experience a performance hit either in terms of CPU usage. Ultimately, I'm interested in whether it is best when Windows 7 in parallels is not in active use, to: \n(a) suspend Windows 7 in Parallels \n(b) shut down Windows 7 in Parallels\n(c) Quit parallels completely\nInitial observations\nUsing the activity monitor, I noticed the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*When idle the Windows 7 virtual machine prl_vm_app was using around 2GB of ram and 2 to 2.5% of CPU\n\n*When Windows 7 was suspended or turned off the process disappeared completely\n\n\nIn addition, when Parallels was running with a virtual machine runnning or not, it used around 200 MB and about 0.5% of cpu.\nSo my initial conclusion is that if you are short on ram, then suspending or shutting down the virtual OS is a good idea. There is also some small background CPU usage if you don't shut it down. \nHowever, I'm worried that I'm missing something. \nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Does running a virtual machine running in Parallels on OSX use additional CPU or other resources over and beyond the CPU usage indicated in Activity Monitor? For example does it reserve cores?\n\n*Are there any good rules of thumb about whether or when to suspend the virtual machine?\n\n\nA: Alright, let's see what we can do here!\n\n1) Suspending vs. Shutting Down in Parallels\na) How it affects the host OS\nBoth options do not affect the host operating system - in your case, OS X - from a resource usage standpoint. Rather, they only affect how the guest OS will boot next time - (i.e. waking up from sleep vs. a cold boot).\nWhen suspending, it works just like a physical Windows machine: it saves the current state of the operating system for later use. Unlike a physical machine, however, it uses no extra battery power, RAM, or CPU cycles to do so; Parallels unloads it from RAM and stores it purely on the hard disk (think of it closer to a Windows laptop \"hibernating\" than \"sleeping\").\nb) How it affects the guest OS\nOn the other hand, both of these options have a more prominent effect on the guest OS. Aside from the standard reasons one might want to shut down a computer versus letting it sleep (updates, troubleshooting, etc.), there's one other reason to shut down the virtual machine: Parallels locks down quite a few of the guest OS settings (boot order, coherence mode, shared apps, etc.) and prevents them from being changed if the virtual machine state is anything other than shut down.\nc) Which should be used?\nIn my personal experience with Parallels, I have found no issues with using sleep consistently between sessions. The only time I shut down virtual machines is if I want to change some of the Parallels settings for that particular guest OS or if I encounter an odd bug that can pop up in Windows from time to time.\n2) Resource Usage\na) RAM\nA set amount of RAM is reserved specifically for the guest OS - which you indicated to be 2GB; Parallels will not use significantly more or less.\nb) CPU\ni) Usage\nCPU, like the guest OS hard disk, is used on an \"as-needed\" basis and is accurately reported in the Activity Monitor.\nii) Reservation or parking\nParallels will not reserve (or \"park\") cores; the option you see in the guest OS options (Hardware > CPU & Memory > CPUs) merely limits the number cores that the guest OS will have access to rather than purely reserving them exclusively. This way the guest OS can extensively use these assigned cores, and if the guest OS begins to have a large work load, the host OS can use the remaining cores to continue its business without having processes choked from the guest OS.\n\nHopefully that helps you out! If you have any questions or need clarification on any of that, comment and let me know!\n", "Q: How do I type the euro value sign € on a Mac? I've tried bashing on my keyboard with the ⌥ alt/option key pressed with the ⇧ shift key pressed but I do not seem to be able to find how I can get the euro value sign.\n⇧ shift+4 gives the dollar sign: $\nWhat keystrokes do I need to use to get the euro € sign?\n\nA: Just type alt and 2...... €\njust those two keys\n[Edit] Tested with British & Irish, [both use alt/2] US, Canadian & British-PC [use alt/shift/2] The alternate in each case gives ™\nVery similar to the British/US 'pound' symbol, swapped between shift/3 or alt/3 depending on keyboard.\n\nA: The Euro Currency symbol is found at ⌥⇧2 on the US English keyboard.\nIn general, if you want to discover what symbols can be found on your keyboard when you press the modifier keys, you can use the Keyboard Viewer window.\nTo enable the Keyboard Viewer menu item\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard » Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar is checked.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Make sure System Preferences » Language & Text » Input Sources » Show Input menu in menu bar is also checked.\n\n\n\nOnce you have the keyboard viewer enabled, go to the keyboard menu in your menu bar (it will look like either a picture of a keyboard or a flag representing the keyboard layout you have selected) and chose Keyboard Viewer. A window will appear with a picture of your keyboard. If you hold down the option, shift, or option and shift keys, it will show you what the keys on your keyboard do with those modifier keys pressed.\n\n\nA: An option to use once you know how to get the € symbol is to create a text shortcut for the symbol on your Mac for faster typing. You can do this using text replacement.\nTo get started, follow these steps (also see image below for reference):\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch System Preferences and click on Keyboard (Language & Text on previous versions of OS X).\n\n*Click on the Text tab.\n\n*The Replace and With columns appear. Click on the + button at bottom-left to add a new text shortcut, which opens a text field for you to type your trigger text, for example euro.\n\n*Press ⇥ tab key or mouse over to the adjacent text field (under the With column) and enter the actual € symbol. This becomes the resulting replacement text.\n\n\nAnd you’re done. The next time you enter “euro” it will be replaced automatically with “€”.  But you can always press the Esc keyboard button (to cancel the text replacement) if you actually want to type out the word “euro”.\nThis also works for iOS devices under Settings → General → Keyboard → Shortcuts.\nPlease note that this does not work automatically in every app.  I’ve confirmed it works on iMessage, Notes, Reminders, Mail.  \nFor iWork (e.g., Pages, Keynotes, Numbers) you’ll have to add the shortcuts as they use their own text replacement functionality. For example in Pages, click on the Pages menu item, then click on Auto-Correction tab, and add any text shortcuts in the same way as above. Here you can even choose to toggle (on or off) which text shortcuts you want to be active.\n\n\nA: On the Euro symbol's own official home page, there's a table of keyboard shortcuts for many national keyboards: http://www.eurosymbol.eu/mac-keyboard Copied and amended here:\nkeyboard layout keystroke combinations\nAustrian        Option-Shift-D\nBelgian         Option-$\nBritish         Option-2\nCatalan         Option-U\nDutch           Option-2\nFinnish         Shift-4\nFrench          Option-$\nFrench (num)    Option -Shift-R\nGerman          Option-E\nItalian         Option-I\nItalian - Pro   Option-E\nPolish          Option-3\nPortuguese      Option-3\nSlovakian       Option-R\nSpanish         Option-U\nSpanish - ISO   Option-E\nSwedish         Shift-4\nSwiss French    Option-E\nSwiss German    Option-E\nU.S.            Option-Shift-2\n\n\nA: Character Viewer\nThe Character Viewer tool built into macOS offers the symbol you want, depending on what fonts you have installed. \nTo access, choose the Show Emoji & Symbols menu item in the icon menubar. May be named Character Viewer in older versions of macOS. Find the menu item next to Keyboard Viewer menu item. \nIf you do not see this menu amongst your icon menus, go to System Preferences > Keyboard. Check the Show Input menu in menu bar. \n\nOn the left, click the Currency Symbols grouping. \n\nNote the option to Add to Favorites on the right side. Convenient for frequent use.\n\nA: For Latvian keyboard layout on my mac the combination is Shift+Opt+Q.\n\nA: If you are using Polish OS X keyboard: Option ⌥ + 3\n\nA: On an American English keyboard you can type the European Currency symbol (€) with Option + Shift + 2.\nNOTE: It is also worth to note that specifically in Terminal, option 'Use Option as Meta Key' is turned on by default and this blocks this key combination. Please go to Terminal 'preferences', section 'Profiles' and under tab 'Keyboard' untick 'Use Option as Meta Key' checkbox to have it working.\n\nA: If you are using Czech Mac OSX keyboard, you will find € sign under combination of ⌥ + r.\n\nA: just and addition here if you have you option key used to swap spaces this will override the keyboard shortcuts.

Can I clone from my iMac to a brand new hard drive to be used in a macbook pro? \nBasically I upgraded my Macbook Pro 250G HDD to a TB HDD and the TB took a dive and is being replaced under warranty. However when I made the clone before it was from a Macbook pro to a Macbook pro (laptop to laptop) and since then I have gotten a 27in. iMac which used migration assistant to bring everything over through time machine.\nNow I'm trying to see if will make a difference that it's cloning a desktop HDD to a blank HDD to be used in a laptop? (ie iMac to Macbook Pro).\nI'm working with a MacBook Pro (13-inch Mid 2010), and my iMac is running Mac OS X (10.7.5) \nUPDATE It's been two years since posting this question and since then I've actually gone back and forth cloning hard drives in both directions a handful of times without issue. The only thing that matters is the OS version, which when cloned remains constant, so it poses no issue. Copying all files over would be a different story.\n\nA: I would not recommend it since this may cause issues. The installation process of OS X is specific to the underlying hardware. So if you just clone the iMac HDD and use it in a MacBook Pro, it's possible that you may encounter issues.\nIt won't hurt to try it out, so do try. But when you try it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you press Cmd+V when you hear the startup chime on the MacBook Pro and hold it until you see a Verbose Boot initiated (with many Unix related messages coming up on the text screen and scrolling up). You can read through the messages to see if any serious looking errors appear before the login window comes up.\n\n*Also note how long the startup process takes and whether it seems slower than it should be.\n\n*After you're logged in, you can also check Console.app for errors during startup.\nFor a good experience, I would instead recommend that you do a fresh install on the new HDD (with the HDD installed on the MacBook Pro) and then use Migration Assistant to copy applications and files over.\n", "Q: How Can I Set XCode to Correctly Highlight Multi-Line Strings for Shell Scripts? Quite simply I have a shell script that I'm editing in XCode, and it contains several strings which contain new-lines. Easiest way for me to do this was just to leave the string open so that it spans several lines in the file, and as far as I know this is perfectly valid for a shell script to do, or at least none of the shells I work with seem to mind it.\nHowever, XCode doesn't like it at all, and treats only the first line of the string as a string, and interprets the rest as new commands. This has no particular effect on the script, but is a huge pain as it looks messy, and causes it to try to auto-complete things that are part of the string. XCode only accepts it correctly if each line ends with an escape character, but of course that eliminates the new line so is of no use to me.\nHere's a stripped down version of one of my strings:\n#!/bin/sh\nUSAGE=\"$0 [options] source [host:]target\nArguments:\nsource\n    Path to the folder or Time Machine .backupdb to backup from.\n[host:]target\n    Path to the target to backup to, with host for remote backup via ssh.\"\n\necho \"$USAGE\"\n\nPutting this in XCode will cause only the first line of USAGE to be highlighted in red (string), while the rest are black. Is there a way to force XCode to interpret these multi-line strings, or is what I'm doing somehow wrong and I should be formatting my strings another, more compatible way?\n\nA: I don't think that there is a way to get Xcode to highlight this the way you would like, so I tried a couple of my favorite text editors.

( more details of that here)\nSomeone at work Suggested I change my DNS servers to openDNS and see if that resolves the problem.\nAs they thought it may be that the DNS server from my provider is what was slowing down the page/image loads due to the cross domain calls with its javascript.\nIt turns out that this was indeed the case.

Especially for just one site.\n\nQuestion\nIs there any way I can use my normal DNS server addresses. But have a proxy (PAC file) that redirects to an alternate DNS server when this web domain (cultofma.com) is used.\n\nA: You can specify the DNS servers that will be used for specific domains, but AFAIK this requires you to run BIND (named) on your machine. In this situation, your computer would be running a named process, and will have its configuration file setup to forward DNS requests for most queries to your ISP (i.e., the DNS servers that you were using before Google's Open DNS). This also allows you to specify domains in which you'd like the 'alternative' DNS server to be queried. Once you've got named up and running, you could then configure System Preferences to use your loopback address (127.0.0.1) for DNS lookups. The /etc/named.conf file for this configuration (based on Apple's default named.conf) would look something like:\n//\n// Include keys file\n//\ninclude \"/etc/rndc.key\";\n\n// Declares control channels to be used by the rndc utility.\n//\n// It is recommended that 127.0.0.1 be the only address used.\n// This also allows non-privileged users on the local host to manage\n// your name server.\n\n//\n// Default controls\n//\ncontrols {\n    inet 127.0.0.1 port 953 allow {any;}\n    keys { \"rndc-key\"; };\n};\n\noptions {\n    directory \"/var/named\";\n    /*\n     * If there is a firewall between you and nameservers you want\n     * to talk to, you might need to uncomment the query-source\n     * directive below.

Here are some instructions on how to undo this setup:\n1.) Remove the DNS server (127.0.0.1) from the network interface that you configured in System Preferences.\n2.) Disable the launchd job that causes named to start on boot:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.isc.named.plist\n\n", "Q: Connect to my mac from my Ubuntu failed!

I want to give my niece my old iPhone 3GS so she can use it as an iPod touch. I don't want it connected to my iTunes.\nShould I buy a new SIM card for it or should I leave my old one in?\n\nA: A new SIM card is only necessary if you want to still use it as a phone.

Your cellular provider will have turned off that SIM when you activated your newer iPhone. \nTake your old 3GS and go to 'Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.\nThis effectively makes it a new phone.  No apps will be present other than the default apps that are on all new iPhones.

It is necessary to listen to those notifications to be able to act on them. I attempted to find a command line executable that is included with Mac OS X to perform this function. Although there is a notifyutil executable in Mac OS X, it does not act as an observer to the NSDistributedNotificationCenter. I also looked at the terminal-notifier project, but it appears to only post User (GUI) notifications.\nI've created a Foundation executable that can be run in the background to detect when a screensharing session ends (and start the ScreenSaverEngine as mentioned by @Lauri Ranta above).

Does Apple perform some kind of checkup or just showing the ID is enough?\n\nA: If your just looking for the ~5% student discount, yes your student ID card will be enough. \nFor the Apple On Campus 12% discout, they will check from your student card if your school is registered to this program. \n", "Q: I can't add video to a Keynote on iOS I have a movie/video on my iPad.  It is located in the video file (not the photo album).  When I go to Keynote presentation to add this particular video and click on media, all that comes up are photo albums so I can't seem to access this video in the video file and therefore can't add it to Keynote.  What to do?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible, but your video must be in one of the photo albums or your Camera Roll.\nIn Keynote, tap the Add Object icon at the top-right of the display in Keynote for iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the Media tab in the selection screen that appears.\n\n*Tap the photo album that contains your video.\n\n*Tap the video thumbnail you want.\n\n*Tap Choose.\n\n\nThe thumbnail for the video will be placed on the slide and will play when tapped on.\n", "Q: How do I stop loading images in Junk mail folder in Mail.app 6.6 with Gmail I have setup Mail.app to use my Gmail account. Gmail has a spam filter that works excellent for me. But I sometimes check the Junk mailbox in Mail to see if something got there by accident.\nWhen I go through the messages the images in those messages get loaded anyway as the message is placed by Gmail in the Spam folder (which is linked to the Junk mailbox) but Mail.app does not mark it as Junk and therefore loads the images.\nIf I manually mark the message as Junk, Mail stops loading the images.\nHow do I make Mail to mark the messages in Gmail's Spam folder to be marked as Junk, forcing it to not load the images?\n\nA: You have to \"map\" the Gmail folders to match what happens in Mail.app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Preferences in Mail.app\n\n*Go to Accounts and select your Gmail account\n\n*Click the \"Advanced\" tab\n\n*Enter [Gmail] (yes, with the brackets) into the 'IMAP Path Prefix' field\n\n*Close the window and Save changes to the Account.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Canon iP3000 Printer not working after using with OS X Lion I was able for some time to print from Lion using a 10.6 driver.

If you do then you may need to contact an Apple Genius to see if they are aware of this issue and a resolution to it\n", "Q: How can I select paragraphs easier in iOS 7? Selecting text has become very clunky in iOS 7, whereas it was very smooth in previous operating systems. In particular, in iOS 6, three taps of some text would select the whole paragraph. This appears to have stopped working in iOS 7.\nIs there a way to select a whole paragraph by tapping the screen in iOS 7?\n\nA: The short answer is no, you can't triple tap to select a paragraph. Here's what I do, however, to select larger chunks of text.\nDouble-tap and hold your finger puts iOS 7 into \"drag to select\" mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Double-tap and hold your finger on the first word of the paragraph\n\n*Drag down to select\n\n\nA: A two-finger single tap will select a stand alone sentence or a complete paragraph when in  edit mode.\n", "Q: Application to launch specific applications, windows, and tabs I am a programmer. I'd like to improve my workflow by being able to have a \"saved workspace\". When I start my computer, or whenever I'm ready to resume a project, I want to launch a specific set of browser tabs, terminal windows, text editor, etc. and when finished, \"save\" the state of my tabs/windows so I can resume again later.\nMy current workflow is to never close any windows and never shut down my computer.\nI don't know of an application like this but I would really like to find (or build) one.\n\nA: Mac OS X has been trying to achieve something like this on a per-app basis using Saved Application State, however, that will only retrieve the last known state of an app, not some arbitrary one from the past.\nI'm not sure of any app which can do that.\nThe closest that I am aware of would be a macro which could, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*launch a specific set of applications\n\n*open a specific set of URLs in a web browser \n\n*open a specific set of files in a specific app (or apps)\n\n\nYou could also add optional features such as \n\n\n*\n\n*quit all of your currently-open applications before beginning (or quit specific apps, like your email and twitter client) when you know you are going to work\n\n\nThis is very simple to do in Keyboard Maestro, which has a free, 30-day demo on the site. \nFor example, in the image attached I have created a macro like this as an example. I will use numbers to correspond with the numbers on the image to show what each step is doing:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This macro (read simply as: \"series of actions\") will take place either if I choose the menu from the menu bar…\n\n*…or if I use the keyboard shortcut I have specified.

I could have told Keyboard Maestro to run any sort of command, or open specific files in other applications.\nThe only thing which is not possible, as far as I am aware in any app, is the ability to say: \"Ok, save everything that is on my screen right now and remember it for later.\"\n", "Q: Hiding Inactive Menubar Items I am curious if there is a way for me to hide certain objects in the menubar when they are \"inactive.\" Some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth hides when Bluetooth is off\n\n*Wifi hides when wifi is off\n\n*Audio/sound hides when sound is muted\n\n*Battery hides when it is 100% charged\n\n\nThese are some examples. I use Alfred Workflows to work with these objects most of the time so having them in my menubar sometimes is useful but sometimes isn't. I use Bartender but was unable to find this option within it's settings. Admittedly, this is a pretty esoteric question.\n\nA: There is a nice tutorial on the various options and techniques here: http://mac.tutsplus.com/tutorials/customization/customizing-the-os-x-menu-bar/\nNone of these is quite as flexible as you ask for (Wifi hides when wifi is off...), but realize that the majority of those icons are controls as well as indications. For example, if the wifi is off, the icon can be used to access the wifi controls. This can be real handy to turn the wifi back on. ;-) Hiding the icon would make that a more lengthy process, forcing you to go through the settings app.\n", "Q: Does iOS support IPsec IKEv2? Does iOS support IPsec IKEv2?\nIf not, is there any way to get IPsec IKEv2 working on iOS?\n\nA: I do not believe the built-in Apple VPN client supports IKEv2 on either the Mac or iOS devices. This is because certainly on the Mac - including Mavericks 10.9.1, and I believe also iOS the VPN client is based on the open-source Racoon software which does not support IKEv2.\nThere is a Racoon2 see http://www.racoon2.wide.ad.jp/w/ which does support IKEv2 but that is not what Apple include.\nCisco AnyConnect client for iOS and Mac does support IKEv2.\n\nA: No, IPsec IKEv2 is not supported on iOS by Apple.\nThe only IPsec that iOS supports is Cisco IPSec (notice that it even has a different capitalisation), according to the link from bmike ♦, the Authentication methods section, iOS basically only supports several IPSec Xauth authentication methods, which are an extension to IKEv1, and are incompatible with IKEv2.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://help.apple.com/iosdeployment-vpn/mac/1.2/#app36c9653d\n\nA: iOS 9 now has a UI for IKEv2 VPN.\n\nA: Yes. Since IKEv2 was defined in 2005, you'd be hard pressed to find an IPSec implementation that doesn't run v2 these days. \nThe best documentation I've found for iOS and VPN is here from apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://help.apple.com/iosdeployment-vpn/mac/1.2/#\nCisco's documentation says their AnyConnect 3.0 has a feature of IKEv2 on iOS. \n\nA: If you are asking about Mac OS X built-in IPsec client, it's easy to verify that racoon is used. Just open Console and check system logs from the time when you use the IPsec client:\n2/22/14 8:05:38.649 PM racoon[16111]: Connecting.\n2/22/14 8:05:38.650 PM racoon[16111]: IPSec Phase 1 started (Initiated by me).\n2/22/14 8:05:38.652 PM racoon[16111]: IKE Packet: transmit success.

When using a Group from Contacts in a Mail address, all the Group list does not appear in the Mail address and those missing do not receive the email. \n\nA: Try creating a duplicate of the group and trying again to see if it the duplicated group works. Also, check that all the contacts have a valid email address on their contact card as this could be what is causing issues with the Mail App.\n\nA: I had this problem too.  I removed the existing contact card from the group and added it back.  That worked for me.\n\nA: I had this problem, too. Making a copy of the group didn't help. I fixed the issue by making a new contact card for that person (from scratch), deleting the old card, then adding the new card to the group.\n", "Q: How to copy apps between 2 devices using the same Apple ID? Is there a way to copy an application from an iPod Touch gen.2 to an iPad 3G gen.1 while both devices are under the same Apple ID? The application is no longer present in the Apple Store.\nUsing iTunes is there a way to back up and restore individual applications?\n\nA: When you connect the iPod Touch, doesn't iTunes offer to copy new purchases (i.e. the app that's important to you) to your Mac?\nYou can also try to copy the .ipa file straight off of the iPod Touch with iFunBox; http://i-funbox.com/ifunboxmac/\n", "Q: iOS jailbroken: native storage on an external drive? Since I have a faster internet connection now, and I like watching screencasts, I've started to explore YouTube downloader apps, but there's a lot of apps that I would like to use by downloading data overnight.\nThere are several iOS Wi-Fi hard drives on the market now, but of course each one provides access to the drive only through its own limited app.\nSo, using a jailbroken iOS device, how could I take the native filesystem (or the directory where all apps live and store their data) and extend it to an external (networked) drive, so that my apps would think I just happen to have a 2TB iPad?\n\nA: Theoretically? Yes.\nPractically? No.\nYou would first need to build nfs for iOS. Then, you would need to make the YouTube downloader application save its movies onto the network drive. As far as I can tell, nobody has worked on nfs for iOS, so unless you know a lot about programming for iphoneos-arm, you might just be out of luck. You wouldn't be able to extend the user partition onto the network drive, though, so none of this would be transparent to the apps. You could symlink the Documents folder for each app that you'd like to have access to your network drive, which would give you the same effect (assuming you can get your drive mounted).\n\nA: It seems like it's possible. I've ssh'd into my iPad and mount_nfs exists, although it doesn't yet work for me.\nWill report back if found anything.\n", "Q: Shared data partition for Bootcamp no longer accessible I have my Macbook Pro running Mountain Lion setup with partitions as follows:\ndisk0s1 (unnamed) - EFI partition\ndisk0s2 (\"Macintosh HD\") - OSX partition\ndisk0s3 (\"Recovery HD\") - OSX recovery partition\ndisk0s4 (\"BOOTCAMP\") - Windows 7 partition created through Bootcamp\ndisk0s5 (currently unnamed, but should be \"Data\") - exFAT partition to be shared between OSX and Windows.\nUp until yesterday everything was working fine, but now the Data partition is no longer accessible by OSX or Windows.  OSX simply won't mount the partition and Windows claims the disk needs to be formatted.  I believe this is due to a corrupt partition table and could use some help in figuring out how to resolve this.\nUnfortunately, I can't remember exactly how I created the various partitions.  I would have thought I created the Bootcamp partition through the usual means and then shrunk the OSX partition to make room for the new partition, but the layout mentioned above seems to suggest otherwise.  I may have created a large Bootcamp partition and then manually shrunk that to make room for the Data partition.  Either way, I created a hybrid MBR partition using GPT fdisk.\nSomewhat ironically, I think this debacle was caused by something I did while troubleshooting an external hard drive that is no longer readable (hardware failure).  In the course of troubleshooting the external drive I had used fdisk and the Disk Management utility in Windows 7, but shouldn't have done anything to my main drive.  I'm not sure, however, if just using these utilities attempts to \"correct\" and issues it deems necessary.\nAt first I thought that maybe the MBR table got corrupt so I recreated it using gdisk.  This solved nothing.  I had dumped out the table before and after using fdisk -d and the results were identical.  After more thought, I realized that OSX probably wouldn't be using the MBR anyway, so now I'm stumped.\nI've tried googling for some clues, but most of the results I've found are about the Windows partition no longer working and usually it's because of a corrupt MBR.\nAny thoughts on the next steps to take would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: After a lot of trial and error and research I came across this post that solved my issue:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/19084645#19084645\nLong story short, running fsck_exfat on the Data partition (disk0s5) indicated that the main boot region needed to be updated and it provided an option to update it.  Sure enough, this fixed it.\nPrior to running fsck_exfat I tried the Verify Disk option on the partition in Disk Utility and it almost immediately failed saying \"Invalid sector size: 0\".  Clicking the Repair Disk option failed and said the disk needed to be reformatted.\nAfter running fsck_exfat and updating the main boot region Disk Utility still showed the partition as \"disk0s5\" rather than \"Data\".  Clicking the Verify Disk option still gave there error saying the sector size was invalid, but the the partition name suddenly changed to \"Data\".  Then, clicking Verify Disk again said everything was fine.\nHopefully this will help someone else out there.  Or me, the next time I run into this...\n", "Q: An \"Untitled\" app icon is created on iPhone home screen after restart even after deletion I have a white app icon titled \"Untitled\". When I click on it, it opens a Safari window with Untitled title window. After deleting it, if I restart the iPhone, it gets created again.\nIs there a way to delete it permanently?\n\nA: The procedure will require for you to SSH into your device. \nNavigate to \"private/var/mobile/library/webclips\" and delete any clips (folders) entries.\nBy deleting these entries, it will eradicate the untitled icons appearing on your springboard.\n\nA: Remove the profile from the settings app that installed that web clip.\n", "Q: Why is my iPod nano reading everything out loud and functioning abnormally? I just reset my iPod nano 7th gen via iTunes to remove some broken tracks and then resynced it, and when I unplugged it after disconnecting it, everything was quite broken.\nFirst of all (with a headset plugged in) the iPod is reading everything out loud....screen dim, music, double tap to open, etc. But then, in conjunction with this, I can't control the screen like normal...you have to double-tap to open anything and I can't swipe side to side to get to settings so I can't try to change whatever mode this is. When you slide a finger over the icons, a little selection square moves over them with you.\nWhat's going on?\n\nA: It's in VoiceOver mode (an accessibility feature). I don't have an iPod nano, but on iOS, under General, there's an Accessibility menu where you can turn it off.\n\nA: You can fix it, but its a bit of a pain.\n\n\n*\n\n*Swipe left using two fingers till you get to Settings and double tap.\n\n*Double tap General.\n\n*Fiddle with it till you get down to Accessibility and Double tap.\n\n*Double tap VoiceOver.\n\n*Turn off VoiceOver.\n\n\nShould work fine from there.

It's made mostly for companies, organisations,schools, etc.\nTo be able to help you with the certificate you need to post the certificate details.\n", "Q: How not to download all emails when setting up a new Mail account? When I add a new Email account, Mail application automatically downloads All messages, but I do not need all the messages to be available on my Mac.\nIs there a way to tell Mail app to only down messages of the last 3/6 months?\n\nA: Are you using POP or IMAP? If you use IMAP, you can say in the Mail-settings to omit the attachments. This will only download the email headers and bodies, without heavily attachments. Maybe this can fit your needs?\n\nA: No - Apple desktop Mail.app doesn't have a setting to only download a window similar to how iOS does on Exchange.\n", "Q: Unplugging iPad/iPhone Charger: Which end to unplug first? After charging an iPad or iPhone, which end do you unplug first: the one that's connected in the device or the charger end?\n\nA: There really isn't any difference, there is no chance of anything bad happening regardless, although if you were particularly worried about this sort of thing, then frankly you would be better to turn the charger unit off at the wall socket first, after which it is utterly irrelevant (assuming you are using a wall charger).  If you are charging from a PC with no option to turn off the USB port as such, then you might have a preference depending on if you leave the cable in or not etc, but it's just that; a preference.\n\nA: It really doesn't matter, either way is fine.\n\nA: At all, it really won't matter. But I always disconnect the charger end first. This is done to prevent harm in the charger, but with modern chargers there shouldn't be such problems...\n\nA: It does not really matter. You could unplug the wall charger first and then that has already turned everything else off. \n\nA: Unplug the wall charger first, then from the phone. This way there is no power in the cord and no damage can be done to the cord if the phone end comes in contact with the cord. \n", "Q: App store ranking - effect of downloads from multiple countries If I have an app in the app store, it seems to be that the general consensus is\n\nHigher Downloads = Higher Rank\n\nHowever, if my app is downloaded 500 times in Australia, will that affect my US ranking? Or are the app stores completely country-independent?\n\nA: Not sure if this is the correct place to ask this kind of question, you should try the Apple Dev Fora (http://devforums.apple.com). Beside this, no-one will be able to answer this question 100% sure except Apple engineers, however, we can assume Apple is isolation the stats per store, meaning lot of downloads wont affect the rankings in other stores. \n", "Q: Using AppleScript to find information about images in Pages documents I'm trying to extract information about images placed into a Pages ('09 v 4.3) document.

Never fancied enabling FileVault on previous Macs but now I'm running OS X on an SSD. Is there a noticeable decrease in speed?\n\nA: Every time you make the computer do something extra, in this case encrypting/decrypting all file access, it will take longer and the machine will slow down a bit.\nFileVault 1 did slow things down noticeably, but with FileVault version 2 (Introduced in OS X 10.7 (Lion)) running on an SSD there is no noticeable decrease in reading or writing files. I have this enabled on a 15\" MacBook Pro Retina and a 2012 11\" MacBook Air. The only time it is noticeable is when you reboot, as it requires a password before starting the boot process.\nYou may notice that the system is slow when you first enable FileVault 2, since it has to encrypt the whole drive. Once that is done you will probably forget that it is on.\nIf you decide that you don't agree with me, turning FileVault off is easy enough. You will, once again, have the slow initial period as the whole drive is decrypted.\n\nA: I just finished turning off Filevault 2. For all who happen upon this thread looking for recent information, here it is. \nCorsair FORCE GT 480GB 1.5yrs old. Writes on file vault 2 were under 250mb/s. Noticed the performance degradation. \nSecure erased free space\nrepaired disk\ndisabled file vault 2\nNew write speeds are 438mb/s almost matching the read speeds at 4510 mb/s.\nFileVault 2 will show you extreme performance degradation and should be avoided for all who spent the money upgrading to an SSD. \n\nA: My own experience with File Vault 2 on Samsung 840 EVO on an early 2011 MacBook Pro running Mavericks is that the slowdown is not noticeable. \nDetails:\nI took one speed reading before turning File Vault 2 with \ntime dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k of=tstfile count=1024\n\nThat showed about 490 mb/s. After File Vault 2 was on and encryption was completed, another reading showed about 315 mb/s. This looked bad, so I did a restart.\nThen I took three more readings. They showed 492, 507 and 503 mb/s. I am not claiming that File Vault 2 improved speed. I should have taken multiple readings before turning on encryption, to get an idea of the expected range.\nWith the data that I do have, I'd say that whatever the penalty is, it's not noticeable.\n", "Q: How do I ping6 a link local address on OSX?

Do you have a mac that's connected to the same network? Then you can retrieve the password in the Keychain of the computer. (analogue for Windows systems)\n\nA: Resetting the device either resets the settings (and wipes keychain entries) or erases the entire device and stars fresh (which also wiped the keychain).\nSince iOS stores passwords for WiFi in the keychain, wiping it means the record of the password is gone.\n\nA: Jailbreak your device to enable the use of the Cydia store.\nThen install \"WiFi Passwords\" (BigBoss) from Cydia.\nYou will now be able to see all your saved passwords once you start the app. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Tiger): Get keyboard defaults to stick I have a circa 2007 MacBook Pro with fully-patched Mac OS X Tiger installed.

I must be able to access it without being connected to the internet, any browser will work, preferably Chrome though. Is this possible?\nI've created a page with a test example:\n<a href=\"http://www.website.com/file_test2.html\" download=\"test_file.html\">Click Here To Download test webpage</a>\nbut clicking the link seems to only open the webpage and not download it. It works fine on a laptop or tower (something not using an application, or with an accessible file tree).\nI've also tried viewing the site an offline reader, but they won't seem to load it. I think there is too much jQuery for it to work. The reason for all of this is so people can view the website in places without an internet connection (cabins, camping, basements, anywhere else without internet access).\n\nA: I would start with Safari's reading list feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TI39\nIt is built into the OS but doesn't integrate well with the Chrome app as you asked. You also might need to do some code changes to have all the features you desire work in offline mode, but since web apps were the first iOS app Apple created, there is lots of documentation at https://developer.apple.com/Safari\nThe iOS version of Opera has a save for offline option. \n", "Q: apps/music/photo sync **after** clean install of iOS 7 I am preparing to upgrade to iOS 7.0+ via a clean install. From what I've read, this method is best to minimize the chance of taking a hit on battery performance. If I understand correctly, a clean install wipes my phone and puts it into a \"brand new, just out of the box state.\"\nMy question is - do I just re-sync my clean phone using iTunes to get my music and photos (stored in iPhoto) back on my newly upgraded phone? If this isn't correct, can someone please respond with the best method or direct me to a site that will offer the instructions?\n\nA: Yes. When you do a clean install of iOS 7 no to your device, iTunes will prompt you to set up your device. When asked to restore from backup, choose Set up as new iPhone. This will mean that you don't restore your data and preserve your 'fresh' install.\n\nUse the tabs across the top of iTunes to select exactly what you would like to sync back to your device. Apps that you sync to your device using the Apps tab in iTunes do not restore the app data, unless the app data is stored in iCloud, or through some other method of syncing data (i.e. Dropbox content that is pulled from Dropbox servers).\n\nA: Yes, you can \"Set up as new iPhone\" and later sync apps, music, photos, movies, books, etc., from iTunes. You will lose all app data, including the data stored in the iOS stock apps that Apple provides.\nKeep the following in mind to be better prepared before you do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will have to configure all settings afresh (including settings like WiFi, Privacy, Location Services, Notifications, Mail accounts, iMessage, iTunes & App Store, Safari, Do Not Disturb, Passcode, Restrictions, and others).\n\n*Import photos from the Camera Roll before the new phone setup. Otherwise you will lose all those photos (even if you have photostream enabled, you may probably lose older photos if they're not synced to another device)!\n\n*You will lose all Messages (iMessages, SMS/MMS), Call History, Mail Accounts, Calendar Accounts, Wallpapers and the Home Screen arrangement of app icons.\nFor a complete list of what the iOS backup contains, which in this case is all that you would lose and have to setup afresh, see the section titled iTunes will back up the following information on Apple's \"iTunes: About iOS backups\" page.\n", "Q: Terminal commands for \"Application Windows\" and \"Show Desktop\" in Mountain Lion The title pretty much says it all.

I have already got a USB car charger for my iPhone and that works fine. When I put my iPad into it it says \"Not Charging.\"\nCan anyone tell me why it won't charge?\n\nA: The not charging indicates that when the iPad is running, the remaining current from your adapter won't be adding much meaningful charge to the battery.\nSee -  iPad displays \"Not Charging\" when plugged into USB ports.  What can I do?\nWhen you turn off the screen and idle the CPU, the charge rate will go up when the iPad is on, but you'll want a higher current charger or to power off the iPad if you want to maximize the current that goes to the charging circuitry as opposed to running the iPad.\n\nA: You will be better off purchasing a car charger that is rated for use with the iPad.

Or I can go edit and select each one and then delete. Is there a faster way? \n\nA: If your goal is to delete it just from the iPad, then remove the account in Settings > Mail, Contacts, & Calendars. \nYou can use the Edit button to select several messages and push the Delete/Archive button to affect everything that is selected.\nIf you have access to a desktop machine, removing everything from the server should be much faster.\n\nA: In IOS Mail App: Click Edit and there should be a \"Mark All\" option.   Can flag,  Mark as Read, or move to Junk.

As far as I know, the only way to do this is to first add them to iTunes (on a computer), then synch iTunes with the iPad.\nSome of these movies are .avi files and others are .mp4 files. I've selected the Films section of the iTunes Library and opened the \"Home Movies\" tab. I've tried several ways of add the files including:\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Add File to Library...\" menu item (in the file menu)\n\n*The \"Add Folder to Library...\" menu item (in the file menu)\n\n*Dragging the file from windows explorer and dropping it into iTunes\n\n\nFor some reason this fails for all the files except one. The one that works is an .mp4, but strangely none of the other .mp4 files (or any of the .avi files) appear in iTunes after I try to add them to the library.\nIs there some reason why this one particular .mp4 would work but not others? Is there another simpler way to transfer these files to the iPad? I'm using iTunes 11 on Windows.\n\nA: This is from the Apple Support site:\n\nWhat video content works with iTunes and mobile devices?\niTunes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Video content purchased from the iTunes Store. \n  \n*QuickTime and MPEG-4 movie files that end in \".mov\", \".m4v\", or \".mp4\" and are playable in QuickTime Player. \n  \n*Video podcasts.\n  \n*iTunes Digital Copies. \n  \n*iTunes Store Movie Rentals (Requires iTunes 9 or later).\n  \n\nI've had luck converting non-compatible video for iTunes and i devices with Handbrake, a multi platform, open source video converter.\n\nA: The answer to your first question is yes.  \nEdit: The answer to the second is yes, please refer to:\nHow to transfer a movie (.avi) from pc to iPad without iTunes?.\nThe reason it does not work is because an avi file is a container file, which encapsulates the underlying video and audio codec.\nThe video can be encoded with mp1v to mp4v, DIV 1 - 3, H264 or WMV, within the avi/mp4 files.\nYou will need to retranscode the movies so that the underlying format is acceptable to iTunes.\nThis can be done with vlc.  There is a bug with vlc 2.1 which reduces the quality of movies, so I recommend using vlc 2.0.8. I am running Mac os x 10.8.5.\nStart VLC:\npress: ⌘+O, which will open the \"open Source\" window:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Browse ... Select your video file to be transcoded.\n\n*Tick Streaming/Saving\n\n*Click Settings...\n\n\nYou will then have to select the file name where to save the transcoded file, select the encapsulation method (which is \"Quicktime\" below). Then select the transcoding options, you will also need to set the bitrate which will set the quality, and the scale.\n\nThe above settings work for me you may have to play around depending on your individual set up.\nIt was tested with vlc 2.0.8 and Mac OS X 10.8.5\n\nA: It turned out that the reason I couldn't import most of the .mp4 files into iTunes is because they were read-only. If you try to import a read-only .mp4 file into iTunes it fails, silently. Once I removed the read-only setting they imported successfully.\n\nA: Actually iTunes can only accept MOV, MP4 and M4V videos, AVI is definitely not one of them. So you should save avi to mov/mp4/m4v and then you will be able to successfully transfer video to iTunes. For those MP4 that cannot be moved to iTunes, they may not in QT or MPEG4 codec, and they also need re-transcoding.\n", "Q: Can't change folder permissions I'm running Mountain Lion and I have a folder in ~/sites that has a red icon on the folder  and I can't open it because 'access is denied'. \nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Info > unlock with admin password, change 'everyone' privilege to 'read write' but won't change so tried 'read only' but still 'access denied'\n\n*Terminal > sudo chmod -R 0777 ~/sites/lockedfolder\n\n*Terminal > sudo chmod -R 0777 ~/sites\n\n*Terminal > sudo chmod a+rwx ~/sites/lockedfolder\n\n*Terminal > sudo chmod a+rwx ~/sites\n\n*Disk utility > repair permissions and steps 1-5 again but no luck\nAll users now show 'read write' access in get info window but still  and no access... \n \nWhat can I try next?\n\nA: In addition to the Unix file permissions, there are old HFS file bits. To unlock your folder try:\nTerminal > chflags nouchg ~/sites/lockedfolder\nAlternatively, you could do a Get Info in the Finder, and uncheck the \"Locked\" checkbox from that window.\n\n\nA: This is probably due to an issue with Finder.

What robust setups of partitions which accommodate (a) MtLion OS X, (b) Windows x64, (c) Data partition used [primarily] under Windows?\nThings that would be desirable (optional) past the basic stability are:\n\n\n*\n\n*live shrink/expand/add/delete of partitions preserving existing data\n\n*ability to upgrade to newer versions of OS X without risk of losing Windows or Data partition\n\n*ability to upgrade / reinstall Windows without risk of losing OS X data\n\n*ideally, data shared for read & write between Windows and OS X \n\n*ideally, no third-party [paid] tools / drivers required for the whole scheme to work\n\n\nA: Always have a good backup before you attempt any partition and/or filesystem changes!\nThat said, here are some answers to your list of questions.\n1. ability to shrink/expand/add/delete partitions safely after both OSes installed, while safely preserving the data\n\n*\n\n*By default, Disk Utility allows resizing only through changing the end of a partition (not the beginning). If you need to resize any partition both ways (like \"shrink partition for one OS to expand partition for another\"), then there may be a need to physically move data to accommodate that. This can be done only with third party tools like iPartition, which supports \"non-destructive resize of HFS+ (including case-sensitive and journaled), FAT and NTFS partitions\" (taken from the Coriolis Systems website). Even with a third party tool, you may not be able to resize partitions around in every combination that you can think of (you also need adequate free space to consolidate all files).\n\n2. ability to upgrade to newer versions of OS X without risk of losing Windows or Data partition\n\n*\n\n*You can do this without issues with the setup you have linked to.\n\n3. ability to upgrade / reinstall Windows without risk of losing OS X (including OS itself, applications, user data&settings) -- [1] has it\n\n*\n\n*This is also possible with the setup you have linked to.\n\n4. ideally, data shared for read & write between Windows and OS X\n\n*\n\n*The free solution to do this is to have the data partition formatted as FAT32. But this would limit individual file sizes to 4GB. Also, FAT32 does not have journaling, unlike NTFS and HFS+ that do. So recovery from data corruption is possible through some rudimentary means, but not as reliable as other filesystems.\n\n*By default, OS X can read NTFS (Windows) volumes, but not write to it. On the other hand, by default, Bootcamp allows you to read the OS X volume, but not write to it.\n\n*There are third party applications to allow read/write access to HFS+ volumes from Windows and to allow read/write access to NTFS volumes from OS X. The most popular ones being the solutions from Paragon Software.\n\n5. ideally, no third-party [paid] tools / drivers required for the whole scheme to work\n\n*\n\n*See the above points. It's not possible to eliminate FAT32 from the scheme without third party tools/drivers (free or paid).\n\n6. ability to easily transfer the whole setup to a new HDD (complicated for [1])\n\n*\n\n*Transferring to a larger HDD is going to involve some manual work. There is no easy way to clone it out since your partition size requirements in the larger HDD would be different. While partitioning would require some work, cloning all these partitions to another drive of the same size is possible using disk based cloning utilities like Clonezilla (this is feasible with larger disks with the partitions already created, but would require some more work for the OSes, especially Windows, to recognize the new size).\n\n7. ideally, ability to have more than 2 partitions under Windows (i.e. 2+ data partitions)\n\n*\n\n*You can have multiple partitions, but the overall partition management is better managed through OS X.\n\n8. risk of any OS to corrupt any partition should be not larger than in a single OS setup with its native partition\n\n*\n\n*This is more of a filesystem and cross platform filesystem driver question. Although third party tools/drivers for NTFS from OS X and HFS+ from Windows have existed for years, they cannot be guaranteed to be bug free. Without native read/write implementations from either OS for the other's filesystem, a regular backup (or even two) is a good practice to follow!\n\n\nA: My own solution for the original problem so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*give up having a dedicated Windows data partition on the built-in disk\n\n*split the built-in disk into two partitions: (1) OS X bootable and (2) Windows bootcamp bootable\n\n*size that partitions based on some initial estimation; use a subset of this process (specifically, Time Machine for OS X, WinClone for Windows) to re-size partitions when absolutely necessary\n\n*when completely out of space on either of partitions, or in need of shared read-write storage, purchase PNY StorEDGE (eg 128GB) non-protrusive SD card as a dedicated user data disk (exFAT); large read-only files like books/music/read-only mail archives are good candidates to move there.\n\n\nThis minimizes most of the risks and dependence on third party tools, keeps NTFS for Windows volume, is friendly to OS X upgrades and reinstall of any OS. Straightforward, but promises to be reliable.\n", "Q: Mac Mail not including original email headers in Reply Is there any way to make Mail include the to/cc email addresses when forwarding/responding to a message? currently all I get is:\nOn Oct 15, 2013, at 2:47 PM, John Doe <jDoe@jDoe.com> wrote:\n\nwhat I would like is:\nFrom: Dakine83 \nSent: Tuesday, October 15, 2013 2:55 PM\nTo: John Doe\nCc: Jane Doe\nSubject: Re: Clean the fridge!\n\nNot including who has seen the email chain is a serious omission, hopefully it's just a setting I can't find.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't customize the Reply/Forward headers without the help of QuoteFix or ReplyWithHeader.\nTo customize the actual headers when viewing an email message, I'll quote this MacFixIt article:\n\nTo alter the headers that Mail includes, you can go to the Viewing section of the Mail preferences, choose the Custom setting, and then add or remove any fields of the e-mail header that you wish to see. Unfortunately you need to enter the field names manually, and many times e-mail services will append their own header details to a message, especially for handling spam or other security features. Therefore if you are not sure what the header titles are then you will need look them up in the raw source code for any particular message.\nTo do this, select a message in your inbox and then press Option-Command-U or choose \"Raw Source\" from the View > Message menu.

I have an iPhone through my company. From my understanding, Apple does not allow any software onto their i* devices that does not come from the app store.

Is there any keyboard loggers, or other spyware that could be installed which would allow a company to track employees actions outside of the traditional email client?\nI know text messages show up on a monthly bill through the carrier. If texting through Google voice, I'm assuming that would be unreadable, since it is a third party app and uses a data connection?\n\nA: Companies can choose to provide in-house apps to employees through the iOS Developer Enterprise Program without listing them on the Apple iOS App Store.\nWhat you're asking about mainly falls into the realm of MDM (Mobile Device Management). One of the popular MDM solutions on iOS is Afaria, from SAP. Installation of the MDM app is made a mandatory requirement by some companies in order to allow employees to connect to corporate email (and other services). An MDM solution can be used to setup apps, accounts, impose corporate policies/restrictions on specific features and also enable remote wiping of the device through the provisioning of profiles.\nDue to the application sandbox restrictions imposed by iOS, the MDM application does not have complete control over the device to snoop across every other application on the system and the OS. It cannot log keystrokes, network communication or data from the apps you use.\nRead through the iPhone in Business page for details. Here are some relevant snippets:\n\nWhile IT can interact with iPhone and iPad devices through an MDM server, not all settings and account information are exposed. IT can only manage corporate accounts, settings, and information provisioned via MDM. The user's personal accounts can’t be accessed.\n  ...\n  ...  \nExamples of what an MDM server can and can't see on an iOS device.\nMDM can see:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Device name\n  \n*Phone number\n  \n*Serial number\n  \n*Model name and number\n  \n*Capacity and space available\n  \n*iOS version number\n  \n*Installed apps\n  \n  \n  MDM cannot see:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Personal mail, calendar, contacts\n  \n*SMS or iMessages\n  \n*Safari browser history\n  \n*FaceTime or phone call logs\n  \n*Personal reminders and notes\n  \n*Frequency of app use\n  \n*Device location\n  \n\n\nA few more points to note on this topic:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple may expand on the device monitoring and policy enforcement features in future releases of iOS.\n\n*One important prerequisite imposed by companies for allowing access to corporate email (and other resources) in exchange for installing MDM on the device is that the device must not be jailbroken.

It's distracting and annoying.\nOf course, one thing I could do is switching to the 24h format, but I'd prefer not to. Are there any other suggestions how this could be fixed?\n\nA: You should try toggling to 24h format, force quit Settings, and then reset it to 12h format.\nYou could also try toggling to German and back to English, once again after force quitting Settings.\nSometimes something simple as toggling a setting will get the app to execute some code that it didn't when you switched the language setting.\nGood Luck.\n\nA: You don't have to force close anything.

The first was clear and the second was FileVault 2'd and was used as a Time Machine.  My intent is to end up with one FileVault 2 partition spanning the entire drive.\nI have already moved the data from the clear partition to the second and removed it, and I have already decrypted the FileVault 2 partition so that it can be resized.  However, Disk Utility will only let me resize the second partition at its end, not move its top end up.  (Once resized to fill the disk, I intend to re-encrypt the partition.)  It seems I may have to move the second partition to the top of the drive first.\nHow would I go about expanding this partition to fill the entire drive?

It used to, before I decrypted the FileVault volume.  It's my understanding that the disk was un-CoreStoraged (if that makes any sense—forgive me, I'm learning this stuff on the fly) after decryption.\n\nA: The resizing can be finicky when there is a gap in the space between the partitions.

The second list is how the physical drive is actually partitioned. I've seen cases where you can image the secondary partition contents to a DMG on the free space in the first filesystem - then make the drive one filesystem and then grow the one logical volume to take all physical space.\nI've also seen it where you need to undo the core storage - which implies an erase of the drive and backing up all the data elsewhere before proceeding.\n", "Q: OS X change Admin user to Standard user with command line I would love to send a Unix command through ARD that will change a OS X admin user to a standard user.

I'm using Microsoft PowerPoint 2011 on a Mac. When I use \"Save As...\" and choose PDF format, I would like a PDF that has all the slides except for slides marked as Hidden in my slide deck. But I always get all slides in the PDF.\nThis is a problem, of course, because hidden slides are hidden because they aren't ready for public viewing.\nI would think there should be an option to suppress hidden slides, but I can't find one. My colleagues who use Windows do seem to have the option on MS PowerPoint for Windows.\nIt is possible to suppress hidden slides during Print... but then I am at the mercy of print formatting, and the PDF contains print margins that I can't suppress.\nHas anyone found a solution for this?\n\nSolution:\nThere appears to be no way to make \"Save As PDF\" skip hidden slides on the Mac version of Powerpoint.\nSo the workaround is to use Print instead, and print to PDF within that dialog. One can fix the margin issue this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Print dialog.\n\n*Click Page Setup... to choose a paper size.\n\n*Change the Width and Height to match the full width and height of the paper you choose. For example, if you select Letter size, the default width and height are 10\" x 7.5\", so change it to be 11\" x 8.5\".\n\n*Now one can print to paper or print to PDF and get the full bleed, and hidden slides stay hidden.\n\n\nA: Instead of Save As... PDF, Print->\"Save as PDF\".  You can get around the print margins by setting up a printer/presentation that has no margins, \"full bleed\". \nA few important steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, go to File -> Page Setup and make sure that you've got the dimensions there identical for the default paper size in the printer.  In my case, it's 8.5 x 11 inches for Letter size paper.  Read the dialog box carefully, and select the option that lets you set a size larger than the printer will allow.\n\n*In the print dialog, make sure you do NOT have \"scale to fit paper\" checked.\nYou should now see that the print preview in the print dialog is edge to edge.\n\n\nA: Another approach would be to move all the hidden slides to the end of the presentation, Save as PDF, and then excise the hidden slides after creating the PDF. You could always insert a slide before the hidden slides stating that \"The following slides are not part of this presentation\"...just in case you forget to remove them from the PDF before circulating.\n", "Q: How can I replace a hard drive running BootCamp?

If I try single user mode, it stops at a certain point before booting entirely and says \"waiting for root device.\"\nHowever, I was able to successfully boot into OSX after trying five or so times.  Then, after running for a few minutes it froze up.  I've been able to repeat this a couple times, but 90% of the time it just shows the circle.\nI do not believe this is a hardware problem because Windows works fine (I am typing this from Windows), but it doesn't scream \"software problem\" because it's intermittent.\nAny advice?\n\nPS: I replaced the stock hard drive last year with this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820171569\nI found a blog post http://www.klein2.de/does-apple-drop-the-intel-x25-m-ssd-support-with-10-8-3/ that seems to describe my problem, but I doubt that it is for the same reason.  The screenshot with the black background is exactly what I see when I try to boot into single user mode.\n\nA: I brought it to the Apple store where they replaced the hard disk cable for free (possible thanks to Applecare).

If the local OS X Recovery system is missing, late-model Mac computers should automatically attempt to access OS X Internet Recovery. \nYou can also force a system to start up to OS X Internet Recovery by holding down Command-Option-R. This worked for me. When you do this, your Mac tries to re-download the OS X Recovery system from Apple servers.

This is because most background processes only run when they are needed (see \"On Demand\")\nBest to look at Activity Monitor to see if there is anything taking up CPU.\nMy guess is for text editing and multitasking you will have no speed issues. \nFor web browsing the browser and especially add ins will take up CPU and memory thus requiring swapping.\n", "Q: iOS 7: How can I disable ringer for all phone numbers but one?

It suddenly discharges its entire battery without warning, and won't start until it's had about 10 minutes charging afterwards. This happens even when plugged into the mains and on 100% charge. So far it's only happened after a long day's use (plugged in all day), but it's happened three times now. The cycle count is 768, according to Apple support the maximum cycle count on my model is 1000, so it shouldn't be end days yet. It's also displaying the condition as \"normal\". \nI've ordered another battery which should be arriving tomorrow, but I'd really appreciate knowing why this is happening, and how I can avoid it happening again. I've lost some important work due to these shutdowns, and I'm worried about where the charge is going - if the battery fried the logic board I'd be up the creek.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Your problem is (or was) your Power Adapter. \n45W that's enough for a MacBook Air but definitely not for a 15\" MacBook Pro. \nApple shipped a 60W or 85W power adapter with these MacBook Pro (depending on the processor) \n\nA: Try a better charger.

Please have a look at the screenshot of my music app below.\n \nHere you can see volume slider is disabled, that is without pointer.\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nA: It sounds like it is most likely stuck in DOCK mode; it thinks something is connected to the dock, and is passing all audio through dock connector which then also abdicated volume control to the accessory rather than on the phone/pod/pad.\nThis could be the software stuck if it corrects itself after a reboot and a connect to USB to a computer to alert the device that it's no longer supposed to send line-out level sound.\nBasically, when you connect an iOS device to a car stereo or other dock, there is some intelligence to determine if the volume should work like headphones where the user can control things or in line mode where the iOS device should send a line-level signal and the car audio is responsible for amplification and volume control.\nIf reboots and restores do not fix this, you will need to get the hardware cleaned and/or repaired. It could be as simple as lint in connector making the pins not connect electrically (or even physically preventing proper insertion). It also could be an internal failure (corrosion due to liquid damage or just a fault in the circuitry without an external cause).  You can follow the examples given in this Q&A to troubleshoot dock connectivity issues\n\nA: I had the same problem. My phone was stuck in dock mode. I followed someones advice on Apple community. They solved the problem by going to a dock station with speakers and plug the iPhone in, play music and removed the iPhone from the dock. I did this and it worked for me.\n\nA: If you had called me when I worked at Apple and took calls on iOS 7 (I was doing that during that release), I would go through some basic troubleshooting, but really if the only thing that changed was the upgrade, and you say it's not on silent,  etc, I would be very suspicious that something went wrong during the upgrade.\nIt's more satisfying to say \"do x y and z and that fixes it\" but a lot of the time with these kind of problems you just run a restore and that will solve it. It's unlikely your hardware went bad exactly at the same time, so the upgrade is about 99% sure to be the problem.\nLooks like 7.1.2 is the newest OS you can get, I recommend you make sure you have proper backups, then put the phone in DFU mode and restore it with iTunes.

I am used to windows computers where the Key is on the bottom of the machine. I don't see a key of any kind.\nI'm also not sure what version of OSX it should be running. \n\nA: You can just install the new hard drive and if you have a connection to the internet when you first boot up you can download Mac OS X directly from apple.  If you hold the alt key while the machine is booting it will take you directly to Internet Recovery. \nSome features like iPhoto will be missing from this \"free\" version however they are very cheap and easy to install afterwards via the app store.\nThis process was tested on a 2011 MBP, also because you have to download the entire OS the process is quite lengthy.\n", "Q: Proper way to sync Google Cal to iCal I have a google calendar and I need to have several iCal sync and pull updates from this Google Calendar.

It is especially noticeable with low impedance headphones. Some have even had a click when the sound is turned on (i.e. when an alert sound plays, or a song is started in iTunes).\nYou could try taking it to the Genius bar, they might replace it if it is still under warranty. There could be a short somewhere, or it could just be considered \"normal\" which is why audiophiles use digital output.\n\nA: You said the humming stops when you touch the machine, which reminded me of another issue: in some situations, some people can feel a \"tingling\" sensation when they touch the casing of a portable Mac which is connected to an ungrounded power supply.\nSo, an idea here: plug the power supply in, but make sure you are using a grounded plug on the power supply.  There are some more details in the answers to this question.\n\nA: I had this exact problem. It's a grounding issue.\nI'm guessing you're plugged in using the 2-prong plug?\nUse the 3-prong plug and you'll be golden.\nIt's a subtle issue, but what's happening is that you created a ground loop by not using the ground prong on your charger. Your USB-C cable is acting like an antennae, and it's leaking RF noise into the air, creating what Shure calls a \"hum field\", or an inductive loop, which the microphone is picking up.\nI was never able to figure out why the noise would disappear when I touched the body of the laptop though. Maybe the body is acting as a ground and absorbing the EMI?\nA little trick is that you'll notice that the amount of noise will increase and be very stable when you touch the metal shield of the USB-C connector.\n", "Q: iPad Other Storage - what is it and how to clear it up? iTunes reports my iPad has 4Gb of \"other\" storage (yellow). It was 6Gb before I did a sync.\nWhat is this and what can I do about it?\n\nA: \"Other\" data is memory things other than apps, music, or movies use. This usually consists of mainly downloads and other content that your device cannot classify. You can remove it by downloading a file explorer and deleting unwanted items to free up space.\n", "Q: Duplicate mount points on Mac I'm having a problem where the name of my Windows drive changes periodically on my Mac with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.\nExample: The Windows drive might be named drive/dept now, but next the name might be drive/dept-2 or drive/dept-4.\nI need the location of this drive to be constant to run a script. With the periodic name change I have to check what the name is and adjust the script each time I run it.\nWhy is this happening? Is there anyway I can stop this?\n\nA: From your description, this seems like an issue with unmounting the drive not working properly or an unexpected restart of the system. When a drive is unmounted, the mount point under /Volumes/ should be gone. Otherwise Mac OS X would create a new mount point with suffixes like \"-1\", \"-2\" and so on since a name that's currently used cannot be replaced without a proper unmount.\nThere are a few things you could do to resolve this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that you always eject the drive correctly.\n\n*Restart the system.\n\n*Remove the duplicate mount point in /Volumes\n\n*Apply the combo updater for Mac OS X 10.6.8 v1.1 and see if that helps.\n\n\nReferences:\nRemove the duplicate mount point in /Volumes\nDrives in OS X appearing with '-1' appended to their names\n", "Q: Find my Mac: \"Online, no location available\" I'm testing the \"find my Mac\" feature at icloud.com and one of my Macs can't be found.

So I'll mention that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find My Mac is enabled on the Mac in System Preferences --> iCloud.\n\n*The date and time zone on the Mac are correct.\n\n*The Mac is connected to the internet via Wifi. Other Macs on the same Wifi network are found, so it doesn't appear to be a problem with Wifi location.\n\n*Location Services is enabled in System Preferences --> Security & Privacy --> Privacy\n\n*I am in the USA, where this feature should work (and as mentioned, does work for other Macs on the same network).\n\n*I'm logged in to the same iCloud account on multiple Macs, but only the one Mac is not found.\n\n\nAlso, though not specifically mentioned in TS 4006 or on other sites that I've seen:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Mac does not have a firewall enabled\n\n*The \"Play Sound\" feature of Find my Mac works.

It is connected to the Wi-Fi router via ethernet.  I turned on Wi-Fi (to the same router), and my MacPro's location now shows up in icloud.com under the Find My iPhone pages.\n\nA: I just waited a while, and it started working. There's no indication of why it wasn't working at one point but then started working later on. That's kind of concerning, because I wonder how reliable the system is. But there doesn't seem to be any fix beyond \"wait it out\".\n\nA: FYI:\n+1 turned WiFi on, not connected to any WiFi network, no auto-join to any wifi, and suddenly, the location is now working in iCloud 'find my' service correctly.\n", "Q: Why won't an SMS go through in certain geographical areas on my iPhone 5s if it contains exactly 148 or 149 characters? This is odd. On my iPhone 5s (iPhone6,1 on Sprint 15.1 running iOS 7.0.2), whenever I try to send an SMS that contains either 148 or 149 characters, it fails to deliver.\nIt took me a couple weeks to track down what was actually going on. At first, I just thought that some messages didn't send perhaps due to network problems; it seemed random and normal. An iMessage with the same content would be delivered just fine. I finally got sick of them failing all the time (I write relatively long messages), so I sat down and worked out what the issue could be. I thought that maybe my messages were failing to certain carriers, making it a problem that is out of my reach. I sent the same samples to one of my contacts for each of the four major service providers - AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile (oh, and also Google Voice as a bonus). They always failed on the 148 and the 149 length messages. Here are some screenshots to illustrate what happens:\n\nAt least for me, it's been 100% repeatable. I tried many other lengths as well, and so far, these are the only two that do this. I thought that it could be a bug in iOS 7, so I had my contacts count out their characters and send the suspects back to me. I received them just fine from each of them. I don't know anyone else with an iPhone 5s, so I can't test to see if it's something with either the hardware, the carrier, 64-bit iOS, or the baseband firmware.\nHave any of you experienced this? (I've looked everywhere on Google to no avail.)\nTo anyone with an iPhone 5s, could you please try this yourselves on both LTE and 3G?\nDoes anyone know what could be wrong?\nEdit: I just tried this again just now. I'm on 3G, and it sent the messages just fine. I was always on LTE when the messages failed, though. I will try it again when I get in LTE coverage in case it has been resolved since my findings.\nEdit: My iPhone connected to LTE, so I tried it again, and it failed to send the same message that successfully sent earlier today on 3G. This is bizarre! Due to this, I think it can safely be assumed that it's not an issue with 64-bit iOS 7, because otherwise, it would have failed over both 3G and LTE. This is because iOS simply sends the SMS as the same sequence of PDU data to the baseband regardless of which wireless technology it's using, and the baseband handles everything else from that point on. I have updated the title and content of this question to reflect this newfound information.\nEdit: The contact in the screenshot above named Ryan has an iPhone 5 on the same carrier. He's connected to the same Sprint LTE tower as me. We tested it, and he could send 148-character messages to me, but I could not send them back. (This should be assumed, but I'd like to state that I make sure that iMessage is turned off during all of my tests.) This leads me to believe that it's not a problem with the carrier. I'm making a cautious deduction here, but I'm going to suggest that the issue lies within the baseband firmware. Can anyone else support or confirm my hypothesis? Can anyone provide some insight into why this might occur?\nEdit: Just when I though that it couldn't get any more complicated, it did. I was connected to LTE, so I thought, hey, maybe the 7.0.3 iOS update fixed it. I know that it worked earlier today at my office about 40 miles away from my home, but there's no LTE at my office - only 3G. I got home from work today, and I tried to send a 148-character message, and it failed (no luck with the update). I wanted to verify that it's an LTE-only problem, so I turned off LTE in the Cellular settings. I tried sending the message, but it failed. I turned off cellular data altogether, and it still failed. For some reason, and only on my iPhone 5s, when I'm on the tower near my home, I can't send and SMS that contains 148 or 149 characters. Now geography comes into play. Wow, this is getting out of hand. I have no idea what to make of any of this, but it's truly annoying. It's only happening for me, even though there are other people in my home on Sprint, and they can send the same messages just fine. It would be one thing if it only happened every once in a while, but it's 100% consistent and reproducible near my home. I even drove 10 miles away, and it still failed. Who would I even go to for support or a resolution in this situation? Sprint? Apple? The Midi-chlorians? I'm completely lost here.\nUpdate: I just went through my tests again, and I've confirmed that this is still occurring.\nUpdate: I recently moved uptown, and it hasn't been occurring here. Next time I'm back near my old place, I'll test it again to see if it's just that I'm in a non-issue location or that Sprint has fixed it.\n\nA: It looks to me like your texts are approaching a length where the phone needs to send a concatenated SMS. Judging from your success with 3G and not on LTE I would guess at this being an operator problem with supporting concatenation on LTE in some scenarios.\nEDIT: The test you ran with your friend connected to the same tower obviously puts this to some doubt.\n\nA: Was having some SMS message sending failures and came across this post.  I have a Samsung S3 with android 4.3 with Sprint service and can confirm that messages with both a 148 and 149 characters fail consistently.  147 and 150 character messages send with no problem.\nThis makes sense as in the past I would edit or manually split my messages with success but never understood why that worked.  Pretty annoying but at least there is a workaround by just adding or deleting a couple of characters by looking at the character counter or on failed attempts.\n\nA: Try send it as a Multi Media Message which allows more than 140 and see if that works.\n\nA: I can reproduce this problem exactly on a Sprint Galaxy Note 3. Whenever my message contains 148 or 149 characters, it fails with \"code: 34\" and \"Network not responding\".\n", "Q: Problem downloading photos from iPhone Photostream to Windows Why doesn't my iCloud panel on my Windows 8 computer always download the photos from Photostream on my iPhone? \nI have an iPhone 5, on iOS 7.\n\nA: It seems that Apple dropped the ball with the new iCloud services for Windows.

Apparently Mavericks doesn't allow any property list/configuration file to be used when it's been changed since release from Apple.(This opposed to previous versions of OS X, where you could do some editing and still run the app)\nFor those who don't have a clue what I'm talking about:\nThere is a file called \"CodeResources\" which holds hashes/code signatures of each and every file in an app's folder. Now there's this one trick I want to do, which involves editing the Info.plist in Boot Camp(utility to run Windows on another partition) so I can install Windows 8 from USB (I downloaded the iso via our college's site for free and I don't want to burn it to DVD, because I'm cheap/stubborn like that).\nOnce I modify /Applications/Utilities/Boot Camp Assistant.app/Contents\n/Info.plist, Is it possible to codesign the app myself or otherwise get it to run?\n\nA: Before OS X 10.10, you can run sudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app to re-sign the app with an ad-hoc signature.\nIn order to re-sign it in 10.10, you need to additionally specify the --deep command to re-sign bootcamp:\nsudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app --deep\n\n\n'--deep' When signing a bundle, specifies that nested code content such as helpers, frameworks, and plug-ins, should be recursively signed\n               in turn. Beware that all signing options you specify will apply, in turn, to such nested content.\n               When verifying a bundle, specifies that any nested code content will be recursively verified as to its full content. By default,\n               verification of nested content is limited to a shallow investigation that may not detect changes to the nested code.\n               When displaying a signature, specifies that a list of directly nested code should be written to the display output. This lists only\n               code directly nested within the subject; anything nested indirectly will require recursive application of the codesign command.\n\n\nA: Since 10.7, sandboxed applications have crashed on launch if the Info.plist has been modified. \nAs a workaround, you can run sudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app to replace the code signature with an ad-hoc signature. \nIt disables sandboxing, so for example the preference file is saved in ~/Library/Preferences/ instead of the sandbox container.\n(direct copy from @user3936's comment )\n\nA: Just what I needed, thanks.\nBut in os x version 10.10 upwards you require the following command:\nsudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Utilities/Boot\\ Camp\\ Assistant.app --deep\n\nIt will prompt for the install of command tools, then will work without issues.\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide the address bar and status bar in iOS 7 Safari?

Oddly however, if you drag the same email from a normal folder into a folder it works.  I suspect this is down to a bug in the Mac Mail logic where it assumes that because the mail is in a folder, the removal of the Inbox label is not required, but a smart folder is not a folder, it's only a view of a folder.  Massive fail, and this issue has been like this for 1+ years.\n\nA: Got the same problem and getting insane. The only thing that helped so far was to log in to Gmail and there either click on \"Archive\" or simply remove the label \"Inbox\" from an email. Both actions remove the mail from the Inbox and thus also from the Inbox in Mail.app. The mail is then only kept in other folders (or better: labels as Gmail uses it) or \"Archive\" if no additional folder / label was added. However, there seems to be no way to remove the \"Inbox\" label from mails through Mail.app.\n\nA: Thanks for the hint about \"smart\" folders\nI found that if in Gmail I uncheck \"all mails\" in IMAP, then the problem also disappears, I can move messages as I please.\nHowever this is only in Apple Mail, Outlook demands all mail to be visible in IMAP in order to work.\nI use Outlook for archiving in the right folders since Apple Mail does not have any shortcut key.\n\nA: It may help to attempt to rebuild the mailbox that you're having problems with.

The error you're seeing says that Adobe Premiere does not know how to process the video format that's within the AVI file.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, you would have to find out (or know) the codec used for the video within the AVI file and then download and install the appropriate codec on your system.\n\n*To find out the codec for the file, examine it using a tool like QuickTime or VLC and see if you can use the Inspectors in these to get the video and audio codecs for your file.\n\n*If these two don't help, you would have to use a media information tool like MediaInspector or AviInfo on OS X or GSpot on Windows. Then search and install the codec for the file.\n\n\nHere's some additional explanation and information from Adobe on \"Troubleshoot file formats and codecs\":\n\nVideo-recording devices and video software applications encode files in a specific file format, such as AVI, QuickTime (MOV), and Windows Media (WMV). For a list of the file formats that Adobe Premiere Elements supports, search \"Supported file formats in Adobe Premiere Elements \" in the Adobe Knowledgebase.\nSome video file formats, including AVI and MOV, are container file formats. The data inside these container files is encoded according to a particular codec. Codecs are algorithms for compressing video and audio data. Many different codecs exist.\nFor example, an AVI file can be encoded with the DV codec, a commercial codec (such as DivX), a Motion JPEG codec, among others. (Camcorders that record to miniDV tapes use the DV codec. Some still-image cameras use the Motion JPEG coded.)\nAdobe Premiere Elements sometimes cannot decode video files that were created with a poorly designed codec or a codec that is not installed on your computer.\nKnowing the format and, when applicable, the codec of the files you are working with helps you use these solutions. To gather this information, do one or more of the following tasks:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the file in Apple QuickTime Player and choose Window > Show Movie Inspector.\n  \n*If the file is from a camcorder, camera, or other video-recording device, see the device's documentation, or locate the device's specifications on the manufacturer's website.\n  \n*Open the file in a third-party application that analyzes media files, such as MediaInfo or GSpot 2.70.\n  \n\n\nA: I encountered this recently when my Kodak digital camera recorded in .MOV, and I figured importing it should be a breeze. Nope. I kept running into a very unhelpful \"File format contains no audio or video\" error when dragging the .MOV file into my clip bin.\nThe solution was so simple it was almost ridiculous. After Googling for a bit, I found a YouTube saying all you had to do was change the filename extension from .MOV to .MP4, and boom - done. I didn't believe it at first, but sure enough - it worked like a charm! :-)\nThis was on Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2015, Windows 8.\n\nA: It's very simply.\nHOW TO FIX: download avid codex pack, install it (on mac -> library->QuickTime), restart and reopen Adobe Premiere.\nhttp://avid.force.com/pkb/articles/en_US/download/Avid-QuickTime-Codecs-LE\n\nA: All I did was add \".mov\" to the file name and all is well!!!\n", "Q: iPhone backup data overwritten by mistake I was updating my iPhone to iOS 7 and in the process I took a backup of my phone. After installing iOS 7 on my iPhone, I connected it to iTunes and instead of pressing Restore from backup, I pressed Backup and iTunes saved the backup of my restored iPhone, overwriting my original backup data.\nThe newer backup I have now is of my blank restored iPhone and I don't have a backup in iCloud either. Is there a way of retrieving the backup that I did before updating my software?\n\nA: With iTunes backups, there is only one backup (the latest) maintained per device at any point in time. Since you have overwritten the older backup with a new one from the fresh install, it's possible to recover only if you have a copy of the backup folder made before the install through the built-in Time Machine backup system on OS X (if you have a Mac) or any other solution.\nHere are the iTunes backup folder locations on different operating systems:\nOS X - ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\nWindows (XP, Vista and 7) -  %APPDATA%\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\ \nSince you do not have iCloud backups, you're completely out of luck if you didn't have backups of the iTunes backups. If you do back up your computer, simply restore the folder where iTunes stores iOS backups (after making sure you have a current backup for other devices if needed) and you can restore your iPhone from an older backup. \nFor more information, see these answers to similar questions - they provide details as well as recommendations for the future:\nRestoring an OLD iPhone backup\nRecover iPad Safari bookmarks overwritten by iCloud \n\nA: If you are on PC, you can play around with Windows Restore and restore your computer to an earlier point. This should put the old iTunes backup in place [unless I am mistaken].\n", "Q: Windows draggable under menu bar after second display Using OSX 10.8.5, I recently attached a second display to my 2013 Mac Air via the Thunderbolt port. Since removing this display I can now drag Finder and other windows under the menu bar. They pop back into viewable space on release, but this is visually annoying. How do I get the standard 'solid' menu bar behaviour back?\nI have tried switching resolution but this doesn't work.\n\nA: Possible fix: edit the icon shortcuts in menu bar top right. For example Sys Prefs > Date & Time > Show date in menu bar (toggle it on/off). This seems to force the menu bar to refresh and fix the problem.\n", "Q: Why is my site getting error reports from users with iOS7 on a MacBook? I've asked this question already on Stackoverflow though got referred to this forum here.\nI got a list of Safari bugs that happened on a MacBook running iOS7. I am a bit confused now as afaik iOS7 is an operating system for iPads and iPhones only - or am I wrong? \nPS: I am aware that my question might sound a bit odd but I am used to Windows (cough, cough) and don't know much about Macs and their operation systems.\n\nA: Ruling out a possible hack to get iOS to run on a MacBook natively (which would get a lot of publicity), I can see the following options\n\n\n*\n\n*Users didn't know enough about their system and just picked the things most likely (which means that you could have error reports from users with OS X 10.7 on a MacBook as well as from some with iOS7 on an iDevice mixed together)\n\n*One or the other is just the default option when filling in a bug report on wherever you are getting them from and people are lazy\n\n*Users have been accessing your site via the iOS simulator on OS X. Possible but rather unlikely (unless you have a very special site :-)\n\n\nA: There is no publicly known way of running iOS 7 on a MacBook. As you've said, iOS 7 is a mobile OS used on iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices. Macs use different versions of OS X.\nDepending on how you're getting these bug reports, here's what users may be doing and what you could do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Entering incorrect information in the bug report - just ask your users about the browser configuration and hardware in use (you could also provide them instructions to get the Safari version).\n\n*Configuring custom (and possibly invalid) user agent strings to indicate iOS 7 on MacBook, which you've gathered from logs - examine the user agent to check for the presence of \"Mobile\" anywhere (indicating it's from an iOS device) or the absence of it.\n\n\nHere's the list of Safari User Agent Strings. You could try to link the user agent with a specific user by communicating with a user and having a test session.\n", "Q: Finder generic icons for music/movies on second drive I have added an SSD to my iMac with OS X Lion and wanted to reorganise files a little:  \n\n\n*\n\n*System and home folder on SSD  \n\n*Music, Documents, movies on HDD\n\n\nThat's not hard, but when I move the Music folder to Finder's sidebar I get a generic folder icon. Is there any way to get the music icon for that folder (which is on a different drive)? I find it visually quicker and easier to find the correct folders in the sidebar if they have custom icons.\nOnly solution I found is to use ColorfulSidebar.bundle and get Snow Leopard style color icons (and change them as you like in folders info panel), but I would like to have the newer gray style all over system. The ColorfulSidebar also does not work for in-app file browsing (you always get gray icons).\n\nA: Unfortunately the icons now appear to be hardcoded, it used to be the case that you could just name a folder Movies in your home folder and it would gain the icon but not anymore.\nAccording to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8380562/adding-buttons-to-finder-toolbar\nDropBox are going to pretty extreme lengths to get their icon in the sidebar, using code injection. \nIn other words, I don't think it is possible I'm afraid.\n", "Q: Can be iPhone detected in 'Find my iPhone' service after recover? I lost my iPhone and while it was turned on I could lock it and put in 'Lost mode' through  Apple 'Find My iPhone' service.\nUnfortunately almost one month it's not found and until now I had hope to find it.\nIf somebody found it and recovered or re-installed iOS on that phone, can it be detected after turning on in my iCloud service anyway? or I lost it forever?\n\nA: I assume since it was a month ago that you had iOS 6 on there? If someone found it and wiped it from scratch, your Find My iPhone will not work.\nIn iOS7, Activation Lock could prevent them from re-activating your phone if they found it, and you might have a chance to find something.\n\nA: It depends on what iOS version it was on. \nWith iOS 6 (or earlier), wiping it would remove Find my iPhone tracking completely without asking for Apple ID authorization. \nWith iOS 7, one is required to enter their Apple ID before they can wipe the phone. As a result, it cannot be wiped, and Find my iPhone can't be disabled until your Apple ID password is entered.\nUnless you updated to iOS 7 the day it was released and before your phone was stolen, which I think is highly unlikely, it is probably lost forever. \nIn summary, and as a direct answer, with iOS 6 or before, one could wipe the device and re-install iOS and thus destroy all tracking abilities of Find my iPhone.\n", "Q: How can I invert photo colors on iOS? I'm looking for a way to invert individual photo colors in iOS 7 to use as a background instead of inverting the entire phones color scheme. How can I do this?\n\nA: You can download the app Photoshop express (free) that has this feature. \n", "Q: How can I purchase Mountain Lion on a computer and install it on a different computer? I bought a used MacBook Pro 15″ with Lion and Windows dual boot. I accidentally dropped my Mac when it was on - everything was fine until I rebooted it and it got stuck on the grey screen, and I lost the dual boot so even Windows wouldn't start.\nI've searched on the web, and it tells me to restore it via the internet with ⌘ cmd+R.\nI did it, but it asked me to update to Mountain Lion, so when I hit ok it says that my Apple ID has not been used to purchase Mountain Lion.\nWhat can I do to purchase a new copy of Mountain Lion with my Apple ID? Can I use my other PC to purchase it with my ID, and after that download it when am in recovery?\n\nA: If you dropped your computer and it stopped booting right after that, you may now have a defective hard drive. I do not recommend attempting to re-install the operating system (Mountain Lion), as this may cause data loss.\nMy current recommendation is to confirm that you have a good backup of the data that is on your computer. If you do not have a backup, it may be necessary to attempt data recovery from the drive that is in the machine.\nIf you do have a current/valid backup of your data, I would recommend attempting to boot from another disk (CD/DVD, USB flash drive, etc.), and attempting to open Disk Utility to see if the software is reporting SMART failures with the drive. Alternately, very poor performance or clicking sounds while attempting to view/access the drive may be indicative of a defective drive.\nRegardless, at this point, a system re-install is not likely to help with your issues (based on the problem description). If you are at all concerned about data loss, or are hesitant to attempt diagnosis/troubleshooting of your machine, I would recommend taking the machine into an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Store for further assistance.\n\nA: The answer is yes you can, purchase Mountain Lion with your Apple ID on one computer then install it on another.\nEdit:\n\nThe above is only true if your second computer is a mac. If your second computer is a PC you have to purchase a Snow Leopard DVD from apple.  Install it via the DVD, then upgrade to Mountain lion.\n\nI would replace your harddrive before reinstallation of Mac OS X.  If you have a small set of screwdrivers the procedure is easy.\nThe replacement drive I would buy would be a 2.5\" non external powered HDD with a USB 3 enclosure. Open the enclosure, move the new drive to into your MBP, and your old drive into the enclosure.  Once you have installed Mac OS X 10.8 proceed to transfer the files you need from  your old drive, if it still works. If it does not you may want to try to repair it using disk utility, and try to extract the files again.\nAlternatively you could just buy a replacement drive here install the drive and then the OS. I have used this company before and their rates are ok. Or do a search on google and find a cheaper hard drive - up to you.\nBackups:\nThe other thing I would do is purchase a second external hard drive and set that up as a timemachine backup.\n", "Q: Disk Utility won't Unmount HD for formatting I have two internal drives in my 27\" iMac (10.8.5). An SSD system disk and a 1TB SATA drive.\nThe HDD has been acting up recently, very slow performance, bad behavior etc. Tech Tool Pro and Disk Utility don't seem to be able to fix the drive, so I decided to wipe the data by a reformat and writing zeros to the entire drive.\nEverytime I try and format, it tells me that the drive cannot be unmounted.

Is there a way in Terminal to do this instead?\n\nA: When a disk is first connected, macOS helpfully tries to run fsck on the volume. If the volume is large or has extensive problems, this process can run for a long time before it fails.\nThe following Terminal command should identify the process at fault:\nsudo lsof | grep diskn\n\nreplacing diskn with the number of the offending disk.\nOnce you have the process ID, you can kill it thus:\nsudo kill -9 pid\n\nreplacing pid with the process ID determined above.\nThen you can run diskutil normally, either from GUI or command line.\n\nA: You can force unmount a drive by running the following Terminal command:\ndiskutil unmountDisk force /Volumes/VOLUMENAME\n\nReplace VOLUMENAME with the name of a volume on the disk you are trying to unmount.\nFollowing this, attempt to Erase/Partition the drive again in Disk Utility. Using the above command can interrupt file read/writes, which can cause file corruption. However, since you are erasing the drive anyway, this doesn't really matter in your situation.\n\nA: Disable Spotlight for that Hard Drive (System Preferences)\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1454712?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: If you have a PC download transmac trial start in administrator mode plug your disk in via usb.

Otherwise use format and choose HFS+ plug the hard drive into your Mac again and it should format no problem.\nWorked for me this morning. Took about 5-10 minutes.\n\nA: You cannot erase a disk that you are booted on. There should be a Recovery Partition, a \"hidden\" Partition from which you can format the boot disk.

Is this normal? Whenever I wake up my 2012 Macbook Pro after it's been asleep for a few hours, the screen turns on, but it is unresponsive for about a minute.  During this time, the mouse cursor does not move at all whenever I touch the trackpad and the computer is unresponsive to the keyboard.  I also see the WiFi icon in the taskbar act as if it is searching for WiFi (the WiFi icon is gray, but each bar turns black consecutively from bottom to top repeatedly).  The computer is finally responsive after a minute or so and the WiFi icon stops searching.  \nIs this normal behavior for a Macbook Pro when waking?

I've configured one to automatically drop certain files in a folder on the other Mac. I've used an Automator script to do this, it logs in using a user name [copier] created for this purpose, and then copies the files.\nThis used to work reasonably well. Recently however the files are copied with the wrong permissions. The copy has read&write permissions for user [copier] and 'no access' for everyone else. It should have read&write access for everyone. The folder permissions do have read&write access for everyone, so that's not it.\nHow can I set the permissions of files that get copied into this folder? \n\nA: I'd recommend checking to see what the permissions on the source files are, to confirm that they are not set restrictively (i.e., no access for others.) It's possible that these permissions are being replicated on the share by the automator script.\nIf you need the enclosing folder to have more restrictive permissions, you can likely keep that setup (and use Automator to change permissions on the files before they're copied.) Although I'm not sure that Automator can modify file permissions, you can definitely use it to run a shell script (chmod 644 filename.txt?) on the files before they're copied to the server.\n", "Q: Can I replace my old model MBA battery with a 54-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery (12 hrs) for the newest model MBA?

I was able to extract my old hard drive from my old computer and load it onto my new laptop, it reads the drive fine and acknowledges there are 110GBs of files on it but when I click in the folders nothing appears and everything is 0 bytes. \nIs the problem the platform that each computer had, the old hd was OSX 10.6 and this one is Mountain Lion? Also, when I went to Disk Utility to try and Repair the disk it went through everything successfully but when it tried to unmount it at the end of the process it failed.  To Unmount it I had to Force Eject it, does any of this make sense? \n\nA: Perhaps its the way you're wording it, but it probably would have been easier to connect the laptops together in target disk mode (hold T when turning on the old macbook), assuming you have the correct cables.  It should then appear as an external drive on the new macbook.  \nAnyway, Mtn Lion should read the drive without issue as 10.6 uses the same native mac filesystem as 10.7 and 10.8 (journaled hfs).  Are you able to use terminal to list files?  Perhaps it's an issue with Finder taking forever to list the directory.  I would try Disk Utility again or run fsck -fy on the volume to force a filesystem check if you know that the old drive is in good working order.\n", "Q: Must there be notification alerts for anything to appear on lock screen?

I also delete pages be selecting the page thumbnail and pressing 'delete'.\nWhen PDFs are merged in this way, are they really merged into a single PDF or is the first PDF just acting as a container file for the second?  Likewise, are deleted pages really removed from the PDF or just 'commented' out in the rendering engine?\n\nA: Merged PDFs from Preview are perfectly valid and follow the standard. I've never found any incompatibilities with them.  It does merge it into a single PDF, and any pages that are deleted are removed from the file.  You can test this by checking file sizes first before merging, then after merging, then after deleting some pages.\nThe only drawback I've found with Preview is that the Apple code for writing PDFs seems to default to writing PDFs which are faster for Preview to render, but which are larger than typically put out by Acrobat.  (At the moment, I can't find the link that originally proposed this hypothesis... It's been a number of years.)  For example, you might open an Adobe-created PDF in Preview, immediately save it to another file, and notice that it has expanded.  This change in file size does not change the image quality in any way.\nIn general, the change in file size is not too much of a deal.  It's only in rare cases (such as 120MB scanned PDFs) that I worry about which app I use to create the PDF.\n\nA: The PDF format is designed to be a container for page objects which can be added, deleted or reordered very easily. \nBy very crude analogy, you can easily add another Paragraph to an HTML document by adding a set of <p> tags around some new text data. You can remove the paragraph by deleting the tags and text. You can re-order the paragraph by moving its order relative to other paragraphs.\nSo, dragging pages from one PDF document into another simply adds the Page object data from the source document to the destination document. So there is no difference between 'really merged' and 'acting as a container for more page data'. Page data is indexed, so the PDF document knows how many pages it contains and in what order they come.\nSimilarly, deleting a page removes that Page Object from the PDF data stream and re-indexes the pages. You can test this by deleting a page and checking the file size reduction.\nObviously, Apple tries to conform to the PDF specification (otherwise they wouldn't be PDFs, they would be 'Apple files'.) Any divergence is a bug. However, the same page information can be written in a variety of ways: different encoding structures, colorspaces, additional metadata, etc, so it's possible for Adobe's PDFs and Apple's PDFs (and others) to be different sizes and 'styles' within the PDF spec.\n", "Q: Mavericks to include better window management solution? Up until now, I have used a program called Stay to maintain my preferred location and sizing of all my apps.  My main use case is that I have two external displays that require me to rearrange my applications after unplugging the displays (which is quite common going to/fro meetings).\nSince Mavericks is supposed to enhance the support for multi monitor setups, I was wondering if this new support eliminates the need for a third party solution.\n\nA: Using Mavericks Mac OS X 10.9.1 here with 2 external monitors and the laptop display on a MBP late 2011. One is connected via the thunderbolt port and the 2nd one via a USB external adapter/card. Mavericks does not remember window position and sizing after unplugging my MBP from the two monitors and re-plugging it. Still have to use Stay. \n\nA: Yes, Mavericks will keep the window in the same location as when you unplug your external display.\nThe only exception is when you take one of those windows full screen, in which case it will not return to the original position when you exit full screen mode. The window would instead go to your currently active display.\n", "Q: how to cancel download of iOS7 on iPhone I started to download iOS7 from my iPhone 4, and then I read about lots of lag and battery issues. I'd love to try iOS7 but since I won't be able downgrade to iOS6 I'd like to cancel the download. The problem is I don't know how.\nI've only been able to stop the download by disabling Wi-Fi.\nHow can I cancel the download of iOS7? Am I doomed to never be able to use Wi-Fi again?\n\nA: You can probably back up your iPhone with iTunes and then restore that backup, and that should cancel the update.\nRestore Back Up and not Restore iPhone\n**There is another way too, which just worked for me: your iPhone can't install the update if it doesn't have the free space available, and this is a pretty big update.  You can simply copy a bunch of large files to your iPhone (e.g., lots of music or audiobooks) and the update will stop and you will get a message saying that the download cannot finish installing due to lack of space.  This essentially stops the update (and then you can go back in and immediately remove the big files that you moved on there).  \n", "Q: Vmware Fusion, how to remove suspend option completely I have good number of virtual XP and W7 machines on our domain, one thing always cause problems when multiple users are using the same machine.

Mousedown behaves like single click On my macbook, with a mouse plugged in (Microsoft Intellimouse Optical), a single click will sometimes behave like a double click, or pressing the mouse button but not releasing it will behave like a click.  This behavior is sporadic.  Sometimes it will happen with every click for a few clicks.  Sometimes it will be every other click.  Sometimes it behaves normally for a while.\nI've been using this mouse with my macbook for weeks without incident until a couple of days ago.  This only happens at home.  I have an identical mouse at work that does not give me any trouble.  I'll work at home with my mouse behaving badly, go to work and have no issues, then come home and the mouse behaves badly again.  At work, my mouse is plugged into a USB hub.  At home, it's plugged directly into the usb port.  I've tried swapping USB ports, but the behavior did not change.  I've tried rebooting.  That didn't help either.\nHow should I further troubleshoot and resolve this issue?\n\nA: The misbehaving mouse is surely having hardware issues. This behaviour is very likely not caused by software.

I have alarms set up in my iOS Clock app, with both \"Vibrate on silent\" and \"Vibrate on ring\" switches set to ON in the Settings app. For the last several months I've been relying on a silent audio file to create a vibrate-only alarm to wake me up. But this morning, it seemed to stop working — the alarm went off, but made no sound and did not vibrate. Only the screen lit up like usual.\nI've tried deleting and re-creating the alarms, un-toggling and re-toggling the vibrate switches in Settings, trying alarms using the built-in ringtones, and rebooting the device, and nothing seems to make alarms vibrate again.

I have installed a third party SSD in my Mac. I have used it quite a while before I enabled TRIM. \nDoes that mean that the SSD cannot reuse any files I have deleted until now? Is it necessary to somehow delete the free space of the disk to tell the disk via TRIM that this is really free space now?\n\nA: If this is not your system disk, you should kick off a disk repair which will trim unused blocks. Otherwise, boot in single user mode (hold ⌘+S during startup) and issue the command:\nfsck -fy. Be aware this will not work from rescue systems, as they do not have trimforce enabled, while booting to the single user mode acknowledges trimforce.\n\nA: Once you enabled trim, the drive is now better capable to self manage storage without needing any special help.\nYou could kick start the process by making a backup of the drive (just in case the filesystem has corruption) any then boot into Recovery HD and use Disk Utility to repair the drive once (which is functionally equivalent to huy's answer). That intentionally trims all unused blocks when the filesystem is otherwise idle. \nI would avoid any attempt to overwrite free space since that just adds more needless writes to the drive. If you feel that's needed, a total erase and reinstall from backup might faster in the end. \nYou are correct that the first immediate delete operations could leave you with free blocks scattered about non-continuously, but writing a gigabyte or two temporary file and deleting it should get enough free trimmed blocks to make an immediate speed up and the rest of the speed will come after garbage collection cleans up after routine file changes and deletes pass through trim status. \n", "Q: Automatically move files to a parent folder + delete subfolder I'm trying to figure out how to automatically move files from a folder to its parent folder and delete the original folder.

Is it possible with either Hazel or Automator or both?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The following solution will move all (and only) \".avi\" files within subfolders (one level deep) to the parent folder and delete the subfolders. It may not be the most optimal solution since there are many different ways in which shell scripts can be written to solve a problem.\nAssumptions and restrictions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Only \".avi\" files will be moved. Other files will be ignored and deleted without warning.\n\n*The (updated) script works only three levels below the parent folder. If there are subfolders within the subfolders containing \".avi\" files, they will be deleted like any other file (including those \".avi\" files).\n\n*This script can handle \".avi\" files that have spaces in the filename.\n\n\nCaution:\nThis uses a shell script that moves files and deletes directories/files completely.

The moment I log in, the memory spikes up.\nAny idea what the hell is happening? Please help.\n\nA: First of all: High Memory-Usage is not a bad thing in itself - the goal is to have a performant system and it can accomplish that by using RAM. \nThat you Mac slows down is more likely a problem that a process or an App is hogging Memory and not correctly releasing it, forcing the system to use Swap-Memory (on your Harddrive) and thereby slowing your system down, but that is just one possible scenario.\nI think it is necessary to differentiate that because i think you are looking at the wrong place for your problem. \nOther Possibilities could be wrong File Permissions, I/O errors of your Harddrive or SSD, timout issues for some process or App (Google Drive, Dropbox etc), corrupted chaches or swap files. \nYou should:\n\n\n*\n\n*check the CPU-Usage in the 'Activity Monitor.app' Is there a Process/App that is using up your CPU and slowing your system?\n\n*Check the 'Console.app' in /Applications/Utilities/ for errors and post them here.

If you need to do this often and would like to make it faster at some monetary cost as well as loss of convenience, your options are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Get a Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter\n\n*\n\n*Connect the devices like so: USB drive <-> Time Capsule <-> MacBook Air.\n\n*Connect the MacBook Air to one Time Capsule on its Gigabit ethernet port via this adapter.\n\n*Connect an external USB drive to the same Time Capsule, then transfer files to it from the Time Capsule (this would get you a higher data transfer speed, depending on the external drive and your ethernet cable).\n\n*Disconnect the USB drive from the Time Capsule, connect it to the second Time Capsule (switch the MacBook Air to the other one too over Thunderbolt<->ethernet) and copy files to it.\n\n\n\nOR  \n\n\n*\n\n*Get a Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and a USB Ethernet Adapter\n\n*\n\n*Connect the devices like so: Time Capsule 1 <-> MacBook Air <-> Time Capsule 2.\n\n*Connect the MacBook Air to one Time Capsule with the USB<->ethernet adapter and to the other Time Capsule with the Thunderbolt<->ethernet adapter.\n\n*Copy files from one Time Capsule to the other (just like how you're doing now).\n\n*The speed will vary depending on the direction of data transfer as well as network conditions and the number of files.\n\n\n\nA: No there isn't and worse, the file transfer rate on a Time Capsule is significantly slower than even a 5 year old computer due to the limited power of the controller in the base station.\nYou could connect a USB drive and export the files over USB, but that still doesn't load the files on the new device and is also slower than most would like.\nThe last time I copied more than 500 GB off a Time Capsule, it took most of the weekend via USB. My files were lots of small files as it was a Time Machine backup so perhaps you'll see faster transfer if the files are music, video or not lots of small files.\n", "Q: Mac OS X UNIX-oriented Tutorial Is there any Mac OS X tutorial/book that covers the UNIX part of this operating system?

Requires iOS 7 on AirPlay device.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4448?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: Found this unofficial item:\n\nToday’s update also brought AirPlay From iCloud, which lets guests\n  stream their purchased music, photos, and videos stored in iCloud to\n  another person’s Apple TV. If you bought World War Z on iTunes, you\n  can now go to a friend’s house with an Apple TV and watch it there\n  without having to log into their Home Sharing account or store it on\n  your phone. It’s all streamed from iCloud.\n\nSo, I guess you browse the iTunes store (or maybe the Videos app) on your phone, select something you bought, tell it to start playing, and then AirPlay it over to your friend's ATV.  Or your own ATV, I guess, although it would seem easier to play it on your own ATV using the ATV menu itself.\n\nA: I think I figured it out. If the video exists on the iTunes store and you have AirPlay from iCloud enabled on your Apple TV via the settings app then once you start playing a video from your iOS device and send it to your Apple TV via Airplay you will see a rectangle with the video description on the top half of the tv like you are playing a video directly off the Apple TV. You can tell for sure it is playing via iCloud by hitting the home button. If the video continues to play then it is playing via 'AirPlay From iCloud'. Otherwise the video would stop playing. \n", "Q: Is there any place to download Apple Configurator 1.3? I would like to use Apple Configurator for our Store iPads, but I can't upgrade my iMac to 10.8 (min. Requirement for AC 1.4) right now.\nWhere can I get 1.3 or any other version that I could install on 10.7.5?\n\nA: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ldzpp9ajy7y82k/Apple%20Configurator%201.2.1.zip\nI found it on https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com\nHope it will work.\n\nA: Look on reddit, you can find some old apple configurator download links. Here is Apple Configurator 2.2 beta 3 DMG. Apparently, CNET hosts some apple configurator downloads too  https://download.cnet.com/archive/3000-2651_4-12222355.html.\n", "Q: Printing in black and white without intermediate greys I'd like to routinely print using only black ink when colour isn't important, because I have a whole lot more black ink than colour ink. I have a Canon printer and I have selected the 'Black & White' option from the print dialogue, but the result is that it prints in grey-scale, and the greys are rendered using the colour inks.\nTo prove this I scanned a printout at 600dpi and got the following in what looked like a light-grey part of the page:\n\nI suspect that if I can convert the image to pure black and white with dithering (no grey) then the printer might then use only the black ink.  How can I do this easily from any application?  Or, how else might I configure my printer to print using only black ink?\nI think there used to be filter options available in earlier versions of OS-X, which might have included something which would do this, but I don't see those anymore.\n\nupdate: experimenting with Frizlab's suggestion to use the black and white Quartz filter in Preview's PDF save dialogue, I quickly realised that I was still going to have a problem with images.  Even after these become black and white bitmaps, they'll still need to be scaled to the print resolution.\nAs anticipated, this results in the black-and-white image being scaled with smoothing, resulting in intermediate greys which the printer renders in colour ink.  In fact, on printing my perfectly black and white test page my yellow ink lever dropped by another bar.\nI also found that even perfectly black text has colour fringes on it.  I thought this might be a result of the medium-quality print setting (perhaps scaling was involved), so I printed again in high quality:\n \nEven the high-quality image on the right shows a few of coloured spots (eg., top right edge), and I wonder if the difference is simply that the black has over-printed the coloured ink more thoroughly in the high-quality case.\nI thought those colour spots might be aliasing or encoding artefacts, so I scanned a laser-printed page and found no such issues.\nRemember that I'm not being picky about how this looks.  I just don't want to waste money replacing all my colour ink all the time while the black cartridge still has plenty of usable ink.\nAfter this investigation, I think what I need is:\n\n\n*\n\n*a dithering conversion, so that low-contrast text and images are visible\n\n*a conversion which matches the printer resolution exactly so that there is no scaling\n\n*to use the high-quality print setting\n\n\nOr I need an alternative printer driver or printer firmware.\n\nA: To convert easily any image in Black & White (no gray):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file in Preview\n\n*Choose \"Save As…\" (Visible in the File menu, while holding the Alt key in Mountain Lion)\n\n*In the save dialog, choose the PDF file format\n\n*Still in the dialog, apply Quartz filter: \"Black & White\"\n\n\n\nEDIT: You can convert to black & white with dithering using The Gimp (free & open-source):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the image using The Gimp\n\n*Select menu item Image -> Mode -> Indexed…\n\n*On the window that opens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the Black & White palette\n\n*Select a dithering mode (I chose Floyd-Steinberg)\n\n\n\nYou can also use Photoshop using the same technique. However, Photoshop is expensive.\nFinally, command-line solutions exist: convert (part of the imagemagick package), or gm (part of the graphicsmagick package).\n", "Q: how reduce the size of all photos in my iPhoto library? My iPhoto libary is 58 Gigs.  They are all snapshots, nothing professional.  Most of the photos were taken at 12megapixels because that's the default setting on the camera.\nI'm sure they will all look fine if they were reduced to 5megapixels.\nIs there a way in iPhoto to reduce the size of all photos in the Library to smaller?\n\nA: Before you take this (drastic) step, consider a couple of things. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the trash in iPhoto has been emptied -- not everyone realises this needs to be done, and it can take gigs of space.\n\n*iPhoto creates a duplicate image when it rotates an image, and the original is not required. I'm not sure if there's an easy manual way to remove these, but I use CleanMyMac (http://macpaw.com/cleanmymac). It has a free trial and it will save a large amount of space. \n\n*If you're worried about performance due to the size of the library, consider splitting it up helped me. I got to about 60gb, and it was very slow, so I used iPhoto Library Manager (http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/) to split it (I split into 1 library per year)\n\n\nA: Mac's built-in Automator can reduce image sizes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator (inside /Applications).\n\n*Choose Application as the document type.\n\n*Click \"Photos\" in the Left Column.\n\n*Drag \"Scale images\" into the Actions Area.\n\n*Click Add.\n\n*Choose Scale image \"By Percentage.\"\n\n*Choose 50%.\n\n*Click Run.\n\n*Click OK.\n\n*Click Save in the Automator File Menu.\n\n*Name it image resize 50%.app. It saves to Applications Folder.\n\n*Double-Click the icon in Applications.\n\n*Right-Click the app in the dock and select Keep in Dock.\n\n*Now, any image you drag onto this Dock icon will Duplicate and Reduce image Size by 50% (so 12 MegaPixels will become 6 MegaPixels).\n\n\n\nConsider storing your photos on an external hard drive or USB flash drive of proper capacity. You can also ignore iPhoto, and store all your images in the \"Photos\" folder. Use Image Capture to import new images from your Camera or Camera's Memory Card.\nAlso, when taking photos in your 12 megapixel camera, go in the Settings menu on there and change the capture size to a lower megapixel Size. If you have a large memory card, you can take the same photo in several different sizes.\n", "Q: Spotlight, please don't show mail, but still let me search in Mail app When I search for stuff, even constraining with name:whatIwant, the majority of results are old e-mail messages and Safari history items.\nHow can I get rid of these results, but still search my email from within the  Mail program? I have already added the History folder from Safari to the Privacy tab and put the Mail app in there too, but the results still show.\nI am using Mountain Lion at the moment.\nEDIT: It turns out I already had Messages and Web history un-selected in my Search Results tab (see second screengrab below), but I am still seeing the results from Web pages and from current (not just archived) Mail messages.\n\nMy Spotlight privacy tab:\n\nMy Spotlight check boxes...\n\nSome results from my search window:\n\n\nA: In System Preferences -> Spotlight, go to the Search Results tab, and uncheck Messages and Chats.  \nThis will still allow you to index and search from within Mail, but the results will not show up when searching via Spotlight.\n\nA: You can add ~/Library/Mail/ to the privacy tab, but it also prevents you from searching for messages in Mail.\nIf you can consider using Alfred instead, it doesn't include mail messages in the default search results, and it can be configured to not show mail messages even when you use the open or find actions.\n\nA: *\n\n*Start Spotlight (by default ⌘ cmd+space) and search for any term, then select Spotlight Preferences… at the bottom of the list.\n\nAlternatively, open System Preferences and select the Spotlight pane.\n\n\n*Uncheck \"Messages & Chats\" and close System Preferences.\n\nA: I have struggled with this also (telling spotlight NOT to search in mail etc.)...\nThe best solution for me so far has been to get in the habit of writing:\n-kind:mail\n\nat the end of every search I make in spotlight.\nI will admit this isn't a GREAT solution - but it works (and you could probably set a keyboard shortcut to type it for you if you wanted).\n\nA: For me the issue was that my email account was set to automatically download all attachments.

This is set up with 2 email accounts (gmail and ISP default).\nI want to use the \"Contact Us\" option on one of my apps, but this offers me the options of using either of the mail logon email addresses.\nI NEVER use either of these, and don't disclose these to anyone (so I can easily change when they get too much spam).\nMy question is how do I get the iPad to use the email aliases I have set up on gmail.\n\nA: Try this in iOS 7: This works when you have an authenticated alias set up as your default in Gmail.\nSettings → Mail, Contacts, Calendars → Add Account → Other\nOn \"Account\" Page:\n\n\n*\n\n*Email: you@personaldomain.com\n\n*Password: Your personal domain password\n\n*Incoming Server: imap.gmail.com\n\n*Username: Your Gmail username\n\n*Password: Your Gmail password\n\n*Outgoing Server: pop.gmail.com\n\n*Username: Your Gmail username\n\n*Password: Your Gmail password\n\n\nA: You can set your email up using IMAP. This lets you specify the email address (the alias you want to use) as well as the authenticating account (your actual email address and password).\nGo to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account > Other > Add Mail Account. Then enter the email address you want to use. When you click Next, the next screen allows you to specify the username (your actual email address) and password.\n\nA: It requires some cheating if you want to have multiple From addresses available for a single account. http://emmanuelbernard.com/blog/2013/03/24/multiple-email-aliases-in-ios/\n\nA: Using IMAP instead of the Gmail configurator is the best current solution, at least for iOS 7. See this nice blog post, courtesy of Nathan Jones, that provides a detailed solution with screenshots.\nFrom Nathan's blog post (step 12):\n\nTouch Add Another Email… to add as many e-mails as you want. (Remember\n  these have to be preauthorized by Google.)\n\nOnce you've added all of the aliases that you've already set up in Gmail, the aliases can be used in iOS to send or reply to emails.\n", "Q: How to let MacBook Pro recognize my external hard drive as internal hard drive? I'd like to install Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro, but as the internal hard drive cable is not working, I'm using it with an external hard drive plugged in which OS X is installed on.\nWhen I try to install Windows 7 it says that I have to have an internal hard drive to install it. So I'm just wondering if there is a way that can make my laptop think that the external hard drive is an internal so I could install Windows, or is there any other way to install Windows?\nI don't want to install Windows in a Virtual Machine.\n\nA: You should be able to do this with dd by setting Removable to False.\nUnmount your disk, then run…\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=1 count=1\n\nDon't forget to replace disk2 with the actual disk identifier. This command will erase the contents of the disk. Untested, be careful, usual 'not responsible if stuff goes wrong' applies :)\n\nA: Using Mac OS X's built-in Boot Camp Assistant (in Applications, Utilities Folder) you can install Windows 7. After install, when you turn-on your Mac, hold the Option Key to Boot into Windows. This method runs the Operating System off it's own Partition of the internal Macintosh Hard Drive. When you boot into it, Windows will be Full-Screen, and \"running natively.\"\n-or-\nAn alternative is to Run Windows INSIDE Mac OS X using a Free program called \"VirtualBox.\" This way, VirtualBox will be in your Dock on the OS X side. You will launch it, and run Windows 7 (or any Operating System) Virtually. Please note, this will be slower, and will need certain Drivers. There may be limited Functionality running Windows inside VirtualBox, instead of natively inside Boot Camp. And it lacks some of the Hardware Features available to a Native Operating System.\nIf there is a \"problem\" with your MacBookPro's Hard Drive, I would consider getting a NEW Solid-State Drive (of say, 128 GB). This can be purchased for around $100-$125. A few benefits: your Operating System and Programs will boot/launch Faster.\nIt may also be a good idea to move all of your Media to the External Hard Drive (noting that they will only be available when the External HD is plugged-in via USB. Go to iTunes and in Preferences tell iTunes to use the External Hard Drive for Storage.\nCheck your MacBookPro Model Number on Wikipedia (search MacBookPro). Make sure to Upgrade your RAM to Maximum Capacity. Then, Download whatever version of Mac OS X is the latest that machine will run. After Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8, the Mac App Store is Available. That means all versions of Mac OS X after 10.6.8 can be easily downloaded via the Mac App Store onto a New Hard Drive.\nSo, basically: \n1. Purchase the latest version of Mac OS X your MacBookPro will run for $20 in the Mac App Store (let's say Mountain Lion, or Mavericks on Tuesday October 22nd)\n2. Purchase an SSD (Solid-State Drive) for around $100 at 128 GB\n3. Plug the SSD into the Mac's USB Port.\n4. Go in Disk Utility.\n5. install OS X onto the SSD using Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\n6. Turn-off the MBP (afterwards)\n7. Flip the MBP over and open the botttom.\n8. install the New SSD that you just installed Mac OS X onto.\n9. Turn-on the Computer.\n10. Run Boot Camp.\n11. install Windows 7 onto it's own Partition, using Disk Utility again.\n12. After install, boot into Windows by holding the Option Key after hitting the Power Button to turn the Laptop on (hold it down for a few seconds).\n13. Install all the Microsoft Updates and Drivers for your Printer and Peripheral Devices.\n14. ReStart into Windows.\n15. After all this is done, any time you turn-on your Computer, you choose which OS to boot into. You can even choose a Default in Mac System Preferences, System, StartUp Disk.\n", "Q: iPad 32 GB, running iOS 7.0.2. Unable to run Reset to Factory to restore Restrictions Password I seem to have quite a problem - which is caused by the lack of possibility to restore/reset the restrictions password (could e.g. be done through SMS like other services do).\nThe problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restrictions was enabled quite a while ago on the iPad.\n\n*The restrictions PIN is lost.\n\n*\"Find my iPad\" is enabled.\n\n*I go to iTunes to reset to factory, but it tells me I have to turn off Find my iPad first.\n\n*I go to Privacy + location settings on the iPad, but the Find my iPad setting is grayed out (likely due to Restrictions being enabled?).\n\n\nSeems to me like I have a catch 22 situation going on. I cannot reset my iPad because Find My iPad is enabled, and I cannot remove Find my iPad without resetting the iPad to get rid of Restrictions.\n\nA: First sign in to https://icloud.com/find and see if you can remotely erase and then remove that device from the list of your controlled devices. That will quickly return the device to factory settings at the cost of having to set up the device again from a backup or from new.\nIf the device isn't connected to the internet, you may have to force the erase as follows by putting your device into Recovery mode to allow iTunes to restore the device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the device by holding the Power button and sliding to power off.\n\n*Hold the Home button whilst connecting the device to your computer using the USB cable.\n\n*iTunes should detect a device in recovery mode.\n\n*Click the Restore button to restore the device.\nOnce the device has been restored, you can go through the setup process, logging in with your Apple ID to disable Find my iPhone, and restoring from backup if you wish.\nThis and several items related to activation lock are covered in Apple FAQ and articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5818\n\nA: Connect to iTunes & backup, leave iTunes running & the iPad connected.

Each one has a different folder structure and fileset. I now have a massive NAS that I want to consolidate all my data onto. I've created a new folder structure on the NAS and have moved over most of my data.\nDoes anyone know of a tool that could index my NAS and then compare any other hard drive, folder, or other media and list what folders/files are not on the NAS.\nI believe I could write a script that would md5/sha1 each file on the NAS and put that data into a database. Then the script could compare using those hashes and list differences. I'm hoping for a better solution if one exists.\n\nA: To close out this question, I didn't really find anything out there already.\nI ended up writing a python script that read all the files on the drive and saved an MD5 hash of each one in a database.\nThen I created another script that would read the contents of the drive to compare and lookup the MD5 in the database to see if the file already existed. It's not perfect, but it worked.\n\nA: It is possible to transfer photos say in 20-100 GB chunks at a time to an SD card or a USB flash card and use Dropbox uploader to scan the thumb drive and upload only the new files automatically to Dropbox.  Once the unique files are uploaded to Dropbox, it is possible to download them all to a new hard drive.  This was even if you dont use Dropbox regularly, you can use them for a few days or weeks just to get the job done.  It is also possible to write scripts in unix shell, Ruby, PHP or Python to create a database and transfer the unique files which you seem to have done.  The dropbox solution is for the layman.

I use the Dropbox app on iOS to sync my camera roll to my PC through the cloud.\nWhat do I need to do to push the edited photo to my PC?\n\nA: Try emailing the photos to yourself.\nWhen you edit photos, iOS doesn't actually modify the JPG file. Instead, it saves an XML file with the same name that contains information about what edits were made—that's why edits \"disappear\" when you copy the JPG. They were never there in the first place.\n\nA: Photos shared from the Dropbox app have their filters and corrections fully applied (at least as of iOS 7.1.1 and Dropbox 3.1.2).\n\nA: I know a solution.

SMART status seems ok although AHT reported 4hdd/11/40000000 SATA (0,0) which is the code for disk failure AFAIK. Normal boot fails, Firewire target disk mode works, however after a certain amount of disk access the drive stops responding - for example in the middle of a large file transfer it never get beyond a certain point.  After this folder listing stops working and all I can do is reboot the iMac.\nI have read similar questions that suggest using Ddrescue. However the behaviour of my drive is that it doesn't report failure, it just never finishes. Will Ddrescue cope with this? \nUpdate: I've made the question title less specific so hopefully more people find this thread - be sure to check all comments below for some useful tips.\n\nA: Since you're having problems with the drive after using it for a while, no tool may be of help completely. Depending on what's actually failing on the drive, trying to re-read the same sections for a long time could possibly aggravate and expand the problem to other areas. So I would not recommend ddrescue as the first option.\nSince there may not be a single solution that is guaranteed to work for this case, I would suggest a combination of different approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to copy small sections at a time (starting with the most valuable data, leaving aside OS, Applications and Application Preferences that can be redone later with some time on hand) and give it some rest in between.\n\n*Try the freezer trick to see if it helps\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Remove the hard drive from the computer.\n  \n*Place the hard drive inside of a zip top freezer bag. (don't buy a\n  cheap bag.)\n  \n*Place the wrapped hard drive inside of ANOTHER zip top freezer bag.\n  (yes, you need to do this)\n  \n*Place the double wrapped hard drive in the coldest part of your\n  freezer.\n  \n*Leave the hard drive in the freezer for 12 hours at least. You want\n  it good and cold! (see figure 2 below)\n  \n*Once very chilled, install the hard drive in your computer and\n  start pulling off data. Begin with the most valuable data.\n  \n*At some point, the hard drive will fail again. When it does, mark\n  the last successfully copied data, pull out the hard drive, double wrap\n  it again and stick it in the Chill Chest for another 12 hours.\n  You may need to do this a number of times to get all the data you\n  want, or until the hard drive stops working completely.\n  \n\n\n*For any data that you are able to copy out, do a quick verification and back it up elsewhere. You can never have too many backups!\n\n*Depending on the drive's manufacturer, download the hard drive test tool from the manufacturer's site, install it on a USB thumb drive and run it. This may help in detecting the actual issue better while at the same time marking bad sectors so that they're hidden (the latter is possible without these tools as well).\n\n*As a final measure, use ddrescue to see what you can recover before throwing or recycling the drive.\nIn the future, ensure you regularly use Time Machine in conjunction with a disk cloning utility (Clonezilla, Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper!)\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove all installed terminal applications and extensions back to native without doing a clean OSX install? Basically I would like to know if it is possible to remove all php, apache, homebrew, mac ports etc. installs back to native without doing a clean install of the OS?\nIf not is the best way to go about having a mac in this state to do a clean install and then revert some of the folders back using time machine i.e. the applications folders, documents etc?\n\nA: Firstly, you should be sure why you would like to do this and what a fresh environment would provide. This is going to be a bit tedious to do since you have multiple sources for the installs.\n\n\n*\n\n*For homebrew, follow the steps in this answer to uninstall homebrew.\n\n*For MacPorts, follow the steps from the uninstall MacPorts page page.\n\n*For PHP and Apache, it may not be simple to revert them to what the OS came with if you installed these outside of solutions like homebrew, MacPorts, MAMP or XAMPP.\n\n\nThe non-tedious way, which may take longer to complete, is to\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone your drive (using a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! or Clonezilla).\n\n*Reinstall the OS afresh.\n\n*Then use Migration Assistant to bring everything over from the clone. You would have to uncheck the \"Other files and folders on ...\" option in Migration Assistant to prevent it from bringing back the locations that homebrew, MacPorts, etc., use. This method would also skip many files (like in /Users/Shared) that you would have to copy over manually from the backup.\n\n\nA: If you have a need to this in the future you need to plan ahead. (I do this for having a clean machine to make builds on)\nThe basic step is to create a backup of a machine without these installs and save that backup. Then you can reinstall from this backup (I do this into a virtual machine) and then apply Apple and other software updates.)\nThe you can add the software you will want to remove.\n", "Q: Ways for developing an in house app (just for members of an enterprise) I wanna develop a private app for just some members of a small enterprise.

Is there a way for me to use a virtual machine (VirtualBox) on my MacBook Air with encryption protection? I want to install a VM of Ubuntu, and if my employer calls back the hardware I don't want them to be able to access what's on there…\n\nA: Yes. You can put the VM in an encrypted sparse bundle. This way, the virtual machine can only be run if the image is mounted, and that requires a password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility (found in /Applications/Utilities/).\n\n*Select File → New → Disk Image from Folder… or press ⌘ cmd+⇧ shift+N.\n\n*Select the folder that contains your virtual machine and press Image.\n\n*Choose sparsebundle as the Image Format, and choose the level of encryption you require.\n\n\n*Choose a password to encrypt the image. Make sure to uncheck the Remember password in my Keychain box if you believe that they could access your Keychain.\n\n*Click OK. Disk Utility will create a sparse bundle to hold the VM.\nThe sparse bundle should auto-mount (and request for your password if you didn't store it in your Keychain) when you try to perform any action that would require access to your VM.\n\nA: While grgarside's procedure is spot on, you may not see sparsebundle as an available Image Format, as can be seen in here...  (as i recently experienced)  \n\nIn this case, it is likely that you will need to enable Disk Utility's advanced image options via the following terminal command.\ndefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility advanced-image-options 1\n\nUpon retrying grgarside's procedure, you will see more format options be made available, including the desired sparsebundle.\n\n\nA: VirtualBox 5 now has the ability to encrypt VMs directly, so maybe the sparsebundle approach is moot in the narrow case, but still very reasonable in the widest cases.\n", "Q: PDF from pdfLaTeX doesn't print correctly I am trying to print a PDF file generated with pdfLaTeX, but the OS X (10.8) CUPS always shifts and scales the content of the page, without me having any chance to change that behavior.\nTo reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create PDF using pdfLaTeX\npdflatex testpage\n\n\n*Choose paper size and/or double sided\n\n*Open document\nopen testpage.pdf\n\nEverything looks as expected in the Preview application, but when I select \"Print\", even when setting the scale to 100%, the margins are different on all sides, the print size is wrong and shifted.

Is there any simple way to update such packages using homebrew-cask? \nAnd if I call brew cask install dropbox again, it shows there already exist some cache of old version, which I feel so dumb.\n\nA: Try this command:\nbrew cask install dropbox --force\n\nPlease consider logging a bug over at homebrew-cask about your concerns with updating this kind of cask.\n\nA: As of today brew cask does not implement upgrade but there is an open issue that tracks this at https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/4678\nIf you want to see it implemented sooner you could add your small contribution by fixing one of the todo items listed there.\n\nA: This has really irked me so I created this script to update all Brew apps and allow the user to choose which Cask apps to update. You can exclude apps from consideration too.\nhttps://github.com/derrekyoung/ScriptsAndUtils/blob/master/brew-cask-upgrade.sh\n\nA: brew upgrade --cask dropbox\n\nI find this to be the most convenient way of upgrading a specific app using brew.\n", "Q: Late 2012 Imac 27'' constant beach ball loading and slow downs I just bought myself an iMac 27'' late 2012 model.\n\nI am constantly getting beach balls and the computer slows to a crawl taking anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute to get back to regular speeds.\nMy normal programs are:\nRubymine\nParallels Desktop\nChrome\nSkype\nI've used a laptop with less specs than this iMac and it never had these terrible hiccups. What can I do verify what is causing the issue?\n8GB is more than enough for what I'm using - is it just the Apple-tax that requires me to have even more ram?\n\nA: It might help to examine how the machine's resource usage looks inside of Activity Monitor...Are the CPU cores maxed out? How about RAM usage - is there any green showing in the pie chart? Lastly - is the Disk Activity tab showing excessive write rates constantly occurring? \nDoes the performance of the machine increase when you quit out of particular applications (namely Parallels?)\nA defective hard drive could cause slowness, but this may be accompanied by other symptoms (crashing, audible clicking, logging of I/O errors). It may be prudent to run the Apple Hardware Test just to confirm tht the hardware is in good shape.\n\nA: It's always fun to trace slowdowns. First thing I like to do is regular 6-month maintenance: reset NVRAM and PRAM, repair disk permissions, and reset SMC parameters. \nI really like Avast for virus and malware checking on the Mac. \nChrome is notorious for chewing up processing. If you are running 10.9 or later, Safari is a much better choice. For 10.8, it's a good choice. \nParallels, I assume you are running Windows on a VM? Quit Parallels after all the above, and see if that does it. Check with Activity Monitor to see how much RAM is in use, maybe you need more. I think the max on that unit was 16GB. \n\nA: There are 3 main possible causes for your issue. When experimenting described slow downs, follow these steps:\n1 - RAM: Go to Activity Monitor > Memory. Look at the graphic at the bottom of the window, it is called \"memory pressure\". It will show you if everything is ok (green), not so much (yellow), or if it is out of memory and it is swapping (red). 8GB should be enough for most users, though.\n2 - CPU: Go to Activity Monitor > CPU. Check the graphic at the bottom of your screen. You can easily find if an App is consuming too many resources.\n3 - i/o bottleneck. This is harder to troubleshoot, but it is the most likely to happen. If your iMac does not have an SSD / Fusion Drive, your OS X is running on an old HDD that can be producing the slow downs. Sometimes, when mechanical drives are about to fail, they run even slower, causing symptoms like the one you've described.\nYou can test your HDD speed using: Black Magic Speed test:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12\nReference speeds (read):\n\n\n*\n\n*Mechanical 5400 RPM HDD: ~ 60 MB/s\n\n*Mechanical 7400 RPM HDD: 90-180 MB/s\n\n*Low-end SSD: ~220 MB/s\n\n*Mid-High-end SSD: ~700 MB/s\n\n*Latest MacBook Pro (2015) SSD (M.2 SSD): ~1300 MB/s\n\n\nA: You may have malware using up resources. Clean it up with Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac (formerly known as AdwareMedic). You download their free app and clean things up. Here is the link:\nhttp://www.adwaremedic.com/index.php\nThe program will identify malware and optionally remove it (you should almost certainly remove it). \nMalwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac is entirely free and I have no affiliation with the developers. It is simply the best tool for this job.\n\nA: I would encourage you to download etrecheck:\nhttp://www.etresoft.com/etrecheck\nThen in Etrecheck, you will see\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/extensions from 3rd parties\n\n*Startup items from 3rd parties\n\n*Startup daemons from 3rd parties\n\n*Internet plugins from 3rd parties\n\n*Preference panes from 3rd parties\n\n\nUsually, Some pieces of programs can interfere with the Mac OS. In my case, in 100% of cases, issues are related to 3rd parties (non-Apple)\n", "Q: How do you take a Verizon iPhone 4 CDMA phone and get it connected to Straight Talk? I purchased a nice black Verizon iPhone 4 (CDMA) which has it's contract fulfilled. \nWhat steps do I go through to get it connected to Walmart's Straight Talk on the Verizon towers?\n\nA: The iPhone 4 built for Verizon's network is a CDMA-only device that is not capable of operating on a GSM network that requires a SIM card, such as StraightTalk (which uses T-Mobile's network). It will never work. It does not have the radios built into it that would be necessary.\n", "Q: Mavericks downgrade to Mountain Lion - alert cannot be installed on this computer I purchased a second hand iMac with Mavericks Developer installed already, seen as I am not a developer and other things don't work, I purchased a copy of Mountain Lion but when tring to run the installer it gives me this message\n\"alert mac os x 10.7 cannot be installed on this computer\"\nI want to keep all user profiles and software intact so I don't want to wipe the hard drive (although many other posts say when you get that message wiping the hard drive still doesn't solve it) \nany ideas?\n\nA: Verify that your iMac can run the older version of Mac OS X. You can see what versions can be run by searching for your specific model of iMac at EveryMac\nSometimes I have seen that even if a Mac was shipped with an older version of Mac OS it is difficult to downgrade due to firmware upgrades that make the system incompatible with older releases. I haven't personally experienced this sort of issue in maybe 10 years. \n\nA: You can't exaclty \"downgrade\". \nYou habe to create a bootable drive with your installer, boot from that drive, reformat your internal (backup first!) and then install 10.7\nMake sure your computer supports it first. \n\nA: In my opinion some more infos would be great to help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*What do you mean with \"Mavericks Developer installed already\"? Does it mean it is a beta Mavericks installation only available for developers? Or do you mean XCode is installed?\n\n*Why do you want to downgrade to 10.7?\n\n*\"and other things don't work\": what is not working? I do not see the connection.\n\n*Why do you want \"to keep all user profiles and software intact\"? You bought a second hand iMac, and I would expect that you would like to reset it.\n\n\nA little hint for users who sell their computer: you should re-install the Mac system and remove all data before selling you computer!\n", "Q: How to extract all pages of a PDF into individual PDF documents I want to be able to extract each sheet of a PDF into a separate PDF file. I have looked high and low, but it seems that there is no automated way to do this without reverting to Automator hacks (which I am open to if someone has an example of a really clean way to do this as a service and save the files to the source directory.)\nSo, for instance:\n PDF File:[page 1, page 2, page 3]\n PDF File:[page 1], PDF File:[page 2], PDF File:[page 3]\n\nA: I remember looking to do the same thing a few years ago and lo and behold, I still had the link in deep archive: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1354754\nA MacRumors Forums member named Oligarch put together a bunch of command-line pdf tools, which can be downloaded from this link: http://users.skynet.be/tools/\nThe pdfburst command is what you need:\nNAME\n     pdfburst -- burst (split) PDF documents into single pages\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     pdfburst file [path]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The pdfburst utility bursts (splits) the PDF document file into single\n     pages which it writes to path, appended by an underscore character and\n     zero-padded page numbers.\n\n     If file is a single dash (-), the PDF document is read from the standard\n     input.\n\n     If path is omitted, the base name (last path component) of file is used\n     and the single page files are created in the current working directory.\n\n     If path ends with a slash (/), it designates a directory and the single\n     page files are named with just the page number.\n\n     Missing directories along path are created.\n\n\nA: Another option is to use pdftk:\npdftk input.pdf burst\n\n\nA: You're looking for pdfseparate.

What is the OS of the Time Capsule ?\n\nA: The AirPort Time Capsule (the official name, with my emphasis added on AirPort - see below for the reason), runs NetBSD, according to the Examples of use section for NetBSD on Wikipedia. It cites two sources - one being an answer from superuser.com (not very useful in this case), and another an article on wifinetnews.com, that states:\n\nA source unconnected with Apple provided convincing proof that the AirPort Extreme uses NetBSD as its embedded operating system...\n\nThe AirPort Extreme Base Station, AirPort Express Base Station and the AirPort Time Capsule all run the same firmware (that's why the AirPort in all the names). This can be seen in the firmware downloads available for these products - it's the same download for all these devices. Of course, nobody has jailbroken these devices yet, so we do not know if or how the installation process chooses specific bits for the underlying hardware. But the OS cannot be different with the same firmware download (it does not make sense for these devices to have such a scheme).\nSee the recent AirPort update 7.6.4 page for understanding the above correlation.\n\nA: The Time Capsule NAS storage can be accessed from Mac OSX, Windows and most *Nix distributions.\n", "Q: How do I get iTunes Radio back?

It seams like it is some device connecting and disconnecting which is preventing your Mac from staying in sleep mode.\n\nA: I had the same problem with Linux on Mac, turned out that USB is waking up the system. I disabled the possibility for USB waking up the laptop on Linux. This does not affect the power button or the lid, they still work.\n\nA: Same problem here. MBP Retina (13-inch, early 2015) still running Yosemite.\nWhen I am at my desk, I have an Apple Extended Keyboard plugged into the left side USB port. This has been my writing keyboard (I am a professional writer) for many years, and many laptops. Never have I had this spontaneous wake-from-sleep problem.\nThis week, I was forced to install Microsoft Office to work with a specific client. I had avoided installing any MS software until now.\nThis is the ONLY change that has happened to my machine this week, and this is the week that my computer has started waking randomly in the middle of the night, or waking immediately after putting it to sleep.\nI believe MS Office may be the problem here.\nI have disabled \"Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer\" in Bluetooth advanced preferences.\nI have disabled \"Wake for network access\" and \"Enable Power Nap\" in the Energy Saver prefs.\nNone of this has helped the problem. I think MS Office is probing the USB port, or something, and causing my external keyboard to respond. I know. It sounds weird. But NOTHING else on my computer has changed, and this problem only started after installing Office.\n", "Q: Gray screen immediately upon boot. Cannot enter into safe mode, and cannot show boot loader with the Alt key. How the problem came to be: \n\n\n*\n\n*I wanted to dual boot Debian on my MacBook Pro 8,1. I got my USB ready, downloaded ISO, and installed rEFInd. I restarted to make sure the new boot manager worked. It did. \n\n*To burn the ISO on my USB, I followed the instructions on the official Debian page, which require the dd command. \n\n*However I was careless in my typing, and instead of choosing my USB to load the iso to, I chose a 10GB partition that I had set up long ago (i.e. of=/path/to/10GBPartition instead of of=/path/to/USB ). Tragically, I restarted my computer right as I realized what I had done. \n\n\nNow, my computer loads immediately into a gray screen, and stays there. The screen comes up just about a second after the boot chime sound. I tried SHIFT, ALT, SHIFT+CMD+V, and I even tried inserting my OS X Lion CD, but absolutely nothing works. It simply goes straight to a gray screen, with nothing on. Any ideas on how to salvage this system? \nThanks for any and all help. \n\nA: You could also try holding command-R to start up in recovery mode, option-command-R to start up in Internet recovery mode, or command-S to start up in Internet recovery mode. Or try using Recovery Disk Assistant to create a recovery partition on an external disk.\nIf you can somehow start up from the recovery system, one thing you can try is to choose the Reinstall OS X option. It downloads and installs a new copy of OS X over your existing installation and keeps user files and settings in place. It fixed a problem I had where my Mac got stuck during the startup process. (I don't remember what part it was though, and I was able to start up in single user mode and from the recovery partition.)\nIf nothing else works, you could try replacing the hard drive with an empty drive. Since your Mac has firmware support for Internet recovery mode, it would normally start downloading a disk image for the recovery system from Apple's servers, and then allow you to install a new copy of OS X on the empty drive.\n\nA: I am lucky enough to have family with plenty of Macs nearby my place. As a consequence, in this kind of situations, I don’t hesitate to use the good old Target Mode.\nBoot while pressing T; the Mac boot as an external disk, which you can connect to via FireWire or Thunderbolt (depending on your model of Mac). This is incredibly useful to get data back from a non-booting computer, or to try and fix a hard drive, or even to install a system on a machine with a non-formated drive and no installation DVD or USB drive.\n\nA: I've done the same.  Intentionally.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.\nIn the end, I had to remove the drive and clear the partition.  Having a CD filesystem where it doesn't belong seems to really, really hurt their EFI implementation.  Anything that requires EFI to scan to see what partitions are available, will hang. \n\nA: I have just had a very similar problem: I had a Mac Mini on which there was nothing but Debian installed; my boss wanted a dual booting MacOS/Debian. With recent experiences in dual shrinking MacOS-partitions I thought it might be a good idea to set up partitions first, then reinstall MacOS.\nEverything went fine until I finished the debian installation and rebooted into grey nothingness.\nI tried every keyboard shortcut I could find, including resetting the PVRAM - which actually worked and caused me to have to deal with the startup sound again (which I turned off in MacOS before) - but none of them did do anything. I could not boot from cd/usb/internet, into verbose, safe, mode...\nI then decided to remove the disc from the machine and to analyze it on another machine. The steps in https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac+Mini+Late+2012+Speaker+Replacement/11727 helped. I only followed these instructions until no. 12, then I could remove the hard disk drive.\nI plugged in the machine and found the following: Debian had somehow managed to initialize my /boot partition twice:\nroot@delta:~# wipefs /dev/sdc4\noffset               type\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n0x3                  exfat   [filesystem]\n                     UUID:  5441-1031\n\n0x438                ext2   [filesystem]\n                     UUID:  ea926f51-8909-4adf-af05-46870faf36a1\n\nWith this fixed (wipefs /dev/sdc4 -o 0x3) everything worked immediately. \nIt might be too late for your machine, but perhaps not too late for others. \nAnd one thing to mention: if you want to remove your speaker in your Mac Mini the instructions on ifixit.com state something about the Mac Mini Logic Board Removal Tool, which is available for $4.95 as a remake and for $39.95 as original apple-designed. I used a paper clip. Save money. Be good.\n", "Q: How do I view or verify signed .mobileconfig files using Terminal? I need to troubleshoot problems with signed .mobileconfig profiles. How can I show the signature of a these files using Terminal? Is it also possible to verify the certificates that were used to sign the profile?\nIs there a way to output the XML content of these files without the signature?\n\nA: Apple's .mobileconfig files are signed using PKCS7. The signing certificate data can be shown using the following command:\nopenssl pkcs7 -inform DER -print_certs -in ~/Settings.mobileconfig\n\nYou can copy/paste ASCII certificate data from the output into a plain text file (with a .cer filename extension) to create copies of the certificates:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIElTCCA32gAwIBAgIBAjALBgkqhkiG9w0BAQswga4xQDA+BgNVBAMMN0tlbGxl\neSBDb21wdXRpbmcgT3BlbiBEaXJlY3RvcnkgQ2VydGlmaWNhdGlvbiBBdXRob3Jp\ndHkxGTAXBgNVBAoMEEtlbGxleSBDb21wdXRpbmcxJTAjBgNVBAsMHE1BQ09TWCBP\n...\nq19fbG33zNwRhVHceYMpcbWG1MSqLxnPu4wo75OZFIJCaByZykfpKAzRZl9aa7rD\n5bAuzZAziXBW7WWKce2a4hGN804W9RHco5HIGLsQAdg4pLZvENXF1+JNHtBVXjjL\nWJrCDKjnCyS1DqmJqijk9KIDM8gP6iLLeQ==\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\nOpenSSL can be used to verify the code-signing certificate as well. Assuming that we've copied the signing CA's certificate text/data into ~/CA.crt, and copied the code signing certificate into ~/CodeSigner.crt.:\nopenssl verify -CAfile ~/CA.crt ~/CodeSigner.crt\n\nRemoving the signature from a file can be accomplished using this command:\nopenssl smime -inform DER -verify -in ~/Settings.mobileconfig -noverify -out ~/Unsigned.mobileconfig\n\n", "Q: Reading pdfs on iPad without storing them permanently I'm a software developer and my software is generating a lot of PDF reports which I know will consume a lot of space if downloaded.

How does he enable Wi-Fi if there was a required 4 digit passkey?\n\n*Is there any extra protection with iOS 7?\n\nA: *\n\n*It is only possible if the thief knew (or guessed) your passcode.\n\n*If your data was in standard apps(Mail, safari), then there's nothing to worry about, if it was stored in apps that allow for filesharing through the 'apps'-tab on iTunes, then I don't really know how iTunes handles that.\n\n*Yes it was connected to the Internet, but it could be with 3G (was it on when it was stolen?) or a public network that automatically connects (like Apple Stores or Starbucks) without needing a password.\n\n*Don't really know\nIn any case, report this to your local police office (bring the serial number, it should be on the box) and let them handle the theft. \n\nA: 4) Is you enable 'find my iphone' in iOs7, the user won't be able to format your phone till he is able to login your Apple-ID account.\nEg using itunes -> Restore phone will fail and require to login first.

Is there a way via command line I can unsubscribe this Podcast Or any other way to get rid of this error.\nThanks.\n\nA: You could try the detailed procedure outlined by Apple on iTunes for Windows Vista or Windows 7: Troubleshooting unexpected quits, freezes, or launch issues.\nIt begins with starting iTunes in Safe Mode and then proceeds to other steps like removing iTunes Preference files, creating a new library, recreating a library and so on.\nIf you seem to get stuck in this process, I would suggest creating a new library and adding your existing content to it. You would lose your playlists, ratings, etc. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the Shift key when launching iTunes (from the Start Menu or Task Bar or Windows Explorer).\n\n*Click on the Create Library... button and start iTunes.\n\n*Drag and drop all your media folders into the iTunes window.

What's the legal status of my Snow Leopard copy?\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it still \"bound\" to that install, i.e. the Mountain Lion only legally counts as an \"upgrade\" and I'm required to keep the original one, or\n\n*it is now \"free\", such as if I want to use it to install it elsewhere, I can (legally) do it (i.e. I would have one system running 10.6 and another one running 10.8)\n\n\n(hint: I'm not talking about dual boot)\n(hint: I'm not talking about if it is feasable, only if it is legal)\n\nA: Yes, for the first question. Whenever you sell your Mac, you're expected to sell it with the OS it came with, which in this case is Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Your upgrade to OS X Mountain Lion purchased from the Mac App Store belongs to you for your use and cannot be transferred to another person (on the other hand, if you bought a Mac with OS X Mountain Lion preinstalled, you're allowed to do a one time transfer to another person).\nFrom section 3. Transfer in the SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR OS X MOUNTAIN LION (emphasis mine):\n\nA. If you obtained the Apple Software preinstalled on Apple-branded hardware, you may make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Apple Software (in its original form as provided by Apple) to another party, provided that: (i) the Apple Software is transferred together with your Apple-branded hardware; (ii) the transfer must include all of the Apple Software, including all its component parts, printed materials and this License; (iii) you do not retain any copies of the Apple Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (iv) the party receiving the Apple Software accepts the terms and conditions of this License. For purposes of this License, if Apple provides an update (e.g., version 10.8 to 10.8.1) to the Apple Software, the update is considered part of the Apple Software and may not be transferred separately from the pre-update version of the Apple Software.\nB. If you obtained your license to the Apple Software from the Mac App Store, it is not transferable. If you sell your Apple-branded hardware to a third party, you must remove the Apple Software from the Apple-branded hardware before doing so, and you may restore your system to the version of the Apple operating system software that originally came with your Apple hardware (the “Original Apple OS”) and permanently transfer the Original Apple OS together with your Apple hardware, provided that: (i) the transfer must include all of the Original Apple OS, including all its component parts, printed materials and its license; (ii) you do not retain any copies of the Original Apple OS, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (iii) the party receiving the Original Apple OS reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of the Original Apple OS license.\n\n\nFor the second question, yes, you can install Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard on one other Mac that you have. Look at the SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR MAC OS X, where section 2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions states (emphasis mine):\n\nSingle Use License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, unless you have purchased a Family Pack or Upgrade license for the Apple Software, you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to install, use and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software on a single Apple-branded computer at a time. You agree not to install, use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so. This License does not allow the Apple Software to exist on more than one computer at a time, and you may not make the Apple Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time.\n\nYou can do a one time permanent transfer of the Mac OS X Snow Leopard license. Section 3. Transfer in the agreement states (emphasis mine):\n\nYou may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Apple Software.\nSubject to the restrictions set forth below, you may, however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Apple Software (in its original form as provided by Apple) to another party, provided that: (a) the transfer must include all of the Apple Software, including all its component parts (excluding Apple Boot ROM code and firmware), original media, printed materials and this License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Apple Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the Apple Software reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of this License. You may not rent, lease, lend, redistribute, sublicense or transfer any Apple Software that has been modified or replaced under Section 2H above. All components of the Apple Software are provided as part of a bundle and may not be separated from the bundle and distributed as standalone applications. Apple Software provided with a particular Apple-branded hardware product may not run on other models of Apple-branded hardware.\n\n", "Q: How to delete an app from device using iTunes? How do you delete (not just hide) an app? The Facebook app is corrupted and is causing my phone to crash and restart. (4 times just yesterday!) I really don't want to have to restore my entire phone, losing everything on it. It would be much easier if I could delete the app and re-download a version that is not corrupted.\nIn the past we could do this, but with this latest version of iTunes, I can't figure out how to!\n\nA: Why are you trying to do this via iTunes? You should delete the app on the phone and use the app store on the phone to re-download it.\nHowever if you feel you must do this via iTunes after you have deleted the app from the phone, go to:\n~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications\n\n…and delete the application from there.\nYou can then download it again via the iTunes store and re-synch the phone.\n\nA: You can delete an app from iTunes by going to the Apps section (from the dropdown on the left), then hit the Delete key. When it asks if you would like to keep the file or move it to trash, choose to move it to the trash.\nYou can also delete the app directly on the phone and download it through WiFi. Tap and hold the app's icon until it jiggles, then tap on the x to delete it. Next go to the App Store and install the app afresh.\n\nA: Open iTunes. At the top left of your window, there is a drop down menu, make sure it is set to Apps. You should now see all of your apps in icon form. The tabs below the player window allow you to switch into List view as seen below.\n\nThen select the apps you want to delete, right click and select Delete.\n\n", "Q: How to restore Applications & Files from HD Backup (Migration Asst won't read it) I recently had a problem with my MBP which wouldn't start up. After the chime it would shut down. I started using ⌘ cmd+R and ran Disk Utility. Had issues with my boot partition but no issues on my data partition.\nBought a new external HDD, created 3 partitions as Mac OS Extended Journaled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Partition\n\n*Original MBP Boot Partition Backup\n\n*Original MBP Data Partition Backup\n\n\nI managed to get all the data saved so I'm reasonably confident I have everything backed up on the external HDD.\nI erased my MBP boot partition and reinstalled Mountain Lion. The Data partition remained same and is still fine. Now I want to get all my files/libraries/apps back from the External HDD backup. Migration asst doesn't see Partition 2 and only sees the boot partition.\nI'm sure there must be a way to migrate everything back but I can't find a way to do it.\nHow can I use Migration Assistant with a second partition, or can I use an alternative method to restore my data?\n\nA: Manually, enable root user, and then you can move the files by hand. \n", "Q: Exploring the files in a MobileSync backup I'm trying to find if some movies that I had on my iPhone 5 might be hidden away in a MobileSync backup.  The weird part is that iTunes → Preferences → Devices doesn't show a backup for this device in February, but there's a folder in the MobileSync backup folder that shows a Feb 10, 2013 last modified date.\nWhat I'd like to do is find out what all is in that folder without having to restore a device. Honestly, I'm not sure how to do the restore anyway, since there's no entry in iTunes for it.\nIs there any way to browse what is in each backup?\n\nA: Here's the DIY method:\nNavigate to the following directory:\n~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/\nYou'll get a cryptic list of folders.  Inside each folder will be a large number of files with cryptic names.\nOpen these files in Quicktime Player.  \nThere may be thousands of them but if you sort by size you should get video, audio and photos to float to the top.\nAlternatively you could try one of the applications that is meant to do this such as iPhone Backup Extractor (There is a free and a paid version I have not tried either myself).\n\nA: iExplorer\niExplorer will let you browse iTunes backups.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iExplorer and click the Browse iTunes Backups button.\n\n\n*Your most recent backup should be shown. It should show multiple 'domains' as below:\n\n\n*The data you are looking for should be in the MediaDomain.\n\n\nA: For Linux users, these are just raw media files without extensions. mpv will play them.

Also, when I try to give Siri a command, Siri cannot hear me.  Has anyone else had that problem too?\n\nA: Once the alert is answered it wont pop up again. You have to go to: Settings -> Privacy -> Microphone Then check the state of your app. \n\nA: I had this problem in the past (on iOS 6 so not sure whether this could be helpful to you). A cold reset fixed the issue with the microphone.\n", "Q: What features of Mavericks are beneficial to you? This question serves to share and collect the enhancements that make a large difference to how you use your Mac. \nPlease post one feature per answer. Please also check to see if your answer has already been posted - duplicate answers will be deleted. To search answers for this question use inquestion:this (directly from the question page) in addition to your search terms in the search box in the upper right hand corner of this page.\nThe best answers will not only list a feature, but provide details on how to configure that feature, and provide an image of how to use the feature to be more efficient or effective with Mavericks.\n\nA: iCloud Keychain stores and syncs Secure Notes across Macs.\nThe new iCloud Keychain stores website usernames and passwords, credit card numbers and Wi-Fi network information and keeps the data up to date across all of a person's Apple devices, including the iPhone and iPad.\nIt also stores and syncs Secure Notes across Macs, like this:\n\n\nA: Notification Center appears on current monitor\nIn a multi-monitor setup, Notification Center now appears on the monitor where your cursor is currently located. This is a nice improvement if you invoke it while you're working on a secondary monitor: it appears on the monitor you're looking at, rather than the primary.\n\nA: You can now sort your documents in Finder even when you have the grouping feature turned on. (For example you group the download folder by filetype and files inside the group are sorted by name)\n\nA: The overhaul of the virtual memory system makes it clear that memory pressure is the primary factor to track and not how many free pages, inactive pages or overall virtual memory is allocated.\n\nThe bottom panel is invaluable for diagnosing a slow machine and knowing whether to rule out memory contention as a cause of the slowness. After running your Mac for a week, you should reach a nice steady state like shown above and can know if adding more RAM or adjusting the programs you run will affect performance. \n\nA: Messages (iMessages) can be created quickly in Notification Center\n\nA: Now you can see which all apps are using your location. And you will also a new Privacy tab in Security & Privacy in System Preferences :\n\n\nA: Safari tells you when a tab crashed\nWhilst Safari has always been able to restart crashed tabs, now it tells you when it's done so:\n\n\nA: Automatically Installs Updates\nMy favorite feature is the ability to have updates install automatically in the background just like they do in iOS 7.\n\nA: Charging state of an iPad is notified to the user\nBecause of insufficient current on some Macs, especially older ones or because of USB multipliers, iPads can't get charged or they only get charged when their screen is idle.\nOf course, Mavericks can't fix this situation, it's basically an electrical problem but it seems that Apple now made it a little bit more manageable by notifying the user through a Notification Center message if their iPad is not being charged when plugged to their Mac.\n\n\nA: With a text field active, Control ⌃ + Command ⌘ + Space opens a characters panel including Emojis.\n\n\nA: The energy consumption view that collects 8 hours of history and graphs the charge level in your battery as well as showing each process that drained measurable amounts of energy is going to make squeezing extra productivity out of one charge much easier.\n\nNot only will developers (I'm looking at you Dropbox) know that they have to be better stewards of battery life, it makes it easy to see which apps support App Nap and even that a program that is quit now was responsible for using energy in the past 8 hours. This tool provides actionable information for users to better manage their experience when away from wall power on a portable Mac.\nThis detail is quite hidden inside Activity Monitor, but Apple does expose the biggest users of energy in the menu bar for apps using significant energy.\n\n\nA: Secret Wallpapers\nOS X ships with a bunch of really cool sample photos that are not normally available for use as desktop backgrounds.\nPreviously in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, these were located at:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.Framework/Versions/A/Resources/Default Collections/\n\nIn OS X 10.9 Mavericks, they’re now located at\n/Library/Screen Savers/Default Collections/\n\nHere's how to get them:\n\n\n*\n\n*from Finder, use the menu Go → Go to Folder… (or hit ⌘⇧G) and paste in: /Library/Screen Savers/Default Collections/\nYou should see 4 folders, and inside them you’ll find lots of really cool Wallpapers:\n\n\n\n\nA: Bring Your Home Folder's Library Back with One Checkbox in Mavericks:\nApple decided to hide the Library from its users in recent OS X updates, but in Mavericks you can now change that with a simple checkbox.\nIn the past you had to enter a Terminal command with every little system update:\nchflags nohidden ~/Library\n\nWith OS X Mavericks, you can just navigate to your home folder, press Command+J to bring up the folder settings, and check the box next to \"Show Library Folder\" instead. \n\nA: Full screen finder:\n\nPretty simple, but really nice.\n\nA: Using Speakable Items and Automator To Command Your Mac By Voice:\nThe Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) uses an automator script and the new \"Speakable Items\" option in Mavericks to achieve this:\nSystem Preferences > Accessibility > Speakable Items to launch apps. \nWhen it's set up, you simply hit a key on your keyboard, speak a phrase, and that launches the apps you choose.\nTheir example is a simple \"Good morning\" to start your day.\nThere is a list of preprogrammed things you can say to command your Mac as well.\nThey have a video tutorial which takes you through the various steps.\n\nA: Fairly certain that System Preferences has had some visual tweaks, including larger text and icons. There's a new iCloud icon too.\nEdit: As per comments, the category titles have been removed.\n\n\nA: LinkedIn and few others are now supported in Internet Accounts :\n\n\nA: Finder Tabs\nSafari Style\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Command + T opens a new tab (as it does in Safari)\n\n*Right click (or control + click) a file or folder within a finder window > \"open in Tab\"\n\n*Control + Tab to cycle through each\n\n*Bunch of open Finder windows?  Window > \"Merge all Windows\" to neatly arrange into one Finder window with tabs.\n\n\nA: Activity Monitor tells you what pages a Safari process has open\nIf you mouseover any Safari subprocess in Activity Monitor you can see what pages are loaded in the process in the tooltip.\n\nA: Put your computer to sleep quickly\nIf you're using OSX Mavericks on a MacBook, tapping the power key briefly immediately puts your computer to sleep—a simple tweak that makes saving energy even easier.  For the usual shutdown dialog, just keep holding for three seconds, or press control+power.\nAs always, you can put just the display to sleep by pressing control+shift+eject or control+shift+power, depending on your model.\n\nA: Using multiple desktops on multiple displays is finally usable. Now I can switch desktops on my left hand monitor while the right hand monitor doesn't change.\n\nA: The battery menu in the top bar now shows apps using high amounts of energy - nice for killing energy-hogs:\n\n\nA: Move Dashboard in Mission Control\nYou can now drag to rearrange the Dashboard to move it between your desktop spaces and full screen apps. It can even be dragged to alternative monitors, providing that \"Displays have separate Spaces\" is enabled in System Preferences → Mission Control.\n\n\nA: Mac App Store Notifications Now Include Multiple \"Later\" Options\nYou can choose from a handful of times in the future to remind you about pending updates from the Mac App Store.\n\nCredit to this reddit.com/r/mac post.\n\nA: The Mail.app for Mavericks supports exporting emails now as PDF files, which is useful. Although if attempting to export multiple emails as PDF, it will simply generate multiple PDF's rather than appending one large PDF file.\n\nA: Disable Mavericks Spelling Autocorrection:\nIf you get frustrated when OS X 10.9 attempts to autocorrect the multiple technology words that it doesn’t recognize. You should be able to disable the autocorrection feature either globally or on a per application basis. \nIn theory you should be able to disable it globally or disable it only in certain applications. I have not found that the global disable actually seems to turn off the corrections in all applications though. this is most probably a bug that will be fixed in future Mavericks updates.  It is helpful to disable it only in specific applications anyway. \nDisable Spelling Autocorrection in all Applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Keyboards under System Preferences.\n\n*Under the Text tab uncheck correct spelling automatically. \n\n\nDisable Autocorrection for a Specific Application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Apple application that you want autocorrection disabled.\n\n*Right-click (or ctrl-click) into any text field. From the context menu that appears, under Spelling and Grammar uncheck Correct Spelling Automatically. \n\nRemember that various applications can handle spelling correction in multiple different ways. Many applications will maintain the consistency of OS X and have this option available when right-clicking (ctrl-clicking) a text field. Disabling autocorrection in Chrome, for example, is handled this way. \nOther applications such as Firefox may require you hunting through the Preferences to disable the autocorrection feature. \n\nA: Finder messages are now Notification Center alerts\nPrior to Mavericks, alerts from Finder would show up as a modal window, however they now show as a Notification Center alert, such as below:\n\n\nA: Battery Life\nIt's hard to beat getting an additional hour of use on a battery charge. I've been getting at least that much more use before having to plug in my 2012 MacBook Air. My experience matches up well with Apple's claim during the announcement keynote where the 13 inch Air from 2013 with Haswell benchmarked with another hour to an hour and a half of battery life just by installing Mavericks.\n\nA: Disable App Nap on a per app basis in OS X Mavericks:\nYou may or may not know that one of the more discreet features in OSX Mavericks will be App Nap.\nApps will enter App Nap when they’re completely hidden from view by other apps and when they aren’t actively working. This is a great way to reduce your running apps from killing your Mac’s battery life.\nAlso, you may want certain apps to never enter App Nap. This could be true for apps that are important to you but sometimes perform long non-interactive tasks.\nTo prevent apps from entering App Nap, go to Finder -> Applications -> right click on the app you want -> click on Get Info -> and look for the option that says “Prevent App Nap” right under the copyright section, as shown on the picture below:\n\nPlease note that said option won’t be there for apps that don’t support App Nap.\n\nA: Show Desktop using Trackpad now follows motion\nUsing the Show Desktop gesture, the motion of the windows now follows the motion of your fingers on the trackpad. No longer is it a set speed, you can move the windows at the exact speed of your fingers, and even pull them back half way through to cancel the motion.\n\nA: Gatekeeper shows most recent app in System Preferences\nAfter Gatekeeper blocks an app, going to the relevant option in System Preferences shows the app name and a button that allows you to open the app.\n\nThis means it is no longer required for new users to know that clicking Open from the right-click menu will bypass Gatekeeper.\n\nA: iCloud Sync:\nAutomator and AppleScript Editor, both apps have been updated with iCloud compatibility. AppleScripts that you've created or Automator workflows can now be moved into the cloud and synced to all of your Macs that are running OS X Mavericks.\nIt's useful if you're creating and updating scripts or workflows that need to be deployed to a handful of Macs automatically.\n\nA: Show Twitter feed in Safari's Sidebar\nUpdate: It's not the complete feed, just messages with URLs embedded in them.\nBeing able to see your twitter feed in a Safari Sidebar is pretty cool, and definitely under documented.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your Twitter credentials to the \"Internet Accounts\" panel of \"System Preferences.\"\n\n*Click on the \"open book\" icon in the new Safari bookmark bar.\n\n*Select \"Shared Links\" or use the keyboard shortcut ^⌘3 to toggle \"Shared Links\".\n\n\nI believe that this is all that I did to be able to see my twitter feed in the safari sidebar.\n\nA: Messages now has a color setting called auto, which will color the messages of the person you're talking to in the way that they color their own messages.\n\nA: This not exactly a useful feature, Java seems to be not installed by default and when you try to check java version in terminal, it takes you to the download page. Run this in terminal : java -version\n\nas a feature, I find this quickest way to install Java :P\n\nA: Hidden Dock won’t appear in fullscreen apps:\nYou may find that the Dock won’t show up from the bottom or right/left side (depending on where you put it) when apps are in fullscreen, and when you fast-move the cursor to where your Dock is hidden or when you pause right there and let the cursor hover. No Dock.\nHere’s the trick:\nYou need to move the cursor very slowly. That’s all you need to do. If you move it too fast to the edge of your screen, the Dock won’t show up.\n\nA: Side dock has new UI\nIt now looks like this (I really like the light that indicates which apps are open, it's a lot more clearer than the bottom dock):\n\n\nA: Open PSDs directly in Safari\nYou can now preview PSD files (Photoshop Documents) directly in Safari without actually opening Preview, or even downloading the PSD to your Downloads folder.\n\nA: AirPlay display:\nThe Apple TV makes it easy to see on your TV the media content that is on your Mac, such as to stream videos or photos.\nIn OS X Mountain Lion, you could also mirror your Desktop to the Apple TV, such as for presentations. \nOS X Mavericks takes that to the next step, treating the Apple TV as just another monitor, so you can extend your desktop onto an Apple TV-connected TV or projector.\n\nA: Enhanced Dictation\nEnhanced Dictation allows offline use and continuous dictation with live feedback. \nGreat for those without Internet connections and those not wanting to have their dictation processed outside of their network.\n\n\nA: ColorSync Utility: New Calculator\nThis little known included application continues to improve with a new colour Calculator.\n\nNot new to Mavericks but certainly hidden, ColorSync continues to provide interactive 3D colour space visualisation for profiles.\n\n\nA: Driving directions for iOS:\nOS X Mavericks adopts iOS's Maps app. That by itself is not a huge deal, even though it's nice to have an alternative to Google's Web-based maps. But what's cool is the ability to get driving directions and send them to your iPhone or other iOS 7-based device. They show up in the iOS Maps app, ready for you to follow while driving or walking, and they remain in your bookmarked directions for access later if needed.\n\nA: Improved Multiple Screen Support\nIt is pretty awesome having a menu bar on each screen and being able to full screen apps on a per screen basis. I never used full screen mode before since I always had the linen background on my other screen.\n\nA: New Safari setting to power off plugins when inactive to save battery life as featured in this Ars Technica article.\nI have high expectations that this will stop the issues occurring when my girlfriend has 15 tabs with flash players open in the background while working in other programs.\n\nA: Easily Identify New Apps:\nIf you use Launchpad, any new apps you download will sparkle to denote their newness.\nOnce you acknowledge them, or they've sat there neglected for awhile, the sparkles will disappear. \n\n\nA: Move Dock Between Monitors\nThe Dock starts on your main monitor, but if you put your cursor in another monitor, go to the bottom of the screen, and then keep moving down, the Dock will pop up (and disappear from wherever it was previously).  This is really nice if your \"main\" monitor isn't actually.\nThe motion has to be pretty straight down and surprisingly long - it's a bit finicky.\n\nA: Responsive scrolling\nIn Mountain Lion and earlier, any window content that doesn't fit in the current frame of the window (like a long webpage) isn't drawn until scrolled into view. In Mavericks, this offscreen content is \"pre-rendered\" during idle time, which results in vastly improved scrolling performance (especially noticeable with complex documents or webpages).\n\nA: Disable Notification Center on the Lock Screen:\n\nNotification Center doesn't see a whole lot of improvement this time around, but the update does mess with your settings a little bit. If you're not a fan of getting a million notifications, you're going to want to pop into System Preferences > Notifications and take a look at the new options. The big one to check is \"Show notifications on lock screen.\"\nIf you don't want your emails or anything else showing when you're computer is locked, uncheck this box.\n\nA: Zoom pictures in QuickLook\nYou can now zoom pictures in QuickLook using the default zoom gestures: Pinch In & Pinch Out, as well as panning with two fingers.\n\nA: Debug menus have been updated\nThe debug menus have been updated for various apps.\nBelow is the debug menu for App Store and Contacts:\n\n\n\nTo activate the menus, run the following commands (and restart the apps):\ndefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.AddressBook ABShowDebugMenu -bool true\n\nReplace true with false to remove.\n\nA: Did someone noticed that the Remove from Dock option on the Trash icon's context menu in the Dock is gone. I clicked that a couple of times accidentally and then had to bring it back in Mountain Lion.\n\nA: Event reminders based on travel time\nWhen you create an event in Calendar, you can specify a location. If the address is recognized, it'll insert a map right in the event details (and even give you the current weather conditions!).\nBut it goes even further. Calendar can also determine your current location, so you can tell it to calculate the travel time to the event based on where you currently are. If you do, that gives you a new alert option: \"when I need to leave.\"\nThis is so much better than the old fixed-time options (1 hour before, 30 minutes before, etc.) because it's dynamic based on where you are and how far you need to drive.\n\nA: iBooks (for Mac) stinks (can't edit any metadata, kinda flakey about syncing with my iPad, you now have to interact with two programs to manage your books, etc.), but if you were unfortunate enough to have it suck all of your books out of iTunes and into its universe before you knew what was going on then here are a couple of tips.\nTo delete a book or PDF select the book and hit the Delete key.  (There was something in iTunes that worked in that same non-intuitive way, wasn't there?)\nTo reduce the the flakiness of the sync I had to double-home-button-kill iBooks on my iPad, then try syncing again.  It helped.\nIf out of habit you drag a PDF into iTunes it will be gladly accepted, but you won't be able to see it anymore, because the Books category is gone and there's no Library category anymore.  It will show up as Music and you can delete it from there.\nUPDATE: 9:30pm: NOW there's a \"Delete\" item showing up when you right-click on a book in the popup menu.  That hasn't been there all day.  Have no idea what made it start showing up.  This program needs some work.  It should have been iBooks beta.\n", "Q: Other than size, what's the difference between the iPad Air and the Retina iPad mini? They both have an A7 processor, the new MIMO wifi, etc. \nWhat, if anything, are the technical or spec differences other than screen size?\n\nA: Here's a modified screenshot of Apple's iPad comparison page, differences are highlighted.\nThe only differences are the prices, height, width, weight, screen size, and density. Everything else, including the battery life and thickness surprisingly, is exactly the same:\n\n\nA: To a first approximation, the performance of the iPad Air and the retina iPad Mini are identical due to the same M7 CPU in all three devices. Most everyday tasks won't run any faster or slower on the iPhone 5s versus the two new iPads. The primary observable difference (other than physical dimensions) is longer battery run time of the Air.\n\n\n*\n\n*both have M7 chip like the iPhone 5s\n\n*both have identical cellular chipsets and LTE support internationally\n\n*due to a larger frame, the Air can sustain higher CPU clock rates initially and over time as compared to the Mini. It's measurable in benchmarks, but I haven't seen a real world test where this is measurable in practice.\n\n*due to the larger battery, the Air maintains an LTE hotspot for 24h whereas the Mini will tether data for 18h on one charge.\n\n\n\nNow if you are benchmarking things and measuring things to the % or fraction of a per-cent, there are reliable reports of slight differences with the Air being marginally faster than the phone and Mini.\nThe first effect is the iPad Air runs the CPU at a slightly higher 1.4 GHz nominal clock rate whereas the iPhone 5s and iPad Mini start with clock rates of 1.3 GHz. Now, chips like these don't run at full speed until they have significant loads and often will run at lower clock rates when mostly idle (or sleep a substantial portion of the time when able) in order to conserve battery power.\nI would also expect that the Air is able to maintain the full CPU speed longer when running a sustained task since the heat generated by the A7 CPU can be cooled better when in thermal contact with a much larger chunk of aluminum which also has a larger surface area to radiate the heat away.\nSo if you are going to encode video or process a podcast and that operation takes 25 minutes - you might expect the Air to complete the task even faster than the 1.4/1.3 CPU clock speed ration if the Mini and iPhone 5S can't radiate away the heat and have to reduce clock speed further to keep the heat generation within limits.\nAnandtech has a very nice graph that shows both of these effects clearly.\n\nYou can see the blue iPad Air lines clustered to the left a few percent higher than the red iPhone 5s lines and then the iPhone 5s either throttles down the performance to save power or stay within thermal limits.\nLuckily Anandtech ran a second review of the retina Mini and report that thermal considerations are strongly suspected to make up the performance difference over long task runs between the iPad Air, iPad Mini and iPhone 5s:\n\n\nA: An alternative comparison of the two tablets highlighting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Differences (What are the advantages of each)\n\n*Key features of both (screen resolution, camera resolution, CPU Cores & Frequency)\n\n*Full list of specifications of each\n\n\nMaybe seen at Tablet Rocket: Apple iPad mini 2  vs Air \n", "Q: Can I upgrade from Lion to Mavericks? Or must I upgrade to Mountain Lion, first? I never bothered to upgrade my 2012 MacBook Air to Mountain Lion. Currently I am on Lion.\nCan I upgrade straight to Mavericks, or do I need to first upgrade to Mountain Lion and then to Mavericks?\n\nA: According to the Mavericks How To Upgrade page you can update from Snow Leopard (10.6.8) Lion (10.7), or Mountain Lion(10.8) later to Mavericks (10.9) if your hardware meets the requirements, which yours does. I upgraded my 2012 MacBook Air to Mavericks about two weeks ago and the battery life is noticeably better.\n", "Q: Difference between US QWERTY and International QWERTY Apple keyboards? What exactly is the difference between US QWERTY and International QWERTY Apple keyboards?\nI’m talking about the hardware keyboards specifically, not about keyboard layouts (in System Settings).\n\nA: Latest version from the official Apple website:\nQWERTY - International & QWERTY - US\n\nThe link below is to the overview of all keyboard layouts that Apple provides. Might be useful.\nLink: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794\n\nA: The most important differences are the size and position of the Enter/Return, and a few differences in the layout. The ~ key and the \\ key have an entirely different position on both keyboards. Also, the US keyboard has no € label (although it can be entered: Alt+Shift+2).\nThe International keyboard (‘keyboard type’ = ISO) also has one more key than the US keyboard (‘keyboard type’ = ANSI).  Some Apple keyboard layouts use that key for essential characters, and this can cause problems for users with only the US keyboard.\nBelow is a high-quality visual comparison.\nUS QWERTY Apple keyboard:\n\nEN International Apple keyboard:\n\n\nA: It doesn't have the alternate \"upper\" characters of the number keys, i.e. the pound sign.\n", "Q: Will any files or apps delete after updating to Mavericks? I'm downloading the update right now and I would like to know if any of my files or app gets deleted after this update... I'm sure many people here already installed the update so what can you say?\n\nA: The upgrade to Mavericks overwrote the config file for the Apache web server (localhost). It also overwrote the environment variable giving access to Java. \n\nA: I have been running Mavericks for about two weeks and I haven't noticed any apps that were deleted during the install. Some of Apple's apps may be updated during the upgrade, but I'm not aware of anything that gets deleted.\n\nA: From my upgrade experience, nothing has been lost in the process. All application settings are the same, all the applications are there and all the files are still here.\nUpgrading an operating system should never touch your personal information and your installed applications unless you are doing a clean install, but if you are simply running the \"Install OSX Mavericks\" application, you have nothing to worry about.\nHowever, the only thing that does get deleted is the installer itself once you have finished upgrading. If you would like to keep it to either create a bootable recovery USB or use the installer to upgrade other Macs you own, you can either copy it to a USB or some other form of storage besides your boot hard disk or simply make a copy of it in a compressed zip folder which wont be deleted regardless of its location.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I noticed that the Finder favorites were reset.  I had some custom folders in the list of favorite before the update and now they are gone.  I KNOW that I had a favorite for Dropbox and it was missing after the install (I chose to move my Dropbox folder to another drive so it isn't the favorite created by Dropbox).  There was also a new favorite for \"Deleted Users\" that I didn't know existed before.\nI tried going through time machine history to see when it changed, but it doesn't seem like the list of favorites are changed  with time machine.  \n\nA: My folder favorites also disappeared after a couple restarts, and two of them moved up top as as toolbar shortcuts. I had about 30 of them for work purposes. I have not figured out how to get them back yet other than just manually re-adding them all.\n\nA: After upgrading to maverick a folder was deleted out of my dropbox.  I didn't notice it until a month later and Maverick was the only change I made to my pc so I'm blaming it.\n", "Q: Travel time not automatically generated in Calenders I have just installed Mac OS X Mavericks and have been familiarising myself with some of the new features. One of the touted features was the ability to tell you the \"travel time\" for any given appointment. However when adding a new event to my calendar, the travel time is just specified times that I set, it will not show me how long it will take via car for example.\nI have ensured that Calendars is allowed to use my current location, as well as Maps (which I believe is used to generate the time).\n\nA: Try reentering the address so that Calendar registers it as an address (addresses will be suggested to you when as you type) rather than a mere string - that worked for me.\n", "Q: Does the iPad Air stay cooler whilst charging than the previous iPad? My iPad 4 gets quite hot whilst charging, even without a case. As I get this with every one of my iOS devices, as well as Macs, I always expect this from a device now.\nHowever, the iPad Air is much thinner than the previous iPad, and consequently has this had any impact on the temperature of the iPad Air whilst charging?\n\nA: Yes, the airs will be cooler than the 4th generation iPads when charging due to the laws of physics. How much cooler may be hard to estimate and simple to test empirically once we have shipping devices and a thermal imaging camera.\nThe specifications of the iPad Air show that the surface area of the back is 40,680 mm^2 (169.5 x 240 mm) and that it contains a 32.4 watt-hour battery.\nThe specifications of the 4th generation iPad show that the surface area of the back is 42,934 mm^2 (185.7 x 241.2 mm) and that it contains a 42.5 watt-hour battery.\nSo, to charge the Air you have far less energy (ratio of 1 : 0.76) going in to the device and only a slightly less (ration of 1 : 0.95) surface area with which to dissipate heat from the charging of the battery.\nSince Apple almost always limits the charge rate of it's devices to get 80% of the full charge in 2 hours and the remaining 20% and top off in the next 2 hours we can safely expect that pattern to hold. Since the energy going into the older device isn't offset with enough extra surface area to dissipate that heat - the lesser energy going into the Air during an recharge cycle will let it's surface temperature run cooler to dissipate all the heat that the battery puts off while charging. I also see no reason to think there will be less or more airflow from speaker openings and such or that the glass of the Air will insulate more or less than the previous generation.\nSo I can confidently predict the iPad Air is going to be cooler than it's predecessor in more ways than one.\n", "Q: Is it bad to format your ssd many times? In the past two years, I have formatted my SSD many times and I started to wonder, is it bad? Does it harm your SSD every time you format?\n\nA: Formatting your SSD is not particularly different from writing to it. I wouldn't worry about it.\nIf you'd like to know more about SSD lifetimes, check out this question:How long will an Apple SSD last? \n", "Q: Can I add or change the author of a PDF file in iBooks? I had several PDF files in iTunes that I had added authors to. Then I upgraded to Mavericks and launched iBooks. It moved my books and PDFs from iTunes, but many of my PDFs now show the author as \"Unknown Author\".\nIs there a way to add an author to these files? I cannot \"Get Info\" on the file in iBooks like I used to be able to do in iTunes.\n\nNote: This question was originally asked about OS X 10.9 Mavericks. Now that 10.10 Yosemite is available, there is a way to do this easily in iBooks.\n\nA: You will have to edit the metadata for the PDF, but there seems to be no way to do this in iBooks for Mac.\nOne workaround is to use Preview for this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Double-click on the PDF file in iBooks and the file will launch in Preview.\n\n*Select File > Print....\n\n*In the lower-left corner of the drop-down dialog select PDF > Save as PDF.... This will allow you to edit the Title, Author, and Subject PDF metadata.\n\n*Save the new file to your Desktop or any other location.\n\n*Open iBooks and delete your old PDF.\n\n*Now drag and drop the new PDF into iBooks and it should recognize the correct metadata.\n\n\nA: To be clear, Bryan Luby's and ReF's answers are both correct. I wanted to elaborate on ReF's answer for those who may have never used Automator before. This will allow you to change the the data for items in bulk.\nChanging the Author\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and in the left-most dialog box select \"Finder &\nFolders.\"\n\n*In the subtree dialog box just to the right, select \"Get    Specified Finder Items\" and drag this box to the top of the workflow    zone.\n\n*Inside the \"Get Specified Finder Items\" box select \"Add...\"    and choose the files you wish to modify.\n\n*In the left-most dialog    box select \"PDFs\"\n\n*In the subtle dialog box, select and drag \"Set    PDF Metadata\" into the workflow after \"Get Specified Finder Items.\"\n\n*Inside the \"Set PDF Metadata\" box, check the Author and type in    the Desired name.\n\n*Click Run, the play button, in the top right    corner.\n\n*After this workflow completes you can add these files to    iBooks and the Author field will be correct.\n\n\nIf you have previously added them you will have to delete the ones where the Author didn't show up.\nChanging the Title\nUnfortunately, iBooks reads the title from the name of the file; rather than, the title contained in the metadata of the pdf itself. If you want to change this is Automator it is possible. The most comprehensive way is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*As above, use the \"Set PDF Metadata\" option to update the\nmetadata title to the title of the book.\n\n*From the PDFs subtree select the \"Rename PDF Documents\" widget to the end of the workflow.\n\n\nThis method will only work one file at a time and rename the file for you while updating the metadata. This is a particularly slow way to accomplish this task. It would be faster just to edit the file name directly in finder, or, preferably, use command line arguments and regular expressions to rename the file removing the unwanted parts.\n\nA: In iBooks 1.1 on Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change to List view\n\n*Click once on the entry that you want to edit, and wait a few seconds\n\n*Click once on the author, title, or whatever you wish to edit to make that part editable\n\n*Type your changes\n\n*Click off that line\n\n\nA: You can use the Automator workflows. Choosing PDF on the left and then dragging the action \"Set PDF metadata\" (or something similar, my version is in Italian) on the right part of the Automator window you can put author, title and whatever in one or multiple PDF files.\nIssues and workarounds: if you update the metadata directly on your PDFs in the iBooks folder it will not update iBooks, so you won't see any change. I suggest to copy your PDFs on you desktop, erase the PDFs from iBooks, use Automator to add the metadata and then re-import (drag and drop is useful here) the books in your iBooks.\nI have just finished updating my files, you can't go wrong ;)\n\nA: Here is how to delete iBooks and get book management functionality back to iTunes (including the ability to edit metadata):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor and kill the bookstoreagent service.\n\n*Delete the file for that service:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CommerceKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/bookstoreagent\n\n\n*Use AppCleaner to remove iBooks app completely.\n\n*Restart iTunes and Books menu will appear again there.\n\n*Copy our ebook files from our backup back to internal storage. This is mainly for ebook files that we didn’t purchase from iBookstore. Don’t worry about books that we purchased from iBookstore, we can re-download them again.\n\n*Delete the ebook files from\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books\n\n…so iTunes library will detect them as missing. Right click for each book, choose “Get Info” and it will ask the location of the file. Point the location to the ebook file that we have restored. Yes it’s probably a long and tiring process especially if we have plenty of books.\nAn alternative way of step 6 is to delete all the books from iTunes library and re-import them from the files. All the metadata we created before should remain unchanged.\n\n*Re-download books that we purchased from iBookstore. Or alternatively if we have those books in our iPhone or iPad, we can just sync them with iTunes and choose to transfer those books.\n\nA: just throwing this out there for those who want to edit the metadata directly.\nFrom the command line (Terminal) you can use exiftool to edit the metadata of the pdf (or any file for that matter).\nSo to edit the author tag you could simply type:\nexiftool -author=\"Joe Bloggs\" /Users/yourAppleIDhere/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/iCloud\\~com\\~apple\\~iBooks/Documents/SomeDocument.pdf\n\na list of pdf tags that are editable in exiftool can be found here:\nhttps://exiftool.org/TagNames/PDF.html\nand here is a list of all the support file types and their respective tags (click on file type name):   https://exiftool.org/TagNames/ \nAs mentioned above by @JoeGermuska the Title in Apple Books is read from the file name.\n\nA: In other words: It's not just to choose your files and change it the way you do it in iTunes with artists.\nMuch easier-even if I don't have anything to add to that problem..\n(In Google Play/Books you can change name easy-and in a jiffi!)\n", "Q: Re-use Mavericks install file I have three Macs I want to upgrade to Mavericks.  Is there a way of re-using the install files, so I don't have to do three separate 5gb downloads?\n\nA: Download the update from the App Store. Once the file has finished downloading, check your Applications folder for the \"Install OS X Mavericks\" icon. Copy this installer to your other computers before going through the install process. The installer will delete itself after the install is finished.\n\nA: Background: when you run the \"Install OS X Mavericks\" application to upgrade your Mac, the app deletes itself when it's done.\nSolution: make a copy before you run it. Since the App Store opens it automatically, you need to quit it, go to the /Applications folder, and make a safe copy somewhere. Actually, my standard procedure is to create a zip archive of it (select it in Finder, then choose File menu > Compress). The zip archive won't get deleted, and is easier to save, copy around, etc than the application (which is actually a folder with complex internal structure). Anytime you want to reuse it, copy the archive to /Applications, double-click to expand, then double-click the expanded app to run it.\nThere is one hangup, though: the zip archive will be over 5GB, and the FAT32 volume format  (frequently used for flash disks and such) can't deal with files over 4GB. You may have to reformat disks to a more modern format, like exFAT or Mac OS Extended, in order to use them to store and transport the file.\nAnother option is to use the installer to convert a USB disk into a bootable (and reusable) install disk. This makes reinstalls much faster since the installer is stand-alone and bootable.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I make a bootable USB flash drive a Mac?\nEither use DiskMaker X, or do it yourself at the command line with the createinstallmedia tool hidden inside the installer application -- right-click the installer app, select Show Package Contents, then open Contents/Resources, drag the createinstallmedia tool into a Terminal window, and follow its instructions. You should end up with a command like this (assuming the disk you want to erase & convert into an installer is named \"Untitled\"):\nsudo \"/Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\" --volume \"/Volumes/Untitled\" --applicationpath \"/Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app\"\n\n\nA: DiskMaker X takes a bit of time for a USB, and beside the initial screen you will think it hangs, but it works, just look on the Led of your USB stick. In my case to revert from Yosemite (I do not tell you what I think about Yosemite and Apple Inc.) to Mavericks it took more or less 15 minutes to generate the installation on a USB 3.0.\n", "Q: Dock shows on only one screen on OS X Mavericks I understood that every display would behave independently on OS X Mavericks, and that it would get its own bar (top of the screen) and dock.\nHowever, the dock shows only on the main screen, and not on the other screen, is it normal?\n\nA: None of this works if you use a left or right positioned dock in Mavericks.  The dock will ONLY migrate with a Bottom mounted dock and ONLY if the monitor positions are set side-by-side (corner or top/bottom mounted will not work, at least as of 10.9.1 and 10.9.2 versions of OS X). Apparently, people who prefer left/right positioned docks (to maximize vertical space without hiding since most monitors are now wider than tall) are now second class citizens.  The now semi-opaque color is also much brighter for such left/right docks as well, which many seem to hate). \n\nA: The dock only shows on one display at a time. It is hidden on all other displays, but can be made visible just as you would any hidden dock. That is, moving your mouse cursor below the display you would like the dock to appear (or left/right depending on where your dock normally is). Then the dock will hide on it's current display and appear on that display.\n\nA: Please see this link:\nhttp://rwillgo.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/mac-os-x-mavericks-how-to-move-the-dock-from-one-display-to-another/\nThe gist of it is that you have to tap + hold + drag the mouse to the bottom of the screen for the dock to move.\n\nA: If you're using a stacked display configuration, as in main monitor with the secondary above, then the dock does not appear on the second display. If it can or does, I'd like to know because this is how I run my setup. \nIf you have them oriented right to left, then the dock will appear. In my limited experience, only one image of the dock appears at a time on whichever monitor you activate it on. You have to play with it, as the cursor motion seems to need to be elongated or dramatic or whatever. Not a big thing, just different.\nIt's there by default, trust me. HTH.\n\nA: The issue is nothing to do with which screen is active, and more to do with a \"safety feature\" that prevents the Dock from popping up too easily.\nTo get the dock to appear on another screen (active or inactive), you need to move the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen and keep moving past the bottom edge until the dock appears.\nLeaving the pointer at the bottom edge of the screen will not work.\nWith a Magic Trackpad,  it's a bit more fiddly - you can either take one giant fast swipe down past the bottom edge, or swipe down several times (about 4) in quick succession after the pointer has already hit the bottom of the screen.\nAnd, once again, you do not need to click on the screen to make it active before the Dock will appear.\n\nA: In order to make the dock switch from one screen to the other, you should \"jump\" with the mouse on the bottom of the screen you want it to be shown on.\nHere it is shown more: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5891?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US (look for \"Working with the Dock\")\n\nA: To bring the dock over to a different display:\nIf you've clicked on a display to make it active, note how the Menu Bar brightens. But you don't need to.\nWithout clicking the mouse again, move the cursor all the way down to the bottom of the screen. This is the same technique as if you had invoked System Preferences > Dock > \"Automatically hide and show the Dock.\"\nWhen the cursor touches the bottom, the Dock will rise up from the bottom and stay there on the selected display. (If you had previously enabled \"Automatically hide and show the Dock,\" it will disappear as you move the mouse upwards, but remain tied to that display.)\nTo move the Dock back to the main display (or any other display), repeat the process starting with Step #1.\n\nA: exactly correct. move the cursor to the next screen, all the way to the bottom and then keep scrolling as if to move it beyond the bottom for a second and the dock will appear. It does not do this if you just tap the bottom of the screen with the cursor, bouncing it off of the bottom so to speak, apparently because this may be an unintentional mouse movement. with a little practice, this becomes second nature.\n\nA: It worked fine here:\n\nMoving the dock to a second display is not straightforward but it’s easy to do. Assuming you are using an Apple Magic Mouse, you can tell OS X to move the dock to the active display by following these steps:\nFirst, click the desktop or any window on the display where you want the dock to move to. This will make the menu bar go active.\nThen, place your finger on the mouse while moving the cursor towards the bottom of the screen. The dock will them pop up.\n\n", "Q: If I update to Mavericks, will I be able to boot from USB? running a late 2009 (5,5) Macbook Pro. I am currently unable to boot from liveUSB disks, but would really like to. I know that newer macs can do this (Macbook Air, new MBPs), but is it a hardware or a software thing? If I update to Mavericks, would I be able to do this on my machine?\n\nA: It has nothing to do with the operating system. The update will not change your ability or inability to boot in any particular way.\nThe stage of the boot process you're talking about is handled by the firmware, not by the operating system.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set the *default* monospace font in Safari? I have a web application that uses the browser's default monospace font. It's set up that way so that the user can pick their own. In Chrome, this works well, as it's easy to set the default fonts, but in Safari, they removed the option.\nIs there some way for users to set default fonts in Safari?\n\nA: The following information was correct when it was posted, but now only applies to obsolete versions of Safari.\n\nThere are unexposed preferences for changing the default fonts and font sizes:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2StandardFontFamily Georgia\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2DefaultFontSize 16\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2FixedFontFamily Menlo\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2DefaultFixedFontSize 14\n\nAnother option is to edit the CSS file that defines the default styles (look in\nPreferences > Advanced > Stylesheet), adding something like this, for example:\n@font-face {\n   font-family: monospace;\n   src: local('Menlo');\n}\n\nThat rule makes any element that uses font-family: monospace (as well as elements like <pre> and <code> by default) use Menlo. Just change the font name (being careful to keep the enclosing quotes) to whatever you prefer.\n\nA: As of Safari 12, all options for doing so have been removed:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Appearance panel is (long) gone\n\n*The defaults keys are no longer respected\n\n*CSS @font-face definitions are limited to a built-in whitelist of local() values, ignoring any other fonts installed on the system, which is part of a broad package of anti-fingerprinting measures\n\n\nTaken together, this means there is no way to change the defaults away from Times for serif, Helvetica for sans-serif, and Courier for monospace.\n\nThe only thing you can still do is create a user stylesheet to style various elements directly. So for example you could change the default font family from serif to sans-serif:\nbody { font-family: sans-serif }\n\nOr you can even still name specific locally installed non-system fonts:\nbody { font-family: 'Open Sans' }\n\nUnfortunately while this works reasonably well for changing the default document font, it is complicated to use the same approach to restyle every element that defaults to a monospace font. I am not sure CSS can even fully emulate the default behaviour for such elements at all – whereas it was previously easy to do so by using either defaults or a user stylesheet with a @font-face rule for monospace (which simply redefined what monospace meant without touching the default styling itself, and so allowed the default behaviour to apply to that other font).\nI viscerally dislike reading large amounts of text set in Courier, so it looks like in the future I will have to use another browser to read RFCs…\n", "Q: What is the partition size needed for The Mavericks install disk? I will setup a USB key to install Mavericks.\nI would like to know the needed size of the partition to install Mavericks.\n\nA: The Mavericks install app is about 5.3GB and it is compressed. That should be how much space it will take up on a USB stick. Just drop the installer on the stick and double click on the installer to install.\n\nA: For me, the Mavericks partition uses 5.36 GB (5,355,311,104 Bytes) (per Disk Utility).  That's 4.98 GB in old-school \"binary\" types like me (4.98 GiB).\nThis is subject to change given partition overhead, block size, a Mavericks version.  So I'd allocate a little more to the partition.\n\nA: I have partitioned my 64 GB USB stick into two parts, one being 5 361 369 088 b large out of which 5 951 488 b is free after making it Mavericks installation disk.\n", "Q: terminal starts with `no such file or directory` message I removed Enthought Canopy from my Mac and now when I start terminal there's this warning message says \n-bash: /Users/myname/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/activate: No such file or directory\n-bash: /Users/myname/Library/Enthought/Canopy_32bit/User/bin/activate: No such file or directory\n\nof course they don't exist because I deleted the program. How do I remove the message?\n\nA: You need to edit your profile (.profile, .bashrc, .zshrc, .tcshrc, etc… that is appropriate for your chosen shell) and remove any lines that contain \"Enthought\". It might be a bit more complicated than just deleting a couple of lines depending on what it did to your login file.\n", "Q: osx mavericks update deleted all my files and apps from osx lion after osx mavericks update i lost all my files and apps from osx lion, is there any way to get it back ? \neverything was deleted what was on destop in osx lion, apps, pictures and etc.\n\nA: I ran into the same thing. Here is what I had to do to get everything back.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had to create a new dummy account.\n\n*While logged into the dummy account I found my old user home folder and renamed it something else.\n\n*I then created another user account named my original account name.\n\n*I proceeded to delete that account's home folder.\n\n*Then I renamed my old user home folder to the name of the newly created account\n\n*I logged into the newly made user account.\n\n*After that I went to the users folder and make my new account the owner of my home folder (it will still think your old account is the owner).\n\n*I applied the ownership to all enclosed items.\n\n*\n\n*You should see all your desktop and documents return.\nYou may have to log out and back in to have everything come back.\n\n\n\nAs for your apps.

Most of the applications should come over properly. I had to re-activate my MS office for mac. Everything else seemed to work fine.\n\nA: My roommate just had the same problem with his MacBook Air. Apparently it had logged him into a new user account which it created.\nCheck in /Macintosh HD/users/ to see if your old account is still there, if that is what happened. It should appear as a locked folder with your username.\nIf this is the case, log out of this account, and log into your original account. All your files should now be in their correct places.\nTo delete the new account go to System Preferences > Users, unlock to make changes, select the account (make sure you have the correct one selected), and hit the minus (-) sign at the bottom of the list.\n\nA: I believe what is being said is.... when you update to the new Operating System which isn't just an update...it's a full new Operating System, you automatically get a new Operating System User Account created. Then after the install, users are logging in to the new user account wondering where all their stuff is...including mail folders.\nIf you just log out of the operating system new user account and log back in with your usual user account and password, you should see ALL your stuff there as it was before. If so, THEN you can safely DELETE the new user account as it has nothing in it anyway (other than some recently downloaded emails likely).\nHope this helps. This may NOT be true for everyone reading this page but it was the problem for one user I new. She simply didn't even realize she was logged in to the Operating System as a different person or user account name.\n\nA: log out of new account, and log into your original(OLD) account.

I want to be projecting and changing text on my laptop at the same time.  Is this possible\n\nA: Not in presentation mode, no.  Presentation mode is intended solely for showing a PowerPoint deck, not for making edits to it.  \nIf you want to edit your presentation, you'll need to be in one of the other views, such as slide view.  If you want to make this as much like presentation mode as possible while still being able to edit your presentation, you can minimize the notes view at the bottom, minimize the notes view on the side, and hide the Ribbon by single-clicking on the Ribbon tab that is currently active.

I marked the messages as unread in gmail and they all appeared in my mac mail. I then marked them unread.\n\nA: A Mail update for Mavericks is now available.\nMail Update for Mavericks includes improvements to general stability and compatibility with Gmail, including the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fixes an issue that prevents deleting, moving, and archiving messages for users with custom Gmail settings\n\n*Addresses an issue that may cause unread counts to be inaccurate\n\n*Includes additional fixes that improve the compatibility and stability of Mail\n\n\nDownload here\n\nA: This is an answer but not an explanation. When I disabled 2-factor authentication on my Google account, all my messages appeared. I don't have any explanation why I was able to download 8 (new!) messages but not the others — if the computer couldn't authenticate, it would seem that none of them should show up. But that worked. Now for the why…\n\nA: I can confirm what Bob posted: open your GoogleMail or GoogleApps e-mail inbox directly in a browser and mark them all as \"unread\". Then sync your e-mails in Apple Mail by clicking \"Send & Receive All\" (or whatever it's called in the English Apple Mail user interface).\nThen, in your GoogleMail, mark them all as \"read\" and sync again.\nThat's it, the e-mails will show up correctly.\n\nA: I've just tried a lot of things, for now the best method seems to be only using my Mac for IMAP actions. If I do them on anything else, my Mac is inconsistent about updating it, which isn't exactly acceptable.\n\nA: For those struggling with this, two things:  #1.  There's an update for OSX today which supposedly deals with mail.  It didn't solve the problem for me, but it's worth updating anyway.  And #2.  Logging into my Google Settings security page (not to be confused with Gmail settings) DID SOLVE this issue for me, though I have absolutely no idea why.  Following a suggestion on this page, I logged into Gmail to check to see if I'd enabled 2-step authentication.  I had NOT, which means I didn't change it...  but when I clicked back over to Apple's Mail app, suddenly, all of my messages were there even though I did nothing other than log into my Google settings page to check my settings (but, again, I did not change them).\nSo, for me, this issue was solved (temporarily?) by simply logging into my Google settings security page.  YMMV, but definitely be sure to log into your Google Settings.\nI should note that I'd given up on Mail since upgrading to Mavericks once I realized messages weren't being delivered.  I switched to the Airmail app (it's ok).  Interestingly, Airmail seem to receive all messages, including the ones that Apple's Mail did not.\n\nA: Here are the steps to get back deleted GMail on Mavericks.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you open mail, you’ll see the sidebar where the folders were before. \n\n*You’ll see these options: MAILBOXES, ON MY MAC, SMARTMAILBOXES \n\n*Hover your mouse over “ON MY MAC” and then click “Show”. The folders should be back. \n\n\nContent from- http://www.askiyogi.com/gadget/40845.html\nHope it helps! \n", "Q: Cannot unlock password protected SSH key in OS X Mavericks I just upgraded to OSX 10.9, and when trying to establish an SSH connection with public key authentication, a prompt appears asking for my SSH key password.\nI initially thought that the upgrade caused the keychain to forget some passwords, so I re-entered mine.

In Lion and Mountain Lion Mail, the \"Mailbox List\" included an entry for flagged messages, with an sub-entry for each kind of flag. This appears to have been removed in Mavericks Mail. Is there a (perhaps hidden) setting to restore this, or is it gone; and if so, how can I get a list of my flagged messages (of each kind).\n\nI've tried creating a \"Smart Mailbox\", but that doesn't seem to work.\n\nA: I had this problem -- the \"Flagged\" folder disappeared from the Mail app and no longer contained any flagged messages, even though I could see that my messages still had flags if I logged into the iCloud website and looked at them there.\nFor me, the solution was to rebuild my Inbox in the Mail app.  Select the mailbox you want to rebuild (\"Inbox\" in this case), go to the Mailbox menu, and select \"Rebuild\" at the bottom of the menu.  It could take a minute or two, depending on how many messages you have.  Suddenly Mail recognized all the flags again, and my Flagged folder re-appeared with my flagged messages in it.\n\nA: Select the inbox in question, then the mailbox menu and \"rebuild\". We had this issue on 3 machines in my office and length rebuild was required. I've noted the flags show up if you surf to one of the flagged emails...it's as if \"touching\" the emails is required for the data to be triggering the flag functionality...rebuild must have the same effect. \n\nA: The flagged message folder isn't missing on any of the 5 Macs I have upgraded to 10.9 so I'm concluding that the folder isn't intentionally being removed as a matter of design.\nI suspect you have some database corruption or another error (perhaps gmail two factor authentication) causing the missing folder.\nHave you reached out to Apple support? They typically offer free support within 90 days of any \"purchase\" and it would be interesting to see how they handle a \"purchase\" for a free app.\n\nA: The databases associated with your mailboxes are probably corrupted and need to be rebuilt. Simply choosing \"Rebuild\" from the \"Mailbox\" menu is worth a try, but is unlikely to do the trick. If it doesn't, the following steps will fix the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Mail.\n\n*Remove all of the \"Envelope Index\" files from the ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/ folder by opening the folder in Finder (⇧+⌘+G) and deleting all files whose names that begin with \"Envelope Index\". After deleting these files you should \"Secure Empty\" the Trash to be sure they're gone.\n\n*Relaunch Mail and wait. This will take quite some time: many hours if you have a lot of messages.\n\n\n*Once Mail is fully launched, search your mailboxes (⌥+⌘+F) for \"flagged\" messages and wait again.\n\nThis can also take a surprisingly long time during which it will sometimes appear that nothing is happening, but patience will be rewarded as your flagged messages begin to appear.\nDepending on how serious and extensive your database corruption is, it's possible that not all of these steps is needed. You might simply try the last step alone and see if it works. However, the missing flags are likely a sign of a problem that will manifest itself in other ways, so the surest approach is to do all the steps above.\n\nA: My flagged messages also disappeared, but they showed up again by themselves as I was reading this page. Seems to have \"rebuilt\" themselves.\n\nA: Rebuild Mailboxes didn't work for me, but it turns out flags are actually part of Spotlight. I forced a re-index:\n\n\n*\n\n*drag the drive where your mail folders live (usually your boot drive) to the the Privacy tab in System Preferences → Spotlight.\n\n*log out, log in.\n\n*drag the drive back out of the privacy list and wait while your Mac re-indexes.\n\n\nI found I also had to sort my mailboxes by the flagged column, then click on each flagged item in turn.\nThis solved my issue, and is mentioned in an Apple discussion here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5479534\n", "Q: Can I change the color of the current date in Mavericks Calendar? Unlike previous versions of Calendar, Mavericks Calendar uses a color to indicate the current day.

I am trying to locate my pictures in guest account but am unable to find it. How can I retrieve these?\n\nA: On an Apple guest account, the home directory is wiped each time you logout or shutdown. That's why it's called a 'guest account', because it is meant to be temporary. \nYou will need a tool to recover deleted files if they have not been overwritten by new files in the time between when they were deleted and now.\n\nA: There is no way to recover those pictures unless you're willing to try out some paid tools for recovering information from a disk (there's no guarantee even in that case).\nA guest account is temporary - a home folder is created only for the duration while the user is logged in.

Will Pages/Keynote/Numbers (ex. iWork) be free for old macs?\n\nA: It appears that everyone that owns an older copy of iWork for iOS gets a free upgrade whether or not your version came from a retail CD or the Mac App Store.\nIf you don't already own iWork - you will have to pay for either a new Mac or the apps piecemeal on the App Store.\nThe above summary is my understanding of this MacWorld article that includes calls with Apple Press relations and an \"on-the-record\" confirmation that all owners of iWork should get free upgrades despite some glitches in the initial roll out today.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.macworld.com/article/2056159/what-you-need-to-know-about-apples-free-apps-policy.html\n\nA: In addition to upgrades for users of existing/previous installs of iWork, it has been shown that the logic that handles identifying whether you are eligible for an upgrade does not take into account whther your install was a trial or retail edition.  In some cases, users with a trial version installed have found that upgrades were provided.  It should be noted that the trial versions are no longer available for download officially.\n\nA: No. It can be downloaded for free only for Macs purchased on or after October 1, 2013 (source).\n", "Q: How do I permanently disable Notification Center in Mavericks? In Mountain Lion I was able to permanently disable Notification Center, with no apparent side effects:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\nHowever, the Mavericks upgrade process restored Notification Center in all its irritating glory. Is there are reason that the upgrade reverted my disabling of Notification Center? \nCan I disable Notification Center in Mavericks using the same procedure, without side effects?\n\nA: If you start Terminal, enter\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool False\n\nand restart, this did the trick for me in Mavericks.\n\nA: Just unloading the plist still works for me:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\n\nIf the plist is not loaded, sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui KeepAlive -bool False should have no effect.\n\nA: You will have side effects if you upgrade to Yosemite (Beta 2).\nThe notification icon on the menu bar re-appeared, but clicking it just makes the icon itself flash briefly. I am able to slide the panel from the right of my magic trackpad, but otherwise can't fix the menu bar to either fully disable or reenable it.\n\nA: actually I came up with a much more straightforward way. Simply remove the Notification app which is located in /System/Library/CoreServices/.\nTo do so you first have to kill the process otherwise finder won't let you delete it since it's already running (do a little top to get its PID). Then just move the .app file to the thrash.\nAt reboot it's as if it's never been there.\nAnd since I simply remove the .app and don't touch any config files, I don't see how I could get any side effects (but please correct me if i'm wrong).\n\nA: In Mavericks you cannot control the notification center, because you will make FaceTime unusable. If you get an incoming call, no window appears.\nSo you cannot accept the incoming call.\nI did not check other OS Versions.\nI think, there is no solution. All the code is Spaghetti.\nIf you switch one thing off, you break another.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade the SSD on late 2013 retina Mac Book Pro? Do the late 2013 models (13\" - (ME864LL/A, ME865LL/A, ME866LL/A), 15\" - (ME293LL/A, ME294LL/A)) support after market SSD upgrades? If so, is a drive that works with the late 2012/ early 2013 rMBPs compatible with the late 2013 models?\nAlthough not officially supported - A couple sources (EveryMac, OWC) indicate the late 2012/ early 2013 rMBPs support after market SSD upgrades. \n[Update]\nifixit posted a teardown here indicating in step 8 that:\n\nThe proprietary SSD has changed to a PCIe format, but still isn't a standard\n  2.5\" drive. However, it is a separate daughtercard, and we’re hopeful we can\n  offer an upgrade in the near future.\n\n\nA: The current OWC PCIe SSD's for Macbook Pro Retina's 10,1/2 work for the 2012/early2013 models. Not the Late 2013 models (11,1 (13-inch models) & 11,2 (2.0 GHz 15-inch model) & 11,3 (2.3 GHz 15-inch model) ID#'s).\nThey claim they will release compatible upgrades \"for next year\". So, I guess, not until 2014. Could be sooner, I don't know the history of their estimates->outcomes of SSD releases for pre-announced/expected products.\n\nA: Update (5/24/2016)\nSalvation is here!  OWC has released SSD upgrades for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display 13\" & 15\" Late 2013, 2014, and 2015\n\nA: Yes, you can. As OWC says the late 2013 MacBook Pro with retina display uses a separated SSD drive like the old gen. However this time Apple went with PCI Express instead of the old SATA drive. The current OWC alternative SSDs are not compatible with the latest generation. But OWC promises that they will offer the products for the latest model \"in near future\", and from my past experiences I estimate that it will come to us around April 2014.\n\nA: You can upgrade using Samsung XP941 series drives. 128GB, 256GB or 512GB available. Very expensive at this time though.\n\nA: The connector on the XP941 is different from the connector on the SSD PCIe cards used in the late MacBook Pros.  \n", "Q: Calendar issue on OS X Mavericks When I try to open Calendar I'm told \"You can't use this version of the application 'Calendar' with this version of OS X. You have Calendar 6.0.\"\nAny ideas why this could be happening? I just uprgaded to OS X 10.9 Mavericks from OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion today.\n\nA: It would appear that the upgrade has failed to update your Calendar app. OS X 10.9 has Calendar v7.0 and if you do have 6.0 then something went wrong.\nI would suspect that there is some serious problem with your existing Calendar app such as permissions.\nDelete your Calendar app and either grab a copy from another Mavericks Mac or re-install 10.9.\nIf you go the re-install route I would be tempted to do a reformat and clean install myself, just to make sure there are no hidden gotchas since you already have one. At the least I would boot into recovery mode and run \"Fix Permissions\" before the re-install.\n\nA: Perhaps you inadvertently made a copy of the calendar application. Make sure that the application you are trying to launch is contained in your Applications folder.\nOne way to do this is using spotlight (CMD-Space), type \"calendar\", then click the result which has \"Applications\" in the context menu to the left.\n\nA: I find I usually have better luck with doing complete formats and installs of new operating systems. As others have pointed out, sometimes steps in the update don't write over existing files they should because the permissions got messed up somewhere along the way.\nFirst, please make sure your user data is backed up (a couple of times) and validate that you can read it from the other source.\nThen reinstall using OS X Installer.  You'll need to use the Disk Utility to format the drive clean.\n", "Q: Does Mavericks Support MTP? Does Mavericks add support for MTP devices e.g. Android/Windows Phone?\nI cannot find any mention of it.\n\nA: Mavericks does NOT support MTP natively.  You can use Android File Transfer for MTP file system access or one of many other apps like Dropbox, or AirDroid for file sharing that does not use MTP.\n", "Q: Chrome back/forward gestures no longer working after Mavericks update Has anyone else noticed their 1 finger back/forward gestures no longer working in Chrome?\nI have tried the gestures on other applications such as Safari and Mission Control, they are all still intact.\n\nA: Make sure you enable: System preferences > Mouse > Swipe between pages\nAND OPEN A NEW TAB in Chrome\nIf you had it working before but then it stopped working suddenly (usually after an OS / Application update) you might just have to uncheck / recheck the \"Swipe between pages\" option. That should solve it.\n\nA: In System preferences > Trackpad > Swipe between pages (under more gestures tab)\nUncheck it and recheck it. \nShould work in Chrome now. You may need to do it when first installing Chrome or updating Chrome.\n\nA: Make sure you enable: System preferences > Mouse > Swipe between pages\n\nA: I disabled my chrome extension (crxMouse), and the problem is gone.\n\nA: Yes, I've noticed that too. I already reported that error to Google via the Chrome's Options panel -> tools -> report errors.\nHopefully they'll fix it soon!\n\nA: Do you have Better Touch Tool installed?  If so, uninstall it as it doesn't play nice with Mavericks atm.  Also if you dont have it installed, I changed the tracking speed, as I had previously set it with Better Touch Tool.\nI'm pretty sure it's not an issue with Chrome.\n\nA: There is a bug report already on the Chrome forums. Check it out here and add your info too.\nIt seems to be a sporadic problem; I have the issue every hour or so, but my colleague doesn't get it at all.\n\nA: Mine stopped working too, but realised I had installed a chrome plugin called 'SmoothScroll' (or something similar).  Uninstalling this gave me my gestures back, Happy times! \n\nA: This is a Chrome bug which is fixed in the 64-bit Beta which I use. It's a beta but works fairly well, I haven't noticed any problems except the headbar occasionally not retracting in presentation mode.\n\nA: I ran into this issue a while back as well.  When I looked at my Chrome extensions, I had one enabled called Smooth Scroll.  When I disabled that extension, my gesture swipe returned to normal.  Hope that helps.\n\nA: I can confirm this annoying bug. \nThe magic mouse right swipe for \"back\" doesn't work most of the time, but does after swiping with the trackpad once.\nChrome 60\nmacOs 10.13 public beta 5\n\nA: I too faced the same issue before chrome update, after the update Version 69.0.3497.100 (Official Build) (64-bit) issue is resolved.\n", "Q: Has anyone working Parallel 7 on Mavericks?

Looking over usage, of the 16GB of installed memory...on average it uses 10-14 GB RAM when barely running a few apps!!! \nThere is this kernel_task that is always running with over 1GB of RAM and most apps are not taking that much RAM, so what is using up all my RAM?! File cache? It shows very high in that new description, with about 1/3 of my total RAM\n\nA: Have you checked if Spotlight is indexing the hard drive? \nI found that for about 2 hours after installing Mavericks, my computers needed to perform this task, which took up a lot of system resources.\nYou can disable this indexing (guide here) and check whether it freed up any memory, which has been suggested by some to be the case in similar situations.\n\nA: Who said that this memory use is bad in any way? At the very least, the OS will be using the memory so that it can spin down your hard drive at the first opportunity. Hard drive access is energetically expensive. RAM is already powered up, so letting it sit idle is truly wasteful.\nThe question is a yet another post in the style of \"oh no my ram is all used up, bad [insert your bogeyman here]\". Let's get it out of the way: RAM should be always fully utilized. You paid for it, you're paying to keep it powered up, it's really counterproductive for all this money to go to waste.\nIf your computer feels slow right after updating, it's true that the indexing service may be to blame. Let it stay on overnight, make sure you get a full Time Machine backup done, and see what transpires next. Don't get hung up over RAM consumption - without some rather technical understanding of what those numbers mean, you can't make any use of them. They are red herring. It's a curiously recurring pattern.\n\nA: I am having the same problem, but also seeing a degradation in performance, system hangs and app crashes. I do photography and some of those apps, especially Lightroom, NEVER give up memory that they have taken, even after you quit them!\nI talked to mac support and was told that if you open your apps to full screen/maximize, everything behind them will go into app nap mode. He said that is the best way to take advantage of Maverick memory capabilities - let each app take the whole screen and ctrl-tab between them. Unfortunately, that is not how I work,and doesn't work well for my needs. It might help you out tho.\nI used to be able to do a \"purge\" from a terminal app and clear out unused memory, but maverick does not allow me to do that anymore. I would keep an eye on memory and just type purge now and then and things were fine. I am searching for a way to do that in Maverick. If not, I may have to do a restore from time machine as I am unable to do my work. \nI installed Maverick more than 5 days ago so I would think it should be done indexing. macbook retina pro, 16gb, kernal is using 1.13gb, page file is about 8Gb.\n\nA: RAM is there to be used.  It is a place for your computer to keep the most frequently used data so it doesn't have to fetch it from disk which is much slower (could be 50-60 times slower).  The RAM in your Mac Mini is 1600MHz DDR3 if you upgraded at time of purchasing.  This is capable of about 12800MB/s transfer.  The HDD if it's a physical one is a 5400rpm drive capable of 200-300MB/s.  So you want your RAM to be fully utilised.  It's no use to you when it's free.\nWith that in mind, your problem is not how much RAM is in use but rather, why your computer is slow.  The best way to determine that is to see which programs are accessing the HDD.  You can read all about how OSX manages memory on Apples support site.\nAs pointed out in this Superuser answer:\n\nMavericks introduced \"memory compression\" which is, more or less,\n  another layer of swap. Active pages now get classified inactive, then\n  compressed (which might show up as Kernel memory depending on what\n  tools you are using,) then written to swap as memory usage increases.\n  Mavericks has also has stopped showing separate numbers for active and\n  inactive in Activity Monitor, since it turns out not to be a useful\n  thing to look at, especially given the misconceptions surrounding it.\n\nAs suggested by other people, a hard-drive index or full system backup would be a major culprit of disk activity slowing your machine so I'd look there first.  You can also disable the spotlight indexing in Terminal if you wish like so:\nDisable: sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\nEnable: sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\nI would try turning off indexing temporarily, perform a full backup, when you've done both of those then re-assess the performance of your Mac and if you still have issues then use Activity Monitor to see what else is performing Disk I/O.\n\nA: Memory clean app sovled my problem.\n\nA: I have the same problem, and I want to clarify one point the TS/OP mentions; the activity window doesn't account for all the ram that is used. Combined, the stuff showing in the window doesn't add up to the crazy amount being used some where secret...\nMy answer would be, let time pass and see if it'll go away by itself, there might indexing or updating going on under the hood.\n\nA: Others have asked, but how are you determining RAM usage? Via top in the command line, I see the following on my Mac Mini (2012) with 8GB of RAM:\n\nPhysMem: 3861M used (919M wired), 4328M unused\n\nWhich seems right.  But if I run htop—which is an improved version of top I have compiled & installed on my own—I see the following.\n\nMem[|||||||||||||||||||7762/8192MB]\n\nWhich to me reads as if I am only 512MB away from swapping.  Which is all to say that you might be reading the data incorrectly & something else on your setup is causing a bottleneck.  I’m quite happy with the speed & responsiveness of Mac OS X 10.9 on my setup. No issues.  More stable than Mac OS X 10.8.\n", "Q: Create bootable drive from command line New with 10.9 is the ability to easily create a bootable drive from the installer that is downloaded from the App Store, with a single command createinstallmedia in the Terminal.  This link at MacWorld has details.\nI encountered a problem with this, with an Error -9999 when trying to erase the USB drive I had inserted.\nThe error occurred while booted into 10.6.8; but since that particular computer also has a 10.8 partition, I booted from it and tried the same command with the same USB drive.  It was able to erase and create the boot drive successfully.\nDon't know how widespread this problem is; but, if this occurs to someone else who does not have the newer OS available to boot into, I'm wondering if there is any other way to fix the error; or if the Disk Utility methods of creating the boot drive will need to be used.\n\nA: This is a temporary issue in that running the script from an OS older than 10.9 seems to error out.\nCan you take your image to a Machine that's already updated to run the script? You'd need two USB drives unless you're OK erasing the one holding the download before you know the script works.\n", "Q: In Mavericks' Activity Monitor, what is a \"Zombie?\" I have Nginx installed; compiled via MacPorts, and configured to launch on start-up. When I go to the Disk tab of Activity Monitor after installing Mavericks, the nginx process(es) is listed with a kind of \"Zombie,\" or sometimes \"64 bit, Zombie.\" What does this mean?\n\n\nA: According to wikipedia, a zombie process is  a process that has completed executing, but still has an entry in the process table. In other words, a zombie process has finished executing, but it hasn't been cleaned up yet.\nWhen a process finishes, its return code needs to be returned to the parent process. Normally, this happens immediately, so you don't see the zombie process. However, sometimes, the parent process doesn't cooperate, and the zombie stays in the process table indefinitely.\nIf you want to get rid of a zombie process, you have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait. Hopefully it'll clear up on its own.\n\n*Send a SIGCHLD to the zombie's parent. If it's behaving correctly, it'll fetch the return code of the zombie process, and the system can then reap the zombie process.\n\n*Kill the parent process. When you kill a process, its children are adopted by init, which will clean everything up for you.\n\n", "Q: how to enable continuous scrolling in iBooks 1.0 for OSX Mavericks? According to press reports, Apple promised that the new iBooks app for OSX Mavericks would include an option to read books in continuous scrolling mode. Did this come to pass, and if so, how does one enable this?\n\nA: Continuous scrolling is available for iBooks on iOS but not the Mac. The Mac version of iBooks only allows pagination.\n", "Q: Mavericks lock screen doesn't show screen saver Prior to upgrading to Mavericks, when I chose to lock my MacBook Pro's screen, it would do so with my screen saver options (rotate through images in a folder, and show a clock). However, when I go to lock my screen now, it's simply a black screen.\nIs there a way to make Mavericks use my screen saver settings when I choose to lock my screen as with older versions of OS X?\n\nA: Check system preference -> Security & Privacy -> General-> Require password XXX after sleep or screen saver begins\n\nA: Set one of the hot corners to start the screen safer. \nThe lock sends the display to sleep in mavericks - there's no option to change it afaik\n", "Q: Which iCloud account does iBooks use to sync? Does the new iBooks app for OS X Mavericks sync notes, bookmarks, read position, etc. using one's iCloud account, or one's iTunes Store account? \nIn other words, if two people use separate Apple IDs for their iCloud accounts, but use the same Apple ID for the iTunes Store to share purchases, will their read positions and notes remain distinct or conflict with each other?\n\nA: The iBooks app on iOS as well as OS X Mavericks uses the account you use to sign into the iBooks Store for syncing bookmarks, notes, collections, highlights and purchased books. So if you share an Apple ID/iTunes Store Account for purchases from the iBooks Store, then the sync will affect all the users who share the account.\nThe iBooks sync is not based on one's individual iCloud account, which is used for iMessage, FaceTime, Mail, Calendar, etc.\nSee iBooks: How to sync iBooks between devices for more information.\n\nA: The iTunes Store account's Apple ID (not the iCloud account). And so, yes, the reading locations will be synced unless you disable that option.\n\nA: It seems to use both. From what I can tell, the iCloud account syncs your bookmarks etc., while the \"collections\" are stored in your store account. My wife and I use the same store account but have different iCloud accounts. While we have our own highlights and bookmarks, our collections lists are the same.\n\nA: I have a different Apple ID for iCloud and the iTunes Store. When I tried to download from the iBooks Store using macOS El Capitan iBooks it would only accept my iCloud ID -- though if I'd purchases anything from iBooks that would have been through my iTunes Store ID. (I don't purchase from iBook Store because of problems like this).\nI Francisco is correct about the sync, but there is something odd about purchase sync.\n", "Q: How to delay hibernation after sleep in Mac mini?

It's no longer working in Mavericks.\n\n\nA: cmd + drag does the job! This got me trying for a while.\n\nA: The reverse of this operation is holding command, then dragging the folder back out. The problem of having unwanted folder or files linked and residing on the toolbar confounded me for a long time. It had had the effect of making the Spotlight window INVISIBLE when in Finder. \n\nA: I was looking for the same thing. The closest solution I could find was to add the app to the sidebar.

It means the data contains some Ascii (Basic Latin) character, and for some reason, a fallback font is used.\nIt’s more difficult to say. On the pages in the screen shot, the text rendered that way have Arial set as the primary way, so it almost looks like Arial was somehow replaced by LastResort in your computer. But this would affect the page more widely, and your use of the computer in general, so it’s probably something in Safari.\nI would first try re-installing Safari.\n", "Q: missing /usr/bin/gnutar on Mavericks (MacPorts) MacPorts is complaining about missing /usr/bin/gnutar on Mavericks\n:info:extract sh: /usr/bin/gnutar: No such file or directory\n\ngnutar is indeed not there anymore.\nAs suggested here I tried to change the tar command in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf:\ntar_command=/usr/bin/tar -0\n\nwith no effect.\nAny suggestion? Did I configure tar_command in the wrong file? Is there another workaround?\n\nA: My dirty hack was a symlink to system tar command.\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/tar /usr/bin/gnutar\n\n\nA: I downloaded the sources from:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/tar/\nCompiled the usual GNU way:\n./configure\nmake\n\nAfterwards I manually copied the generated binary as /usr/bin/gnutar. I am not sure were it is built, but I believe it was as ./src/tar\nOf course, this was just a quick hack to install new ports. I would not upgrade all the ports (as recommended for OS upgrades) until there is an official MacPorts version supporting Mavericks.\nAlso, remember to delete that file before the next MacPorts version. Just to keep things clean.\n\nA: The problem is that your version of MacPorts was not built on Mavericks and assumes the tools that were there when it was installed are still available. Since this is no longer the case, you should re-install MacPorts, which will automatically fix this issue.\nSince there is no binary installer for Mavericks at the moment, you will have to build from source instead. Make sure you have installed the Command Line Tools using xcode-select --install before you attempt to run ./configure in the MacPorts source tree. See http://guide.macports.org/#installing.macports.subversion for a how-to.\nIf you don't want to build a development version from source, a binary installer will be made available in the next few days.\nEdit: A binary installer for Mavericks (for the 2.2.1 bugfix release) is now available: https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1-10.9-Mavericks.pkg.\nNote that you should still run xcode-select --install in any case, even if you do have Xcode installed and use the binary installer.\nSince this keeps getting referenced: If you just updated to Mavericks you should also follow https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration.\n\nA: Edit:\nThis is not a permanent Solution!

I received my MacBook Pro yesterday. After unboxing, I used it for some time and then I fully charged the battery. I will be using this laptop as my primary device.\nSo, my question is, if I use my MacBook about 7-8 hours a day with the charger plugged in, will it be harmful for the battery? What is the recommended way?\n\nA: To get the most out of your MacBook Pro's battery, follow the Notebook Battery advice from Apple: unplug and use your battery until empty about once a month, then charge back up to full.\nIf you need help following Apple's advice, use Battery Guardian; it is free and will remind you when to deplete your battery.\n", "Q: Add a value to CustomPapers' plist using Terminal I'm trying to add a printer to CustomPapers' .plist using this terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.print.custompapers.plist 165x165 -dict-add <bottom>0</bottom><custom>1</custom><height>467.71653555</height><id>'165x165'</id><left>0</left><name>'165x165'</name><printer> </printer><right>0</right><top>0</top><width>467.71653555</width>\n\nPlease can someone suggest where I've gone wrong with this and if a dictionary item exists with the key \"165x165\" that it should not add the item.\n\nA: You have to quote the value, remove -dict-add, and use for example <key>name</key><string>165x165</string> instead of <name>165x165</name>:\ndefaults write com.apple.print.custompapers 165x165 '<dict><key>bottom</key><real>0</real><key>custom</key><true/><key>height</key><real>467.71653555</real><key>id</key><string>165x165</string><key>left</key><real>0</real><key>name</key><string>165x165</string><key>printer</key><string> </string><key>right</key><real>0</real><key>top</key><real>0</real><key>width</key><real>467.71653555</real></dict>'\nThis checks if the key exists:\nif defaults read com.apple.print.custompapers 165x165 &> /dev/null; then echo 'the key exists'; fi\n", "Q: What has been deprecated or removed in OS X 10.9, Mavericks? For the last couple of releases of OS X, there have been some parts of the OS and the utilities that have been simplified or removed compared to the previous release. Especially as seem from a power users point-of-view.\nTwo examples from past releases are the scaled down AirPort Utility (version 6.0) and the limitations in \"Sharing\" System Preference panel that used to be able to manage FTP servers - both changes have been rather annoying in my book!\nSo, before I \"upgrade\" to Mavericks, I would like to know if there are anything specific that will be \"downgraded\" in the same process.\n\nA: As mentioned in the Apple support communities, it apparently won't be possible to synchronize calendars and contacts between the Mac and an iPhone via USB connection or local WLAN anymore. The only remaining directly supported option would be via cloud synchronization (e.g., iCloud).\n", "Q: How do I sum up specific things in Numbers?

I think I need to use the SUMIF() function but I get stuck afterwards.\n\nA: You are correct in that you need to use the SUMIF function.\nThis is the specification from the Function Browser:\nSUMIF(test-values, condition, sum-values)\n\nTry this in your cell:\n=SUMIF(CATEGORY; \"=HW\"; POINTS)\n\n", "Q: How to specify command to always run as root? In Mountain Lion, I frequently used a simple automator app called \"Purge Memory\" which just ran \"purge\" in the command line. I really enjoyed cleaning the RAM, especially when buggy apps ran memory leaks. \nBut now in Mavericks purge requires root privileges, breaking my app. I know I can open terminal and input it, but that is not nearly as convenient.\nI have heard that on Unix you can allow a specific command to always run as root. That way I could automate purge. I would like to know if anyone knows how to do this or if this would even solve the problem?\n\nA: You could use a Run AppleScript action that runs do shell script \"purge\" with administrator privileges. It requires entering a password though.\nIf you don't want to enter a password, add %localaccounts ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/purge to sudoers. (Run sudo visudo, press i, type or paste the text, press escape, and type :wq.) Then use a Run Shell Script action that runs sudo purge.\n\nA: I disagree about purging unused RAM being useless. I have 8GB of RAM, and when free RAM gets down to a several MBs, my Mac gets very sluggish, and it's even hard to switch Finder windows without it being really slow. The purge command fixes that right up. \nNow Mavericks uses compressed memory, so you aren't supposed to need such things, but I still find that my Mac gets unresponsive when there is not enough free RAM. Typing \"sudo purge\" into terminal freed up 2GB of RAM, and things are nice and snappy again. \n", "Q: Truncated “Recent Items” Label in OS X Mavericks General Preferences I’ve just upgraded to OS X Mavericks (Build 13A603) and discovered a truncated label in General Preferences.

Since there's no way to change the size of System Fonts in the GUI, I used the TinkerTool utility to reset to defaults.\nIt was the fixed-pitch font that was incorrect, and TinkerTool had it highlighted.

Is there any particular reason(s) why people shouldn't upgrade to OS X Mavericks straight away from Mountain Lion, Lion or Snow Leopard, rather than waiting say a period of 2 months eg for reasons of bugs etc (which maybe fixed in this time) ?\nEdit:\nI am looking for legitimate reasons only (obviously).\n\nA: Having used every Mavericks beta since beta 1, including the GM, as well as the final version, I can quite confidently say that everyone should upgrade straight away.\nWhilst the many betas of Mavericks have had many bugs, the GM seemed to do away with almost all of these. For example, in every beta before GM, I suffered from an awful bug whereby you couldn't actually put the Mac to sleep - it would have to be shut down, since clicking Sleep or closing the lid wouldn't do anything. This was fixed along with many more bugs in the GM.\nWith my poor internet, I was considering keeping the Mavericks GM for a while, since I saw no incentive to update - there wasn't any problem that I was hoping that the public version would fix1.\nIt would appear that Apple's done it right this time, using the GM as the 10.9.0 and the public release as the 10.9.1.\nIn conclusion, I believe that people should upgrade from Mountain Lion to Mavericks without hesitation - there's no massive bugs from what I can tell, and I see no major reason for Apple to expedite the release of 10.9.1 to fix a serious problem.\n1 (unlike my experience with the Mountain Lion beta - the public release couldn't come soon enough)\n", "Q: Does Mavericks support OpenCL?

I am in design as well and it's a very frustrating 'update' from Apple. \n\nA: My custom profiles were deleted and the system was reset to the default profile - you'll have to recalibrate your screen.\n\nA: Mine were reverted to a default, but my original profiles were there and listed in System Preferences -> Display -> Color.\n\nA: Yes, Apple changed the color profile in Mavericks. You can see the difference immediately. The black is not black, it's more like dark brown.\nThere is one way to get best color accuracy.

The trick is to create an alias in /Applications to the application's .app dir/bundle, and then to tell Alfred to include macOS aliases in search results.\nI use Homebrew-installed Emacs as an example below because generalizing the instructions would make the language awkward. Extending the example ought to be trivial.\nFirst, create a macOS alias (not a symlink):\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, press Cmd+Shift+G and use Tab auto-complete to enter the path of the directory containing \"Emacs.app\" (In my case, this is currently /opt/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-mac/emacs-27.2-mac-8.3)\n\n*Press Cmd+N to open a new Finder window, then Cmd+Shift+A to go to /Applications\n\n*Create the alias by Cmd+Opt dragging \"Emacs.app\" from the homebrew window to the /Applications window.\n\nNow, let's make Alfred include macOS aliases in search results:\n\n*\n\n*Open Alfred's preferences (alfred 4.7), navigate to Features > Default Results click Advanced.... A popup window will open that allows you to add file types that will be shown in search results.\n\n*Drag the Emacs.app alias from the Finder /Applications window to the popup window. The new entry should read com.apple.alias-file  |  alias\n\n*Close the popup and try searching for 'emacs'. The result list should include the \"Emacs.app\" alias.\n\nThe alias will fail at every update that changes the versioned path to the app in the Cellar, which happens to be emacs-27.2-mac-8.3 at writing. The correct solution to the underlying problem is to fix Alfred so it picks up applications installed to /opt. A hacky alternative might be to hook into homebrew and recreate the alias when needed.\nI'll probably manually recreate the alias each time it breaks so that the breakage can serve as a reminder to check for an upstream fix to the underlying problem.\n\nA: Found the answer here.\nI needed to add the Homebrew cellar path to the list of paths under Features | Default Results | Search Scope, and then Alfred recursively scanned it and found Emacs. \nOn my Mac the path was /usr/local/Cellar.\nAnd there was great rejoicing!\n\nA: I actually came across this back in March with the release of Alfred 2 and documented my solution here: http://blog.victorquinn.com/alfred-2-and-emacs\nPerhaps that'll help you.\n\nA: Alfred Preference >> Features >> Default Results >> Search Scope\nin Search Scope: \nFinder Folder Clicked and Just Drag and Drop!

The second is quite involved and requires a lot of technical know how.\nMethod one:\nBuy a new drive with an enclosure. Replace the failing drive with the new one.  Put your old drive in the enclosure, install Mac OS X on the fresh drive and transfer your data from the old drive. \nHowever that is not what you requested.\nMethod two:\nThe second method is to use the dd command and ssh via terminal. The two machines will need to be on the same network, and will need to be able to see each other.\nI've looked up both your machines on everymac.com and will assume that your dying drive is 500GB and the new one has 1TB.  \nYou will need more than 600GB of free space on the new machine for this to work and you need to know what you are doing.\nYou need to download and burn a copy of any selfbooting Linux distribution (I have tested this with an old copy of Ubuntu 12.04 I have lying around). \nOnce you have the disk burned you need to boot your dying machine with the DVD/CD you just created by holding the alt key while your machine reboots, then selecting the media in your DVD drive to boot from.\nYou will need to set up your old iMac on your network, I would use cables rather than wifi (because there is less to go wrong and it is easier).\nMake sure both your old and new machines can \"see\" each other via ping. \nOn your mac open System Preferences>Network>Ethernet.  \nConfigure the IPs:\nI used the IP 10.10.0.1 and subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, on the \"Linux\" mac I used 10.10.0.2 with the same subnet mask. From the command line on either machine you should be able to ping 10.10.0.1 and 10.10.0.2 before you proceed to the next step.\n\nEnable remote login on your new machine.\nFind the partition on your old mac you want to copy via Linux command line.  This is most probably going to be /dev/sda\nYou will need to be root on your \"Linux\" machine so do sudo -s\nFrom your old machine (Linux) issue the command (via the shell):\ndd if=/dev/sda | gzip -1 - | ssh user@hostname dd of=image.gz\nThis assumes that the drive on your old machine you want to copy is called /dev/sda, you will need to replace user with your username on your new machine, and hostname is the IP address of your new machine.\nThe command will take a long time as it copies your old disk perfectly to a new image on your working iMac.\nOnce you have replaced the old disk on the failing machine you can restore the image by booting Linux again and issuing the following command:\nssh user@hostname dd if=image.gz | gunzip -1 - | dd of=/dev/sda\nThis will take the created image and put it on your new harddrive.\n\nA: Start the old mac holding down the 'T' key.  This will boot it into target disk mode. It is for all intents now a FireWire drive. \nConnect via FireWire to the newer mac. Copy everything over and you're good. \nRepeat the process to copy back when you install the new drive. \n", "Q: How to use plain text smileys (disable automatic emoji substitution) in Messages.app?

The screen flickers slightly and things struggle to load. I managed to run disk utility on it before these problems start and it coming up with lots of failures.\nThis all suggest to me it's the hard drive.\nIs there anything else I can use to diagnose the specific problem? Would the above description point to a hard drive failure for you?\nIf that's the case I'm willing to spend £100 or so on a new hard drive (would this one be ok?) and attempt to fit it myself (following online guides!!).\nBefore I had problems, the iMac was running completely fine and not struggling with anything - even high spec games so you can see why I'm very reluctant to buy a new iMac... especially at £1500!\nI feel like I'm being completely screwed over by Apple for not supporting a perfectly good machine, so much appreciated in advance for any help given!!\n\nA: From the sound of things it is likely the hard drive. An \"easy\" way to find out would be to attach an external HD and install the OS on that.\nBe aware that depending on what is going on with the old HD it could eventually just prevent the Mac from booting as the Mac tries to access it even if it is NOT the boot drive.\nNote that a USB drive would be SLOW, Firewire would be preferable and, while it is not as fast as SATA, would provide you with a generally usable/bootable Mac while you work up the courage to open it up and replace the drive ;-).\n\nA: It's garbage to say that no reseller would touch it.  I think you will find that any repair outlet, authorised or not, would gladly take your dollars in exchange for some service.\nHaving said that, they will charge, and while it's not a particularly easy Mac to repair, if you have basic screwdriver skills and the nerve to do it, you can fix this up youself just fine.  I have the a similar machine, and did it myself.\nYou'll need to take a look at the guides on iFixit to know exactly what you need to do to replace the hard drive (and yes, it does sound like a hard drive fault to me also).  The scariest bit is removing the glass and screen, as you'll need various tools such as suction cups etc (all explained in the guides).\nWhile you are fixing it up, the single most useful upgrade you can do to give this elder statesman a shot in the arm is install an SSD instead of a regular HD.  Trust me, it will be like a whole new machine!\n\nA: You could add an external hard drive, install Mac OS X on the external hard drive and move all of your data over before the internal drive dies completely.\nThis has the advantages of being relatively inexpensive, easy since you just plug in a new drive and use software to migrate your data, low risk, and fast. Opening an iMac is not easy or without a significant amount of risk.\n", "Q: Airplay Quality Issue From MacBook Pro Long story short, my question is - is there a known quality issue using Airplay from a MacBook?  And is there a way to improve quality?\nDetails\nI have an HDTV here that I'm using for Airplay mirroring.   We have Comcast internet, using Comcast's wireless router.  The AppleTV is connected directly via an ethernet connection.  The MacBook Pro is a mid-2012 retina model.\nWhenever I use Airplay from the MacBook, the video is always extremely choppy.  The audio keeps up okay, but the video constantly freezes.   The thing is, I can use Airplay from my iPhone 5 or my iPad 2 without any issue. \nExample\nTo compare, say I open up the YouTube app on the iPhone or iPad.  I can mirror videos from those devices without any issue - clean playback, no pausing.   If I open a YouTube video on my MacBook, the video will constantly pause and \"jerk\".   If anything I would have expected the iPad to have the most issues, as it's the oldest device.\nMavericks\nI had hoped that the problem would get better after upgrading to Mavericks yesterday, but no luck.  When attempting to use the AppleTV as a \"second monitor\", the performance is so bad that even moving the mouse cursor around causes pausing, so it's just not usable.\nFWIW - I'm an IT guy, consider myself pretty knowledgeable about this stuff... so ask any follow up questions you may have.   I'm really frustrated that this is a non-issue with iOS devices, but seems to be impossible to get working correctly from the $2000+ MacBook LOL.\nAdditional Info\nUnfortunately, there hasn't been any interest in the question today.   But I thought I'd add some additional info.   Both my Macbook and router are operating at 802.11N, so I would think wireless network speed should not be a problem here.   From what I can tell, the issue keeps pointing to my Macbook (based on all the above)...  I'm just not sure what else to check.\n\nA: Okay, after dealing with this for quite some time, I finally found a solution that worked for me.   I figured I'd come and share for others as well.\nIn order to resolve the choppy playback, I ultimately went in to Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings.  After resetting, the device downloaded the very latest OS for the Apple TV, and after everything was done, the Airplay quality between the MacBook and AppleTV is actually pretty decent.   \nIn testing, I was able to mirror my display without any noticeable choppiness.   I was also able to extend my desktop on to the TV, and this worked surprisingly well.   Even playing YouTube videos was of decent quality, with almost zero choppiness during playback.\n\nWhat I have not tried yet...  and will update this answer later on, is reconnecting my photo streams.   As it's common to have 1000+ photos in my shared streams, I'm concerned that this may have slowed the device down (just a guess, honestly).   I'll do some more testing today, mirroring as is, then adding the photo streams and comparing, to see if that causes any issue.

Changes that can increase productivity of the user, consumption of media are likely to attract more votes.  The change could have been made in any current revision of iOS7, but has to still be available in iOS7.0.3.\n\nA: My favorite new feature is the ability to 'reduce motion' via Settings > Accessibility > Reduce Motion.\nWhen enabled, the animation for launching an app and going to the home screen are greatly reduced, which allows me to access the phone from its locked state more quickly, and is more valuable to me than having zooming animations.\n", "Q: Terminal output as a screensaver? I want people to keep an eye on a script running in terminal whilst I'm away from my desk, but I don't trust them access to my machine.\nIs there a way to show the terminal console as a screensaver, thus making it read-only and require login if they touch keyboard/mouse etc.\nI'm aware of alternatives like logging to a log server they can access etc, however for now I'm only interested in outputting terminal as a screen saver. Is this possible with any known currently available screen saver software?\n\nA: This may work, but looks to me like it needs quite a bit of work to make it go.\nhttps://github.com/lunow/terminalscreensaver\n\n\nA: Phosphor from the XScreenSaver collection does this quite well. There are a few caveats though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phosphor is a bit heavy on the system compared to a basic terminal. On a portable computer this can cause fans to spin up or batteries to drain faster.\n\n*Scripts run in their entirety before outputting anything.

I would like to ask if the game farming simulator 2013 can be run in both the mac book air 11 inch and 13 inch? This is because i am intending to get a mac book air next year, and the game in question.\n\nA: I would think it should run fine on either...  the game has very low system requirements.   You can view the requirements here:\nOfficial WebSite\nhttp://www.farming-simulator.com/about.php?lang=en\n", "Q: How to choose on which display Application Switcher shows? I always have a lot of applications open at the same time. In order to quickly switch between them, I use CMD+Tab shortcut. In order to switch even faster, I sometimes use CMD+Tab and then select the app I want with my mouse pointer and have a gesture to open Application Switcher with my Trackpad.\nI just installed OS X Mavericks and realized it always shows Application Switcher on my laptop screen instead of \"main\" external display. This makes it hard to switch fast between applications since my cursor is on the external display and App Switcher is on laptop's screen.\nIs there any way to change this? I tried swapping the menubar \"block\" in System Preferences => Display => Arrangement, but it didn't help.\n\nA: Try moving your Dock to a different screen in System Preferences > Dock > Position on screen. The Application Switcher will open on the same display as the Dock.\nYou can also quickly move your Dock (and Application Switcher) to another display by hovering your mouse on the very bottom of the desired display for a moment. \nThe Dock will then rise up and appear on the desired display. (Note: this only seems to work if the Dock's Position on Screen setting is Bottom)\n\nA: cmd+tab when you mouse-over the dock. The app switcher will move to the display your mouse is on.\nFound this out by accident... the obvious behaviour would seem to be that the app switcher appears on whatever display the cursor is.\nUpdate:\nAs correctly mentioned in the comments, you don't actually need to cmd+tab when you mouse-over the dock, you can just mouse-over the dock on whichever display you want, from then on the Application Switcher will show on that display.\nHowever, as the question was about showing the Application Switcher, why not do both at once?\n\nA: Please let Apple know if you find this behaviour non ideal. Personally I would prefer either of the following behaviours:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Application Switcher is always displayed on the monitor on which the menu bar has been placed under System Preferences → Displays → Arrangement.\n\n*The Application Switcher is displayed on the display with the active (opaque) menu bar.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  I have my laptop on the left, my external monitor on the right.  My dock is always way left on my laptop.  If I move the dock to the right, it goes to my external monitor.  Now the application switcher defaults to the external monitor.  Also system preferences open up on the external monitor side as well.  Much nicer--also gives me extra space on my laptop desktop. \n\nA: In the Display Preferences panel, click on the Arrangement tab.  Click on the white menu bar and drag it to the display you wish to make primary.\n", "Q: How do you color code folders in Mavericks? I used to be able to color code each folder in Finder. \nI know I can use tags in Mavericks, but is there a way to restore the ability to actually color code folders?\nThanks.\n\nA: Unlike colours, tags one not mutually exclusive. You can set multiple tags for one file. \nThis may explain why Finder no longer displays the colour like before. \nSadly, it will only display a maximum of three colours on the right of the filename. It looks like these three colours are the last three in the list.\n\n\nA: 2 solutions to color tag files:  \n\n\n*\n\n*How to add, change and delete Tags in OS X 10.9 Mavericks\n\n*Tag your files with drag and drop in OS X Mavericks\n\nA: remember to tell Apple. We want labels back:\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n\nA: You might be interested in downloading Folder Magic. It lets you easily assign colours to folders (which makes them very easy to differentiate).\n\nA: As there doesn't appear to be a good solution to our problem, this allows you to use your coloured icons on the sidebar to help you locate folders visually by larger colored areas of the screen:\nhttps://www.macupdate.com/app/iphone/43078/sideeffects\n\nA: Interestingly enough, there are several Applications which can act as a finder replacement and which display the Folder Labels in 10.9 as well as the Background like in 10.8, 10.7 etc.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pathfinder\n\n*Forklift\n\n*Transmit (FTP-Client)\n\n\nSo the feature is not completly gone, the 10.9-Finder just don't display it. Let's hope someone finds a Hack to get coloring back. \n\nA: The folder magic app kind of works its a bit fussy as an extra step, but if you are using a set system or not changing it frequently it will work nicely. --  It is my dream that maybe someone will write an app that carries the \"tag color\" up into the \"folder image\"  (two tags = two tone folder? etc?)  for all the visual/spatial organizers out there.\n", "Q: Is It Possible To Still Upgrade To OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion? For those Mac owners still on OS X Snow Leopard, does the possibility exist to upgrade to OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion rather than to 10.9 Mavericks?\n\nA: Yes, Apple sells older OS as redeemable downloads from the web store.\nApple sells OS X Mountain Lion redemption codes, alongside OS X Lion, for £14 each on the UK store. \nThe US store link is below and it appears the part number is the same no matter which store you select:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://store.apple.com/us/product/D6377Z/A/os-x-mountain-lion\n\n*http://store.apple.com/us/product/D6106Z/A/os-x-lion\n\nA: I have some good news for you. Every Mac running Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) or later will be able to upgrade for free to Mavericks.\nCheck the specs page on Apple.com\n\nBut if you want to upgrade specific to Mountain Lion (can't think of a reason why?), the answer is no I'm afraid. Every time Apple releases a new OS, they drop support for the older ones.\nYou can always look on eBay or other second-hand sites to obtain a legal copy of the disk.\nEDIT: Apple offers to buy both Lion and Mountain Lion in the online Store! Issue solved :)\n", "Q: Which versions of Adobe Creative Suite will work with Mavericks? I own Adobe CS4, which works perfectly with Mountain Lion. I would like to upgrade to Mavericks, but I'm not sure if CS4 is still supported. Thus my question:\nWhich versions of Adobe Creative Suite will work with Mavericks?\n\nA: From this Adobe help page:\n\nAdobe and Apple have worked closely together to test Adobe® Creative Cloud applications and Adobe Creative Suite 6 applications for reliability, performance and user experience when installed on Intel® based systems running Mac OS X Mavericks. (v10.9). All Adobe CC and CS6 products are compatible, but a few products require updates to the latest builds to work properly. Adobe Photoshop® CS5, CS4 and CS3 were also tested with Mac OS X Mavericks and there are currently no major issues known.\n\n\nA: It works I just upgraded to this operating system. I read the official Adobe message too. And I just decided that I am not going to wait. So I just upgraded and all of the Adobe applications work. Especially with the Video programs in CS4 it works good. \nit works I was worried to until I tested it. I also recommend a smc reset, pram reset, and a disk repIr so your boot times increase because my slowed down after the installation. Just do these steps and you will be up and running..... \nYou can look up those things online. \n\nA: About a month ago I upgraded from Leopard to Maverick and my 2008 Macbook Pro became unusable due to long response times. 2-3 minutes for just a mouse click. After many hours of tracking this down (Apple support was very patient and helpful) in the end uninstalling CS4 fixed the issue and my computer is faster than ever - probably faster because of all the clean up we did during all of this. So I've got my computer back but cannot user CS4 on it.\n", "Q: How to disable Mavericks' emoji shortcut The shortcut control-command-space in Mavericks opens a panel with Emojis. I'd like to use it for another application (Divvy), but it complains that it is already used by a system-wide keyboard shortcut. But as far as I can see there is no way to disable it in the system settings. Does anyone know of an alternative method to disable it?\n\nA: Creator of Divvy here.  I'm not sure why Divvy can't record this shortcut in the UI, but you can force Divvy to use this shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Divvy.\n\n*Launch Terminal.app and paste this command, on one line, and press enter:\ndefaults write com.mizage.direct.Divvy globalHotkey -dict keyCode 49 modifiers 4352\n\n*Also, paste this command, on one line, and press enter:\ndefaults write com.mizage.Divvy globalHotkey -dict keyCode 49 modifiers 4352\n\n*Restart Divvy.\n\n\nThere's no risk to running these commands, you can always change the shortcut again in the UI.  Hopefully I can update the recorder to properly capture these shortcuts in the future.\n\nA: This all seems to be for older OS's I have run the terminal command but for Yosemite it looks like just assign the name to \"Emoji & Symbols\" for all apps.  Would be nice to not assign any shortcut to this and remove it but you can't save no shortcut and it will not let me save and then delete the shortcut (that probably wouldn't work anyway.  At least it is assigned to another shortcut across all apps finally!\n\nA: You can change the shortcut from System Preferences:\n\nEither three periods or an ellipsis character should work.\nYou can disable the shortcut by modifying ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist:\ndefaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Special Characters...' '\\0'\n\nQuit and reopen applications to apply the changes made with the defaults command.\n\nA: If it's of any help, you can disable the replacement of emoji to emoticons in the Messages app like this: Edit > Substitutions > Emoji menu. Not sure if this frees up the Ctrl+Command+Space shortcut, though.\n\nA: I wanted to promote @jrhorn424's comment to an answer, so it's more visible.\nFrustratingly, the keyboard preference pane won't let you remove a standard shortcut, only bind it to something else.  You can do it in the terminal, though.\nAs @jrhorn424 wrote:\n\n\"A note for Yosemite (OS X 10.10) and later: instead, use defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Emoji & Symbols' '\\0'\"\n\n\nA: I use Quicksilver for this, it overrides other keyboard shortcuts by default, which is handy for pesky harder-to-manipulate default shortcuts. It can open any app with any key combination; check it out.\n", "Q: Identify disk manufacturer in Macbook Air I wonder how can I know which is the disk's manufacturer for my Macbook Air. Is there a way to know whether the disk is one of those faulty SSD disk that Apple has recalled.\n\nA: The article which you linked to from the Verge says there is a firmware update on the app store which will test your drive.  If your firmware cannot be updated Apple will replace your drive for free.\nI would back up my data and run the mentioned firmware update.  \nI could not find the firmware update on the app store but I found it on the Apple support site here.\n", "Q: Change my Apple ID email address on iCloud account I had to make a new email address for my new Apple ID since I forgot my previous Apple ID password and couldn't receive a verification email.\nNow that I have my new Apple ID and password, my iPhone 4s still shows my old Apple ID. How can I change it so that my new Apple ID shows when I wish to download anything?\nMy iCloud account still has my old Apple ID and is in grey; so I can't change it! I don't want to delete my old iCloud account.\n\nA: Go to https://appleid.apple.com, click Manage my Apple ID and sign in with your current iCloud ID.  \nTap edit next to the primary email account, tap Edit, change it back to your old email address and save the change.  \nThen edit the name of the account to change it back to your old email address.  You can now use your current password to turn off Find My iPhone on your device, even though it prompts you for the password for your old account ID. \nThen go to Settings > iCloud, tap Delete Account and choose Delete from My iDevice when prompted (your iCloud data will still be in iCloud).  \nNext, go back to https://appleid.apple.com and change your primary email address and iCloud ID name back to the way it was.

A few years back I had to send a Powerbook to Apple for hardware repairs (the optical disc stopped working and had to be replaced.)\nI had FileVault enabled, and the tech at the time told me I'd have to disable that encryption in order for them to implement the repairs. So for privacy I just re-formatted the entire OS (having a backup, of course) before handing it off.\nIs it still the case that Apple requires FileVault(2) to be turned off before they will repair a Macbook?\n\nA: Firstly, I think this would be better handled by calling Apple Support directly. I do not see mention of this in any of the repair terms and conditions documents on apple.com.\nSecondly, regardless of whether Apple requires FileVault 2 to be disabled or not, I would recommend that you follow the same process you did before - backup all the data, reformat it and install OS X afresh before giving it for repair. This would protect your privacy and also reduce (or prevent) wasting time with support if/when they inform you that they would have to format the drive and install OS X because it's encrypted with File Vault 2.\n\nA: The response I got from Apple Support:\n\nFor many repairs, as well as quality checks after a completed repair, it is necessary that our technicians can boot the Mac. If FileVault is enabled, that means that we do need to note the password for the time of the repair.\nA viable alternative is to wipe the Mac’s hard drive or flash storage prior to the repair and restore from a backup afterwards.\n\nSo either prepare to hand off your password to them, or empty your hard drive before giving the macbook for repair.\n", "Q: Remove existing Facebook account from OS X I had synchronized my personal Facebook account on OS X Mountain Lion in System Preferences  > Mail, Contacts & Calendars through the Facebook tab. I removed it and synchronized my official account on it, but I'm still getting notifications for the personal account.\nHow do I remove the personal account details permanently and stop the notifications?\nUpdate\nI have upgraded my Mac to OS X Mavericks 10.9, but the problem exists on the upgraded OS X version too.\nEdit\nI have found another thing with my mac. This issue happens only for my official account. If i have synchronized any other accounts. It doesn't happen. Working fine. What may be the problem with this?\n\nA: My suggestion would be to log out of the current Facebook account. Then go into your user's Library folder (holding down the alt / opt key while in the \"Go\" menu in Finder and you will see a new entry \"Library\"). In your Library folder enter the subfolder \"Preferences\" and delete these two files:\ncom.apple.accountsd.plist & com.apple.internetaccounts.plist (or just shove them over to the Desktop for testing)\nLog out and back into the correct account and see if there are any notifications in Notification Center still listed. If yes, then download Onyx from http://www.titanium.free.fr/downloadonyx.php and let it do an automation where it clears all caches. When Onyx is done it will ask you to restart.\nFrom here you should be good and there should be no trace of the original/old Facebook account. If however you notice anything still being left over, comment back with more information.\n\nA: Find it under System Preferences > Internet Accounts. You can remove Facebook account from there.\n\nA: If you don't want to mess with plist or any system configuration, just open Facebook in your browser, go to Settings -> Apps and remove permission for Mac OS X in there. It will not send to your Mac any notifications anymore.\n", "Q: How can I disable this mutli-monitor window-cutoff in Mavericks? If I drag a window in between two screens, half the window disappears.

Any idea how to get it to refresh and find the messages I have sent? \n\nA: I had this problem as well after upgrading to Mavericks. The solution for me was to select a different Outgoing Mail Server. My Exchange account was set to use the \"Exchange SMTP\" server (which worked fine for me prior to Mavericks). The other option in the pull down menu was something called \"USERNAME@SERVERNAME (Exchange)\" so I picked it. This solved the problem. Sent mail once again appears in my Exchange Sent Mail folder.\nThe weird thing is that this option is not listed as one of the SMTP servers if I click on \"Edit SMTP server list\".  Maybe it's something other than SMTP?\n\nA: I have the same issue. To choose the Exchange protocol instead of the SMTP solved the issues of not stored mails. The problem is that the Exchange protocol (maybe only in my case) has other issues, i.e. size restriction. Therefore i have to rely on SMTP protocol.\nbtw: that the exchange options does not appear in the smtp server list is logical as it is a fixed communication procedure and has not to be configured like SMTP. By using the Exchange protocol the Exchange server stores the sent mails in the right folder with SMTP protocol all is up to client. And exactly here the problem seems to be in mavericks or its mail client.\n", "Q: How to keep both Mavericks menu bars opaque in two monitor setup Mavericks shows the menu bar in both monitors when you have two. That's great, but the menu bar in the passive desktop turns translucent, which is a bit annoying. Is there a way to keep both menu bars opaque at all times? Setting the menu bar opaque in the desktop settings affects only the active monitor.\n\nA: I just found a fix for this. Check out this video I made.\nStep 1. change the order your displays are in.\nStep 2. set to opaque.\nStep 3. change back the order, now you have opaque on both bars.\n\nA: you really can't do this but you can:\nhide the second display's menu bar by going into SysPref -> Mission Control-> and uncheck Displays have separate Spaces.\nI'm sure there will be an update soon enough that allows you to dedicate one display as your Control display, for lack of a better term.\n... in researching this tho I did find a neat app called bartender which cleans up your bar.  not free and I'm not linking it cause I have no interest in the company at all, but I am giving the trial mode a shot right now. \nGood Luck\n", "Q: SVG in Keynote? I want to use line art in my Keynote presentations.

I have a fairly old (I am not sure when it was bought) iMac 5,1 running OS X 10.6.8, but I just saw the free upgrade to Mavericks. It looks tempting, but I'd rather first know if my computer can handle this OS before I try to install it.\nProcessor: 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\nMemory: 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM\n(I guess that covers the most relevant hardware, if something else is important I'll add it.)\n\nA: System requirements can be found at Apple - Upgrade your Mac to OS X Mavericks. Click the View compatible Mac models link under the Check your Mac hardware step to view the supported models.  Currently:\n\nMac models compatible with OS X Mavericks \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)\n  \n*MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)\n  \n*MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)\n  \n*MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)\n  \n*Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)\n  \n*Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)\n  \n*Xserve (Early 2009)\n  \n\nFrom the Apple menu select \"About This Mac\" and then click the \"More Info…\" button to determine exactly what model you have.\nAccording to the information at How to identify iMac models, the iMac5,1 is the Late 2006 model, which is not compatible with OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: According to Apple, the iMac5,1 was released in 2006, and is thus not on the list of models that are supported by Mavericks. Whether Mavericks can be hacked to run on your machine is a different question.\n\nA: You have the same iMac as me, which is the last white plastic iMac model before transitioning to the more rational aluminum body.  That's a mid-2006 for future, and unless someone knows of a script to trick the OS into thinking it's an older model, 10.6.8 is as far as we can go.\nBummer, right?\n\nA: I think maverick should run inspite of apple official required models. Y also have a i mac mid 2006 with snow leopard. \n", "Q: Can I use two non-Thunderbolt displays on a MacBook Air I have been told that the only way to connect more than one external display to a MacBook Air was to buy Apple's Thunderbolt monitor and daisy chain.\nMavericks promises better support for external displays. Is it now possible to run two non-Thunderbolt monitors from a mid-2013 MacBook Air or is this still impossible?\n\nA: The changes in Mavericks make it possible to connect a DisplayPort monitor to your MBA and also use an Apple TV as an external display - I've just confirmed it on my setup - but that is pretty slow over wifi. \nThe issues with connecting monitors to the MBA are in hardware, not software. For example, the reason why you cannot connect a DisplayPort adapter to the Apple Thunderbolt Display is because the monitor itself uses the DisplayPort channel:\nhttp://www.anandtech.com/show/4832/the-apple-thunderbolt-display-review/8\nConnecting two displays to the MBA requires two thunderbolt devices.\nThe first device can be either the Apple TB display or one of the Thunderbolt docks with a DVI / HDMI connector. Both of these options use the DisplayPort channel, so connecting a DisplayPort monitor to them won't work.\nThis is where the second Thunderbolt device comes in (a hard disk or other device with two TB ports for pass-through). This acts as a man-in-the-middle and can extract a second DisplayPort signal.\nSo your setup will look like this:\n<Air> -- <TB dock/display> -- <TB drive> -- <DisplayPort monitor>\n\nA: You can connect two monitors to a 2013 Macbook Air by connecting one to the Mini DisplayPort, and one to the USB port via this USB - DVI adapter:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086359SG/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nWith the computer open, this gives you up to three screens. The USB connected screen is minimally laggy - fine for work, but probably not good for games or video.\n\nA: It's possible to daisy chain two external monitors.\nThis KB-article lists the models that support up to 2 displays through one Thunderbolt port.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air (Mid 2012 and later)\n\n*MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012 and later)\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch and 17-inch, Early 2011 and later)\n\n*iMac (Mid 2011 and later)\n\n*Mac Mini (Mid 2011 and later)\n\n\nA: You could use a Thunderbolt to HDMI then a HDMI splitter and I know there's a program to make your MacBook think you are using one big display.\n", "Q: Change Dock color on left/right site in OS X 10.9 Mavericks New in OS X Mavericks, when using the famous dock on the left or right site:\nIt has a white background now.

I can confirm it works for me  on OS X 10.9.2. Just download it, run and select the \"Install Transparent dock\" option. You can also choose the \"Install 10.8 style dock\" option which will enable the theme from OS X 10.8. You can revert to the default dock at any time by running the app again and selecting the \"Restore Dock\" option.\n\n\nA: You can set hide-mirror to true to remove the blur effect:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock hide-mirror -bool true;killall Dock\n\nBefore: \n After: \nI don't know how to make the background dark though.\n\nA: I haven't tried this yet but if you look at the old instructions for Leopard you can edit the color by changing the images in the Dock app.\nSorry, this does not work after all.\nCurrently I use a black desktop as a workaround (you could also use an image with a black margin at the right/left).

I checked the PID (375) in Google Chrome's own task manager, and it is GPU Process. I don't think it is used often, but I also fail to see why it is constantly non-responsive.\nDoes anyone else experience the same thing? Is this a problem of GPU handling of the new OS? Maybe there are some GPU-accelerated websites/videos (I mean video player) out there so I can test whether there is a problem? Thanks.\nBy the way, my machine is a MacBook Pro 13'' mid-2012 non-Retina.\n\nA: I've been experiencing the same issue for about a month, except it predates Mavericks (10.9) when I was still using Mountain Lion (10.8.4 and 10.8.5 specifically).\nI've found the only way I can remedy the issue is to force quit the unresponsive Google Chrome Helper and all other associated processes (all \"Google Chrome ...\" named items) except for Google Chrome itself (the one with the icon). That will crash most, if not all, browser plugins, but it will make Chrome useable for a decent amount of time if you keep down on your number of open tabs.\nIt's not fantastic by any means, but my other remedy is going back to using Firefox for the time being and keeping my fingers crossed Google is working on a fix for this issue.\nMacBook Pro 6,2 (15-inch Mid-2010)\n2.53GHz Intel i5\n4GB RAM\n128GB SanDisk Ultra Plus SSD/500GB Toshiba HDD\nOS X 10.9 \"Mavericks\"\n\nA: This bug is fixed on Oct 31, 2013\n(#89 thakis@chromium.org) \nand the fix will reach the stable channel eventually.\nThis is an issue with how Activity Monitor determines responsiveness – these processes are running perfectly fine. \n(We changed chrome to work around that Activity Monitor issue, and the fix will reach you eventually, depending on which channel you use, how far we merge this, etc.)\n\nA: I had a very simpiler problem - particularly on gmail searches.

After upgrading to Mavericks, I see that the Mail app has been upgraded to version 7.0, and that the setting for \"Check for new messages\" has been changed from my previous setting (every minute) to a new \"Automatically\" option.\nAccording to the help screen, this means that \"Mail varies how often it gets messages, based on whether your Mac is plugged into an electrical outlet\".  My Mac is plugged in, and I've been keeping an eye on the Activity window, and I've seen intervals of 20 minutes, 7 minutes and 9 minutes between checking for mail.  It is, of course, possible that I missed an update - I haven't been obsessively staring the Activity window.\nDoes anybody know what the intended behavior of the app is, when the \"Automatically\" option is selected?  If not, is there a way to increase the log level to try to work out what the app is actually doing?  I've looked in the Console and there appear to be no log events associated with the \"Fetching new mail\" activity I see in the activity window.\n\nA: According to Dan Frakes @ macworld.com:\n\nIn the General screen of Mail’s Preferences window, you’ll find a new option in the ‘Check for new messages’ pop-up menu called Automatically. This option essentially allows Mail to support push-style message retrieval—you receive new messages immediately, rather than at the next scheduled check.\n\n\nA: I have a mix of 5 x Pop3 and IMAP email addresses; and emails were arriving 4 minutes prior on my iPhone before arriving on MAIL.  My experience has been that switching to Check for new messages \"every minute\" as opposed to \"Automatic\" has increased the immediacy of the messages coming in.\n\nA: In my case, I don't use and Exchange server. Just bought a new mini with Mavericks preloaded. Although I have checked \"Check for new messages every minute\", I've found that I have to press the \"Get Mail\" button in order to receive messages. Prior to this on my 2009 mini that had Snow Leopard, I'd get my emails instantly (also having the 'Check every minute' selected. No other preferences were changed between both versions. Like others, I'll get them on my iPhone quicker.\n\nA: Bare in mind one of the big changes in mavericks was around reducing power consumption. \nThere were a number of features added to the operating system around reducing applications polling all the time (because Wifi and network connections use up battery power quickly). Mavericks has a feature called 'AppNap' which is around applications putting themselves to sleep when not needed.\nFor more details see http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/12/#energy-saving\nI'd expect the behaviour of Mail when set to automatic to be different when on or off battery power, and also when other applications are busy or not. I've turned off automatic on my work computer because it is not immediate enough.\n", "Q: How to disable/always allow assistive access on Mavericks? I've been using this script (AppleScript) bound to a global hot key as an Automator Service to open new terminals using a global keyboard shortcut. After upgrade to OS X Mavericks when the corresponding service is triggered from literally any application, a new dialog box popus up saying that \n\n\"(Application name)\" would like to control this computer using accessibility features.\n\nAnd of course script fails to execute triggered from any application which has not been explicitly given permission via System Preferences.\nIs there some way to globally allow accessibility control to any application running on my computer in OS X Mavericks, as it used to be in previous OS X releases?\nThe example script above was not the only script I had on global shortcuts, and whitelisting all installed applications is extremely painful, especially considering that an app may be whitelisted only after a failed \"control\" attempt...\n\nA: I don't know any way to always allow access for assistive devices, but you can add multiple applications to the list in System Preferences by drag and drop:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu\n\n*Click on Security & Privacy\n\n*Click on the Privacy tab\n\n*Click on Accessibility in the list at the left\n\n*Click the lock icon to allow you to make changes (you'll be prompted for your password)\n\n*Check \"(Application Name)\"\n\n\nI don't believe there is a way to set this setting globally.

See man launchctl:\n\nThe /etc/launchd.conf file is no longer consulted for subcommands to run during early boot time; this functionality was removed for security considerations.\n\nYou can now for example save this plist as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/my.startup.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>my.startup</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>sh</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>launchctl setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe launchctl setenv command is ran as the user, so it only applies to processes launched in the user domain.\nThis method doesn't apply to applications that are reopened at login if \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" is checked.\nMavericks and earlier\nIn 10.9 and earlier, you can for example run\necho setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin|sudo tee -a /etc/launchd.conf\n\nand then restart to apply the changes.\nOther methods\n/etc/paths and /etc/paths.d/ apply only (or mainly) to shells. The lines in /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d/* are added to the path by path_helper, which is run from /etc/profile, /etc/zshenv, and /etc/csh.login. I don't know any programs other than shells that would consider /etc/paths or /etc/paths.d/.\n~/.MacOSX/environment.plist stopped working in 10.8.\n\nA: You may be able to set environment variables in the file /etc/launchd-user.conf...\nIn Mavericks, I was able to configure an environment variable in the file using the line:\nsetenv TEST test\n\nAfter a fresh boot, $TEST from /etc/launchd-user.conf is set.\nEdit\nIt's possible that the syntax of the file at /etc/launchd.conf is invalid. Can you post the contents of that file for examination?\nFrom what I'm seeing, setting the PATH variable in /etc/launchd.conf is working normally. However, launchd does not perform any parameter expansion. Therefore, if you have an entry like setenv PATH $PATH:/usr/local/bin, your resulting path would be set to \"$PATH:/usr/local/bin\" (note: not the value of PATH, but the text \"$PATH\")\n\nA: I found that launchctl setenv PATH still works for me for Terminal and applications, but broke in shell scripts, launched directly via clicking or Open With in Terminal from, say, Finder. It's very strange. Other environment variables from /etc/launchd.conf work.\nIn order to fix it for shell scripts launched directly, I also set up PATH either in /etc/paths.d/* or in ~/.bashrc.\n\nA: There is a much easier way. Place a text file in the folder /etc/paths.d/. In this text file, enter the desired path AND a newline. The best way is to create a new file for each path.\nOn my system, there is a file called MySQL with the text '/usr/local/mysql/bin' and a newline.\n\nA: on my Mavericks install , adding \"setenv PATH blablabla\" to /etc/launchd.conf didn't work after reboot\nso i added my new path to the end of /etc/paths , which worked.\n\nA: Editing /etc/paths.d or using .bash_profile didn't worked for me, however as suggested from someone else (I actually came here for upvote his answer, but I couldn't find it again?!), I edited /etc/paths which works for me\nIn my case, I added android-tool adb and android to terminal commands with pointing to their sdk paths (adb has moved to another directory nowadays) which look like\n/usr/local/bin\n...\n/Applications/adt-bundle-mac/sdk/platform-tools  //new entries\n/Applications/adt-bundle-mac/sdk/tools\n\n\nA: SWEET, adding that XML to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/setenv.SVN.plist allowed BBEdit to use the subversion binaries I installed in /opt.\n<clip>\n<string>launchctl setenv PATH /opt/subversion/bin:$PATH</string>\n<clip>\n\n\nA: Simply add your 'bin' (the path that you want to add) path to /etc/paths file - reboot or relogin !!!\nsudo vi /etc/paths \n(create a file (paths file) if it does't exist, I am using 'vi' editor, you can use your own as super user )\nthen, add your bin directory path like below \n\n/usr/local/mysql/bin\n/usr/local/apache-ant-1.9.3/bin\n/usr/local/gradle-1.11/bin\n\nsave the file and relogin ... hope this helps\n", "Q: How to resume a Mavericks download on OS X 10.6? I've initiated OS X Mavericks download from the App Store. Upon either re-login or restart, the OS X Mavericks icon in the dock shows that it's paused. Clicking Resume from the context menu doesn't do anything.\n\nA: It's a usability bug. You have to open the App Store, log-in, and only then will the Resume option work. To resume, you can also click \"Download\" on the OS X Mavericks line in the Purchases table of the App Store.\nSince there's no instant feedback as to whether anything is being downloaded unless your connection is very fast, you can use Activity Monitor to check whether network download seems to be saturated. An alternative is iStat Menus (non-free with 14 day free trial). There, you can not only see that data is downloaded, but you can confirm that it is the storeagent process that does the downloading.\n\nA: I canceled the download by clicking 'cancel downloading' from the context menu.

I use ssh on my machine, and have set up a long not-human-friendly passphrase which is saved in my password manager.\nWhat makes me crazy every time is that I cannot paste into the window pictured below. I know the Remember password in my keychain option and use it. Sometimes I have to enter a new one though. Why can't I paste into a password field?\nSame thing for the dialog which pops up when plugging in encrypted disks.\n\nSome updates:\n\n\n*\n\n*I found out how i can circumvent the dialog: just use ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa, and then I can paste the passphrase into the terminal.\n\n*As mattmcmanus mentioned, my Key is encryted using pkcs8 which was broken on Yosemite's ssh-agent. This is unrelated to the above problem, but it did occur to me at the same time (read here).\n\n*using ssh-add still not fixes this for encrypted disks.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*The dialog for ssh-agent can be circumvented by adding the key in the console/terminal: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa. You can then paste the password into the terminal. Also, adding the -K option to ssh-add will save it to the keychain as per Oliver Lacans comment.\n\n*As mattmcmanus said, id_rsa encryption using PKCS seems to be broken on OSX Mavericks ssh-agent. The fast workaround is to decrypt the keyfile, and encrypt it again with the standard ssh procedure (Key-derivation method: MD5...):\n\n\n\nmv id_rsa id_rsa.pkcs\nopenssl rsa -in id_rsa.pkcs -out id_rsa\n# enter passphrase to decrypt\nchmod 0600 id_rsa\nssh-keygen -f id_rsa -p\n# enter passphrase to encrypt again\n\n\nA: Is it a PKCS#8 key and are you on mavericks? If so, that seems to be completely busted. Not sure there is a solution yet.\n\nA: On Mac OS X El Capitan the ssh-add command can do this with a -K option:\n$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nEnter passphrase for /Users/your.username/.ssh/id_rsa:\n\nYou can paste your password into this prompt with ⌘-V.\nA session for this looks like this:\n$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nEnter passphrase for /Users/your.username/.ssh/id_rsa:\nPassphrase stored in keychain: /Users/your.username/.ssh/id_rsa\nIdentity added: /Users/your.username/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/your.username/.ssh/id_rsa)\n\nRelevant excerpt of SSH-ADD(1) brought up with man ssh-add:\n\n-K      When adding identities, each passphrase will also be stored in your keychain.  When removing identities with -d, each passphrase will be removed from your keychain.\n\nINFOSEC NOTE: Your password won't be shown in the shell, but will be exposed to all running applications via the clipboard.  An autotype solution would be more secure.\n\nA: You can run a script like this in AppleScript Editor:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SecurityAgent\"\n    set value of text field 2 of scroll area 1 of group 1 of window 1 to \"pa55word\"\n    click button 2 of group 2 of window 1\nend tell\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. After finding this question, I kept looking and found an answer elsewhere. This is an older question, but it has no accepted answers and is still high on search lists. (not sure of the stackexchange etiquette on that).\nRE not being able to copy/paste: It's apparently by design. The intention is to prevent all access to the field from the clipboard to prevent a malicious program from scraping password boxes. I'd think pasting (and not cutting) should be allowed, but maybe there's some technical reason.\nFor the ssh-agent stuff, as of (at least) Yosemite, the -K option in ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/blah does what you'd like -- type the password once, it's stored in your keychain, and ssh-agent will transparently unlock for you. To try and be safer, I put my ssh passphrases in a separate keychain that locks itself periodically.\n\nA: Using brew openssl and openssh fixes the issue.\nbrew update\nbrew install openssl\nbrew link openssl --force\nbrew install openssh\n\n# confirm correct bins are being used\n# both should be located in /usr/local/bin\nwhich openssl\nwhich openssh\n\n# add key back to keychain\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nI'm not sure if force linking openssl breaks anything on Mavricks.

I am not sure as my needs at work are pretty simple as I only have a few Macs.\nI hear that FileWave has a solution but I have no experience with it, but it might be worth investigating.\nThe folks at afp548.com have an active community of Mac SysAdmins and they cover a number of workflows that allow you to image large numbers of Macs in similar ways as Ghost and Acronis. It might be worth your while to check that out.\n\nA: I would recommend a slightly different path to recovering in a \"snap\" rather than seeking to emulate the Windows / PC manner of rolling back from a drive or software failure.\nOS X can boot from the external drive, so I typically wipe an external drive and then install the OS cleanly. When it first boots, I migrate my data and applications from my current system onto the external drive. This tests directly whether the new OS will run with your data without touching your data.\nYes you might want to have a backup process, but this lets you run the install and poke at things before you have to commit.\n\nA: While a big fan of CCC and SuperDuper, I've grown to like QRecall as well.

With the new mac os maverick I'm able to add custom tag to almost every files. I'm sadly unable to create those tags inside Mail. Did I missed a checkbox or a feature. I'm talking here about color flags.\n\nA: You can do a Spotlight Finder search, and specify that you want to look for mail messages, and then include words from the subject of your email to locate the message you're looking for (e.g. \"kind:mail news\"). Spotlight will find the underlying file in which the message is stored, and then you can tag it - for example with the word \"stuff\". Although this might be a bit clunky, you will then be able to use \"tag:stuff\" in the search box within the Mail app itself, and the Mail will find it.\nEven better is if you use Alfred (the app launcher).

I can't figure out a consistent behavior (scrolling on the side of the trackpad doesn't work).\nAny idea why?\n\nA: Yes! I am having this problem. It appears to be a known problem with both Chrome and Firefox. So far, I've only seen this behavior in these two browsers. It does not appear to affect Safari.\nThere are posts from as early as August indicating that this was an issue.\nSeveral posts have suggested clearing your Mac's PRAM as a temporary fix, as well as turning off the \"two finger swipe to switch pages\" gesture for both Mouse and Trackpad.\n", "Q: Drag application window to another space In OS X Mavericks how do I drag a window to another space?  I was able to do this in Mountain Lion.\n\nA: Go to system preferences -> Mission Control and uncheck \"Displays have separate Spaces\"\nNow logout and login.\nYou now should be able to drag your windows between spaces like in (Mountain) Lion.\n\nA: Simply drag the window to the edge of the screen and hold it there for about a second.\nThe space slides to the side and you can drop the window into that space.\nAlternatively, you can open Mission Control and drag the window to an existing space or directly to a new space by dragging it to the new space button in the top right.\n", "Q: cmd-tab behavior on Mavericks with multiple displays I have a MacBook with Cinema Display, I have my dock on the MacBook screen side and my menubar is set to Cinema Display. In 10.8 this worked well, when I pressed cmd-tab to switch apps the task switcher would come up on the \"main\" Cinema Display.\nIn 10.9, however, it's always on the MacBook's screen, very annoying. Is there a setting I've missed?\n\nA: Unchecking and then rechecking \"Displays have separate Spaces\" options in Mission Control System Preferences restored the Alt+Tab interface back to the primary monitor, for me (on Mavericks 10.9.5). I did not have to log out, as suggested by the OS.\n\nA: Maverick has this \"Displays have separate Spaces\" switch in the Mission Control settings. \nIn my experience, if it's enabled, then the alt-tab menu gets displayed on the display that used the dock for the last time. IE, if you clicked on the dock bar on the 2nd display, next time you do an alt-tab, the menu is going to show up there.\nIf you disable the \"Displays have separate Spaces\" options, you fix this annoying thing, but you get the old full screen support that Mountain Lion had, where the full screen app in one display, disables every other display.\n\nA: You can also display the app switcher on all monitors with the following undocumented preference:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock appswitcher-all-displays -bool true\nkillall Dock\n\nThis works on Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, and possibly older versions as well.\n\nA: I believe this coincides with the Dock's location.  Just tested it on my MacBook Air, connected to a non-Apple external display, and whenever I moved the Dock from screen to screen the Application Switcher would follow.\nYou can summon the Dock on your big display by dragging the cursor to the bottom of it's display, essentially dragging down at the bottom.  After a second the Dock should pop up.  Once the Dock is on the desired display press commandtab to summon the Application Switcher.\n\nA: So far, the best way to accomplish this for people who prefer the dock on the side is to change the dock position to be at the side furthest from your MacBook.\nThis is done by right-clicking on the dock, choosing \"Position on Screen\" (if you do not see this option, try right-clicking lower down on the dock) and either choosing left or right - whichever is furthest from your Macbook.\nFor clarity and user-friendliness, this was extracted and augmented from Mr Rabbit's comments above.\n", "Q: What does \"'Copy Job' would like to control this computer using accessibility features\" mean?

Safari for Mavericks has a website notifications feature allowing sites to send push notifications.\nI never want to be prompted for this.\nHow can I disable the prompt for all websites, forever?\n\n\nA: The proposed answer of chmod 000 RemoteNotifications does work, but unfortunately console is spewed with many failed attempts to access files in the directory.\nThe messages are all being logged by a process called SafariNotificationAgent which appears to be the single source of grief.  This process can be stopped entirely using: \nlaunchctl remove com.apple.SafariNotificationAgent\n\nOS updates might turn this back on, but I'd rather it not even be wasting system resources trying to access a folder for a feature that I never wanted in the first place.\n\nA: Since the release of Safari 7.0.3 Apple finally gives us an option to turn off safari notification prompts. To disable safari notifications go to Preferences within Safari. Click the Websites tab (notifications tab for older versions of safari) and uncheck \"Allow websites to ask for permission to send push notifications\". And voilà.\nWebsites panel for current Safari (as of High Sierra):\n\nPanel for older versions of Safari:\n\nThe explanation below is only valid for versions of Safari before 7.0.3\nApple obviously forgot the option to disable the notification thing in Safari altogether when they added the feature. Anyway this works, but is not for the faint of heart. ** This is only for older Safari before Version 7.0.3 **\n\nStop Safari\nOpen Terminal\ncd ~/Library/Safari\nchmod 000 RemoteNotifications/\n\nThat's it. \nThe chmod 000 just makes the directory RemoteNotifications inaccessible. To make it accessible again (and to re-enable notifications in Safari) just do the above again but use 755 instead of 000 in the chmod command.\nAs lined out in Renés comment below, it is also possible to change the access rights via Finder.\n\nA: Today in Safari 11, this is available in Safari preferences under \"Websites\" > \"Notifications\". The built-in help describes it simply:\n\nStop seeing notification permission requests in Safari: Choose Safari > Preferences, click Websites, then click Notifications. Deselect “Allow websites to ask for permission to send push notifications.” From now on, when you visit a website that can send you notifications, you aren’t asked.\n\n\nA: defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari CanPromptForPushNotifications -boolean NO\n\n\nA: There seems to be no way to do it. I am thinking of using a plugin to block this code from running. It seems to be related to window.safari.pushNotification.permission in source code. \n\nA: To add on to existing answers:\nMaybe after some time the second part of the accepted answer is outdated. It didn't stop the process. I had to go to activity monitor to find the process in the file system. \nSo I ended doing \nsudo tcsh\nchmod 000 /usr/libexec/SafariNotificationAgent\n\nWorks perfectly so far. The process doesn't run anymore when I restart Safari.\n\nA: In Safari 11 you can find this setting here:\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Notifications > Safari, and then disable it from there. This will disable notifications for Safari, but I don't know if the prompt will stop.

My question is similar to Re-use Mavericks install file, but instead of re-using the Mavericks install file on my own Macs, I would like to make a copy for a friend (so he doesn't have to download such a huge file over his slow connection).\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this legal?\n\n\n*\n\n*A side thought; Does this question even make sense if the binarys have the same checksum?\n\n\n*Is there anything unique to the install file? (e.g.: My app store account details.)\n\n\nI was thinking if we dropped it in place in the /Applications dir and then he went to the app store and \"bought\" it, it would detect the file was already in place and proceed as if it had been downloaded.\n(Not trying to do anything dodgy, just trying to save him from downloading a file that I already have.)\n\nA: Yes, you can reuse the downloaded installer across Macs, even if they're using a different Apple ID account for The App Store. The installer contains nothing in it that prevents it from being used this way.\nData about App Store accounts comes from existing user data on the machine during the upgrade, it's not embedded in the downloaded installer.\nThe legalities of doing this seem fine: the upgrade is free and the user is required to accept the EULA when they run the installer application, before the install begins, so you're not bypassing some acceptance of this agreement by sharing the installer instead of downloading it from the App Store.\nEdit and field test: A friend used my pre-downloaded copy of the installer on his MacBook Pro tonight and it worked just fine.\n\nA: Yes, this should be fine, although I have not tested it specifically. After you install another copy of Mavericks for your friend's computer, the first time your friend logs into the Mac App Store/Software Update on his own Mac with his Apple user ID and password, it should register that he has a functioning copy of Mac OS Mavericks.\nTo make sure, it might be better to first have your friend log in to the Mac App Store to \"purchase\" the free download for the Mavericks installer, and then cancel the download as it begins. Then you can copy your installer to his hard drive (onto his existing installation of Lion or Mountain Lion) and run it from there.\nI used a similar method with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion; in that case, I had friends pay for the upgrade in the Mac App Store, without actually downloading anything. Then I transferred my copy of the Mac OS X installer to their Mac from my external hard drive, and I ran an installation in the usual manner. Apple and the Mac App Store did not care where the installer had come from, as long as the registered user had paid for the download beforehand.\nBut in this case the Mavericks download is free, so even that is no longer a problem.\n", "Q: Is integrated VRAM included under `kernel_task` RAM in Activity Monitor? I was stunned to discover that Mac OS X kernel can consume 750MB of RAM. A few related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it a problem if kernel_task is routinely above 130MB on mid 2007 white MacBook?\n\n*kernel_task using way too much memory\n\n*How much RAM does the kernel use?\nclarified the issue a little bit, but one question remains: the claim that video memory for onboard integrated graphics is marked as used by kernel as well.\nIs it really true?\nIs VRAM included in the number shown by Activity Monitor for kernel_task?\n\nA: What version of Mac OS X are you running?\nThe kernel_task in Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks takes 1.07 GB of RAM on my 2012 MacBook Pro (non-Retina) with Intel HD4000 integrated graphics and 16GB of system RAM. Yes, this is completely necessary. If you have more physical RAM, then Mac OS X will use a lot for kernel_task in order to make the system run optimally.\nWith each new version of Mac OS X over the years, the kernel_task has taken more and more memory to run Mac OS X.\nIn my experience, if you are running Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, your Mac needs to have more than 4GB of system RAM to run optimally (without the OS needing to use the swapfile on the hard disk constantly, which degrades performance speed). It now appears that your Mac needs more than 6GB RAM to run Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks effectively.\nThe amount of RAM needed for Microsoft Windows 8.0 and 8.1 are comparable. This is simply what is required for the newest personal computer operating systems in 2013.\nPlease note that many system functions run under kernel_task, and the list of what is running on your Mac changes based on what you are using your Mac for.\nI found a good explanation for you, in \"Kernel_task taking up RAM in OS X\" from CNet in 2011. A quote:\n\n...you will see another process called \"kernel_task\" that also will\nregularly use a few hundred megabytes of real RAM and seem to increase\nits RAM footprint with system usage.\nThe kernel in OS X is the\nsoftware architecture that is responsible for handling resources that\nprocesses and programs need. These include the management of\nmultitasking scheduling, virtual memory, system input and output, and\nvarious communication routines between processes. In addition, the\nkernel can be modified and given enhanced functionality by loading\nkernel extensions (kexts) to supply system-level management of\nfeatures like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, graphics processors, third-party\nhardware, access to peripheral devices, and special filesystem\nsupport. In essence, the kernel is responsible for running your\nhardware and making the hardware resources available to applications\nand system services.\n...the process \"kernel_task\" may take up a large amount of\nsystem memory. When the system starts up, even\nthough you may have kernel extensions loaded, not all of the services\nare active. The system may be ready to use them, but will not load\nthem fully until needed. Therefore, if you initially start up your\nsystem and check Activity Monitor, you may see the kernel_task process\ntaking up a relatively small amount of RAM. When you then start using\nyour system and activating features like your iSight camera, Wi-Fi\nservices, switching GPUs, and using external devices, then the\nkernel_task will make use of the resources for these devices and will\ngrow in size.\n\n\nA: I guess, it is included. I have a MBP 13\" 2015 with Iris, and the kernel_task that takes a lot of memory as well, I was investigating the situation and I've discovered a marvellous zprint command. It prints kernel memory zones usage, I see 2 entries taking most of the memory for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.iokit.IOAcceleratorFamily2 - 758044K\n\n*vm.pages.array - 221204K\n\n\nSadly, I failed to found reliable information on the IOAcceleratorFamily2 (and failed to find any information on vm.pages.array), but the name suggests it has to do something with I/O and acceleration. From that info I guess, it's part of the memory, that is responsible for video acceleration and is dedicated for the Iris's image processing needs.\nI did a little test, starting a screen recording and two 4K youtube videos in parallel: com.apple.iokit.IOAcceleratorFamily2 rose to 1.1G in a matter of seconds, and after I stopped the recording and the videos, it fell down to 630M. Thus, I think, it's very likely, that it is responsible for VRAM.\n", "Q: Bypass Mavericks Setup Assistant I just upgraded my system from Mountain Lion to Mavericks.  When my system restarted, the Setup Assistant ran.\nThe Setup Assistant is asking me to configure things on my system that are already configured — location, internet connection, etc.  Plus, it is forcing me to create a new user account, but my user account from Mountain Lion still exists (evidenced by the fact that when I try to enter my previous user name, Setup Assistant informs me that username is taken and won't let me continue).\nSeeing as how my system is already configured, I'd like to skip the Setup Assistant.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: It may be possible for you to bypass the Setup Assistant by creating a file at /var/db/.AppleSetupDone. This can be done by: booting up into single user mode.\nThe following command will mount the boot drive as read/write device, create the .AppleSetupDone file, and restart your computer\nmount -uw / && touch /var/db/.AppleSetupDone && reboot\n\nIf your user account is actually intact, you will be able to login to the computer, and everything will be normal. However, in some of these situations, it's possible that your user account doesn't actually exist (unlikely based on the fact that you can't recreate it), or that your password hash is not a supported one (or is missing).\nIf you cannot login normally after disabling the Setup Assistant, you can re-enable it by removing the file that you created above. This can be accomplished by booting back into single user mode, and performing the following command:\nmount -uw / && rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone && reboot\n\nOnce you've restarted, create a differently named user account (Admin?), and use that account to survey the scene. With the newly created user, make sure that you see an existing account for your previous user in System Preferences. If the user exists, it may help to reset the password for that user (to re-create the hash), and then attempt to login.\n", "Q: When I click on Install App, nothing happens I am trying to install Mavericks on my 2009 Macbook Pro running OS 10.7.5.\nWhen I click on Install App in the App Store, Mavericks doesn't install.

In the powerline docs it specifies that the glyph table starts at 0xE0A0 however in Parser.vim they're using 0x2B60 instead. On 10.8 it works because, in the case of 0x2B60 and 0xE0A0, the branch glyph simple exists in both locations.\nYou can try it by typing into a 10.8 terminal:\necho -n '\\uE0A0'\necho -n '\\u2B60'\n\nAnyways, because 0x2B60 and the others do not exist anymore you just have to update autoload/Pl/Parser.vim to look something like this:\n        \\ 'fancy': {\n            \\   'dividers': [ [0xe0b0], [0xe0b1], [0xe0b2], [0xe0b3] ]\n            \\ , 'symbols' : {\n                    \\   'BRANCH': [0xe0a0]\n                    \\ , 'RO'    : [0xe0a4]\n                    \\ , 'FT'    : [0xe0a2, 0xe0a3]\n                    \\ , 'LINE'  : [0xe0a1]\n\nAlso, you'll probably have to run :PowerlineClearCache for it to take effect.\n", "Q: After the iOS 7 update the weather app has changed my suburbs After updating my iPhone 5 to iOS 7 the weather app that comes on the phone has changed all my suburbs to Sydney.

Nothing is letting me restore. I do not have a computer with the iTunes app synced/backed up. My computer is down since I set up iTunes and I'm using a spare on which I'm unable to download iTunes.\n\nA: iTunes app cannot be deleted from the iPhone. In any case, you probably don't need the iTunes app but what you are trying to access is the Music app instead - which lists all your iPhone songs and playlists. Simply search for Music and open the app. You should see your music intact.\n", "Q: Is it better to upgrade to Mavericks or to perform a clean install? I got my MBP yesterday. It's almost new. Before using it, I want to know should I normal upgrade to Mavericks or perform a clean install? Which one will be better for me? I have several applications installed on it. Should it be removed after upgrading?\n\nA: First, take a backup (using Time Machine or a cloning tool like Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! or Clonezilla) so that you can revert to it if at all something goes wrong and you're unable to salvage it through simple troubleshooting and fixes.\nAfter that, just do a straight upgrade to OS X Mavericks. If you have several apps already installed, then an upgrade will save you a lot of time. The upgrade to OS X Mavericks will retain all your applications, settings and files (they won't be removed).\nAlso, a clean install is recommended only if you're having some issues in the system that you're unable to trace and resolve through other means. For every other case, a straight upgrade is reliable and quicker.\nOn the other hand, if you choose a clean install, then you would have to (follow this tedious and time consuming process):\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your system (using Time Machine or a cloning tool like Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! or Clonezilla)\n\n*Install OS X Mavericks\n\n*Configure all the settings for OS X Mavericks as if you were setting up a new system\n\n*Install all your applications afresh\n\n*Configure each of your applications according to how you'd like\n\n*Copy all your files and folders from the backup\n\n\nA: Considering you only just got your MBP, theres not much of a point of wiping it clean anyway. Just a straight upgrade would do you fine :)\n\nA: For patch level updates, I always just do the normal update process.  For major releases like Lion => Mavericks, I always do a clean install.  It's easy to just restore from your Time Machine drive.  Even if you have tons of data, just let the restore run over night and when you wake up you have a fresh machine with all of your stuff where you left it.\n", "Q: OS X 10.9 Redistributable? I work in an Apple-only office environment with ~40 Macs. Is it possible for me to download an OS X 10.9 redistributable so that we're not downloading 5+ GB continually over our ADSL link ?\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes it is. \nYou can download it once and then distribute it over an external Harddrive, an USB Flash Drive or your network. The package is called Install OS X Mavericks.app and you will find it in the directory /Applications.\n\nA: Yes.\nThe Mavericks installer downloads as an app called Install OS X Mavericks, which gets installed in your /Applications folder. If you copy that to a USB drive, you can take it around and copy it to each one of your computers.\nHowever, be careful – normally, the installation process deletes the app once it's done. You need to copy it from a machine before you install Mavericks on it.\nEven better, you could create a bootable Mavericks install disk on a USB drive (like the old CDs that Apple used to ship <- remember those? :P). There are plenty of instructions around the web; Macworld and Ars Technica both seem to have particularly good ones.\n\nOne of the new features of Mavericks Server is designed to alleviate this burden. Quoting from Apple’s product page:\n\nCaching Server makes it faster than ever to download apps to every Mac on your network running OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 or later. When a user on your network downloads new software from the Mac App Store, a copy is automatically stored on your server. So the next time other users on your network update or download that same software, they're actually accessing it from inside the network.\n\nIf all of your machines are already in Mountain Lion, then you might be able to install Mavericks Server once, then push the update out this way. That saves you carrying around a USB drive, and is a more future-proof solution.\nHowever, I’ve not used Mavericks Server yet, so I can’t attest to the quality of this feature.\n\nA: And with CCC (carbon copy cloner) you can make a bootable volume (SD CARD, USB…).  \n", "Q: Font smoothing is wrong after Mavericks update on MacBook Pro with high-res display (not retina) After I updated to Mavericks, the font smoothing is terrible, tried playing with the setting in system preferences (didn't restart yet) and nothing changed. \nI have a 15 inch early 2011 Macbook Pro with high resolution anti-glare screen (not retina)\nHere's a sample:\n\nHere's Finder menu bar in Mountain Lion \n\nvs Mavericks \n\nIn this example you see that the left of \"F\" in \"File\" is noticeably fuzzier in Mavericks.  \nThe problem is all over: window bars, menu bars, web pages (Chrome & Safari), apps, etc.\n\nA: The system font was changed to a modified version of Lucida Grande. It was mentioned in the What's New in Cocoa presentation:\n\nThe normal Lucida Grande doesn't seem to have changed:\n\nThere is still this hidden preference for using a lighter text rendering style:\ndefaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 1\n\nQuit and reopen applications or log out and back in to apply the changes.\n\n\nThe regular faces of the new and old versions don't look that different, but the bold face seems to be bolder in the new version.\nThe screenshots posted by gooogalizer have bigger differences though, so maybe the new version is rendered in a different way on high-resolution displays, or maybe something else changed in the way text is rendered on high-resolution displays.\n\nA: What this means is that Apple plans to produce all of their upcoming products with retina-displays within 6 months. Mavericks is made for this feature. I updated to Mavericks as well on my new Air and it looks fuzzy. It's not fun. I suppose that'll force me to upgrade to a new one in less than a year if I want't to be able to save my eyes.\n\nA: This solution worked for me:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Download the patch-edid.rb script from the forums thread above and put it in your home directory.\n  \n*Connect only the external monitor(s) in question (I closed my MacBook lid, for example). The script will make override files for any connected monitor.\n  \n*Type ruby patch-edid.rb in Terminal.\n  \n*A new folder will be created in your home directory. Move it into the /System/Library/Displays/Overrides folder. If Finder tells you that you are overwriting an existing folder, consider backing it up first.\n  \n*Restart your computer, enjoy your monitor.\n  \n\nAfter applying the script with edits the EDID info for the monitor, also calibrate it and the fonts should look much better (at least in OS X menus and Safari). Chrome still renders bold fonts differently.\n\nA: I have this same issue. The lighter text rendering command does help a little but not sure if it stays after a reboot? \nThe break-through for me has been switching browsers. I now use Google chrome for most of my browsing. \nBoth text and graphics look much sharper - when comparing some sites the difference is enormous.\n\nA: If you have jagged fonts and washed out colors then it can mean in the Accessibility Prefs Pane the contrast is not set to Normal:\n\nIf the contrast setting is anything other than normal then the LCD font smoothing in General Prefs is overridden which is what causes the jagged fonts. Higher contrast settings can even cause parts of text to dissapear. This is particularly noticeable in Mail for an unselected message preview text.\nTo fix, drag the Display contrast slider to Normal.\n", "Q: OSX Maps displays a non existant iPhone I have recently had my iPhone 5 replaced at the apple store due to an antenna failure. At the time it was running iOS 7 and upon handing it over to receive the new one, iCloud was disabled and the phone was then erased and restored.\nNow when I updated to Mavericks, the maps app now displays the old iPhone and the new one.\n\nHow can I get rid of the inactive iPhone? The two constantly swap around and if I want to send directions to my phone I'm forced to send it to both of them twice since every time I open the dropdown, they keep swapping around. And I realize that it's becoming a huge pain.\n\nA: Finally found a fix for this!\nThe fault lies on the Mac itself. Simply signing out of iCloud on the Mac and signing back in removes any past iCloud enabled devices from Maps.\nAlthough this caused a new problem, it fixed the annoying Maps problem. Other than that hope this helps others out there experiencing the same thing!\n\nA: Rename your iPhone in iTunes or Settings > General > About > Name.

I expected it to be fixed by iOS 7.0.3 update, but it isn't.\n\nA: It looks like you have to just wait for the animation to finish.\nBy turning on 'Reduce Motion' you get another animation, which looks like it is a bit faster.

Just \"throwing\" it down to the bottom of the screen with a one-finger swipe no longer does the trick; I have to keep my finger on the trackpad to get the dock to show.\nI asked a colleague and he noticed the same thing, only in a full-screen app, is there a way to turn this \"feature\" off, or is this a bug?\n\nA: This seems to be the new gesture in Mavericks.  It used to be that you had to pull the mouse/trackpad down twice in quick succession.  Now you just have to hold the mouse/trackpad down at the bottom of the screen.  I had not figured this one out before reading your post, so thank you.  I have found nothing about this anywhere else. Apparently, this gesture cannot be changed.\n\nA: In order to get the Dock to appear for full-screen app, rest (don't click) your finger on the mouse anywhere on the screen, while swiping to the bottom of the screen. The Dock will then appear immediately when you hit bottom. \n\nNote that none of the other methods described here work reliably for me, but this one does every time.\n\nA: As I remember, it was actually the same mechanic before. The difference is that now you have to do the second swipe slowly.

Now you can double-click to open.\n\n*Command-click folder \n\n*Turn on right button clicking for the mouse in System Preferences. Then right click for sub menu and \"open in new window\"\n", "Q: Problem with exporting with gimp I usually export images through gimp. This time, I was on my new OS X Mavericks, as I tried to change the name of the image which was \"LOST\", was not working. I observed the toolbox going to another tool as I typed the letters. I knew that I was pressing a shortcut but when I tried to press another letter like \"y\", the letter showed at the name of the image. How am I suppose to name the image when I export it?\n\nA: This is known issue with Gimp and Mavericks. Current workaround is to turn off all keyboard shortcuts (Preferences/Interface/Remove All Keyboard Shortcuts).\n\nA: Command-tabbing from the exec in the dock to GIMP in the dock back to exec once each time I export seems to be a decent workaround for me.\n", "Q: Mavericks: Window across multiple monitors? I just updates to OS X Mavericks on my iMac 27\" late 2012 with an additional monitor.\nIn previous versions of OS X it was no problem to have one window visible across both monitors, which is very helpful if you work on big spreadsheets. But since the update to Mavericks this seems to be impossible. If I put a window so that parts of it are on monitor 1 and the rest on monitor 2, then only that part is visible that is located on that monitor where the mouse pointer was when i released it after dragging the window. The part covering parts of the other monitor are not displayed after end of dragging.\nIs this just a matter of settings? I really hope so. But I did not find anything in the settings.\nCan you help me to make all parts of a window visible in all monitors it touches?\n\nA: Quoting from John Siracusa’s review of Mavericks (emphasis mine):\n\nIf you prefer the old behavior, uncheck the “Displays have separate Spaces” checkbox in the Mission Control preference pane. Doing so will also restore the ability to have windows that span more than one display.\n\n\nSo yes, it’s just a setting. It’s been put in the Mission Control pane, rather than Displays, because the effect of this change is to allow you to have different full screen apps on different displays.\nThe page of the review that I linked to explains the change in more detail (and specifically discusses the window-across-multiple-displays behaviour that you want).\n", "Q: Mavericks Tag colors Does anyone know how to make new tags with custom colours? \nIt is clear how to change colours to a predefined set of available colours, but I have no idea how to change to a custom colour. (With the colour picker? Changing templates?)\n\nA: You can't.\nThe seven colours are unchangeable, because this is needed to provide backwards compatibility with earlier versions of OS X (where they were called labels, you could only have one, and you couldn't change the colour).\nIf you want a detailed explanation of why tags were implemented this way, and why that restricts the tag colours to the default, then I suggest reading page 9 of John Siracusa’s Mavericks review.\n", "Q: Mavericks clean install with restoration from Time Machine Let's say I want to perform a Mavericks clean install like described in this tutorial. But what I also want to do is to keep all my older apps (especially ones not installed from the AppStore and all their data). I have OS X 10.9 developer preview. Is it possible to do a Time Machine backup, then perform clean install and then restore the data?\nWhat would be the outcome of such operation and wouldn't it level the effects of the clean install (e.g. transferring some unnecessary system data) while restoring from the backup?\n\nA: Your point about the restore from Time Machine leveling the effect of the clean install is correct. Unless you restrict yourself to just copying data files alone from a backup, while excluding custom application installs, application settings and system settings, a clean install would only mean spending more time with no apparent benefit.\nAs I mentioned in this answer to Is it better to upgrade to Mavericks or to perform a clean install?, a clean install is a tedious process that's better done only if you're having some issues in the system that you're unable to trace and resolve through other means.\nDiscounting bugs in OS X Mavericks itself, you would not notice any stability issues by going the upgrade path.\nAs a historical note, Apple used to provide an \"Archive and upgrade\" process long ago where the previous OS would be archived during the upgrade (this was during the time of Mac OS X Snow Leopard and before) and then moved to a straightforward upgrade process that has worked well for several years now. \n", "Q: Safari 7.0 cannot load localhost After upgrading to 10.9 and Safari 7.0, I can no longer load http://localhost:4000 in Safari. Yes, my site still loads perfect when I load it in Chrome and Firefox, so this is something new in Safari.\nThese are the error messages that I see in the developer window. The error message is\nFailed to load resource: The network connection was lost.\n\n\nIt even looks like the server is doing its job correctly. Here's the output from the rake console. Everything is returning 200.\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2013 06:25:49] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 0.0039\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2013 06:25:49] \"GET /stylesheets/screen.css HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 0.0022\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2013 06:25:49] \"GET /javascripts/modernizr-2.0.js HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 0.0014\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2013 06:25:49] \"GET /javascripts/octopress.js HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 0.0018\n127.0.0.1 - - [24/Oct/2013 06:25:49] \"GET /javascripts/ender.js HTTP/1.1\" 200 - 0.0048\n\n\nA: I believe this is a problem with WEBrick v1.3.  WEBrick isn't returning the correct content length & notifies users of this:\n\nWARN Could not determine content-length of response body. Set content-length of the response or set Response#chunked = true\n\nTrying to wget the same resource will also flag an error in the network connection as per: https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1395\nChrome & Firefox just display whatever content was received & don't worry about the mismatch in content length.  Safari, starting with Safari 7.0 on Mavericks' 10.9 is stricter about the response & treats the mismatch as a \"Failure to load resource\" error.  (If I had to guess they're probably trying to improve the speed so don't retry the resource and so don't get the file fully retrieved response that wget does).\nIf you replace WEBrick with thin, this problem should go away.  To do this on a Rack-based application try:\necho gem \\\"thin\\\" >> Gemfile\nbundle install\nrbenv rehash # if you're using rbenv\nbundle exec rackup -s thin\n\n\nA: It might be related to your local development server not sending all the bytes of one of those CSS or JS files to Safari?  \nIt seems like Safari is not very forgiving where other browsers are.  SteveLTN thinks this is might be the case in a similar sounding  Octopress issue on GitHub:\n\nI have found that the file octopress.js should be 8482 bytes, but\n  somehow the server reported 8502 bytes to the browser ( and wget too\n  ), which leads the browser to think that the network connection is\n  lost when received 8482 bytes. Wget, Chrome and Firefox could probably\n  automatically retry it, but Safari didn't somehow. Thank you.\n\n\nA: I experienced a very similar problem running a Sinatra app on Mavericks with Safari. I can confirm that installing 'thin' (gem install thin) and adding it to the app's gemfile were all that was needed to solve this.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to switch focus between multiple displays on OS X 10.9+ The fact that each monitor acts on its own in OS X Mavericks is pretty cool. However, I find that I have to use my mouse and click on the unfocused monitor before I can actually slide back and forth its screens (or spaces).\nWhat's the keyboard shortcut to switch focus to another monitor?\nupdate: follow up question\n\nA: (This should be a comment but I don't have the reputation to post one.)\nI have the same issue. I work almost exclusively in full-screen apps and switch between them with ctrl+◀︎ and ctrl+▶︎. I like to work on my primary monitor and use the secondary for Messages. But I don't want to leave Messages visible when I'm not using it; I would rather switch back to the Desktop on the secondary monitor. But to put focus on the secondary monitor, I have to move the mouse pointer, totally defeating the time and effort savings of using the keyboard shortcut for app switching.\nFor what it's worth, you don't have to click on anything to change focus to a different monitor. You only need to move your mouse pointer where you want focus.\n\nA: I use Keyboard Maestro to do just this.\nI mapped the F16 thru F19 keys in this order.\nF16 Left monitor move left\nF17 Left monitor move right\nF18 Right monitor move left\nF19 Right monitor move right\nI created 4 Keyboard Maestro Actions for this, one for each monitor and one for each direction. Here is the basic shortcut which gets adjusted accordingly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the mouse over to whichever monitor without clicking.\n\n*Keystroke Ctrl-[left arrow] or [right arrow], depending.\nActually I changed the Keyboard Shortcut in System Preferences under mission control from:\nCtrl-Arrow to move left/right a space to:\nShift-Control-Option-Command left/right arrow to free up the simpler control arrows for other activities. I also changed the Keyboard Maestro Macro to reflect the change.\nWhile at it I also have the following mission control operations.\nF13 Show desktop\nF14 Show application windows\nF15 Mission Control\nI have it set up for the mouse to stay on the changed monitor but it could easily be set to return to where it started from.\n\nA: Here's a way that works from the keyboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Keyboard and click the Shortcuts tab.\n\n*Choose Mission Control from the sidebar.\n\n*Scroll down until you see Mission Control listed in the main panel; check its box if not checked, and click the disclosure triangle.\n\n*You should see Move left a space, Move right a space, and then a series of Switch to Desktop 1, Switch to Desktop 2, etc. for as many desktop spaces as you have going at the moment.\n\n*Check all of the boxes of the Switch to Desktop N type.\n\n*In my prefs, each of those Switch-tos has a shortcut already there - Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2, ... Ctrl-N, where N is the Desktop number (Control key is shown as a carat ('^'). You can assign whatever you want to these, but keeping them in a sequential scheme helps, so I suggest leaving them as is.\n\n*Now, you can switch among your functioning desktops (aka Spaces), and if one you choose is on the other display, focus will shift to that display. \n\n*If you don't remember which number a Desktop is, you could first use your shortcut for Mission Control itself (mine is ⌥ Opt-Up Arrow, which I think was the default, but again you can set that for whatever you want). You'll see your current numbered Desktops, and can then use the appropriate shortcut. Press ⎋ Esc to get out of Mission Control.\n\n*I see that if I have all of the Switch-tos checked, then if I had another Desktop and check keyboard shortcuts again, the new Desktop is added to the Switch-to list and its shortcut is checked as well. So no need to go back to Prefs after the above steps.\nThanks for stimulating me to poke into this. I was having the same frustration as you and others!\nADDED for El Capitan: In my October 31 2016 note I describe my latest finding for switching to a space in the external display. It seems you need at least two spaces defined on your external display, and then you need to hit Control-N, Control-M, and you will be live in space M, where N & M are space numbers of spaces on the external display.\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro can help you do that. \nIn my case, I use CTRL + 0,1,2 to refer screen 0, 1, 2. Below is how I configure that. Also, 0,1,2 on number pad is close to your arrow keys, then you can use CTRL + arrows to switch windows on selected display.\nNotice, I use click because I want to move the focus to the window under cursor.\n\n\nA: Best solution I've found thus far is to install the free CatchMouse utility off the app store.  It allows you to assign different keyboard shortcuts to \"warp\" the mouse pointer to the center of each monitor.  In my case I've mapped my left hand monitor to Ctrl+⎇ Alt+←, and the right one to Ctrl+⎇ Alt+→.\nNote: The link to CatchMouse has been updated to an unknown and untrusted source. Download and use at your own risk!\n\nA: I just found an open source window manager called slate.. From my point of view it's better than divvy and better than sizeup.. and it has a key binding for switching focus between screens. Its default key bindings are shown here (very customizable).. it defaults to~  ⌘→ and ⌘←\nbonus: here is my slate config file.. it can give you some ideas to get you started\nupdate\nFrom the comments I realized that my above answer isn't about switching focus, rather it's about throwing windows around from one monitor to another. That's not what the question was about.\nThis solution works assuming that you already have application windows already open in all your monitors.. \nTake a look at this screenshot to understand my solution (click on it to zoom):\n\nscenario 1\ni simply click on ⌘tab to switch between the applications (ie i switch from chrome which is on the already focused monitor to terminal which is on the monitor i want to focus on\nscenario 2\nI do the same simply by clicking on ⌘`, this makes me switch between windows of the same application.. in the example below i got chrome windows in all three monitors, so I simply go through them until I reach the window I want to switch focus to..\n\nA: Another option is the MacOS window manager inspired by xmonad called Amethyst which has some key-bindings (default) ⌥⇧P and ⌥⇧N to cycle the mouse pointer between screens. There's more it can do of course.\n", "Q: OSX Mavericks not downloading from Mac App Store (Lion) I have OSX Lion 10.7.5 and am trying to download the new OSX Mavericks. \nThere is free upgrade option in the Mac App store, which I click and it starts downloading on the launchpad.\nBut when first when I went to the Purchases section of the App store, the button against the OSX Mavericks said Download. \nWhen I click on it, nothing happened. \nIn the launchpad it just keeps saying Downloading without much progress.\nAny idea as to what could be the issue?\n\nA: I recommend to just be patient. I had the same issue, I repeatedly clicked \"Download\" in the App Store, and in the Launchpad I couldn't see much progress at first, but eventually it was downloading (without me having to do anything and insanely clicking probably didn't help).

Although you will get a message \"Unable to view file\", if you tap the Download icon on the top right, it will give you the option to Open in iBooks.\n\nA: I manage my books using iTunes on my Mac and have not found any issues with gumroad texts and using Apple's iBooks reader.\n", "Q: Performance of Numbers 3.0 for large calculation sheet When I used previous versions of Numbers to work with files containing a lot of large formulas, the performance of many actions were slow, including scrolling.  Can you comment how about the latest software update from Apple?\n\nA: I just purchased and tried out Numbers 3.0, and Apple definitely improved the calculation process, as my sheets using large formulas already perform much faster. Performance is better.\n", "Q: Does play count data update on iTunes music is played on the iPhone? If I listened to a song on my iPhone does it update the value on my macbook's iTunes ?

After upgrading to Mavericks the problems still persist.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Blurry drop-down list and other old-fashioned low-definition controls are everywhere (even in Apple apps such as iTunes);\n\n*In Microsoft Office 2011, the controls used are different from what I see in screenshots on the web (with stripes in background, most noticeably), and I don't get the full-screen toggle button on the top right corner;\n\n*In Firefox and Opera the controls are even broken, apart from being old. When I scroll the page the scrollbar gets partially stuck (see the picture).\n\n*In Adobe Acrobat XI the tools on the right do not expand. If I make them expand by clicking the arrow and restarting Acrobat, the tools cannot be applied onto the content and soon the app loses response.\n\n\nI am sure that these apps run in Retina resolution. But why (and how) do they get the old controls? Can I make them use the modern controls? I don't remember installing anything to change the look-and-feel of the system, but what might have I installed to produce such a situation?\n\nA: All the problem (except the 4th one -- Adobe Acrobat) disappeared recently without me doing anything specific. At first all buttons except the colored default button are replaced with new button styles, and then the default buttons are fixed some hours later. Note that an upgrade to Mavericks does NOT solve the issues, nor any restarts or permission repairs do.\nI installed updates for iTunes, iBooks, Mail and Xcode just before the problem disappeared. I also installed a Java VM for running Java applets in my browser, though I don't think all these programs are Java-based. This information might give hints on what actually fixes the ugly UI.\nP.S. I just noticed some other changes in the overall UI. Maybe Apple is changing the UI in the background, without showing anything in the App Store?\n", "Q: Change to QuickTime player in Mavericks? It appears Apple has changed the QuickTime player in Mavericks.\nYou can no longer extract music from a video.\nPreviously you could run a video and when you saved, it gave you an option for audio only.

Now whenever a social, promotions, updates or forums email comes in I get a notification on iOS from the Mailbox app. Previously I would just get notifications for \"real\" inbox emails. How can I continue to only receive iOS notifications for these?\n\nA: As these emails are really in your inbox, you will receive notifications for them. My only suggestion is to use the gmail app in place of the ios mail app. The google gmail app allows you to specify for which folders you receive notifications for all new mail or 'primary only'.\n", "Q: Why does OS X Mavericks block the purge command in Terminal? When I try the purge command on my terminal, OS X Mavericks gives me the following message: \nUnable to purge disk buffers: Operation not permitted\n\nThis hasn't been the default behavior until now. I wonder why Apple changed that. Is there a reason behind this decision? What are the advantages/disadvantages of this?\n\nA: You need to run this command with root privileges. Try:\n> sudo purge\n\nWARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss\nor the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your\ntyping when using sudo. Type \"man sudo\" for more information.\n\nTo proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort.\n\nPassword:\n\nEnter your account's password and it should run the purge command.\nApple probably made the decision for security purposes. The only disadvantage is you have to type in your admin password. The advantage is, for non-admin users, they can not run this command and potentially harm their OS.\nUsually commands that require sudo in order to run at all are potentially destructive or invasive. Two other commands with this requirement are dtrace and xcode-select.\n\nA: I'm no expert, but it may have something to do with the compressed memory thingy in OS X 10.9\n\nDoing more\nThe more memory your Mac has at its disposal, the faster it works. But when you have multiple apps running, your Mac uses more memory. With OS X Mavericks, Compressed Memory allows your Mac to free up memory space when you need it most. As your Mac approaches maximum memory capacity, OS X automatically compresses data from inactive apps, making more memory available\nExrta Fast\nOnce the memory is compressed, your Mac doesn’t have to waste time continually transferring data back and forth between memory and storage. So it’s able to get more done in less time. And since compressing and decompressing happens almost instantly, the only thing you’ll notice is how responsive everything feels. Especially when you’re doing everything at once.\n\nSource: http://www.apple.com/osx/advanced-technologies/ (non-existing)\nSee also: OS X Mavericks is more than Powerful: It’s Power Smart (PDF)\nThey may have done that do avoid the older program from interfeering with the new way of doing things. But I have no idea.\n\nA: Using the purge command can have serious negative effects on the performance of the system (since you are essentially telling the kernel to forget all of its accumulated knowledge about your recent usage, walk through the inactive list and toss everything -- even if some process/driver was about to make use of it -- and then fault/recreate it all again from scratch).  Thus, it makes sense that it would require some level of privilege to execute it.\n\nA: http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-give-your-mac-a-performance-boost--mac-46271\n\nCreating a Terminal Script to Purge the Memory\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Start by opening Terminal.\n  \n*Enter the following line:\ncd Desktop/\n\nand press enter. This points the Terminal to your desktop rather than your user folder. You can point Terminal to any folder you want for this tutorial.\n  \n*Enter:\ntouch Purge\n\nand press enter. This creates a new file called \"Purge\" on your desktop, you won't see it just yet though.\n  \n*Enter:\npico Purge\n\nand press enter. This opens up the Terminal editor for the purge file.\n  \n*Enter the following text in the editor:\n#!/bin/sh\n\npurge\n\n  \n*Press Control + O and then Enter to save the file to your desktop. Then press Control + X to exit the editor. Make sure to use the Control key, not the command key.\n  \n*Once you're back at the normal Terminal screen, enter:\nchmod 755 Purge\n\nand press enter. This makes the file we just created accessible to you. By default, OS X hides the files you create using touch.\n  \n*You now will have a file on your desktop called \"Purge.\" You can open this file to automatically clean your computers memory. Once the Terminal shows a [Process complete] message you can close the application and continue on.\n\n\nA: 'purge' does not release enough RAM.

I have the following problem:\nAlthough I know the fully qualified DN for a user (in the form cn={username}, ou=USERS, o=ORGNAME), I cannot lookup an attribute of password for the user. (This may be anticipated.) The user can authenticate against the LDAP server though.\nI have managed to link the LDAP account in Directory Utility, and do actually get a list of users in the \"Directory Editor\" but I have no idea how to actually propagate that into the system. Specifically (as this is an OS X Server install) I wish to import them in the Server admin app, so LDAP users can log into wiki's, etc. In the Server app, no users appear in the User browser.\nIn advance, I know that that DN looks like an AD DN, it is. However, this server is not on the domain and I do not have domain or LDAP admin rights, so this authentication needs to happen without that.\nCan someone guide me into how to configure this? I've spent some time with Google, but either I'm searching for the wrong thing (possible) or none of the results help.\n\nA: It's possible that you need to set the Authentication Search Path inside of Directory Utility -> Search Policy -> Authentication...Make sure \"Search\" says \"Custom Path\", and that your Active Directory domain is listed below.\nIf you do not see your AD domain in the list, you can authenticate to Directory Utility by clicking the lock in the lower-left corner, and then add a new search path by clicking the \"+\" button below the list of paths. Your domain should show up under \"Available Directory Domains\".\nThis setting should allow users to authenticate against Active Directory when connecting to your server. However, if AD users can authenticate against your OS X server successfully, the Search Path is not likely to be the culprit.\nAlternatively, Workgroup Manager still exists, and may allow you to investigate the AD node more explicitly.\nLastly, you may be required to enable cleartext authentication to be able to authenticate your AD users to your OS X Server hosted wiki (the article applies to Mountain Lion and lower systems, but may be the same procedure that is required for Mavericks).\n", "Q: Is there a way to quickly teleport a window from one display to another? I have multiple displays at my workstation, and I'm looking for a way to quickly \"teleport\" a window -- whether it's full-screened or not -- from one display to another.\nWhen I was on Windows, I used an application called DisplayFusion that allowed me to middle-click on a window's titlebar and instantaneously move it to the next monitor. I'm looking for something similar to that.\nIt is possible to do this in Mavericks?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool\nBetterTouchTool allows you to set a trigger to move a window to a second monitor, such as the one below:\n\nTrigger: Doubleclick Window Titlebar; Predifined Action: Move Window to Next Monitor\nAlternatively, a mouse button, keyboard shortcut, Apple Remote, Magic Mouse or trackpad gesture could be set up as the trigger.\nSlate\nSlate is an extremely customisable tool that allows you to set window layouts/positions through keyboard shortcuts. Combining this with a BTT gesture, you can create a gesture-driven window movement tool for free!\n\nSlate is a window management application similar to Divvy and SizeUp (except better and free!). Originally written to replace them due to some limitations in how each work, it attempts to overcome them by simply being extremely configurable. As a result, it may be a bit daunting to get configured, but once it is done, the benefit is huge.\n\n\nA: It's not identical to DisplayFusion, but I've been using Divvy for quite awhile now to manage windows between my non-Retina 15\" MBP and my 27\" Thunderbolt:\n\nWith Divvy, it’s as simple as a single click and drag in the Divvy interface and your window will be resized and moved to a relative portion of the screen. If that seems like too much work, you can go ahead and create as many different shortcuts as you’d like that resize and move your windows.\n\nOther 3rd party window managers for OS X include Witch, SizeUp, Breeze, and Cinch - here's a relatively recent review of several: http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/utilities-roundups/20-mac-window-management-utilities/\nThere's no similar built-in functionality in any OS X release, including Mavericks.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have more waypoints in Maps.app on OSX?

My next choice would to do a total clean install. Is there any way to fix this? I do have screen shots but having trouble uploading them.\n\n\n\nA: I've encountered that before, particularly at times when Apple's update servers are under heavy load, as they are now (due to the new OS X release and accompanying software updates). As far as I can tell, it's typically a problem with the indicator itself, rather than updates being missing.

It is available via Homebrew: brew install proxychains-ng.\nNote there is a known limitation on 10.11+ that SIP prevents hooking of system binaries - see GitHub issue #78 - but it can be used with anything installed via Homebrew, as the binaries are in directories not affected by SIP.

Sometimes, a volume refuses to eject because some program is using them.\nSadly, Finder doesn't give the identity nor gives a way to solve the problem.\nSo, how do you solve this problem in a clean way, without using a terminal ?\nUsing the terminal, I may find a way to eject it, but it's not reliable.\nsudo lsof | grep volumeName certainly gives some information, but I don't feel like killing random processes in order to unmount a volume. Also, not everybody is willing to run command in a terminal.\nI also don't want to force eject the volume. I think we shouldn't have to force the ejection when we didn't initially run the program that locks the volume.\nProcesses that are frequently involved are: mds and notifyd.\nKilling mds does not guarantee that the ejection of the volume will be possible. mds process is respawned after getting killed, and continues preventing the ejection of the drive.\nI also noticed that mds can be running and using files, and still not preventing the ejection of the volume, so I'm not even sure that it's mds fault.\n\nA: I've found this solution that has worked reliably several times already today. \nThe process that, in my case, was responsible for the failure of the ejection was:\nSystemUIS (as seen in top in a terminal) which is in fact SystemUIServer.\nHere is how to kill it without a terminal: run Activity Monitor, find SystemUIServer (type UI in the top right search field), and stop it with the top left button (stop button).\n\nA: This is an attempt to write a canonical QA for this issue, as per the Meta post:  Where is the list of canonical questions stored for Ask Different? I expect it to be periodically edited with the goal of becoming a comprehensive information resource.\nThere is any number of reasons that you'll encounter this \"error.\"  In fact, it's not an error per se, but a warning that something on the mounted volume is in use and should be properly closed before ejecting it.\nThe the OP's case it was SystemUI as detailed in their answer.  It's possible that you'll encounter this exact same scenario, but more than likely, you'll run into something completely different.\nWhat can cause this?  Pretty much any (but not limited to) the following conditions of the mounted volume:\n\n\n*\n\n*Merely an open Finder window of the mounted volume\n\n*A text file opened for editing\n\n*A PDF opened in preview\n\n*A Terminal session in which the current directory $PWD is on the mounted volume\n\n*An \"install\" script/function that is paused and/or pushed to the background\n\n*And many more...\n\n\nSo, how do you solve this?\nFind out what process has your files\nYou can use the lsof command to \"list open files.\"  \nFor this example, I have mounted a USB drive called \"Music\"  and I have traversed down a couple of directories.  I haven't opened anything or even loaded up a song to be played.  Executing the command:\n$ sudo lsof | grep Music\n\ngives me the following:\nbash      64364            allan  cwd       DIR               1,16       32768     23327 /Volumes/MUSIC/Music Collection/a-ha/Hunting High and Low\n\nThis tells me that in bash, there's a \"current working directory\" (cwd) in this particular folder:  /Volumes/MUSIC/Music Collection/a-ha/Hunting High and Low.  In other words, I have an open Terminal session with that sub directory selected.  Just leave the sub directory and you'll be able to eject the volume.\nHow do you get the list of mounted volumes?\n\n\n*\n\n*mount (This command all by itself will list the mounted volumes)\n\n*ls /Volumes\n", "Q: How do I prevent Calendar from starting up when I log in to Mavericks?

I appreciate hiding Library by default, but since Lion have missed it being easily accessible.\nHow can I get the library folder to be visible in Finder, the Finder go menus / file save dialogs without needing to hold down shift?\n\nA: Apple decided to hide the Library from its users in recent OS X updates, but in Mavericks you can now change that with a simple checkbox.\nIn the past you had to enter a Terminal command with every little system update:\nchflags nohidden ~/Library\n\nWith OS X Mavericks, you can just navigate to your home folder, press cmd+J to bring up the folder settings, and check the box next to \"Show Library Folder\" instead.\n\nA: Open your desired user Home folder in Finder (ShiftCommand + H) and select View > Show View Options.

I was curious what iCloud Keychain (which I haven't explicitly stored any passwords in, yet) was storing, so I headed to Keychain Access.  There I found an item I wasn't familiar with called EscrowService, which appears to have a Date Modified of around the time I was updating to Mavericks:\n\n\nKey escrow being very concerning (by definition, it is the storage of a key with a trusted third party), I disabled iCloud Keychain.  The item remains in my Local Items keychain, along with other items such as server passwords used by Mail.app and Wi-Fi keys.\nDoes anyone know what this item is for?  I suspect if com.apple.lakitu can be identified, it might be a step in the right direction, but I'm coming up short on searches.\n\nA: Well, Lakitu is the turtle that rides in a cloud and throws spiny bombs at the hero of the Super Mario Bros game.\n\nHowever, I have no such key in any of the Macs which I have enabled iCloud keychain sync, so despite the extremely evocative name of com.apple.lakitu I'm not so sure it's part of the default setup unless it's a placeholder for someone that hasn't yet allowed any keychain items to be stored for syncing?\n\nMy only guess is that it holds a key until you establish your syncing or if you do not choose a security code and it stores a self generated code rather than using just your iCloud keychain pin to sync. If you haven't enabled an actual long form security code or added a second device that could be a reason why I'm not seeing this entry and you are.\n\nA: I just today found an article explaining the escrow service for iCloud Keychain.\n\nIf iCloud Keychain is configured to use 4-digit iCloud Security Code (which is a default) then there is additional iCloud service involved: \"escrow proxy.\" In a nutshell, escrow proxy holds encryption keys to the keychain items shared via iCloud and provides those keys to properly authenticated clients.\n\nThe problem with this, according to the article, is that the 4-digit code is then used to encrypt the escrow key.  The 4-digit code constitutes a very weak form of encryption which Apple (or an attacker gaining access to the encrypted data stored with Apple) could brute-force very quickly.\nIt's been a long time, and I don't entirely recall if I tried the 4-digit code.  If I did, that would explain this.\nIt seems the best advice is to use the long password for iCloud Keychain or avoid it entirely.\n", "Q: How can I apply tags in Mavericks recursively? Now that Mavericks removed that ugly colored bar and replaced it with a nice looking dot, I would like to use tags more.\nBasically I have work files in different places that deal with different projects and I would like to apply the tag for all the files included in specific folders. The files may move around into new folders (outside of the original folder) in the future so I would like to apply a tag recursively to a folder so that I can find it easier if it gets moved out of its folder.\n\nA: You can use xattr to write various metadata related to the \"new\" tags in Mavericks. John Siracusa did the heavily lifting already here.\nEssentially you need to write two attributes, com.apple.FinderInfo and com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags, to the files. The easiest way is going to be to get a file tagged how you want and just copy the attributes from it. Open up terminal and change to the directory containing the folder you want to tag recursively. Then enter:\ntouch sampleFile\nopen .\n\nThat will open up Finder so you can tag the sampleFile how you want all the other files to be tagged. After you're done tagging, switch back to your terminal window and enter:\nfind yourDirName -type f | xargs xattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \\\n\"`xattr -px sampleFile`\"\n\nfind yourDirName -type f | xargs xattr -wx com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags \\\n\"`xattr -px com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags sampleFile`\"\n\nThat will recursively drill down and tag all the files in yourDirName as well as files in any subdirectories. You can leave the -type f argument off if you want to tag the subdirectories as well as the files.\nFinally, you can change the\nfind yourDirName -type f\n\ncommands to\nfind yourDirName -iname \"*.ext\"\n\nif you want to only tag certain file types/extensions.\n\nA: One simple way to do this is to use a Spotlight search to generate a list of all the files you're interested in. An example of how to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, navigate to the top of the folder structure you're interested in.\n\n*Type -kind:folder in the Spotlight search field\nThis will search for all files that are not a folder (the - sign negates the results).\n\n*Make sure you then restrict the search to the folder hierarchy you're interested in by clicking on the name of the folder in the search terms just underneath the Spotlight search field.\nYou will now have a list in your Finder window of all the files within that folder hierarchy. Now it is trivial to select all the files, and apply the tags you want in the usual way with Finder.\nUse different Spotlight searches to suit your needs.\nYou can make this process slightly easier by making Spotlight always search in the current folder and not This Mac:\nFinder -> Preferences -> Advanced -> When performing a search: Search the current folder\n\nA: There's a CLI tag tool available via Macports/Homebrew: https://github.com/jdberry/tag\nIt doesn't seem to have a recursion option, however, I would imagine you could use this in conjunction with the standard UNIX 'find'. \ne.g.,\n(from inside the directory you want to tag files in)\nfind . -exec tag --add tagname {} \\;  -print \n\n\nA: Go to the top folder and search for '.' within that folder.\nSelect all of the files and tag 'em.\nYou might need to remove the tag then reapply it.\n", "Q: Is there in AppleScript any way to use \"X of every\" to get multiple properties of each object to create a record?

Since iOS 7 asks for the account data after updating, this might have been introduced after updating.\n\nA: Make sure each person's iPad is using a separate account.   If they are all linked to one account, they will all receive the same messages.

You could try deleting it and re-downloading it.\nFirst, turn off Enhanced Dictation in System Prefs > Dictation. When you uncheck the box a panel will slide down that you can just Cancel (which will turn Dictation off). Next, open Finder and press shift-command-g simultaneously. In the dialog box paste the following and click go:\n/System/Library/Speech/Recognizers/\n\nIn the Recognizers folder there will be two folders. Delete (or rename) the folder called SpeechRecognitionCoreLanguages. It will ask you for your password to delete (or rename) the folder. After that you can go back to System Prefs > Dictation and turn Enhanced Dictation back on. It will show you your download progress in the bottom left corner of the System Prefs window.\n\nA: I had same problem and did the reinstall and still no fix, however I did notice in the \"dications and speech\" tool in System preferences that there is a drop down menu under the mic labelled \"internal microphone\". Click it to once again select internal mic in the options that drop down and the mic will now work.\n\nA: Resetting the cache of the language rec (deleting com.apple.SpeechRecognitionCore in caches of user library) helped me to reactivate a language where the mic reacted, but no transcription took place.\nFor more option look at https://discussions.apple.com/message/24229993\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I've had the same issue (enhanced dictation doesn't work, ordinary Apple server dictation does) and just solved it via a bit of research elsewhere. \nMe? Mac Mini mid 2010, El Capitan, maxed out memory, very basic Logitech AK5730 mike connected via USB.\nThe fault? \nApparently, there is  a coding error somewhere in the recognizer download for UK English (unaware if Apple are working on a fix though).\nAfter trying everything here, I found that little gem of info, switched off the Enhanced module, added another language (U.S.English), switched Enhanced back on, and it forced Dictation to download the new language recognizer.

Before the upgrade my 64GB SSD reported about 5GB free. After the upgrade it reports 18GB free.\nWhile this is fantastic, could someone tell me what is going on?\nMy initial thought is that there may have been 8GB swap space (I have 8GB RAM) which the upgrade may have freed,  but closing the lid and subsequently opening it again has not made any impression. I still have 18GB free.\n\nA: ETA: while the guesses below all stand, here’s a better one from Marceil Weiher:\n\n@rentzsch Have you checked with \"df\" vs. looking in Finder?  I think 10.9 subtracts the space for mobile Time Machine from used in latter.\nMarcel Weiher (@mpweiher) on Twitter\n\nI’ve done some poking around on the machines I have lying around, and I think this is plausible and probably correct.\nIf you use Time Machine, that’s probably your answer.\n\nWithout seeing your system, it’s hard to know, but here are some suggestions:\n\n*\n\n*The Mavericks installer is ~5GB in size, but it gets deleted once you’ve finished upgrading. When did you take the first reading? Perhaps you’ve lost the 5GB installer file (which replaces a lot of existing system files, so it doesn’t add 5GB to the system files), which would contribute to the difference.\n\n\n*Caches (temporary files) often get purged during an OS update. I have ~3GB of caches on my Mac, which would significantly free up space if that happened. Perhaps you had a lot of cache files to begin with?\n\n\n*Do you use Time Machine? Starting with Mountain Lion, Apple started keeping backups on your local disk, and writing them to an external drive when you plug it in. Assuming you plugged in your backup drive before you did the update1, it might just have purged all those local backup files and saved some space.\n1 You did, right?\n\nA: In relation to alexwlchan's answer:\nActually  I believe the difference between what Finder reports compared to df is that Finder as of Moutain Lion (or even Lion?) reports disk space in multiples of 1000 (i.e 1kB is 1000B, as opposed to 1024B). df, having its roots in UNIX, I believe still uses the power of two system. In the man for df you'll see: \n -b      Use (the default) 512-byte blocks.  This is only useful as a way\n         to override an BLOCKSIZE specification from the environment.\n\n -g      Use 1073741824-byte (1-Gbyte) blocks rather than the default.\n         Note that this overrides the BLOCKSIZE specification from the\n         environment.\n\n -H      \"Human-readable\" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,\n         Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the\n         number of digits to three or less using base 10 for sizes.\n\n -h      \"Human-readable\" output.  Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,\n         Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the\n         number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.\n\n -k      Use 1024-byte (1-Kbyte) blocks, rather than the default.  Note\n         that this overrides the BLOCKSIZE specification from the environ-\n         ment.\n\n -m      Use 1048576-byte (1-Mbyte) blocks rather than the default.  Note\n         that this overrides the BLOCKSIZE specification from the environ-\n         ment.\n\ntherefore, if you run df -H you might see similar numbers to what Finder reports, but normally (i.e. when df is invoked with no options, or as df -b, df -k, df -m, df -g or df -h) you'll see number based on power of 2. \nIn relation to the original question - I've also noticed around 13GB more disk space. I think this may mean that Mavericks comes with even less bloat, or maybe that more stuff is compressed on the disk compared to ML? \n", "Q: Apps will not open, post OS X Mavericks update I recently upgraded my 2012 Retina MacBook Pro to OS X 10.9 Mavericks and shortly afterwards I updated the iWork apps to their latest version.\nAfter they were all downloaded and installed, I noticed that in my /Applications folder there were, in addition to the newly updated iWork apps, the old iWork '09 apps in a separate folder. I had just assumed that this was just in case you still wanted access to the old iWork apps and so I deleted them.\nFor the first few hours, the new iWork apps were still working as expected. But, after deleting the old iWork '09 apps, I noticed that I could no longer open the Mac App Store. The icon in my dock just bounces once and then settles, unlike other apps which will bounce a couple of times and start.\n\n\n*\n\n*I did some digging online but none of the results were recent enough for OS X Mavericks.\n\n*Many forum posts say to delete com.apple.appstore.plist as well as many other files but I can't seem to find any of these files anywhere on my hard drive.\n\n*I have contacted Apple but they want £35/$57 just to handle my support request.\n\n*The next morning, I noticed that the error that had caused the MAS to not open had extended to the iWork apps, as well as many other Apple apps including Calendar, Terminal and Photo Booth.\n\n\nWhat I would like to know is how easily could this be fixed?

I often use ⌘ Cmd-Tab with my right hand on the mouse. If the cursor happens to be within overlay, then any accidental mouse movement causes OS X to think that I want to switch to whichever window icon the cursor lands on.\nMeanwhile, I am used to Windows' behavior, where the mouse has no effect on Alt-Tab.  I don't want to think, pause, check anything, or correct anything when I use ⌘ Cmd-Tab; I press the combo and intend to instantly switch to the previous app.  The mouse simply interferes with this.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to turn off this \"feature\"?\n\nA: You can prevent mouse interaction with Keyboard Maestro's app switcher:\n\nDemo:\n\nAlternatively, you can lock the mouse position whilst the ⌘ key is still held down:\n\nHowever, this doesn't appear to be possible without third party tools. You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this on the following page:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n\nA: defining the Problem\nWhat you're talking about is a kind of focus stealing. In OS X it happens in many instances, but always either by how you describe with the pointer stealing focus, an application event stealing focus, or a System event stealing focus. This problem has vexed OS X users for years, and is at odds with the older X windows users that prefer that Focus Follows Mouse. The result of this conflict is that it is far easier to find settings or third-party software that gives Focus Follows Mouse functionality than it is to find settings or software that prevent the pointer or applications from stealing focus.\nOthers feeling your pain have posted here, here, here, here, a massive thread here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here, and the list goes on and on and on... and there is hardly a definitive solution.\nPersonally, I have nearly given my machine the ability to fly when experiencing the focus stealing issue in this way: I am prompted for an administrative password, and right then, someone sends a chat message to me, the chat window steals focus, and inadvertantly and unintentionally, I enter my password in the chat window and hit return, sending my admin password to them. Compared to this, I'm afraid, your complaint pales, and I think you can see why.\nIn general, focus is determined on a per application basis, and some applications, such as Terminal and X11, which by default do not have Focus Follows Mouse enabled, have hooks to achieve that functionality using the defaults command. These were the inspiration for my suggestions involving the defaults command below. The Application Switcher is actually a part of the Dock.app, and it, apparently does not have this functionality built-in (thank you grgarside for testing).\nI'm doing my best to research this, and I believe I have some viable solutions for you.\n\nZooom/2\nZooom/2 will allow you to set a delay to the focus-follows-mouse functionality of the pointer where ever it does this. This will have the effect of giving you the functionality you're seeking, preventing the pointer from stealing focus with the Application Switcher. Its $19.95 but there is a Free Trial <-- download link\n\nAlternatives\nUse a second display? Then move Application Switcher there\nAs detailed here. If you work with two displays, presumably, your pointer is usually going to be on your primary display. Move the Application Switcher to your secondary display, and your pointer won't interact with it.\nMake your Mouse Pointer more visable\nMouseposé from Boinx Software ($4.99 on the Mac App Store) has the ability to change the color of your cursor, making it more visible, thus reducing the chance that you won't notice it is hovering over your Application Switcher. Also, like Zooom/2 mentioned above, it gives the functionality of introducing a delay before implementing Focus Follows Mouse functionality, mitigating the problem of focus stealing.\nIf you make your pointer larger, there is less of a chance you won't notice that its hovering over the Application Switcher. You can give this a try by adjusting the  System Preferences/Accessability Control Panel/Display/Cursor Size Slider :\n\n\nMondoMouse\nAtomic Bird's MondoMouse may be able to\nVirtual Desktop Pro\nCodetek's Virtual Desktop Pro might do it (for $40), is well regarded by users if not by Apple.\nnote: these two apps are really for adding the Focus Follows Mouse functionality to the System, which is the opposite of your requst to prevent the pointer from focus stealing with Application Switcher. Also note that neither of these two applications are actively still developed, and Atomic Bird software is free.\n\nExperiment with the defaults command\nThe way people find those secret hidden defaults settings is, by and large, by experimenting and trial and error. You're not going to hurt anything, or do something that can't be undone by doing so.\nFire up ye olde Terminal.app and give this a try:\n defaults write com.apple.dock FocusFollowsMouse -string false; killall Dock\n\n\nThe Application Switcher (or ⌘ Cmd-Tab ;-) is actually part of Dock.app. I'm not sure what this will do with the behavior of Dock-proper because I can't test it right now (building stuff, so I can't log out right now). I would wager a guess that it doesn't change anything with the Dock-proper, because that is already the behavior with the Dock (you have to click on something in the Dock, or click and hold, already - though it might break Dock-proper mouse-over info, which just tells you the app name).\nWhat this should do is exactly what you want, cause the mouse pointer to ignore the Application Switcher unless you click the mouse button.\nYou can reverse this behavior by changing false to true in the above command.\n\ngrgarside? Thanks for volunteering how about:\n  defaults write com.apple.dock FocusFollowsMouse -string NO; killall Dock\n\nor\n  defaults write com.apple.dock wm_ffm -bool false; killall Dock\n\nor\n  defaults write com.apple.mouse LSUIElement -string 1; sudo killall -HUP WindowServer  #warning, this killall cmd will quit all apps and log you out\n\nnote: anything changed with these commands can be removed by deleting the offending .plist file in ~/Library\n\nInteresting\nIf any are wondering why Focus Follows Mouse is not (usually) the default behavior of the pointer in OS X:\n\nFocus-follows-mouse is not a particularly suitable input method for OS X because its menu bar was designed to be at the top of the screen. When you move the mouse out of your application window to get to the menus, if it crosses any other application's windows on the way, the menu changes.\n-scottishwildcat@stackoverflow\n\n", "Q: Itunes File Conversion So I bought bourne legacy a while ago, and now I am trying to put it on my 4th gen iPod.

Once the file has finished downloading, check your Applications folder for the \"Install OS X Mavericks\" icon. Copy this installer to your other computers before going through the install process. The installer will delete itself after the install is finished.\n\nI recommend distributing the file between computers via AirDrop (if all your computers support it) or via File Sharing (from the Sharing pane of System Preferences).\nNote: Running the update from /Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app will DELETE the installer upon completion!

Something crazy is going on with Time Machine. I upgraded to Mavericks yesterday with no issues. After performing a final backup on Mountain Lion, I disconnected my backup drive out of an abundance of caution, just in case I wanted to use it to roll back to 10.8. I plugged it back in today and let it do its thing, and got an out of space warning. I wasn't too worried about this, since I had been getting these previously (in the past, TM didn't do the best job estimating the space required and removing old backups).\nUpon investigation, I discovered that only the most recent backup (from before the upgrade) was available. I double checked this in Finder and Terminal to confirm, and it appears correct. The Time Machine preferences showed the last backup as October 6, which seemed a bit more reasonable, but I saw no evidence of those files actually existing. The only sure thing I could determine was that something was taking up a lot of my backup volume — out of a ~750 GB volume, only 50 GB was free (Time Machine is estimating 154 GB needed, although only ~140 GB are used on my boot drive).\nAfter further digging, I discovered what was taking up all the space. The hidden .RecoverySets folder, within the Backups.backupdb folder on my Time Machine volume. In it are more than 1,200 sequentially numbered folders, each with a com.apple.recovery.boot subfolder, containing a 419 MB BaseSystem.dmg file. Based on the md5 hashes, these dmg files are all identical, and in total add up to nearly 600 GB (or, the vast majority of the space on my Time Machine volume).\ntl;dr\n\n\n*\n\n*Missing Time Machine backups after 10.9 upgrade.

(I'm thinking yes.)\n\n*What are the folders within the .RecoverySets folder, why have they been gobbling up space, and what can I do to prevent it in the future?\n\n*What do you suggest I do now for Time Machine backups? I'm leaning towards scrapping it altogether and starting fresh, but I am concerned about running into this issue again.\n\n\nI'm not terribly concerned about the data loss at the moment — I have two other separate backups — but I do want to ensure the integrity of my backups in the future. Any info you can provide would be appreciated.\n\nA: Okay, so I can't fully answer this issue but I'll share what I've found out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes. Unfortunately Time Machine has deleted these, so anything unique that was in the past backups is gone for good.\n\n*The contents of .RecoverySets are copies of your Recovery HD. Ordinarily Time Machine shouldn't have more than one of these but, like you, I found the folder contained nearly a thousand identical sets. My best guess is that there is something wrong with my recovery partition that is causing Time Machine to think it has been changed, but that doesn't explain why Time Machine is creating so many copies without discarding any. I've filed a bug report with Apple, and I suggest anyone who encounters the same error does the same.\n\n*You can workaround this issue with a bit of light Terminal work:\n\n*\n\n*First type cd /Volumes/{Time Machine Backup}/Backups.backupdb, replacing the part in brackets with the name of your backup volume before hitting return.\n\n*Next type sudo rm -fr .RecoverySets and hit return, you'll be asked for your password so that the command can delete your existing recovery sets.\n\n*Now run a Time Machine backup as normal using the menubar menu or by entering tmutil startbackup in Terminal and hitting return again. Wait till the backup is finished, as this will recreate your .RecoverySets folder. \n\n*Now type sudo chflags simmutable .RecoverySets and hit return, entering your password again if prompted. This will lock the folder (though it may not show this in the Finder), preventing Time Machine from creating any duplicate recovery sets in future.\n\n\n\nThe above workaround has a few caveats; firstly you won't gain any new recovery sets, but that's unlikely to be an issue, but if you're worried your set may be outdated you can unlock the folder using sudo chflags nosimmutable .RecoverySets (after cd'ing to your backup volume), delete your recovery sets, run a Time Machine backup, then re-lock it again.\nYou may also notice errors in your console to the effect of \"Could not backup OS X Recovery to…\", but that's to be expected as you locked the target folder, it just means this workaround is doing the trick, so you can safely ignore these.\nOne further note; after deleting your .RecoverySets folder, you may not immediately see any extra free space in the Finder. The easiest way to do so is to open /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app, unmount your backup volume and then mount it again, and you should see the correct free-space value, or you can just ignore it, as the free space should be there. In my case I freed up a massive 750gb by deleting my recovery sets folder, as I had over a thousand completely identical copies of my recovery partition in there (no wonder I only had 483kb of free space left!).\nYou may also want to investigate methods of repairing your recovery partition, but I'm not certain of the best way to do this; it couldn't hurt to at least try Disk Utility's first aid repair command.\n\nA: Your TM backup disk should be at least the 3x size of the disk you want to backup.\nAnd make more than one TM Backup on different external drives !!!\n", "Q: Is there software that implements John Siracusa's Spatial Finder concept? Grumbling about how Apple wrecked the Finder when switching to OS X has been going on since OS X was first released.\nIt's been ten years since John Siracusa outlined exactly how the Finder ought to behave.\nWith Mavericks, Apple stepped even farther from this Spatial Finder model, where it's apparently not even possible to have a double click/⌘↓ open a new window by default (it works in windows without toolbars, but the newly opened window will, by default, have a toolbar…).\nMy question is this: is there a third-party Finder replacement that behaves in the spatial way that Siracusa's ten-year-old manifesto calls for?\nNote that it is possible to quit the program that Apple calls Finder.app.\nIs there some other program I could launch in its place that would give me the behavior he describes, most notably the binding of one folder to one window that retains its state with regard to position, size, color, etc.?\n\nA: This isn't a direct implementation of Siracusa's vision. It is, however, a Finder alternative that looks distinctly spatial in orientation, an the opposite of the file browser direction most other Finder alternatives (and the Finder itself) seem to be going:\nRaskin for Mac seems to be the very spirit of the spatial Finder that Siracusa has been calling for. I just downloaded the free trial and am exploring it, but this might be exactly what I've been looking for.\n\nA: I don't see Siracusa's manifesto as a specification for an application - though it could be turned into one.  Rather I see it as a collection of related concepts which could lead to a more intuitive use of our Macs. Some technologies and applications which have been implemented in the 10 years since the article was written include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Metadata.  Tags (in the form of OpenMeta tags) have been around for some years and have now been incorporated by Apple into OS X.  The most capable application using tags is arguably Leap.\n\n*Saved Searches: These have been part of Finder for a while along with the ability to search on metadata.  When combined with tags (and other metadata) these provide new and powerful views of files.\n\n*Quick Look and Cover Flow: Again part of the existing Finder these provide a visual view of files which is part of Siracusa's concepts.  I must admit I seldom use Cover Flow, but Quick Look is an essential part of my use of Finder.\n\n*DesktopShelves: The shelf concept has been turned into an application.  One of its uses is a temporary location (a shelf on the desktop) when moving files around.  I also like to keep Saved Searches on a shelf (rather than the Finder Sidebar).\nSo rather than a single application implementing all of Siracusa's ideas, we can see that there are tools and technologies which have incorporated some of his key ideas.\n", "Q: How to create a record at the runtime in applescript?

I've updated to ARD 3.7 and I can longer copy files. Is this no longer supported or is there some setting I need to change? I've looked and tried many things with no luck. How can I drag n drop files from my local Mac to the Remotes?\n\nA: I can confirm that the file copy still works on the newer versions including ARD 3.7.1 so it's something you'll need to use logs to troubleshoot. \nYou may have to use the copy tool to try copying the file and look over the logs to determine what has changed between your remote computers and the controlling remote desktop computer.\nThat interface has better error messages and reporting and has helped me figure out what firewall settings were preventing me from using ARD in the past. Feel free to post your log if you can't make sense of the details it lists. \n\nA: At the client, try: \n\n\n*\n\n*disable remote management\n\n*enable screen sharing\n\n*enable remote management\n\n\n– and a restart of the Mac. \nAlso, you could try the kickstart routine. \n", "Q: Insanely high kernel RAM usage (over 9GB) in Mavericks I upgraded to Mavericks yesterday, and everything seemed to go fine, but today I noticed that my computer was becoming a bit slow. I checked Activity Monitor, and CPU / disk were at normal levels so I checked memory use, only to find this:\n\nThe kernel is taking over 5 GB of memory? Surely this is not normal? The machine has 16 GB of RAM. Any ideas on what would cause this and/or how to debug?\nUpdate: it's now at 9 GB.\n\n\nA: A reboot seems to clear my system that experiences similar RAM allocation for the kernel, but it will climb up again over time. I have chatted with Apple support and they suggested an SMC reset, which I did along with a PRAM reset and so far, it seems to be under control. It's hovered just under 1GB as I've been working, and watched it dip down a couple of times when some apps were idle. \nLong term, resetting SMC & PRAM didn't affect the memory allocation and I've tracked the insane memory usage to the \"installd\" process. \nOpen Activity Monitor and FORCE QUIT that process and watch the kernel usage drop down to normal levels. Unfortunately, you have to do this after every startup as it appears to be leaking memory on builds lower than 10.9.1 and 13B42.\n\nA: Fontbook was the cause for me, running at 3.9GB and kernel_task at 9GB. Force quitting fontbook caused the kernel_task to drop to 1.12GB and give my fan a break.\n", "Q: Install Mavericks on new drive? Does Mavericks allow an install to a different drive than the current startup drive? \nI am running Mountain Lion on a 2008 Pro Desktop and would like to try Mavericks without losing the old OS. I'd first like to see what apps run fine vs which ones I'd need to update. And also see the performance before fully committing. \n\nA: Yes, you can. Download and run the installer from the app store, click continue and agree to the license. In the screen asking for where to install, click the show all button to show drives other than your startup drive. You can select either an empty drive or one with older versions of OS X installed.\nSince you are very likely to install OS X Mavericks again, you can make a copy of the installer to avoid having to download it again. Make a copy of the Mavericks Installer app in your Application folder before the installation begins, since the app will be deleted after the installation. You can use it to install OS X Mavericks on another drive or Mac.

I am trying to do a polar plot, or radar chart as excel calls them, for a report. I don't have excel, only Numbers, is there a way to do that type of plot with Numbers? I can't seem to find a way. The closest thing to a polar plot that I was able to create was a point cluster with the data transformed from polar to cartesian coordinates, but this doesn't center the axis at 0,0.\n\nA: An app called Radars on the Apple App Store generates polar plots for you to import to your Numbers documents. That's what it says in the description, I however have not tried it yet.\n", "Q: Should I buy all new memory or combine with old? I tried googling for answers on this, but couldn't actually find any decent information. I have a mid 2010 Macbook Pro, which according to Apple supports up to 8GB of ram. I already have a single 4GB stick installed, and from what Google tells me about the identifiers from System Information, it's a Corsair (I haven't actually opened the machine to try and verify.)\nI need more memory, as I'm constantly bumping up against the limit and the system starts swapping instead. Now my question is, what configuration will yield me the best performance? Two 4GB sticks? One 8GB? If I go for a configuration with two 4GB sticks, is it better to get two new ones or just add a single 4GB (presumably same make and model) to the one I already have?\n\nA: The 8GB would be via two 4GB modules.\nAs far as replacing vs adding, the DIMM slots are dual channel so you'll just want to make sure they match. Look again in System Information at the speed column. It will likely say \"1066 MHz\". In that case, when shopping around, just make sure you're looking for a 1066MHz DDR3 4GB 204-Pin module. It doesn't have to be the same brand.\n\nA: As Apple states in the link you mentioned:\n\nFor best performance, fill both memory slots, installing an equal memory module in each slot.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Get one more 4 GB memory stick and install it.\n\n*There is no need to throw your existing one and get two of the same kind, since memory chips are rigorously tested for compatibility, especially if you buy from a seller like OWC - MacBookPro memory or DataMem - MacBook Pro memory.\n\n*The memory sellers would also provide you with the right memory for your system.\n\n", "Q: Can't delete one event from series in calendar.app from a google calendar I have a series of events in a Google calendar that's connected to Calendar.app. When I try to delete one event (I confirm in the prompt that I want to delete the one event) in the series it reappears immediately. \nHow can I remove just one instance without it reincarnating? \n\nA: Did you create the account using CalDAV, as Google recommends? It could of course be a bug in Calendar.app, but I would make sure that the recommended settings are used. See here:\nhttps://support.google.com/calendar/answer/99358?hl=en\nIndeed, as rob speculated, Google doesn't provide Exchange ActiveSync any more for new devices:\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/2716936?hl=en\nHowever, that doesn't seem to be the reason for the problem in question. For me nothing was synced an a new iPhone with an Exchange type Google account, and thus, there were no events to be deleted either. I switched to using CalDAV, which works fine.\n", "Q: Mail.app extremely slow on OS X 10.9 Mavericks Since I updated to Mavericks two days ago on my late 2008 13-inch MacBook (first unibody aluminium), I have huge difficulties using Mail. When Mail is running, everything slows down extremely (I constantly see beach balls and spend most of the time waiting for any of my inputs showing an effect, not just in Mail but with everything). The activity monitor shows that \"Mail\" and \"com.apple.internetaccounts\" both have 90%+ under \"% CPU\", and most of the time Mail is \"Not Responding\". The Mail application doesn't show any window during maybe the first hour after trying to open it, and once I see the main window, everything is so slow that even opening an e-mail can - if it works at all - take a loooot of time. Two or three times, I even got a complete freeze, the cursor not moving anymore, the fans (which were running constantly before) shut down; the only thing I could do was holding the power button for five seconds.\nI have no firewall app running and have looked into my log file which is available here: http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=55665966095442984994\nWhen I force quit Mail and com.apple.internetaccounts, things run smoothly, so the problem seems to be limited to the Mail application. What might I be able to do to avoid having to force quit Mail and have it respond more smoothly and not hang up?\n\nA: Thanks for uploading the Logfile. There are several entries which could describe the Problems, f.e.:\n25/10/13 4:29:58.408 pm WindowServer[125]   disable_update_timeout: UI updates were forcibly disabled by application \"Mail\" for over 1.00 seconds.

It should be named something like \"IMAP-you@email.address\"\n\n*move the Folder for your IMAP-Account somewhere else, f.e. to the Desktop\n\n*start Mail again. It should be syncing the Mails from your IMAP-Account to your Computer in a normal fashion.\n\n\nIf that does not help you could try the second approach: deleting the IMAP-Account and recreating it. \nTry that and post your results please.\n\nA: If you reinstated your mail from an older Mountain Lion (or previous) installation, you  might have moved quite a lot of crud, which is incompatible with Mavericks.\nI once had a similar problem (What is com.apple.mail.plist and why was it slowing Mail down?), which I resolved removing a couple of plists.  In general, you might want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*open console\n\n*run Mail.app\n\n\nand see what console says about Mail.app.  That would be my first port of call.\n\nA: What kind of email accounts is your copy of Mail checking? Are any of them Google GMail accounts? There is a well-documented situation whereby Apple Mail under Mavericks will automatically start downloading all your gigabytes of Google Gmail archives all over again, leaving you with duplicates of everything.\nWhat kind of network activity do you see while Mail is open? If there are massive downloads happening, this could be the culprit.\nMail in Mavericks Changes the GMail Equation, TidBITS, 22 October 2013\n", "Q: How to select paragraphs with similar style in Pages 5? Pages '09 had the paragraph styles drawer with a list of all styles. Each style had the following context menu:\n\nOn the new Pages 5, this is how that context menu looks however.\n\nI can't seem to find where the option to \"Select all uses of...\" went. Anyone have a clue on how to select all uses of a given paragraph style? \n\nA: As far as I know, there is no “Select All Uses of …” command in Pages 5.\nYou don’t need that command to edit the format of all a style’s uses, though. When you change a paragraph's style, like changing some “Body”-styled paragraph’s font, an “Update” button will appear beside the style name in the format sidebar, and the style name will append a * to indicate that it was modified. Click the button and all paragraphs using that style will update.\n\n\nA: I can’t find that command either.\nHowever, if the reason you want it is to temporarily highlight all the places a style is used, so you can browse through example usages of the style, there is an alternative. You can modify the style to add that highlighting, then Undo after you’re done viewing.\nTemporarily adding a background color\nIn most cases, you will want to make the style usages more visible without affecting their position on the page. The best way to do this is to give them a background color.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select one usage of the style.

Now they will all be highlighted:\n\n\n*When you’re done viewing the usages of the style, Undo from the Edit menu (⌘Z) until your changes are gone.\n\n\nChanging the background color instead of the text color is helpful in that it even highlights styled paragraphs with no text:\n\n", "Q: Change The Default Font & Size In Notes How can I change the default font size in Notes' DefaultFonts.plist on a Mac version 10.9\nWhat I have tried:\n\n*\n\n*Go to /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/\n\n*Add myself to read & write permissions.\n\n*But when I open DefaultFonts.plist it stays locked.\n\nHow can I put this in?\n<dict>\n<key>FontName</key>\n<string>Garamond</string>\n<key>Size</key>\n<integer>124</integer>\n</dict>\n\n\nA: If you are editing the file with an application like TextEdit or Xcode, you also need write permission to the folder the file is in (or en.lproj).\nYou can also use another editor like nano:\nsudo nano /Applications/Notes.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/DefaultFonts.plist\n\n", "Q: How to assign hotkeys to paragraph styles in Pages 5?

Is anyone aware of a way to do this in the new Pages 5? \n\nA: The feature was lost in the initial release of Pages 5, but was brought back in in iWork 5.2.\nYou can choose the shortcuts F1 through F8, and it appears to be a per-document setting. I suspect the reason it has to be per-document is that the styles themselves are part of the document. You may also be able to apply shortcuts to a template, so that new documents based on it get the shortcuts, if you use the same templates/styles a lot.\nThe UI in Pages 5.2.2:\n\nI'm not entirely sure why, but Apple have done similar things in a few of their applications, with major updates (e.g. 4.x to 5.x) seeing a bunch of features disappear with a simplified UI, and then some of the lost features come back in minor subsequent updates.\n", "Q: Lotsawater screensaver Mavericks problem Prior to updating to Mavericks I used LotsaWater screensaver.

That would allow you to provide them restricted access to the system while deleting all their files on logout automatically.\nTo enable a guest user:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Click the lock icon to unlock it if necessary and type an administrator name and password\n\n*Select the Guest User in the list of accounts from the left sidebar\n\n*Check the option Allow guests to log in to this computer\n\n*You can also setup restrictions through Parental Controls by checking the option Enable parental controls and then clicking on Open Parental Controls...\nSee:\nUsing the Guest Account in OS X\nOS X Mountain Lion: Set up guest users\nOS X Lion: Set up a guest account \n\nA: You could use a shell script like this instead:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrm -r ~/Desktop/*\n\nOr if you want to move the files to trash:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\ntell app \"Finder\" to move items of desktop to trash\n\nThen run:\nchmod +x /path/to/script\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /path/to/script\n\nLogout hooks were deprecated in 10.4, but I haven't found any way to reliably run a program at logout using launchd.\nThe logout hook can only be an executable script and not a shell command.\nThe defaults command modifies /var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist. Run sudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook to delete the LogoutHook key.\n\nA: Your basic requirement is to clear files between login sessions. If you cannot use Guest Accounts, since you would be doing some custom setup for the user accounts anyway, a simple solution that is easy to manage is to use a Startup Item script that runs on login instead of a logout hook (which is deprecated and may not remain a long term solution).\nWhenever another user logs in, the files created by the previous user on the desktop would be cleared.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a script with the name cleardesktop.command (the .command extension makes it run in Terminal by default) containing the line\nrm -rf ~/Desktop/*\n\n\n*Make it executable by using the command\nchmod +x cleardesktop.command\n\n\n*Add it to the user account's Startup Items list\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*select the user account and go to Login Items\n\n*click the (+) below the list on the right.\n\n*select the cleardesktop.command script and click Add\n\n*check the Hide checkbox next to it so that the Terminal window does not show up on login.\n\n\n*Additionally, you can prevent users from removing this Startup Item with the following steps\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences > Parental Controls\n\n*then to the Apps tab\n\n*checking the Limit Applications checkbox\n\n*in the Allowed Apps: list, uncheck System Preferences - Applications\nIf you wish to make this solution a bit more robust, you can place the cleardesktop.command file in /usr/bin/ and set restricted permissions with chmod 755 cleardesktop.command from the administrator account.\n", "Q: OS X Mavericks upgrade - disk/partition failure I'm on OS X Lion on my Mac, I have downloaded OS X Mavericks and executed the upgrade.\nMy Mac restarted and executed the upgrade process, but after a few minutes the update stopped because my OS disk partition \"My Macintosh HD\" is corrupted. So I tried to check and fix the disk using Disk Utility but with no luck.\nCan I stop the upgrade process and execute my current OS X Lion again, then copy my files, and make a clean new setup? I can't find any way to do that.\n\nA: I had this and I found that I had to have Disk Utility repair both the disk (top level in the tree) and the partition (second level).\n\nA: I tried some solutions, but I can't find any secure way to stop the update setup without delete the Mac partition.\nThe only working solution was to make a clean install.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*I saved much data possible using a bootcamp Win 7 working partition\n\n*then I have restored my last, but old, version (1 years ago!!) on my machine from Time Machine\n\n*from the restoed machine I have downloaded Mavericks, and make a bootable USB setup key\n\n*last I reset the Mac partition and start the setup for a clean install\n\n\nNow it's working fine, and fortunately, I haven't lost anything.\n", "Q: Download files and keep archive Is there a way to keep the archive of a downloaded file/folder? Currently, the archive is moved directly to the Trash can as soon as the content is expanded.\nThanks\nUpdate: screenshot following MK's instructions:\n\n\nA: You have to change the preferences for Archive Utility, which is the default unarchiver used by the browser.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and go to /System/Library/CoreServices/ (from the Go > Go to Folder... menu option or pressing Shift+Cmd+G)\n\n*Open Archive Utility.app from that location\n\n*Go to Archive Utility > Preferences (or press Cmd+,)\n\n*In the After expanding: dropdown, choose leave archive alone (you would currently have this set to \"move archive to Trash\")\n\n*Quit Archive Utility.app\n", "Q: Activity Monitor in Mavericks \"Show Memory Usage\" dock icon gone? I just purchased a new MacBook Pro with Mavericks installed and noticed that Activity Monitor doesn't have the \"Show Memory Usage\" dock icon option anymore.  I really liked this option since I used it to prevent disk swapping by closing applications when I had too many open.  What gives?\n\n\nA: Another option is iStat Menus which gives a lot of really useful information displayed in a very user friendly way and is not expensive.\nhttp://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\nThey have recently updated it for Mavericks.\n\nA: An alternative is Stats (by Exelban), a free and open source utility that can display memory, cpu, network, etc on the menu bar.\nInstall with brew install --cask stats or go to https://github.com/exelban/stats\nTip: You can set the RAM color to be Based on Memory Pressure, which is more useful than Memory Used.\n\nA: It seems that this feature – since Apple has changed the way how they display memory usage – isn't a option anymore:\n\nThis is no longer an option, especially since Mavericks has new memory management routines (ie, memory compression) that make the charting of memory usage less straightforward. Apple has switched to a new \"Memory Pressure\" approach to viewing memory usage, which is available in the Memory section of Activity Monitor, but so far has not been added as a Dock icon option. Hopefully Apple will do so, as this would perhaps be one of the more useful Dock icon options.\n\nI've got that from here one would hope that at some point we could graph memory pressure in the dock using Apple's Activity monitor as opposed to needing to open the whole tool with a window that shows many other items.\n\nA: You actually don't need to that anymore, because XNU now does that automatically - by utilizing memory pressure notifications, it triggers a special kernel thread called MemoryStatus which finds processes that can be exited cleanly - and automatically closes them (well, kills them) for you. This alleviates the need for you to keep a close watch on RAM utilization, and likely accounts for the design decision to remove that option.\n", "Q: Mac username & password for proxy settings keep resetting by itself I've a MacBook Pro Retina Display.\nThe username & password for the proxy settings for HTTPS keeps resetting by itself every few mins.\nIf I enable \"Proxy server requires password\" below & put in my username-password, after 2 or 3 mins, it'll automatically reset and the text fields becomes inactive.\n\nAs a result, the pop-up asking for username-password keeps coming back every few mins (which is very annoying).\nHowever, this doesn't happen for the HTTP one.\nHow do I fix it?\n\n\nA: This worked for me. Here's what I did:\n\nThe solution is to ensure that you have working proxy settings saved in the system keychain, not just your personal login keychain.\nSo when you next get one of these dialogs:\n\n*\n\n*Note the server name that is requesting authentication, the port (usually 8080) and if it is an http or https request. Typically it will be something in the form https://someproxyserver.someorganization.com:8080\n\n\n*See if you already have an entry for that server in your login keychain. If not, make one manually, (being sure to enter the whole thing as per the example above with the :8080 at the end). Typically that there needs to be two separate keychain entries per proxy server, one for http and a second for https, though syncdefaultsd only uses https.\n\n\n*Once you have login keychain entries for the proxy server, double-click them and ensure that under Access all applications are allowed, and that your user name is saved.\n\n\n*Now for the fun bit. Option-drag and drop these entries into your system keychain. Click on the system keychain, and confirm that they are there, and that all the settings are exactly right.\nFor good measure, do a shift-restart then a normal restart.\nYou should now get no more annoying dialogs for that particular proxy server. If your proxy server has more than one alias, or if you have several, then whenever you get a new unidentified dialog, repeat the above.\n\nSource: Apple Support Discussions thread\n\nA: I just went through a similar thing with VPN configurations. I have about 10 configs and it seemed like half couldn't retain the password and I would be prompted for it.\nMy solution was to open Keychain Access, and search for the config in question and delete it's keychain entry. Then re-enter the password in the Network preference pane and hit \"apply\". That created a new keychain entry and I no longer got prompted for the password.\n", "Q: How can I automatically focus Finder windows after CMD-TAB to one in a different space? CMD-TAB to Finder in a different space and the focus will always bet set to the Desktop. As a result, keyboard interaction is impossible until the Finder window is focused with CMD-` (backtick) or clicked in.\nIf Finder is fullscreen (OSX 10.9+), the window looks focused but isn't. All keyboard interaction is sent to the Desktop: SPACE will quicklook over the fullscreen Finder window whatever file/folder is highlighted, even though you can't see them.\nThis was in 10.8 at least. It's really frustrating having to hit an extra keyboard toggle just so I can keep using the keyboard on the window that was meant to be focused.\n\nA: The same thing happens to me in 10.8.\nIf you hold option before releasing command in the application switcher, the Finder window (and not the window of the desktop) gets focus.\nHolding option makes the application switcher \"reopen\" the application, so that if for example the application has no default windows (like a file browser window in Finder), a default window is reopened.\nYou could also consider using other methods than command-tab to focus Finder, like assign a keyboard shortcut for focusing Finder or use Alfred.\n", "Q: Restore ebooks (PDF) from iTunes backup? Upon opening iBooks.app on my clean Mavericks install, I noticed that all my ebooks from other sources than the iBooks Store were missing. Of course, they're not saved in iCloud. So I wanted to restore them from the Music/iTunes Media/Books folder of my Time Machine backup.\nOn my backup disk, there was no Music folder.. I forgot I had excluded it from the backup. I wanted to save space, and I'm using iTunes Match anyway, but I hadn't thought about the books.\nAll the books and PDFs were still on my iOS devices, which started syncing with iTunes immediately and deleted all books in the process instead of transferring them to my Mac.\nFinally I had a look at the MobileSync folder on the backup disk. The backup seems to be some kind of database. I used grep  to search for a few unique terms from my books in the binaries, and they are indeed in there, somewhere.\nI've tried to copy the folder to my Mac so I can look at the backup with iExplorer, but it doesn't show any books. Which app can I use to simply extract the books from the backups?\n\nA: There is an application called iPhone Backup Extractor that will help you extract data from an iPhone backup. it will convert the files you see in the backup with randomly generated names to things you will recognise.\nWhen you run the application and identify the backup you want it to use it'll give you a list of all the application data contained within the backup. BTW you'll need to move the backup folder so its sitting at /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/LONG_GIBBERISH_STRING for iPhone Backup Extractor to find it.\nI'm not 100% certain where Apple stores books/documents that haven't been purchased but my guess would be within either \"com.apple.iBooks\" or \"iOS Files\".\n", "Q: How to type telnet escape character in OS X terminal Escape character is '^]'.\n\nHow does one type that?

Suddenly the arrangement is flipped (i.e. it's now below my Mac rather than above it), and the resolution is switched to 800x600 rather than the normal 1680x1050.\nWhen I then pull the plug and plug it back in (while my Mac and its screen are wide awake), it finds its old configs again and fixes the resolution and arrangement.\nHas anyone experienced anything similar, or is there a fix available? Or should I just consider this an unresolved bug, report it to Apple and hope for the best?\n\nA: I have almost the same experience - after sleep my second display isn't available at all. Thanks for the tip of unplug - replug the display (firewire) - that solved the problem - but I will hate to do it all the time. My setup: iMac 27\" 2011 and Lacie 526 display.\n\nA: The fix I've adopted is to visit the Display section of the System Preferences. Hold the Option key to reveal the Detect Displays button. Click it.\nThe connector on my laptop has ended up a bit loose after years of unplugging and reinserting. Using System Preferences is probably kinder on it, until some kind of fix is forthcoming.\n(There used to be a menu bar icon for displays, which included the Detect Displays option - but now that I have need of it, it appears to have been removed. Apple knows best, I suppose, and who am I to argue. Perhaps I am just plugging it in wrong.)\n\nA: I would have most of my windows halfway or mostly offscreen.\nUnplugging and replugging before I wake seems to solve this problem also.\n", "Q: How to fast set hot corners in Mavericks?

The solution is this: When you're choosing a Hot Corner setting from one of the drop-down menus, hold down your preferred modifier key or keys. You'll see the options change from, say, Mission Control to Option Mission Control\" instead.\nFrom then on, your corner will only work when you're also holding down the modifier key(s) you specified. Now, trips to the Apple menu won't trigger your Hot Corner shortcut—unless you're pressing your selected modifier key, too.\n", "Q: How can I add my Facebook friends in Waze?

It's nice when it works, but it's lagging a lot sometimes, especially in Chrome.\nAnyone found out a way to disable responsive scrolling and make scrolling behave like in 10.8? Either globally or per-app.\nDuring the \"Optimizing Drawing and Scrolling on OS X\" WWDC video, the Apple Engineer uses what looks like an AppleScript file to disable responsive scrolling globally, so it is possible, but I can't figure out how.\n\nA: UPDATE (7.XI.2013 after call to Apple Care):\nI needed also:\n1) resetting PRAM (after turn-off, turn-on while holding CMD+ALT+P+R up to second gong),\nhow to on your mac: https://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379\n2) resetting SMC (after turn-off, turn-on while holding SHIFT+CTRL+ALT(option) + POWER)\nhow to on your mac: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\nTHE BELOW SETTING SHOULD BE: with inertia\n\nIt is probably NOT the permanent solution, but fast and comfortable hack in comparison to system reboot.\nIt worked for me. Sorry that screenshots are in Polish. Anyway, you should manage it thanks to images/icons.\nFirst open Accessibility from System Preferences\n\nThen in Touchpad/Mouse settings, click touchpad button\n\nThen play with/without inertia. \n\n\nA: Firstly I am posting this as possible helpful info rather than a solution.\nWhich may get some one in the right direction.\n\nI found this in the What's New in OSX which goes into explaining what and how Responsive Scrolling works. \nAt the bottom there is also a note saying how to disable it per app for testing purposes.\nBut I do not see this option in my own built apps or any others.\n\nResponsive Scrolling\nResponsive scrolling is an AppKit enhancement that makes scrolling\n  smoother. This involves two significant changes to the way your app\n  draws content:\nScroll views ask their child views to draw extra content outside their\n  normal view area so that the content can be immediately made available\n  for scrolling purposes. This additional window backing is stored in\n  purgeable memory to minimize additional paging. The scrolling thread\n  attempts to redraw the view at 60 frames per second, but it backs off\n  if the app is unable to keep up. Scrolling events are processed on a\n  background thread. Most apps automatically receive this responsive\n  scrolling behavior. However, some views must explicitly opt in,\n  including layer-backed views, custom scroll view or clip view\n  subclasses that override drawRect:, NSSurface-based document views,\n  transparent document views, and document views that override the\n  lockFocus method.\nFor views in which responsive scrolling is automatically enabled, the\n  behavior change should be entirely transparent to you as a developer.\n  However, if your app exhibits any unusual behavior while scrolling,\n  please file bugs.\nNote: You can temporarily disable responsive scrolling for testing purposes by choosing File > Get Info on your app in Finder. After\n  changing the setting, you must quit and relaunch your app. For more\n  details, see AppKit Release Notes for OS X v10.9.\n\nI had a look at the appkit release notes -Responsive Scrolling  which goes into more detail.\nThere are conditions which should stop Responsive Scrolling being assigned  to an App. One of them is:\n\nThe application links on 10.7 or prior (the application must link on\n  Mountain Lion or higher to support this feature)\n\nWhich I take to mean if the App is built to also run on 10.6 then it will not have this feature added.\nChrome AFAIK will run on 10.6 upwards. But I suspect the downloader is downloading a version for you current system.\nPossibly a version built for 10.6 only would disable it in Chrome.\n\nUPDATE*\nBut as bogdansrc points out in the comments. There is no single build for 10.6\n\nI did try:\ndefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome isCompatibleWithResponsiveScrolling -bool NO\n\nBut the isCompatibleWithResponsiveScrolling is for a nsview sub class and I do not really expect it to work.

It's really slow when I switch applications, I'm using Google Chrome, Xcode 5 (I already disabled \"show live issues\"), and not many other apps: Cog (simple audio player) and f.lux and the Terminal.\nRight clicking often takes 5 sec, creating a new Finder window around 3 sec.\nI'm just asking if 4GB will really be enough since I use Xcode to compile a C++ project, or if I should get 8GB. I'm not very concerned about battery life, I'm just worried that 4GB would not be enough to be comfortable, OS X seems to use a lot of memory.\nI'm just wondering what are the best websites to buy memory that is compatible with my Mac. I've looked at macway but it seems they don't have RAM for my model. I don't think I'll buy from OWC, it seems very expensive... Corsair also seems to make RAM for Macs.\nI'm also ready to buy good performing RAM, I don't know if there are better performing RAM out there, or if a 2009 MacBook would really benefit from it.\nAny advice?\nI also tried to check my page out value, could not find it in the new activity monitor, here is the memory thing anyways.\n\n\nA: 8Gb would be best if you can afford it. I've always used crucial.com for RAM and had no problems.\nAn SSD drive would also really speed up system performance.\n\nA: I've always had good luck with Crucial's RAM. Go to their site, choose your Mac, then choose a kit.\n\nA: You should go for 8 GB of RAM.  I do development too using Xcode 5, Terminal, and have Chrome open as well.  Chrome is a memory hog itself and when I had 4 GB of RAM OSX would be swapping to disk constantly.  I upgraded to 8 GB and noticed a huge difference in performance.\n\nA: Mountian Lion uses 2GB RAM, Mavericks 4GB. Windows 7 2GB... I don't want to know what the new Yosemite is going to gobble (especially a bad move of Apple soldering RAM t logic board in new MacBooks... the idea of plug-in chips in soldered chip holders would have been a better solution if RAM cards were omitted), and avoiding it because of this issue and don't like its GUI design, which would put me off from the new features that are impressive...\nI had a late 2008 Mac which was upgraded to 8GB, but still ran Mavericks slower than Mountain Lion and had to downgrade it so it can perform better, perhaps because Mavericks was designed specially for Retina based computers, which have a higher resolution. I now have a new Macbook Pro Retina with Iris Graphics,running mavericks. and is 8GB. It is always a necessity to have a computer that has its operating system using half of the physical memory for performance. It puts less strain on on the machine, and that free RAM would help with your creativity in photoshop, video editing, music creating and more... Logic and Garageband tend to spaz out when there is no free memory.  Then if you thinking that a SSD would make virtual memory perform better, yes it would, but the downside is, continuous paging on your drive would decrease its estimated lifespan with wear and tear. Where paging is supposed to be only on occasion when your work maxes out physical RAM, not every time you use your machine. I would recommend a downgrade to Mountain Lion, until you have the plans and resources to get a new computer.\n", "Q: Mac continuously wakes up with unidentified reason I have MacBook Air 2013, Mavericks installed.\nI recognized that my mac is a little bit warm.

But in my case, the reason is Question mark (?)\nWhat should I do right now?\nIs there any way to see which factor wakes mac up?\n\nA: I had this issue with my MacBook Air Haswell and OS X 10.9. You can add a workaround for this by disabling standby/hibernation.\nOpen the terminal and type: \nsudo pmset -a standby 0\n\nThis will disable hibernation. To activate it again type:\nsudo pmset -a standby 1\n\nIf you look at the log closely, the \"sleep loop\" starts right after going into deep sleep (hibernation) after 3 hours in energy saving mode. You will lose 2-3% battery over night but still better than a sleep loop.\nIf you have Avast! Antivirus installed, I would try uninstalling it first, this fixed the issue on my Mac.\n", "Q: How do I sync my iPhone 3G to OS X 10.9? Anyone have any idea how I can sync my iPhone 3G and my Mac OS 10.9?  Seems Mavericks only uses iCloud now, so can't seem to hard sync the two.\n\nA: You should be able to sync it directly by using the usb. Is it giving you error messages? What is it saying. \nAlso, you may need to check your sync preferences on the phone settings its self. What version of iOS is installed or is it jail broken?\n\nA: Apple has disabled local sync of contacts and calendars in 10.9.  From http://support.apple.com/kb/PH12117:\n\"If you use OS X Mavericks v.10.9 or later, your contacts, calendars, and other info are updated on your computers and iOS devices via iCloud.\"\nSince iCloud is the only way to sync that info, and since the iPhone 3G cannot use iCloud, there is no way to sync that info with a 3G and a Mac running Mavericks.\nSo your only options are to roll back to an earlier version of OSX, run your own Mavericks server (may not work with 3G), use a third-party internet based syncing service, or wait for a third-party non-internet (USB) based syncing service.  See, e.g., https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5460803?start=0&tstart=0 for various posts on how to do these things.\nHope this helps.\nRon\n\nA: You can use the local sync built into iTunes 11.21 or later for syncing your contacts and calendars locally to iPhone 3G and older versions. \nSimply create a replica of your contact cards and calendars currently stored in iCloud. Open iTunes version 11 or later with your iPhone 3G connected using the USB cable. Under the \"Info\" tab will be all your contacts and calendars listed. \nI only see such a method as temporary for now until I purchase another iPhone. Too much manual maintenance is required. I can understand Apple's reasons for abolishing local sync in Mavericks since it was based on old outdated propriety code, hardly suitable for the latest devices on market today. Yet, the update to Mavericks will not stop you syncing contacts and calendars locally through iTunes (see attached screenshots).\n\n", "Q: How to fix choppy scrolling on 10.9 Mavericks? I just upgraded my mid-2012 MacBook Air to 10.9. Now whenever I scroll down a page, the effect is very choppy. The scrolling seems to stop and start very quickly. Also, sometimes the left part of the page will scroll down but the right part of the page will stay put for a fraction of a second. The net effect is very flickery and distracting. \nAny ideas on how to fix this? Slighly different case, but this guy was able to solve a very similar problem (external monitor) by opening AutoCAD (what the heck?).\nI also tried resetting the SMC as recommended here. Still no luck.\n\nA: Try System Preferences -> Energy Saver -> Automatic graphics switching -> Off\n\nA: Not a cure, but here is a temporary solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple menu at the top left corner of your screen, then go to System Preferences.\n\n*Under the personal heading click General,\n\n*Under Show scroll bars, click Always.\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: Finally figured out the scrolling issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Accessibility → Mouse & Trackpad\n\n*Go to Trackpad Options…\n\n*Set Scrolling to max speed and 'with inertia'\n\n\nA: I just performed a clean install of Mavericks and the scrolling works perfectly now. Also, the whole system works much faster now. I wish there was a less annoying solution, but this works :)\n\nA: I experience this issue occasionally. Currently I'm running El Capitan, and I have had this issue in prior OSes. Today just shutting down my MacBook completely and restarting it alleviated the problem. For now...\n\nA: I'm suspecting vmware fusion cause the problem. Because everytime I open fusion, the problem will comes out (in short or long time after fusion opened).\nAnd the funny thing is if I open vmware fusion and parallels desktop together, I don't have the scrolling problem!\n\nA: Today I'm using parallels desktop a whole day and the problem not happens yet.\nI did clean install couple of times before.\nReally I think there's a software causing this problem, because there's no answer from Apple about this annoying problem.\nHope the problem won't occur again with your fresh Maverick ;)\n", "Q: Memory Upgrade: Planning to Use Different RAM Model I'm considering upgrading to a total of 16GB RAM. Currently, I have 4GB.\nMacBook Pro: 13-inch, Late 2011\nMemory  4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3\n\nThe problem: it appears the local resellers no longer have such RAM model.

Thanks.\n\nA: As stated in Apple's technical specifications your machine officially only supports 8GB of memory total.\nThat said Other World Computing runs a massive on-site lab and has confirmed that the Late 2011 MacBook Pro can support 16GB without any stability issues. The memory does need to be PC3-10600 DDR3 1333 MHz however. You can find that memory available from Other World Computing as well as from other online retailers.\nDo keep in mind however that, since it's an unsupported configuration, Apple won't support your machine with those memory modules installed (should you ever need to take it to the Apple store).\n", "Q: Expand symlinked directory in finder Is there a way to make it so that in list view in Finder a symbolically linked directory can be expanded like a regular directory? I would just switch to column view, but I'm using TextMate 2's file browser, which appears to use Finder's list view.\nI have no issue with getting my hands dirty with the console or editing plists if need be - I used Linux for years and fiddled with a Hackintosh for a while before switching to Mac. I'll also understand if The Mighty Apple Hath Spoken. I've just found very little on the topic. (And in my case it's on Macintosh HD so unmounting and remounting is not an option.)\n\nA: One solution, as detailed here, would be to use a hardlink for the directory. It's very important that you understand the implications listed in Bob's answer as well as only use the hunlink utility (also in Bob's answer) to remove any directories created via the hlink utility.\nI certainly would not recommend this solution for anyone who isn't comfortable understanding the details laid out in Bob's answer and/or for a shared system where not every user is aware of which directories are hard links and how to properly handle them.\n\nA: The answer is no, there is not a way to get the nice little triangle to easily expand a symlink directory in the Finder's list view.\nAccording to \"Folder Aliases in Dock or List View cannot be expanded?\" on SuperUser, \"This is a known bug and is even mentioned in John Siracusa's review on Snow Leopard.\"\nThis is consistent with this Textmate Thread which discusses the issue without finding a solution.\n", "Q: Can't send mail using Mail.app since update to Mavericks One morning Mail on my Mac was working perfectly. At noon, I upgraded to Mavericks, then I could not send mails anymore!\nI could read my mails but not send them (though I changed nothing in the configuration). I get the message: \"authentication failed\"!\nMy SMTP servers (two of these university based) are ok… So either:\n\n\n*\n\n*The new version of Mail is no longer pleased with the server credentials (though I checked these)\n\n*The new version of Mail sends wrong information (password), but since these are still here I am wondering if there is some encoding fancy in the protocol that is not working anymore (yes there are accented characters in these informations!)\n\n\nWhat I can I do? Can I downgrade and load an earlier version of the Mail app?\n\nA: I have had the same problem... Spent two days then found it so simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail.app and go to your SMTP account settings;\n\n*Click on the Advanced tab and change the authentication method to password;\n\n*Input your mail as username and the password;\n\n*Voilá! Outgoing mail traffic working!\n\n\nA: I am having the identical problem on two of my mail accounts since upgrading to Mavericks this morning.  Actually, for months I had this problem intermittently on the previous operating system but it seemed to right itself. I'm guessing Apple must have tweaked something along the line. My advice would be, don't knock yourself out trying to solve it. It's almost certainly nothing you've done.  My Incoming mail arrives fine and I also find that the outgoing mail suddenly sends itself after I've almost given up the will to live!  I also have an iCloud email address which I use without problems when I'm desperate to send in a hurry.  I hope Apple will get onto this as it's completely unacceptable to have the issue again on the much awaited Mavericks.\n\nA: Just look if the SSL box is checked. If it is, just uncheck it. It will change the ports automatically.\nTry to end the session and reopen Mail.app.\n", "Q: View/search iPhone text message history How do I read and/or search the history of text messages from my iPhone? Some messages are SMS, others are iMessage, often interleaved within the same conversation. My understanding is that the phone keeps the entire history (which is why there is the \"Load Earlier Messages\" button, which is incredibly tedious to use, slows down with each additional click and offers no [obvious] way of searching).\n\nA: On iOS 7, swipe down on the homescreen to bring up the search tool. You can search for SMS/iMessages and they will be brought up as you type. For iOS 6 and others, you can go one page to the left of the homescreen to do this.\n\nA: You can search that way but when selecting the conversation you were looking for it takes you to the latest conversation , not the particular one you searched and selected.\n", "Q: How to remove dock shelf from Mavericks? I installed OS X Mavericks, and the dock shelf has returned despite the hidden option to remove it from previous OS X upgrades. I've tried all the third party dock utility applications like Docker, Dock Designer, CandyBar. All of these apps promise to remove the shelf but fail to do so.\nThere must be a way to return the dock to 2D view rather than the 3D view or to customize the dock. I'm on 5' of display and the shelf is incredibly glaring, takes up far too much screen space and really isn't needed or wanted.\nDoes anyone know of a way to remove the dock shelf leaving just the app icons floating at the bottom of the screen and their little \"on\" lights below those apps running? Please, no other suggestions like hiding the dock or placing the dock on the side. I want the shelf removed entirely.\n\nA: They removed this feature from 10.9. No one really knows why, but it is removed from the dock settings UI as well as the command line. From the linked article;\n\nAs of Mountian Lion, the Dock is rendered by the OS, instead of the OS using a set of image files like in Lion and before, so it can't be edited.\nThe 2D dock terminal trick only worked via a string item in the Dock executable. As of Mavericks, that string item has been removed.\nThe only way to edit the dock would be to patch the encrypted Dock executable, and inject software to re-render the Dock differently in memory. Not a simple task.\n\n", "Q: Hotkeys being captured in save menu in GIMP? I just installed GIMP (from the dmg on the GIMP website) on my new MacBook Pro running Mavericks. Unfortunately, when I went to go export/save an image, the keys that are hotkeys in GIMP (e.g. 1 is 100% zoom) are captured as hotkeys while typing in the name to save the file. Captured in that they both are not typed in the save name input and it messes with what is being done in the GIMP project.\nAnyone know what the cause might be or how I might fix it?\n\nA: The problem was fixed in GIMP 2.8.10, so if you're running into this problem please download a newer version.\n\nA: I am experiencing the same problem and while I haven't found a solution, I have found a better workaround: just disable all keyboard shortcuts:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Click on Edit> Preferences \n  \n*Go to the \"Interface tab\" \n  \n*Click on the \"Remove all the Keyboard shortcut\". \n  \n\n\nA: It is a known bug with Mavericks and Gimp, but there is no solution yet. For me, Gimp opened once on Mavericks and refuses to do anything now. It seems to be very broken at the moment\n\nA: the key 'J' doesn't seem to be a hotkey. For now, I just save files as J and choose the file extension manually below (using the mouse). At least I can save/export files. Then I manually rename the J-file it in Finder. Ugly but works :)\n", "Q: What is Swiftly on mac? I upgraded to Mavericks a few days ago and since then I keep getting a pop up floating search box randomly.

Everything is good and shiny. However, when I open my iTerm to code, I notice that the performance is lower. If I run a uptime command, the average loading is always bigger than 1 even if I run almost no other user process. Before the upgrade, the number is usually near 0.\nAnybody got the same problem? Any idea how to solve it (except rollback to 10.8)?\n\nA: Finally found the culprit. I'm using zsh and the plugin vi-mode from Oh-my-zsh interacts poorly with git tools. Disabling the plugin made my zsh usable again in terms of responsiveness and reducing CPU load. \nThere are conflicting reports whether Apple's git needs to be upgraded and you can follow that process at https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/2189\nStill many thanks for all the people reply to the answer.\n\nA: It is probably spotlight reindexing your system. Look up in your activity monitor which process is using the most computing time:\n\nAlternatively you can click on your battery icon to see this information.\n\nThe problem should be gone in decent time.\n\nA: If you cannot isolate a process that is actually taking CPU time now that should not (or did not before), then two things might be getting mixed up here:\nuptime and top load averages are run queue average depth and not necessarily synonymous with CPU loading.\nYes, you need threads on the queue to have any chance to load the CPU, but just because there are 4 programs on the queue on average over a minute, doesn't mean that those threads together need to consume even 1% of the CPU time.\nThe real answer here will be to look at output like ps aux to determine which processes are actually running as opposed to sleeping and combine that with iostat to watch the actual CPU loading and see if you can determine if some new processes are running and whether that is increasing or decreasing the IO and CPU load on the system.\n\nA: I contacted Apple about this, after being rather insistent I finally got a reply:\n\nApple Developer Relations                  27-Mar-2014 10:54 PM\nEngineering has provided the following:\nIt's a bug in the way load average is calculated, not something causing more system load.\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.\n\n\nA: I would use terminal and run \ntop -o cpu\nThat will give you an idea what apps are using your cpu cycles.\n\nA: Just now, an iTerm2 update arrived that fixes this exact issue for me.\n\niTerm2 1.0.0.20131108\nMavericks fixes and performance improvements.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Fix bug where arrange horizontally computed the wrapping position incorrectly if the screen's visible frame wasn't 0\n  \n*Set coprocess file descriptors nonblocking to avoid deadlock in bug 2576\n  \n*Revert to old text drawing methods\n  \n*Fix bug where the char under the cursor wasn't drawn\n  \n*Fix bug where cursor blinked while moving\n  \n*Fix crash in tmux with line drawing characters.\n  \n*Fix a bug where a session would split using its old profile after its profile was changed.\n  \n*Improve how font width is computed.\n  \n*Fix occasional hang when a session terminates.\n  \n*Hide menu bar on all screens in Mavericks in non-Lion fullscreen mode.\n  \n*Speed up drawing in instant replay.\n  \n*Update instructions for enabling access for asssitive devices on Mavericks.\n  \n*Changes how text is drawn for improved performance.\n  \n\n", "Q: Mail application which allow to choose smtp server I am using Gmail and I have two SMTP settings on Accounts tab (Gmail - Settings - Accounts - Send mail as).

Using Insert > Choose... easily adds the gif to the slide, but without animation. I have searched and found other sources (example) which all seem to point to using the \"Quicktime Inspector\" to work with the animation of a gif. Unfortunately, the Quicktime Inspector no longer seems to exist in version 6.0 and I can't seem to find the solution otherwise. Any suggestions? Thank you much!\n\nA: If you change the extension to .mov then drag it over, it’ll ask you to optimize for iOS, at which point it will treat the GIF as a movie.\n\nA: In my experience, animated GIFs (and Flash animations) are no longer supported in Keynote. You would probably have to use ffmpeg or QTPro to convert the GIFs to movie files and re-import them.\n\nA: The problem was fixed in Keynote v6.2. Update Keynote and it should work. (as mislav informed me in the comments)\n\nA: They won't animate until you view the slideshow, but should there. Also, go to the Inspector>Quicktime Tab and make sure to change the Repeat setting from None to Looping.\n\nA: The new Keynote (v6) doesn't import GIFs in like it used to, which is disappointing.  \nHowever, if you open an old Keynote presentation (Keynote '09), Keynote v6 will ask you if you want to update and/or optimize it for iOS devices.  If you optimize, it will render the animated GIF into .m4v.  Once that is done, if the Format inspection, you will have a \"Movie\" tab.\nThe down side is that you MUST have Keynote '09.  I tried to export an animated GIF created in Keynote v6 as Keynote '09.  It did not maintain the animated GIF correctly, so when I reopened it, I did not get the \"Optimize\" option\n\nA: if you want a GIF to repeat itself, as beroe correctly pointed out, save the .gif to some folder, change it's file extension (make sure to show the real extension and not hide it (cmd+'i' is the canonical version, change it there if you're unsure)) to .mov and then drag it to keynote 6. Optimize for iOS and now select \"endless\" in the \"format->Film\" section under \"repeat\" (I don't know the correct translations as I use a german keynote).\n\nA: I was unable to import an animated gif into Keynote 6.2.2, so I converted it to mp4 via https://cloudconvert.com/anything-to-mp4  (I googled \"convert animated gif to mp4\"), and then I was able to just drag and drop the mp4 into Keynote.\n", "Q: Can't launch calendar, contact, app store, etc Issue\nWhenever I try to launch an app, it opens for a split second and then disappears.\nSystem\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro\n\n*Retina, Mid 2012\n\n*Processor  2.3 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*Memory  16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\n*Graphics  NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB\n\n*Software  OS X 10.9 (13A603)\n\nConsole\nApp store says\n10/25/13 11:42:06.515 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[593]: (com.apple.appstore.26432[2414]) Exited with code: 1\n\nContacts says\n10/25/13 11:42:44.151 AM Contacts[2421]: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting\n10/25/13 11:42:44.153 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[593]: (com.apple.AddressBook.31536[2421]) Exited with code: 1\n\nDictionary says\n10/25/13 11:43:03.592 AM Dictionary[2426]: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting\n10/25/13 11:43:03.594 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[593]: (com.apple.Dictionary.2144[2426]) Exited with code: 1\n\n1Password says\n10/25/13 11:43:30.354 AM com.apple.SecurityServer[16]: Killing auth hosts\n10/25/13 11:43:30.354 AM com.apple.SecurityServer[16]: Session 100030 destroyed\n10/25/13 11:43:30.356 AM com.apple.SecurityServer[16]: Session 100032 created\n10/25/13 11:43:30.422 AM 1Password[2433]: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting\n10/25/13 11:43:30.425 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[593]: (com.agilebits.onepassword-osx.24144[2433]) Exited with code: 1\n\nCalendar says\n10/25/13 11:44:10.895 AM Calendar[2441]: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting\n10/25/13 11:44:10.898 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[593]: (com.apple.iCal.28368[2441]) Exited with code: 1\n\n\nA: Needed to go to Apple Store and reinstall Mavericks.\nCouldn't install from computer as app store was broken.\n", "Q: Why does Automator need the discrete GPU? My 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina was getting quite hot while I was just browsing the web, so I opened Maverick's Activity Monitor to see what was using so much energy. I discovered that the discrete graphics card was active, and the apparent reason for this was Automator was open (but without any windows/documents open).\nWhy on earth does Automator need the discrete graphics card and not just the integrated graphics? \n\n\nA: Some of the Automator actions, such as those pertaining to Quartz, use the discrete GPU (if available). It may be a stability thing to require the discrete GPU on launch (similar to VMware Fusion). If you regularly use Automator and don't use the Quartz filters (or don't care about the performance gain) it should be safe to use gfxCardStatus. Just select Integrated Only before launching Automator.\n", "Q: All Keyboard Shortcuts are selecting word backwards Since the start of September approximately keyboard shortcuts in OS X have been acting strangely. \nMany of the common shortcuts (cmd+z, cmd+v, cm+c, cmd+w etc) select the previous word rather than eliciting their usual action. Further presses simply continue the backward selection of words as if I were pressing shift+option+left arrow.\nThis does not occur immediately. For example, in Apple's Mail programme, upon loading I can press cmd+n and a new window in which to compose an email appears. However, after commencing typing, any further use of the keyboard shortcuts elicits the strange behaviour.\nThe behaviour also occurs in Safari once some text has been highlighted. As with mail, the standard shortcuts operate as, well, standard before some text has been highlighted. Once it has been highlighted however, all shortcuts assume the \"select word backwards\" functionality.\nThe problem does not manifest itself in Pages or Scrivener. However it does occur in Apple's Notes programme.\nI am using a 2012 mac mini, currently with Mavericks. The problem first appeared while running Mountain Lion.\nI had some keyboard modification programs running, e.g. keyremapper and an apple script to select a current word via Fastscripts. Suspecting the latter might be the cause of my woes, since the problem roughly coincided with its first use,  I have removed it and all the rest of them to boot. I then reset the keyboard to its defaults and  restarted the system.\nI have tested it against Apple's wireless bluetooth keyboard and a logitech usb receiver cordless keyboard while web searches have failed to return even a ball park level of relevant information. \n\nA: Erasing the boot disk and installing OS X Mavericks from a flash drive solved the issue. I subsequently reinstalled the various keyboard modifications I had previously been using, including the 'select word' script, pop clip, keyremapformacbook and PCKeyboardHack. So far none of them have elicited the problem behaviour.\n", "Q: Location of power Logic on Macbook Air 13\" A1369 main logic board Is there anyone who can help with the placement of of power logic components on main logic board? My macbook air is totally dead. \n\nA: I assume you're looking for a way to bypass the power button to power it on?  If so this should help.\nThe power pads, two slightly raised solder points, are found just above the keyboard flex connection on the logic board.  See the circled pads in the picture below.  Bridging these two pads while power is provided to the Mac should power it on.  Be sure to use a metal tool with a non conductive handle to bridge the two points.\n\nSource picture can be found in iFixit's 13\" Mid-2011 MacBook Air logic board replacement guide, used and modified under a CC license.\nSomething to keep in mind, a stuck power button will prevent a Mac from powering on even when the power pads are shorted.  To verify that the top case (it houses the power button) is at fault you should disconnect the top case flex cable (silver flex in the photo) and try again if the Mac doesn't first power on with the power pads.  If it still doesn't power on with the flex disconnected then the logic board is likely at fault although you could still dive deeper and disconnect components (SSD, speakers, display) to further isolate the logic board.\nGood luck!  Hopefully it's something simple/cheap.\n", "Q: How to embed a file as an icon in MS Word 2011 This should be fairly simple and it appears to be a bug in MS Word. I have a MS Word document and I simply want to embed an image in the document, but have it show up as an icon instead of the full image.\nWhat should work is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Insert -> Object...\n\n*Press the \"From File...\" button\n\n*Make sure the 'Display as Icon' item is checked\n\n*Select the image file\n\n*Press Insert\n\n\nHowever, the image shows up as itself instead of being represented by an icon.\nThis works in MS Word on Windows.\nIs there a way to make it work in MS Word 2011 for OS X?\n\nA: A solution to this is to insert the icon and link the icon to the image file. \n\nFind the image in Finder. Highlight the icon and select Get Info from the File menu; right-click on the icon and select Get Info from the contextual menu; or select the icon and press the Command+i key combo.

I know I'm not the first one to wonder this.\nSomething like the Chrome Task Manager.\nIn short, when you have multiple tabs/pages open in the new Safari 7 (shipped with Mavericks), each one is launched as a separate system process. You can view the list of processes in Activity Monitor, but you cannot see the underlying page or URL of each process.\nThis would be very helpful for troubleshooting a runaway or hanging page that's sucking up RAM or CPU cycles.\nApple removed the Activity window in Safari 6. And now with Safari 7, the separate processes are great, but more granular info about each tab would be really great.\nAnyone?\n\nA: If you hover you mouse over the name of the Process a Tooltip will show up telling you the URL Base domain\n\n\nA: Update: “Which URLs are associated with each Safari PID?”\nThis is an update on the topic of seeing which Safari URLs are associated with which PIDs in Activity Monitor. I am using Safari 8.0.6 on Yosemite 10.10.3 with Debug menu on, and with the “Show PIDs in the page titles” option on. (See above and below for how to do this.)\nNicolas B stated that “we still miss the opposite way: Process > Tabs”, referring to looking for a list of tab names based on the single line-item PID in Activity Monitor. \nI can show you how to see all of the tabs associated with a particular web process (PID), although it may not completely bring satisfaction, since: \n\n\n*\n\n*it is a multi-step process, and \n\n*trying to find the logic in PID assignments based on tabs is akin to reading tea leaves it seems. \n\n\nIt should also be remembered that listing all page URLs associated with any single web process within Activity Monitor is not practicable in the UI as it exists today. (I wish Apple’s Safari team would add it into the info window for web processes, however!)\nAt first, I assumed the name shown on the process line-item referred to the last full page opened by that PID (not including cached pages), but alas this does not appear to be the case. I am not sure how the line-item actually gets its name. I will share the results of my experiment to find the answer following my explanation of how to see what tabs are associated with each line-item in Activity Monitor.\nStep-by-Step\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the Debug menu in Safari\n\n*Enable the option to Show Web Process IDs in Page Titles\n(as explained above)\n\n*Get this excellent Safari extension from Brett Terpstra, TabLinks.\n(Please donate to him if you find the plugin useful!)\n\n*Run the extension by pressing button with the small link icon\n(Usually left of Safari’s search/location bar)\n\n*In the extension, add a separator character into the template used \nto display the results (for future search-and-replace work). \nI inserted a ying-yang character, so my template was: [%w-%n]:☯%u☯%t.\nThis will give you the results—including the [WP PID] information \nat the end of each tab name—from Safari’s debugging info.\n\n*Copy and paste the results into your favorite text editor app. \n(Nisus Writer Pro is mine!) \nDo a search-and-replace on your separator character (for me, ☯), and \nreplace them with a tab character (here’s one: ).  \nDo another search-and-replace on [WP, and replace only the \nsingle leading space with a tab character «tab»[WP. \nThis will allow you to split the PIDs into a separate column \nin a spreadsheet. \nSave this file as a .tab plain text file.\n\n*Open the tab file in a spreadsheet app (I used Numbers) and have fun\nsorting by PID. Now there's only one more step...\n\n*In Activity Monitor, select View ▶︎ All Processes, \nHierarchically, and copy-paste the list of line-items showing URLs \ninto your spreadsheet, alongside the tab names and numbers you \nalready have there.\n(You can discard all of the column data you don’t need and just keep\nthe URLs and PIDs in two columns; or, add the Memory column to\ncompare RAM usage, too.)\nThat’s it; not exactly quick, but not terribly complicated. There’s probably a faster way, but this was my first try to get this info.\nAfter doing this, you may find results similar to mine. I had 9 windows open with a total of 36 tabs, all being contained in 20 “url-style” processes. \n(NOTE: Here, I am not including the many QTKitServer and Safari Web Content processes. These run alongside most—if not all—of the “url processes”. These QTKitServer processes have a tiny RAM footprint in comparison to the main “url processes”, e.g., 4.5 MB vs 300 MB.)\nObservations\n\n\n*\n\n*I had 9 windows with 36 tabs, running in 20 processes\n\n*RAM use was total of 5.4 GB  (average 258 MB per process)\n\n*Private memory was 2.0 GB total (average 97 MB per process)\n\n*Any single process line-item may contain one or more tabs (mine\nusually had one or two tabs per PID)\n\n*The URL name in the line-item does not seem to follow any pattern I\ncan discern, except that the name usually (but NOT ALWAYS) reflects\nthe base URL of one of the tabs assigned to that PID\n\n*Sometimes the URL name is inaccurate! Of my 20 processes, \n4 used a URL which was NOT open in any of my tabs. \n(Could these be cached pages, perhaps?)\n\n*A new tab (or window) may be assigned either to an existing PID, or to\na new process, seemingly in a “random” fashion. They are neither\nsequential, nor grouped with any particular window; thus, any window\nwith multiple tabs can have several PIDs running alongside each other.\nThis is enough for now! I hope someone a lot smarter than I can come along and explain a little more!

I recently installed OS X Server on my Mavericks machine, and want to use the server (among other things) to cache software and app updates for other devices on my network. However, when I try to turn on the Caching service, I get the following message:\n\nUnable to start service.\nCaching requires a wired network connection on portable computers. Connect to a network using a wired connection before starting the service.`\n\n\nHowever, my Macbook Air doesn't have an ethernet port! I at one time had an ethernet adapter (using Thunderbolt) but I sold it. Any suggestions for how to get around this problem?\n\nA: Via this Apple kbase article:\n\nYou can specify advanced configuration settings for the Caching service with the command line or by editing /Library/Server/Caching/Config/Config.plist.\nInterface | Listen on all interfaces |    The BSD name of a network interface to be used by the Caching service.\nSetting values for a key\nTo set a key with a simple value, you can use the serveradmin(8) command. For example, to set the Interface key to en1, you would execute this command as an administrator:\nsudo serveradmin settings caching:Interface = en1\n\nI am unable to find any evidence anywhere that Server can use wireless interfaces, but if you connect a USB to Ethernet Adapter and use its interface number in the line above you should be able to use Caching Server.\n\nA: All Airs can use an USB to ethernet adapter and the newer ones like yours use a Thunderbolt to ethernet adapter to satisfy the initial criteria of the setup tool.\nMy advice is to make your wired connection available whenever caching is turned on since in my limited testing so far, caching just won't play with wireless connections.\nCaching used to work over Wireless in Mountain Lion, but I've not discovered a way to reliably shift the services in Mavericks since the server detects when you switch network connections and you'll run into this detection loop each time you don't have a legitimate ethernet connection between the server and your internet gateway.\n", "Q: Is there a reason why OS X Mavericks Server is running Postgresql? I recently installed OS X Mavericks Server on my computer to use for Xcode continuous integration. I now see that the postgresql database is running via the Activity Monitor, and some investigation shows that it was started by Server.app, which is running Python, which started Postgres. I know that postgres is small and doesn't take up much resources, but I am just curious: Is there a reason why Server.app is running the database? I don't see a postgres service to turn on or off (which to be honest would be a great service to run via the server app).\n\nA: From the OS X Server Advanced Administration manual, under the section on Postgres backups:\n\nThe Server app on OS X Mavericks supports three separate database clusters:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Calendar and Contacts\n  \n*Profile Manager\n  \n*Wiki and Xcode server\n  \n\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut in OS X Mavericks for quick reply when an iMessage notification appears?

I am using a Mac Pro Mid 2010 with 16GB RAM so power is not the issue.\nAt first I thought the problem might have been due to having done an upgrade install of Mavericks, but after seeing tagging working fine on an upgraded Air and iMac I decided to try a clean install. Alas, the problem persisted.\nSince I was installing on a DIY Fusion Drive I had created back in the early days of Mountain Lion, that became my next suspect. To \"quickly\" test my theory I installed Mavericks on an external slow & tiny USB drive. Zero problems. Tagging was instantaneous and no beach balls in sight.\nSo, it seemed likely to be one of the drives. First I tried installing Mavericks on a newly created Fusion Drive (using the same component drives; an OCR Vertex 3 and a regular WD HDD) from the Mavericks recovery partition terminal in the hope that a newer CoreStorage would fix things. Same problem.\nNext I tried the drives individually, but after having installed a fresh Mavericks on both (I know, tedious) and still having the problem I feel I am running out of options. Is it my SATA controller? And why just on the tagging?\nI have made a few Activity Monitor Spindumps which I'm hoping anyone with the knowledge & inclination could glean some information from.\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n:/\nTeo\nSpindumps: \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/d86hdy2xcq8jryy/Mavs%20Finder%20Tagging%20Spindump.txt\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ilmaceo8szhp9s8/Spindump2.txt\nUPDATE 17 May 2014\nI have now identified the source of the bug (on my system at least). \nI noticed that on a completely fresh user account everything works as it should, new tags are added without hangs or even delays. \nThe moment I enable the \"iCloud->Documents & Data\" option the problem manifests: hangs occur on adding any new tags. Even more unfortunately, disabling it again does not make the issue disappear. Once enabled the system isn't working properly anymore.\nMy guess is that there's something buggy in the way the system is trying to check for tags across iCloud but strange that the problem remains after removing it. \nAny new info/suggestions are welcome.\nUPDATE 1 October 2014\nThis problem persists in Yosemite 10.10 GM\n\nA: 6 months or more of this problem... \nmy 2013 Mac was hanging when saving files, making outlook 2011 hang often! and slowing down workflows... and after reading this post it dawned on me... \nbefore Mavericks I used 2 different tagging appx, TAGS and Leap. When installing mavericks, tags were quite well, though they became increasingly slow. \nI I deleted both programs and amazingly and thankfully, For now at least, the hangs in Outlook and find have stopped, it feels like a new Machine. I can only hope its permanent.\nWhilst on this topic I had a similar problem with my Mavericks finder a tad's. The centre of the Finder screen used to become transparent and you could not see the files. Drove me insane. Rebooting reinstalling wasting time. I do realise I had an older program called total Finder, Which is really good, installed before I use no bricks. After months of having this problem, then deleting that program, The problem is fixed. \nMoral of the story, if you have installed an app to add functionality and apple then adds the functionality into osx, chances are the app will slow down a your mac. \nMental motor self and all reading ... uninstall apps of such nature. \n\nA: This problem has been bugging me for months. I've kept a weather eye on the Google results, poked around trying to find my own solution, upgraded to Yosemite to see if the issue was resolved there, but nothing turned up. So, during the Thanksgiving break I decided to sit down and fix this once and for all.\nLooooong story short, every time you add a new tag (and possibly when you add a tag to a file) it gets popped into the Finder sidebar for easy access. Handy. Thing is, if you get crazy and add a metric ton of tags, none of them are ever removed from the Finder sidebar. They roll off the edge where you can't see them, and are flagged as \"visible if newer items are removed\" but they are all retained in the sidebar items plist. This plist gets massive, and takes a long time to parse any time it must be modified.\nTo make things worse, when you have \"documents and data\" turned on under System Preferences > iCloud the tag list is synced. This means the hang follows you to every machine where you are signed into iCloud, even on a fresh reload of OS X. Funfunfun.\nThankfully, there is an easy fix. I'll keep the explanation simple for Joe Internet who may be having this problem stumble across this post.\nWhen the Finder is running properly (not beach-balled), right-click on the icon in the Dock and select \"Go to Folder\". In the dialog that appears type \"~/Library/Preferences/\". That funny little squiggle at the front is just a nice little shortcut that tells the dialog to start in your home folder for the path, rather than the root of the internal drive.\nYou will be presented with a cornucopia of scary looking plists. The one we are after is titled \"com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\". Copy that plist somewhere you can find it later (just in case something goes awry and you have to put it back.) Now, delete the the original plist in the Library folder and reboot your machine. After the reboot Finder will have an empty tag sidebar and you can create, delete, and rearrange tags to your hearts content. No hangs. As long as you have iCloud \"Documents and Data\" enabled, this new clean sidebar will also be uploaded to iCloud and clear out the old gigantic one on all your machines.\nIt should be noted that this DOES NOT delete the tags from your files. That information is actually appended to an extended attribute (xattr) of the file itself, rather than being stored in a single plist or database somewhere. Thankfully the tags on the files themselves aren't what's causing the hang issue, so we can leave them untouched.\nOf course, what you will lose are the list of tags and custom folders you want in the Finder sidebar. Add the folders back the normal way (drag them into the sidebar) and you can select which tags you want by going to the Finder menu > Preferences > Tags and checking the boxes. I've got about a dozen and things are snappy.\nOne other unfortunate loss are the tags' assigned colors. That's strictly stored in the Finder's plist. The tags may appear to retain their color until you add them back to the sidebar, or try to apply a tag to an item, at which point the color vanishes.\nAfter you've added a tag or two back to the sidebar the \"all tags\" item will reappear at the bottom of the list. Click on that and scroll through the list of tags to re-assign their colors. Make sure to re-apply color even to the tags that appear to have retained it, because when that tag is next added to a file or otherwise modified there's a good chance the color will disappear.\nSomething to note if you have a lot of colors applied: adding them all back may cause the hang issue to re-manifest. All those color assignments are stored in the plist, and too many may drag things down. I've only got a few color assignments so I haven't been able to verify this theory.\nThat's it! Congratulations! Tags are now usable on your machine(s) again. Just remember to go into Finder > Preferences > Tags every now and again and clear the checkbox or minus sign from the tags you don't want displayed in the sidebar and things should remain snappy.\n\nA: Tagging files with Ironic Software's Leap app avoids this issue in my case. Leap keeps OpenMeta and Finder tags in sync.\n\nA: Thank you so much for the background on this issue, EightQUarterBit.  On the other hand I didn't really want to lose all my sidebar shortcuts and folders (of which I have many) so I opted to dig a little deeper into the plist file and opted to edit out the problem instead of deleting the entire plist file.  I deleted all the plist settings covering tags for everything except the default color tags (turned out to be like 7,000 lines) and saved it and rebooted and it worked like a charm AND I got to keep my other sidebar settings.  Here's how to do what I did:\nFirst I made a backup copy of the com.apple.sidebarlists.plist file on my desktop.  Second, open up the original plist file in a free editor like TextWrangler, search for \"x-apple-findertag:\"  The first hits will be the default (colored) tags.  I left those alone.  Skip down to your custom tags.  Note that each tag's section starts with <dict> and ends with </dict> (although there is one other <dict></dict> entry inside that section), for example, see the set of code for a single tag below (where MyCustomTagName is where the tag's name will be, in 2 places):\n<dict>\n<key>CustomItemProperties</key>\n<dict>\n<key>com.apple.LSSharedFileList.ItemIsHidden</key>\n<false/>\n<key>kLSSharedTagFileListItemLabel</key>\n<integer>6</integer>\n<key>kLSSharedTagFileListItemPinned</key>\n<true/>\n</dict>\n<key>Name</key>\n<string>MyCustomTag</string>\n<key>URL</key>\n<string>x-apple-findertag:MyCustomTag</string>\n</dict>\n\nTake note of the pattern because we are going to want to delete the complete section for each entry of all the tags we don't want to be listed in the sidebar, which in my case was all of them except for the default color tags.  Each entry starts with <dict> followed by <key>CustomItemProperties</key> and is 15 lines long (which includes the first <dict> tag).  Click and drag down to select them all and delete them.  Save the plist file and then reboot your Mac.  The issue was completely gone for me after rebooting and I got to keep my sidebar shortcuts.  You'll need to repeat these steps after creating more tags though.  I contacted apple and reported the issue and have now followed up and given them the solution.\nI've detailed all the steps above, with screenshots, on my blog (which I used to originally reported this problem almost a year ago and then heard about your response today from a commenter on my blog). You can see my alternative solution in great detail on my blog at: http://www.shareyourrepair.com/2013/12/finder-hangs-when-tagging-files-mavericks.html\n", "Q: Apps disappeared since installing Mavericks Since updating to Mavericks, I ran Purge King as I normally would and now all apps e.g. App Store have disappeared.\nI managed to get most of them back into the dock but the App Store has gone totally and the Mail.app won't work now either. Now all my apps in Launchpad are missing.\nAny ideas how to get the apps back? I have since uninstalled purge king.\n\nA: A quick google search for purge king came up with no results so the following answer is simply me going out on a limb here picturing the worst case scenario where said application deleted all applications including 3rd party apps and built in stock applications.\nYour best bet in this case would be to restore from a time machine backup. As I don't know what purge king exactly did the best way would be to do the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your time machine backup drive directly to your machine (if\nit is an Apple Time Capsule then you can skip this step)\n\n*Enter the time machine and delete any backup that has been created after your apps disappeared\n\n*Restart your Mac and hold down the \"R\" key on your keyboard while it is turning on.\n\n*Follow the on screen prompts to choose your language etc.\n\n*Choose the \"Restore from Time Machine Backup\" option and click Continue.\n\n*Select the backup drive on the presented list and restore your computer\n\n\nThis will essentially wipe your drive clean and put onto it your most recent backup from the drive, in this case, the most recent backup that you left undeleted from step 2.\n\nIf you don't have a Time Machine backup, from my knowledge (and I could be wrong) I am unaware of another way to retrieve the stock mac applications back without doing a complete system format and reinstall. Airdropping the applications from another Mac may work but it sounds like other information that the applications require to operate are also missing/damaged (which is the most likely scenario for the Mail app). Your last resort option if you don't have a time machine backup would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup a time machine drive (either on an Apple Time Capsule or an external drive)\n\n*Backup your entire computer.\n\n*Restart your Mac and hold down the \"R\" key on your keyboard while it is turning on.\n\n*Follow the onscreen prompts to choose your language etc.\n\n*Choose the \"Reinstall OSX\" option and click Continue.\n\n*Once OSX has finished reinstalling and you are on your desktop, connect your backup drive to your Mac, enter Time Machine and restore all your personal data and anything else you would need.\n\n\nThe only problem to this approach is that your applications will be erased. You could restore them from the time machine backup but this could possibly cause similar problems that you encountered with the Mail app.\n\nIf you don't have a Time Machine backup from the very beginning, this would be a good lesson to ALWAYS have a plan B. Time Machine is the best plan B for Mac users that exists to date as it not only backs up your personal information, but your entire hard drive so even if your operating system became corrupt or your internal hard drive died, you could clone the backup onto a new drive, boot from it, and it will be as if nothing ever happened.\n\nA: Woah, thats quite odd. Have you tried just restarting the machine? I know for me, it had to redo a spotlight search but I doubt that would affect anything.\nThe only other thing I can think of is to run a permissions fix:\nhttp://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57595312-285/repair-disk-permissions-to-speed-up-your-mac/\n", "Q: \"Apply Rules\" to Sent Mail folder in OS X 10.9 Mavericks does not work Any idea why in Mail 7.0 (part of OS X 10.9 Mavericks,) when I select a group of messages in the Sent Mail folder and do Message --> Apply Rules command, nothing happens?\n(In prior versions of OS X back to 10.5, my extensive list of 70+ rules automatically moved messages from my Sent folder to various other sorted folders.

I thought this is a normal thing, and can bypass it if I restore the phone - that's why I bought it.\nI used the iPhone for one week, then tried to restore it with iOS 7.0.3 but after the restore, the activation screen showed \"This iPhone is locked with an apple id  s.....@gmail.com\". Then I tried my Apple ID instead, but was unable to use another id.\nI went back to the mobile shop for help. He tried for one day but with no success. He said he bought it from Dubai from a person he doesn't have contact address or number.\nHow do I get the iPhone unlocked and can use my Apple ID with it?\n\nA: It may not be your fault, but s...@gmail may be missing photos of his family and other stuff important to him. Maybe not. At least, send him an email explaining what happened. Maybe he will be ok with this, maybe he will thank you, it's just the right thing to do..\n\nA: Since iOS 7 all iDevices now are equipped with Activation Lock, triggered by Find My iPhone.\nOnce locked, only the original owner, or Apple themselves can bypass it.\nWhen you enable Find My iPhone on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, your Apple ID is securely stored on Apple’s activation servers and linked to your device. From that point on, your password will be required before anyone can turn off Find My iPhone on your device, erase your device, or reactivate and use your device.\nWhen purchasing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch from someone other than Apple or an authorized Apple reseller, it is up to you to ensure that the device has been erased and is no longer linked to the previous owner’s account.\nYou can check the current Activation Lock status of a device by visiting https://icloud.com/activationlock from any Mac or PC.\nSource : Find My iPhone Activation Lock\n\nA: You won't be able to do nothing for the moment.\n", "Q: ipython/python broken after upgrading to OS X Mavericks After upgrading to OS X Mavericks, it seems Python broke.

The updated versions don't replace the old ones there, so the App Store keeps seeing the previous version and thinks you need to update.  (iMovie and GarageBand have the same issue; previous versions were installed into a folder inside the Applications folder.)\n", "Q: Possibility to recover data from restored iPhone?

I read online I needed to download iTunes to get into recovery mode which I did when it was done and my phone finally came back on EVERYTHING was gone.  \nIs there anything I can do to get my contacts/ pictures back?\n\nA: Unless you had a backup, no. Do you have a copy of your contacts anywhere? iCloud for example? Visit www.icloud.com and login with your AppleID, see in the contacts tab if you still can find your contacts.\nIf this isn't the case, I don't think you can do anything but learn out of it and make backups regulary.\niTunes is offering you this option.

One has OS X 10.8 installed, the other one 10.9. I'd like to delete the first partition and merge the free space afterwards to the 2nd partition.\nWhat's the easiest way to do this? Can I use diskutil eraseVolume/mergePartitions?\n\nA: iPartition\nFor all my partitioning, I use and recommend iPartition. It will allow you to resize partitions without deleting any data. It also works for Boot Camp volumes and other PC disks. It will automatically move partitions if necessary to allow resizing into free space that is located before the partition.\n\nWith iPartition, resizing a partition is as simple as selecting it, grabbing the resize handle and dragging. Not only that, but if you have several operations to perform, iPartition lets you queue them up and run them one after another, so you can have a cup of coffee while iPartition works. This feature, coupled with iPartition’s ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when necessary, makes iPartition the easiest partitioning tool that you’ll ever use.\n\n\n\nA: I ended up wiping the 1st partition, reinstalling 10.9 on it, migrating the data from the 2nd partition onto it using Time Machine and then removing the 2nd partition using Disk Utility.\nI didn't try using Carbon Copy Cloner or DuperDuper to move the entire partition directly, because I wanted a working OS X Recovery Partition, but I recon that could probably work as well.\n", "Q: AppleScript to make the preview image become the master in Aperture library?

This can be done by reading the EDID with ioreg -l, modifying the offending bits (see the specification in the Wikipedia article), and creating a display config override file for OS X. I have attached such a file for the U2713H and U2713HM; just extract it and move the contained folder into /System/Library/Displays/Overrides. After a reboot, the monitor should show that RGB colors are used.

(jerky scrolling, accidental safari back) After installing Mavericks over Mountain Lion, my vertical scrolling is wiggly (jerky) on rMBP.\nSimilar as in iOS, when scrolling with two fingers on touchpad down or up, a smooth motion \"locks\" the scroll to vertical scroll only. After upgrading to Mavericks, vertical scroll does not \"lock\" and will also wiggle horizontally.\nThis makes scrolling in Chrome and Safari painful because browser will make go back or forward in history when trying to scroll. Occasionally the screen will also jump a few pixels up or down because it's recovering from the horizontal shift.\nAny advice ?\n\nA: Please do NOT accept this answer as the correct one. Leave this question open for as long as it takes to get a proper solution. I don't want the bounty.\nI made a quick app which hacks together some basic vertical-only scroll lock support. It basically tells the system to ignore small horizontal movements when scrolling in a mostly vertical direction.\nYou can download the app from http://kapeli.com/ScrollLock.zip.

I also have an older MacBook with Mavericks installed and I would like to use the iWork Suite on both computers.\nMy question: Are the App Store codes bound to the new Mac or can I download the Apps on both Macs after activating the code?\n\nA: Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer.\nThere are two angles to this - the practical \"Will it work?\" angle and the legal \"Is this legally allowed by Apple?\" angle.\nShort answers - it will work; but it's not legally sanctioned by Apple.\nWill it work?\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, once you redeem the codes on the Mac App Store, these applications will be tied to your iTunes Store Account's Apple ID.\n\n*These apps will henceforth show up in the Purchases tab of the Mac App Store on every Mac that you have.\n\n*Assuming the other Macs you own run OS X Mavericks 10.9 (which is the minimum requirement for the latest iWork releases), you would be able to install the latest iWork on them.\n\n\nIs this legally allowed by Apple?\n\n*\n\n*This is a bit more difficult to answer accurately. I can only provide some pointers on the different aspects and will try to add a score to make it easier to understand (positive means it's legally fine and negative means it's legally not fine).\n\n*Score: -2\n\n*\n\n*Apple tries to follow a \"what's paid for with the original product\" approach when it comes up with software releases and updates. This has meant that Apple has charged owners of older systems for things like enabling WiFi 802.11n, FaceTime on OS X, etc., while giving these free for purchasers of newer Macs (this is similar to newer iOS devices getting iLife and iWork apps free whereas older devices still have to pay for them). From this angle, no, you do not qualify to run this license of iWork that you have been given on other Macs you own.\n\n*On a related note, if you look at past up-to-date programs from Apple for OS X, for example, the OS X Mountain Lion up-to-date program, it clearly states\n\nThe OS X Mountain Lion software content code must be used solely with the products that qualify for this offer.\n  This offer is limited to one OS X Mountain Lion content code per qualifying computer purchased.\n  \n\n\n*Score: 0\n\n\n*\n\n*This recent article titled Apple Offering 'Free' Updates to All Owners of Aperture, iWork, and iLife; Not Worried About Unethical Users states that Apple has intentionally allowed users of older versions of iLife, iWork and Aperture (including trial versions or illegally acquired versions) to upgrade to the latest version for free. According to the unnamed source in Apple:\n\n...With Mavericks, we have changed the way we distribute updates for legacy versions of our apps\n  ...\n  ...when Mavericks discovers legacy apps installed on your Mac, it provisions them as a Mac App Store purchase using your Apple ID. It saves us a lot of time, effort, and bandwidth. After the provision is complete, it will appear in your Mac App Store history as though you have purchased the Mac App Store version of the app.\n  While we are aware that this enables piracy of our apps for unethical users, Apple has never taken a strong stance or action against piracy in the past. We like to believe that our users are honest, even if that belief is in vain.\n  \n\nTotal score: -2 (against installing it on the other Mac).\nTo summarize, Apple's past bevahior and past terms state that this is not legally sanctioned by Apple. Even the article cited above states that \"We like to believe that our users are honest, even if that belief is in vain.\"\nSo if you'd like the bitter truth, in my opinion, you are not legally allowed to install iWork from the up-to-date program on any of your other Macs that do not qualify for the up-to-date program, even though it would work practically.\n", "Q: Reducing the size of a black-and-white scanned pdf I have a 352 page pdf that is a scan of a black-and-white text. The file size is 60.9 MB, which seems excessively large too me. (Is it indeed?)\nIs there an easy way to convert this file to a more compressed one?\n\nEdit. Here's a little sample:\n\n\nA: A great PDF compressor is Ghostscript (gs), which is native in most Linux distributions and easily installable for Mac OS X and Windows.\nDaniel summarizes it best here, with the key quote being his preferred options:\ngs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH \\\n    -sOutputFile=foo-compressed.pdf foo.pdf\n\n\nA: 60MB is probably OK for a greyscale scan of 350 pages.

If you meant it's actually black and white (and no grey) then it's definitely too big.\nPreview is probably a bad tool to try to get the file size down without hurting image quality.  The only tools available will resample the image to a lower resolution.  What I use in a case like this is Acrobat Pro, which will let me convert the compression of the embedded scans to JPEG2000, which can save a lot of space over normal JPEG and retain quality.\n\nA: If it is just text and no images, it is indeed quite large.\nThere are several ways to compress the PDF file, and one of them is a simple solution with Preview.app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file in Preview.app\n\n*Go to the File > Export... menu option\n\n*Provide a name for the file\n\n*Below in the Quartz Filter: dropdown, choose Reduce File Size (the default would be \"None\")\n\n*Click Save\nIf the result is a well compressed file but the readability is negatively impacted, you can try scanning at a much higher DPI and compressing it (to get a better compromise between file size and readability) or use a third party product to do OCR on the file (PDFPen, PDFScanner, VueScan and ABBYY FineReader are just some of the several options available).\n\nA: Found this online tool, it compressed my 100 MB b&w pdf to 18 MB using the medium setting, quality is still very acceptable for reading.\nhttps://www.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf\nIt may be a problem if the user has restricted bandwidth as the file has to uploaded and re-downloaded, Dropbox or Google Drive integration is also offered as an alternative but I have not tested it.\n", "Q: Does LibreOffice work on OS X 10.9 Mavericks?

This can only be supported if Apple makes such a feature available in Mail.app. I do not know if third party mail apps have such a feature.\n", "Q: NoSleep still in in settings though uninstalled? I have still the NoSleep options in my settings panel although it's fully uninstalled. How can I remove them, too? System is 10.9.\n\nA: Download NoSleep.dmg or use it if already there. Mount it and click \"Uninstall.command\".  Reopen preferences, it should be gone. \nUninstalling using official methods is preferred over simply deleting the app packages. Two old, but still relevant questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why there is no standard way to uninstall programs in MacOS?\n\n*How do I uninstall a program completely on a Mac?\n\nA: Try right clicking the NoSleep options button from the main screen of System Preferences and click the \"Remove Preference Pane\" option.\n", "Q: How can I hide file tags? I'm tagging USB and network drives in Mavericks, and I would like the tags to disappear from my Mac when the drives are disconnected.

Confirm.\n\n*Reconnect the external drive.\n\n*The tag will reappear.\n\n*Disconnect the external drive.\n\n*The tag will disappear.\n\n\nI'm curious if there's a more permanent solution, such as a way to create tags so that they're transient in the first place.\n", "Q: FLAC audio support for OS X 10.9 Someone please remind me of what software I need to install to get as full support for FLAC audio as possible.\nI've figured out how to do this, and then forgotten again, perhaps a dozen times over the years. Every time I reinstall or upgrade my Mac. Now I've installed OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and it's time to do it one more time.\nIdeally I'd like:\n\n\n*\n\n*QuickLook preview support\n\n*ability to open and play FLAC in QuickTime Player (QTP7 is okay)\n\n\nI'm hoping to avoid installing half a dozen QuickTime components and Quicklook plugins to find something that works well with 10.9. Thanks!\n\nA: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but native support of FLAC in Mavericks is near non-existent.\nYour best bet would be to just convert your FLAC to ALAC, or Apple Lossless Audio Codec.\nYou can download the free utility XLD, or X Lossless Decoder, to convert.\nDownload XLD from its homepage here:  http://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html\n\nA: It may not fill yours, or our, wishlists (eg Finder and iTunes integration) but no one has noted that\nVLC/VideoLan\nwill play FLAC files directly from macOS.  The UI is far from ideal but certainly saves all that dull tedium of conversion if you're in a hurry to hit Play.\n\nA: I have had little joy so far, after trying several downloads.\nYou can install Fluke to play Flac audio files in some apps, such as Quicktime Player 7. \nThis doesn't resolve the issue though, because it appears Quicklook preview still does not work.\nI had hopes for Xiph.org's codecs, and Perian, though the latter probably just uses Xiph and is no longer maintained. Still no support for previewing Quicklook.\nIt's possible I have some conflicting plugin/codec somewhere, but I doubt it. I tried to clear stale files from the Components, QuickTime, and QuickLook folders (of both the root and the user Library folders) after each install.\n\nA: Unfortunately Fluke doesn't work for me. To play FLAC files, I use Cog or Play (they seem no longer maintained, but work perfectly on Mavericks). To convert/import them to iTunes, there is FLAC to Any Lite.\n\nA: Kudos to @Maya for pointing out the right answer. Here's what I did for converting a FLAC CD rip to something that iTunes would play properly.\nThe method I used was as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install XLD\n\n*Start up XLD and using \"Open Folder as a Disc...\" from the File menu, point it to the folder containing FLAC files\n\n*If you have an album cover, drag and drop it to the empty photo in the UI\n\n*Press the Get MetaData button in the toolbar to load up the song titles, etc.\n\n*Open up the XLD preferences to change the output format to Apple Lossless\n\n*Press the Transcode button\n\n*Drag and drop the converted .M4A files into iTunes\n\n*Enjoy! :)\n\n\nA: VLC is the best tool I know of for just playing FLAC files (see John2095's answer for the link). If you'd like to manipulate the files from the command line (encoding/decoding), then the flac tool is available from MacPorts. I believe it's available from HomeBrew, too, but I don't use that, so I'm not 100% sure.\n\nA: I use Vox to play FLAC files (free on the App store) - it's drag 'n' drop simple. To convert FLACs to m4a and automatically add them to iTunes I use Max which does it in a single step.\n", "Q: Share only iTunes Match between two devices My wife and I have separate Apple IDs, but all of our music is in my iTunes Match \"account\".  Can I share just that between our phones, keeping everything else separate?  We both have IOS 7 installed.\n\nA: In Settings -> Store, make sure you’re signed into the account that has all the music/media/etc. (iOS lets you have one Apple ID signed in for iCloud and another for store purchases).\nThen, in Settings -> Music, turn iTunes Match on. In iTunes for Mac, go to Store -> Turn Off iTunes Match.\nThe iTunes Match will then only be on your iTunes devices, but your Macs won’t have any iTunes Match.\n", "Q: How to run third-party iOS apps in OS X? I have a lot of awesome iOS apps such as Procreate that I would I like to use in OSX. Currently, I am only able to run my own iOS apps in OSX through Xcode. I heard some rumours that thirdparty iOS apps may be possible in the future to work with OSX as Apple tries to integrate its ecosystem even closer to its own services -- yet I would like to get it now: \n\nHow to get iOS apps working in OS X? Any sandbox using things such as Xcode for third-party apps?\n\n\nA: The reason you can run programs that you have source code and libraries for is that Xcode cross compiles that code to run on x86 architecture inside an iOS simulator. \nWhat you are looking for is an iOS emulator and that's something that Apple doesn't provide. There are emulators around, but they all seem to be startup / venture funded efforts at this point. Time will tell if they decide to release the product to paying users or otherwise monetize that work. As of fall 2013, there are no feasible options to do what you ask. \nRealistically, you would need to have source code for those third party apps to be one Xcode build away from simulating those apps on your Mac.\nThis restriction also applies to the dozens of apps Apple ships as part of iOS that aren't shipped in the Xcode iOS simulator.\nThe TL;DR summary is you need an iOS device do to most development and testing since:\n\n\n*\n\n*the simulator isn't an emulator \n\n*the simulator  designed for very specific subset of the development and QA/testing tasks needed to ship and support an app\n\n*the simulator won't run arbitrary IPA or apps to which you lack the source code\n\n", "Q: MacBook Air: audio jack left channel failing I have a MacBook Air 2012. I listen to audio by plugging EarPods into the audio jack.\nThis morning I noticed that I no longer have sound coming out of the left headphone. Well, There is a little, but it is < 10% what it should be.  I tried a different set of headphones and got the same result.\nIs there any option for repairing the headphone port? \nI'm guessing it is soldered onto the motherboard, and there will be absolutely no chance of a repair, and I will have to use a USB soundcard.\nπ\n\nA: Some how my software had panned the audio to the right channel only. \nGod only knows why my machine decided to pan itself fully to the right!?\nAnyway, if you think you need a repair, double check it's not software as I found on the Apple discussions.\n", "Q: How can I \"Page Down\" from the keyboard in an Apple Mail message list? With recent versions of Apple Mail, the Page Down key always applies to the message content pane (unless no message is selected), even if the message list had focus. However, you used to be able to type Control–Page Down to make it apply to the message list. This no longer works in OS X 10.9. Is there another way?\n\nA: I wrote some AppleScripts that can Page Up/Down in Mail’s message list, and the scripts can be assigned Control–Page Up/Down as keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: Command-Option Down-Arrow seems to do it for me\n\nA: fn + down arrow seems to work on yosemite\n", "Q: Wrong app is focused when quitting another one? I have Firefox and the Finder open (neither are hidden), with PDF files in the current Finder window. If I open one of the PDF files, it opens in Preview. When I quit Preview, rather than Finder being focused, Firefox is focused instead.\nThis did NOT used to be the case in previous versions of OS X. There is an order in which apps are focused, and that is whatever was last focused. So, when quitting the PDF file, the Finder should have been focused. This has occurred since I upgraded to Mavericks.\nAnyone know how to fix this, or if it is indeed a bug? This happens with Firefox and the Finder, most frequently.\n\nA: Just asked the same question and saw yours after…\nIt's actualy not related to Finder/PDF/Preview:\nI had the issue with a first Mac (iMac): every time an app was quit (auto or by me), MAMP software (that I always let hidden) was reactivated. I thought it was a MAMP bug, but I just updated to Mavericks on another Mac (MBP – yes, I'm a bit late), and exactly the same thing is happening with Firefox (I have MAMP installed on it too).\nSo I just think this is a Mavericks bug…\nhttps://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ !\n", "Q: iPhone 5s: texts and calls show numbers instead of names I have an iPhone 5s. All contact phone numbers show up in the list as names. How do I get names, not numbers to display for received texts and calls?\n\nA: Put people in your iPhone contacts, when you put people in the Contacts application it is best to put in the full telephone number and the country of the person then the iPhone will use the telephone number formatting of that country.\nI live in the Netherlands and I have setup my iPhone as such, when I create a new contact by default (unless I change the country) they are listed as being in the Netherlands. The country code for the Netherlands is +31, the \"+\" is the convention for country code.\nIf I type in a mobile phone number (the prefix code for mobiles is '6') say \n+31 6 12345678 then the iPhone will format it that way. If I type in a fixed land line number, say +31 40 1234567 then it will put in the spaces to correctly identify the region code '40'. If I put in other people from other countries with other formats for phone numbers, say +1 123 12345678 for something in the US, the iPhone will automatically put in the correct spacing.\nAnd you will see the person's name, not number, for incoming and outgoing calls.\n", "Q: Mount .sparseimage from .bash_profile I need to mount a .sparseimage from .bash_profile but I don't get how to do it.

You are creating an alias.  You must run the alias first to mount the disk image (with of22 in your case).\n2) Seems like you've done #1 because you get the error message \"no mountable filesystem\".  This is probably because the disk image is using a relative path, which means you must run of22 from the parent directory (which seems to be your home directory in this case).\nTry changing the command to \nhdiutil attach \"$HOME/Documents/OF.sparseimage\" -mountpoint \"$HOME/OpenFOAM\"\n\nNotice the addition of \"$HOME\".\n", "Q: How do I prevent Chrome going fullscreen while playing youtube videos? I have started observing this ever since I upgraded to Mavericks. Earlier [i.e. on Mountain Lion] if I played any youtube video on fullscreen, only video would be fullscreen, not chrome. \nNow in Mavericks, I am observing that even Chrome app going fullscreen mode. I am not saying it stays fullscreen even after completing the video, but I find it quite annoying. I just want my video to play fullscreen but I don't want my chrome to go to Fullscreen Mode. Anyone else noticed this ? And is it possible to prevent this ?\n\nA: Chrome takes you into a fullscreen window when you try to play a HTML5 video in fullscreen. On YouTube, if you are using the HTML5 preview/beta instead of the standard Flash (or if you have uninstalled or never installed Flash on your computer), that will continue to happen.\nFor YouTube at least, make sure Flash is installed and drop out of the HTML5 beta program. This is only a short-term solution, and only applies to video sites that still use Flash.\nTry that and see if it work.\n\nA: In Chrome, go to this URL: chrome://flags/#enable-simplified-fullscreen .  You should see the title 'Enables simplified fullscreen' highlighted.  Click the 'Enable' link under it and restart Chrome.\n", "Q: Can I purchase regular DDR3 RAM for my MAC (not from an iMac store?) I know that buying and installing RAM from a regular computer shop will be cheaper for me. I was just wondering if a Macbook Pro 17\" early 2011 model uses specific 'Mac' DDR3 RAM or if I can get away with any DDR3 RAM?\n\nA: Generally in principle yes. You do not need to purchase expensive Apple memory.\nHowever you will need to check for each model - the best thing is to go to a reputable memory supply company website which sells certified RAM and look up your model.\nYou can search for them online but here is a respected store (I have no affiliations with)\nhttp://www.crucial.com\n\nA: Just be sure the memory you buy meets the specifications on Apple's website.\nIt's a very common type of  memory,  204-pin PC3-10600 DDR3 1333 MHz.\n\nA: Although memory chips conform to standards, there could be some minor variations. So it is advisable to buy from a seller who tests and guarantees compatibility of the RAM sticks for your Mac.\nTwo such stores in the U.S. that have served customers for a long time are OWC - MacBook Pro 2011 RAM and Data Memory Systems - MacBook Pro RAM. These are usually cheaper than Crucial and offer good warranties.\n", "Q: Where does Messages.app store its \"Play sound effects\" setting? I'm trying to write a script to configure the system and various apps to my liking, mostly via defaults write. I got stuck with Messages' Play sound effects setting (under General). I think this setting might be new in Mavericks.\nI couldn't find it in any of the *iChat*.plist files under ~/Library/Preferences, so I watched the whole directory for changes with FS events, and it doesn't seem like that setting is affecting any of the files in that directory.\nAny ideas about other locations where Messages.app could be storing this setting?\n\nA: Since Messages.app is a sandboxed app, the preferences would be under ~/Library/Containers/:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.plist\n\nor look through ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.*iChat*/.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone Spotlight (Springboard) search show a little poop emoji in the corner? It's kind of cute, but why is it doing this and how can I change it?\n\n\nA: iOS shows the folder name when you search for an app that's stored within a folder as opposed to lying on the springboard main screens.\nAny chance someone punked you by making a clever named folder and placing these exact apps inside that folder?\nYou can be sure your phone is fine by making a folder and controlling which apps are stored in that folder as well as the name of that folder. Searching for those apps should show the folder name of your choosing.\n", "Q: Will iPhone 4 turn on automatically when charging? If my iPhone 4 dies, will it turn back on automatically after I put it on charge?\nThe reason I ask this is my lock button is broken and I'm afraid to let my phone die. What should I do?\n\nA: Yes, it will turn on once it reaches the minimum charge needed to start the phone.\nWhen the battery is completely drained, you would just see a depleted battery icon (with a connect to charger prompt) for a few seconds if you press the Sleep/Wake button or the Home button. Once you connect it to the charger, it will charge for a few minutes and automatically start up, taking you to the lock screen.\nAt any time, you can wake your phone by pressing either the Sleep/Wake button (on top) or the Home button (below the touchscreen).\n\nA: There is another way also. while charging u should reboot it. \n", "Q: My Macbook keeps two versions of iWork after updating I have updated the iWork applications from '09 to 2013. After updating, I do not know why Apple doesn't automatically delete the old version. So now, I have two versions on my Mac.\nWhat's the best way to uninstall or delete the old version - should I just simply move it to Trash or use some uninstall application?\nWould there be any effect with my old iWork files if I delete the old iWork version?\n\nA: Since the apps have been rewritten, there have been some features missing from the new iWork that was in iWork '09. In addition, documents created with older iWork apps will be permanently updated to the new one, and the new files can remove certain features that existed in the documents created using iWork '09. Due to this, if you need to share files with people who are still on the old iWork that make use of such features, then you would need the old version of iWork to do this. This has brought about the opposite question…\nWhen opening one of my files that I created using the iWork '09 Pages in the new Pages, some things were broken:\n\niWork '09 can be uninstalled simply by deleting the iWork '09 folder, however for a more complete uninstallation you can use an app such as AppCleaner to remove the preference files and other associated files, however beware that using such an app will probably not be able to tell the difference between the two versions, so any settings that you have set in the new iWork apps will be deleted if you attempt to clean the associated files. If you installed iWork '09 through a retail CD, the app data is not sandboxed, and you can tell whether the data is related to iWork '09 or the new iWork by checking the location of the files - if they are in the sandbox, they are for the new iWork. Unfortunately, this doesn't work if you installed iWork '09 through the Mac App Store. If you don't care for your settings in the new iWork (i.e. you haven't run it yet) then there should be no problems running AppCleaner since there should be no preference files for the new iWork yet.\n\nA: To clarify the issue of deleting old versions of Pages and retaining only Pages 5 you need to be aware that Apple has removed over 110 features from Pages 5 and there are many bugs, some serious.\nYou can get rid of either version by simply dragging them to the Trash, but will lose the ability to access either the new Pages 5 format files, or have access to older version files and templates or .rtf or rtfd files.\nTo determine the consequences of keeping one version over another, read the \nRemoved and Altered lists from freeforum\nTo obtain greater compatibility with Pages on iOS, Pages 5 has a much smaller subset of the features in Pages '09. If you migrate your files to Pages 5 it will be simpler to transfer files back and forth from your iPad to your Mac, but there will be a large number of things you will not be able to do in the new format. \nThe new format has the additional problem of being unreadable if there is a problem with the file. It also has many problems when Exported to Word .doc/x and .pdfs. \nBecause Pages 5 only runs in Mavericks and iOS 7 there will also be problems swapping files with other Mac users, not just PC users. \nIn addition Pages 5 files, transferred by 3rd party servers such as GMail, DropBox and Amazon, are damaged because these servers do not understand the special zipped packages that Apple is using.\nYour choices are to go with Apple's new direction and accept the consequences, or stay with Pages '09 which works exactly as it always has, even in Mavericks, or look for current alternatives such as LibreOffice [free] or NisusWriter. \nThere are other alternatives arriving early next year, which will give more choices for low cost DTP users, but it will be difficult to match Pages' meld of DTP, Word Processing and Spreadsheet.\nI along with most of the experienced support people in Apples Pages forums are choosing to keep using Pages '09, whilst keeping a copy of Pages 5 on our Macs. We are keeping an eye on developments with LibreOffice and alternative DTP software from Serif Software.\nApple will not be altering course and has only made minor corrections to Pages 5 in the year since it was launched. Users will simply have to wait to see what develops, but can carry on using the more functional and reliable Pages '09 until Apple no longer supports it in a future OSX or iOS.\n\"Will I be able to read my files in the future?\". Unfortunately the record shows that if you are using any version of Pages you will have progressively more problems. then ultimately reach a point where Apple will no longer support the file format, and dead end it. Probably without warning as it has done previously and in particular with the current version last October.\n", "Q: Mysterious \"Staff\" account on my school laptop There's a account named staff, which I discovered had read permission on my home folder, when I did Get Info on it for an unrelated purpose.

What's the idea here and why is there a second keychain in addition to my login keychain?\n\nA: If you mean the keychain that is called Local Items in the U.S. English locale, I think it is used for keychain items that are eligible to be synced with iCloud Keychain.\nFrom http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/5/:\n\nIf the iCloud Keychain is subsequently disabled, the iCloud keychain highlighted in the screenshot above is replaced with a \"Local Items\" keychain that has the same contents as the iCloud keychain. Any items added to the Local Items keychain will be pushed out to other devices when iCloud Keychain is re-enabled.\n\nI have never enabled iCloud Keychain, but I also have a Local Items keychain. It contains about half of the keychain items from my login keychain, or mostly web form passwords. The Local Items keychain does not seem to correspond to any file and it cannot be deleted.\n\nA: There is a difference between the local items keychain and login keychain. Make sure to pay attention to this fine detail when an error message pops up. \nIf you have a local item keychain issue, here is what I did to resolve my issue that nothing else would fix.\nThe name of the folder it gives is not the name that will be in there, mine only had one folder. I had then move it to the desktop and restart after that another one replaced it. Then I had them delete the folder that I moved, restarted again and everything was fixed and no longer a million boxes popped up, asking for a local item keychain...\n\nA: Although the \"Local Items\" keychain cannot deleted, you can delete individual items stored in it.\n", "Q: Are there any improvements in the Mavericks Terminal app? Most OS X updates have included a few tweaks to the Terminal app. I know that Mavericks has upgraded a lot of command-line tools, but I haven't seen any reports of changes in Terminal.app itself.

There is a very long discussion stream on the Apple forums about this particularly minor seeming but very annoying phenomena. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be any applicable, actionable solutions except to wait several days for the apps to go away. The \"OPEN\" just sits there.\n\nA: To remove from my updates page I merely went to Settings, under Date and Time and toggled off Set automatically and changed the date and time a few weeks ahead. You can change the settings back after checking your app page to see that they're gone. It works!\n", "Q: How do you enable MouseKeys without using the mouse? Recently, I had to shut down a Mac with no mouse and only a PC keyboard with no Eject key.  (Incidentally, there are several solutions to that puzzle, and the one I settled on was to use the Terminal.) But as I first approached the problem, I thought: There is some universal access feature there to help if one can't use the mouse, isn't there? Yes: MouseKeys.  However, this nice page with the keyboard shortcuts for MouseKeys in Lion suggests that you have to enable a checkbox in a System Preferences pane before you can use it. So, how do you enable MouseKeys without using a mouse?\n\nA: You can use the same menus and buttons you would if you were turning on MouseKeys using the mouse, but using them from the keyboard instead. There are a lot of standard keyboard shortcuts that you can use to navigate around without the mouse:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + F2 to go to the Apple menu\n\n*Arrow keys and Return to choose an item from the pull down menus\n\n*Ctrl + F7 to cycle through the sections of a window\n\n*Tab to cycle through the controls in a section, and Space to use the highlighted button or checkbox.\n\n\nThis guide from the BBC's site puts it all together.\n", "Q: Consistently slow and unreliable Wi-Fi everywhere I go. 2012 MBP I have a mid-2012 MacBook Pro. (13-inch, 8gb memory.) I work remotely and spend a lot of time working from coffee shops and other places with public Wi-fi.\nLately - for a couple of months now - I've noticed that I'm getting far more problems with Wi-fi connectivity than normal. My wi-fi connection will drop, I'll be unable to connect (\"A connection timeout occurred\") or the connection will be hopelessly slow.\nThis is happening so often, on so many different networks, that I'm starting to think that the problem is with my laptop and not with the coffee shops.\nHow would I even begin diagnosing this problem?

As far as I can remember, I only made two more changes. I can't say for sure which one of these helped, or if either them helped at all and maybe there was some other factor I'm forgetting, but they may be worth a try:\n\n\n*\n\n*I changed my DNS settings to use Google's Public DNS. I can't remember what they were previously, but I definitely remember playing around with my DNS settings a few months ago so this may have been the culprit.\n\n*I changed the automatic MU settings, following the instructions on this page.\nHopefully someone will find one or both of these to be helpful!\n\nA: After lots of fumbling I discovered that the wifi speed is inversely proportional to the CPU temperatures. I installed TG Pro and found that, without altering the internal fan speed or using external cooling, the CPU's would approach 200 F after about 30 min of on time. With TG Pro I was able to increase the internal fan speed (from the built in speed of 1299 rpm to 3392 rpm) and that reduced the CPU temps to 102 F and the wireless speed was my \"normal\" 75 mbps.\n", "Q: Purchased movies not available after first time played I have purchased a movie and 20 minutes watching, I was ejected. When I tried to play it again, it seemed like the purchase never happened. I was asked to buy or rent it. It seems like I am not the only one. \nIs there anyone who had the same issue and solved the problem ?\n\nA: Problem arises when I start my MacBook (Should be every computer that is connected to the same iTunes store account). If you avoid using it after the movie/documentary or anything else is streaming, you should not have the problem.\nThe solution is to sign out from your iTunes Store account and sign in, so rentals are restored. Just checking for rentals doesn't help.\n", "Q: Upgraded to 10.9, but it broke my Windows 8.1 Boot Camp partition! I just got Windows 8.1 set up via Boot Camp a couple days ago, and everything was working wonderfully.\nToday, I upgraded my Mac to OSX v10.9, as suggested by Apple. Nobody told me it would break my Boot Camp system!\nFirst, my Windows partition didn't even show up in the option-menu at boot, so I tried following the instructions here, which fixed the option-menu, but the system still won't load!\nWhen I tried to boot into Windows, it says it can't find the operating system! So somehow it seems that the 10.9 update is incompatible with previously-existing Boot Camp partitions.\nWhat can I do? I need my Windows partition for work!\n\nA: You could try to fix the MBR Table.\nI would recommend by using a Linux LiveCD or the rEFInd CD http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/index.html\nAlternatively, rEFInd can be installed on OS X so you also get a Partition Manager Tool. I used this tool once to fix my broken MBR Table.\nYou can find the install instructions for OS X here: rEFInd Install OS X\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: I have heard of this issue before.\nI fixed it with the windows 8.1 boot disc.

I just updated to Mac Maverick and updated Pages.\nThe question is I just can't get used to it, I don't the exact words to describe it.\nIn the past, when in the Full Screen modem, I am typing in floating whiteboard in the whole darkness, which is awesome.\nHow can I do that in the newest version of Pages now?\n\nA: First, click on \"Setup\" to toggle the Setup pane off (if it is on).  Then two finger click on the toolbar, and select \"Hide Toolbar\".\n", "Q: Apple Treats Transparent Images as a Black Background I use Skype and I'm trying to upload a profile image from an iOS device that has a transparent background. Every time I save the image to any iOS device, the transparent background turns black :-/ I have the exact image I want on OSX Skype but it doesn't sync the profile picture across iOS devices. I've re downloaded the app but so far nothing's worked. Is anyone else experiencing this issue or knows how to solve it?\n\nA: Simply put, iOS uses the JPEG format when saving images to the Camera Roll, and JPEG does not have an alpha channel for transparency. When converting a PNG image to JPEG, all transparency data is lost. What is happening is the color 0x00000000 (RGBA - four octets) is being changed to 0x000000 (RGB - three octets).\n", "Q: What is that delay between a tap and cursor movement? I occasionally run Windows on my macbook.\nThere is an annoying problem with the touchpad.\nI click somewhere by tapping the touchpad, and then move the cursor, but the cursor movement will not respond until half second later.\nHowever, if I click the touchpad and then move cursor, there is no half second delay.\nIs this an intended behaviour? Is there a resolution?\n\nA: In essence, this is due to poor drivers in Windows. The Mac drivers have been created better than those in Windows.\n\nThe problem is created because the trackpad is waiting for the possible second tap to indicate a double-click. In OS X, the drivers are simply 'smarter' and understand better when you intend to double click or click and move.\nIndeed, actually clicking the trackpad then moving is instantaneous since the physical difference between a click and the cursor movement means that it can distinguish between a double-click and a click and move much faster since it doesn't have to wait for that second click.\nSuch behaviour can be noticed if you put an old iPhone without multitasking next to an iPhone with multitasking, and press the home button on both. You should notice that even though the newer iPhone should be quicker, it's not. The older iPhone reacts quicker, since it doesn't care if the home button was pressed twice - the same action is carried out. Conversely, the newer iPhone must wait those extra few milliseconds to see if you press the home button a second time, indicating that you want something other than the app to close (you want the multitasking bar).\nWith careful timing, it is possible to notice a similar yet opposite effect in OS X to the one apparent in Windows. Whilst a tap-move in Windows causes the cursor to lag as you noticed, and the same behaviour in OS X doesn't cause any lag (the cursor moves immediately), you may notice that a tap-move-tap in OS X causes the cursor to 'snap' back to its original position (if the 'move' was small enough) since it predicts that you wanted to do a double-tap on the same spot. In Windows, a similar tap-move-tap is equally predicted as a double-tap, and to make you do this in the same spot, it prevents you from doing the 'move' for a split second. Two different methods for overcoming the same problem, yet one is considerably better than the other!\nWhilst I haven't tried it, Trackpad++ seems like something that should fix it by replacing the Boot Camp drivers with \"much better ones\"…\n\nA: The Apple Bootcamp drivers for Windows aren't great when you have one finger dragging enabled. I had this problem, switching it off fixed it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click Bootcamp tray icon and choose \"Bootcamp Control Panel\".\n\n*Click the \"Trackpad\" tab.\n\n*Uncheck \"Dragging\".\n\n", "Q: Change behavior of click on desktop Sometimes when I click on the desktop, Finder opens. How can I disable this in OS X 10.9?\nFor what it's worth, it was already happening in Mountain Lion.\n\nA: The reason is because you didn't exit that finder window last time you exited logged out or shut down your mac.\nIf not that then you have some form of malware on your computer\n", "Q: iCloud Keychain & Wireless I set up iCloud keychain on a Mavericks laptop and two iPhones. Passwords for Wireless networks are now synchronized among all the devices. So far so good.\nWhat is also synchronized is the option to automatically connect to a known network. If one of the devices sees an SSID and knows the credentials it automatically connects.\nThis was not the behavior with without iCloud sync: even if the password was known it was possible to tell a device not to connect automatically.\nThere are some networks where I would like my Mac to automatically connect but where I would like my iPhones not to.\nIs this possible or do I have to switch off the whole Keychain sync?\n\nA: Here is a repost of my suggestion from a similar thread, expanding on nelson's response. The advantage is that you do not need to disable iCloud Keychain globally to resolve this issue:\nI too was facing this problem and came up with a slightly more elegant workaround.\nIn the end, I deleted all of the relevant Wi-Fi networks from iCloud Keychain and used configuration profiles to install the network credentials on the desired devices instead.\nI have written a step by step guide for those not familiar with creating and installing .mobileconfig files for OSX & iOS.\nWe're going to create a config profile for each SSID and password combination and install those selectively on our devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Apple Configurator (free) from the Mac App Store.\n\n*Launch Configurator, proceed past first run screens.\n\n*Select the Supervise tab from top toolbar of the main application window.\n\n*Under All Devices > Settings > Profiles, click the '+' icon to create a new profile.\n\n*Under the General tab, give the profile a name, I suggest the same as your first Wi-Fi SSID.\n\n*On the left select Wi-Fi, click Configure.\n\n*Enter the SSID in the SSID field. From Security Type, select Any (Personal). \n\n*Enter the Wi-Fi password into the Password field.\n\n*Click Save.\n\n*Repeat steps 4-8 for your second and any other SSIDs.\n\n*Select each of your profiles one by one and click the share icon to export the profiles.\n\n\nNow that this is done, delete your SSID settings from iCloud keychain, e.g. on your Mac go to System Preferences > Network > Wi-Fi > Advanced and forget any of the SSIDs in question by selecting their names and clicking the '-' icon. \nKeychain sync should forget these networks across the board, but you may need to repeat this step on your iOS devices by selecting 'Forget this network' from the SSID settings if it auto-connects undesirably. YMMV.\nYou are now ready to install the profiles by double clicking, or by opening from an email attachment on any iOS devices, accepting all security warnings.\n\nA: Auto connect is setup in a device. If you go to your wireless option in iPhone, you can turn on or off \"Ask to Join Networks\".\nSo it is independent of your keychain sync.\n\nA: setup your Wi-Fi via iPhone Configuration Utility, I don't think profile will be sync\n", "Q: Phantom unread message in Mail.app I have a smart mailbox with only one rule: messages that are unread.\nRight now I have no unread messages in any of my acccounts, yet the smart mailbox shows a counter of 1.\nOpening the smart mailbox shows no messages (this is correct).

TL;DR: I have a Time Machine backup that I want to modify before running Migration Assistant, but when I try to delete a directory from it either with rm or unlink I get \"operation not permitted\". How can I mount it so I can make a change?\nThe reason I'm at this point:\nUpgrading my iMac from Mountain Lion to Mavericks went so badly that I eventually booted from a USB key, reformatted my hard drive, and re-installed.\nI have a Time Machine backup on a 3TB AirPort Time Capsule, but restoration was painfully slow (even over a wired network) so I gave up that as well.\nI copied the sparsebundle for the machine I'm trying to restore to an external FW800 disk and plugged it into my iMac. Started Migration Assistant, then ssh'd in and mounted the sparsebundle. At that point I was able to select it in Migration Assistant, select the account I want to restore, and begin the process. This took another ~20 hours before showing me the progress bar for ~30 minutes of copying.\nDuring the 20 hours I was able to run some dtraces over the ssh connection and ascertain that most of the time was spent picking through the files in /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems. I want to run Migration Assistant again to restore my applications - I figure it will be quicker than re-installing / re-licensing everything. In order to hopefully eliminate most of the 20 hour wait, I want to remove the gems directory before running MA.\nI (think I) know how hard linked directories work in TM backups. /Library has a different inode in the \"Latest\" backup, compared to the previous timestamp. /Library/Ruby has the same inode in both.

Does somebody knows a way to make them work again or an alternative for them?\n\nA: Both of those still work for me, but you do sometimes need to run defaults commands again after upgrading OS X. If you run the commands again, quit and reopen applications to apply the changes:\nkillall Dock Finder\n\n(If you also want to enable selecting text in Quick Look windows shown from other applications than Finder, you can use defaults write -g QLEnableTextSelection -bool true instead of defaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool true.)\n\nA: To create a stack on the Dock of recently-used apps I solved using Thinkertool (http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html) which allow to enable lot of hidden preferences including the stack of recently-used apps.\n", "Q: How to turn off \"Your SIM played a tone\" message on iPhone 4?

Before Mavericks it seems it was easy to make iTunes forget a device as per this question: Can you make iTunes forget a device?\nHowever according to this Apple support article Sync Services doesn't exist anymore in Mavericks\n\nNote: OS X Mavericks does not use Sync Services. Instead, Mavericks supports sharing your information using several network-based and cloud-based solutions. If you want to sync your information across multiple devices and computers, you should use one or more of these methods. These include iCloud, CardDAV servers, CalDAV servers, or servers that use the Exchange ActiveSync protocol.\n\nWhat is the new trick in Mavericks to make iTunes forget a device?\n\nA: It is not possible in Mavericks\nAt least 10.9.3 and down. Recently Apple brought back Sync Services in 10.9.3 however the resetsync.pl script is not in the Sync Services framework folder. Seeing how Apple brought back Sync Services without the script it seems unlikely that the script and reset functionality will return.\n\nA: iDevices are not linked to iTunes, but to a certain iTunes library. \nThe only thing iTunes remembers are device backups. These can be deleted from the iTunes preferences. So in oder to 'forget' a device, you can restore the device and sync it to another library, or create a new iTunes library.\nEDIT: Solution\nGo to settings > General > usage > Music, then swipe the text saying \"all music\" to the right in order to make the red 'delete' button appear. Tap this in order to remove all music of your device. Then connect to iTunes and sync. iTunes should now re-sync all of your music to your device solving the problem you have.

Selecting Macintosh Hard disk as the \"Startup Disk\" did not alter anything. Zapping PRAM did not fix. The system even could not restart to Safe Mode.\nI finally used the 7-days-ago Time Machine backup to restore the whole Macintosh hard disk. It finished successfully, but after selecting the language it boot again to recovery, and now \"Startup Disk\" application shows no disk to be selected.\nI am sure about the backup that was created in healthy condition. This situation is very rare on this Mac and I face this condition for the first time.\nDoes anybody have any suggestions?\n\nA: It sounds like the file system is damaged. Have you tried running Disk Utility, and selecting 'Repair Disk'?\nRestoring from Time Machine will not repair the file system. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro won't mount external hard drive I have been having this problem with a Macbook Pro late 2006 and a Macbook Pro early 2011.\nMacbook Pro refuses to mount an specific external hard drive or USB stick, after being able to do so with no problem before, and usually after the operating system disconnects it suddenly.\nThat particular external hard drive or USB stick is perfectly good since it works OK under linux.\nMBP would mount the drive month later when tried again.\nIt have happen with two external Western Digital Hardrives (myPassport) as well as with a Kingston USB stick.\nDisk Utility sees the drive but cannot mount it because it's \"incompatible\".\nMany people seem to be having this problem and no solution has been found.\nI cannot format the disk because that's where my backups are.\nAgain: a Linux box uses the drive with no problem. I don't have another mac at hand to try.\nNow I'm going to buy another external hard drive from Amazon.\nWhich brand and model should I buy in order not ti have this problem again?\n\nA: This seems like an issue with the chosen file system.\nWhat file system did you choose when formatting the hard drive? If it's not HFS(+), FAT in any fashion or NTFS you cannot read it on OS X without additional software. If it's Ext, you could go with Paragon's Ext for Mac (but it costs some bucks).\nIn future, best choose exFAT when formatting an external hard drive if you need to use it on different operating systems. It both allows rather large files (which is heavily limited in FAT32), but can be both read and written in all important operating systems.\n\nA: Agreed that it's a file system issue, but if the Mac was able to read and write to it in the past, the file system isn't incompatible with the Mac.\nThe file system may be damaged to the point where the Mac cannot decipher it anymore, but the Linux machine is more able to work around the damage. The sudden disconnection is also a symptom that the file system is damaged.\nWhich file system do you use on these disks? \n\nA: This could be an issue with corruption of the file system/directory structure on the disk.  \nA utility like Disk Warrior may be able to help you resurrect the directory structure and recover the files.\nHowever, given that this is your \"backup\" drive I would be concerned that the disk has become unreliable and would seek a new backup repository (as you mentioned buying a new disk, this is a good idea.)\nCan you recover the files under Linux?  If so this may be a cheaper alternative to consider.  Finding a way to back them up somewhere else in order to be able to test the disk or relocate the files to a new backup disk should be the first priority.\nIf you primarily are just trying to use the files under Mac, then HFS+ (Journaled) is the best choice since it is more robust than something like exFAT.  ext2 under linux would be an alternative as there are some solutions to read/write this filesystem under Mac as well.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try a utility like DiskWarrior to recover/rebuild the disk\nfilesystem.      Alternatively recover the files under Linux if you\ncan read them from there.\n\n*Get a new disk to use as a new/second backup disk\n\n*After copying/recover the original files you may want to reformat\nand test the original disk with something like a surface scan\n(TechTool can do this but is expensive, Scannersz Lite is a\npossible alternative.)\n\n\nUnfortunately a Verify/Repair under Disk Utility is not that thorough so it will not fully test the drive like you need.\nHere's an article on three popular disk tools in OS X \nhttp://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1620209\n\n\n*\n\n*Any disk will have a chance to fail over time and external disks are (usually) given harsher conditions.  That is not to suggest they can't be used for backup but if the data is really critical it's not unwise to keep redundant copies of those backups.\n\n*No one particular Brand/Model will guarantee this doesn't happen again.  You can check the different warranties available which suggests the manufacturer's belief in the reliability of a drive.\n\n*Some disks have 5 year warranties, 3 year or only 1 year.  Determine what reliability/price ratio you want to pay for the data you are backing up.  Also a refurbished drive will usually only have a 6 month warranty and wouldn't be recommended.\ngood luck!\n\nA: I had the same problem.  The HDD is NTFS, a 2TB WD MyPassport.  I was using it between a PC and a mac for a few months (just got a mac), and this last time I plugged it in to the iMac, it wouldn't mount, including from right clicking on it...

Mavericks' (and also Yosemite's) Activity Monitor shows a new diagram, the memory pressure. Sadly, its help text only vaguely explains what exactly it measures. How is memory pressure calculated?\n\nPicture creds go to this answer from a poll question on Mavericks' best new feature.\n\nA: Memory pressure isn't a simple gauge of percentage of memory free and seems to be a 0 to 100% graph. The sysctl value of vm.memory_pressure is calculated in relation to a computed target that tracks the ratio between free and inactive memory pages to the wired and active pages. The absolute counters are viewed using the vm_stat command line tool to inspect detailed allocation of virtual memory. Jonathan Levin has excellent documentation at http://newosxbook.com/articles/MemoryPressure.html covering both macOS and iOS virtual memory and how they calculate memory pressure as well as the actions taken when the pressure index is high.\nThe relevant virtual memory (vm) that feed the calculation of vm.memory_pressure are:\n\n\n*\n\n*vm.page_free_count - an absolute count of free pages\n\n*vm.vm_page_free_target - a calculated target or goal for a \"pressure free\" situation\n\n*vm.page_free_wanted - what the vm system would like to free to alleviate the current calculated pressure index\n\n\nSo - if you are tracking your memory pressure with Activity monitor (or my checking the sysctl values programmatically or at the command line shell) you would do well to look at these four values:\nsysctl -a vm | egrep \"page_free|pressure\"\n\nThere is a new command memory_pressure introduced with Mavericks and when I run it to drive the memory subsystem into a warning state - you can see the memory pressure increase into a yellow range.\n\nThe tool allocated about 4 GB of memory to the tool as the pressure graph increased steadily to this state where apparently the \"warning\" level is graphed: sudo memory_pressure -l warn. As you can see, the system before the pressure had 5.9 GB used and after was up to 7.99 GB used which doesn't even need to add up due to swapping and compression.\nAfter watching how vm_stat 15 showed the warning result in no measurable paging, I quit the tool (Control-C) and then re-ran the tool to make memory pressure critical: sudo memory_pressure -l critical\nI didn't let this run for more than a few minutes as paging was starting and once the tool said I had 5 GB of RAM paged to disk, I didn't want to fill my drive and quit the tool.\n\nYou can observe how rapidly the system freed RAM after the warning was ended and also how it ramped into \"red\" territory to show that the virtual memory system couldn't compress enough pages to avoid swapping to disk. My educated guess is red on the pressure indicates swapping and dramatic over-allocation and/or a time where the free pages are below the amount the system prefers and it's actively purging inactive pages and/or swapping pages expected to be used to swap. Similarly, the system rapidly recovers once the allocations are released and pressure is taken off the virtual memory system.\n\nA: To somewhat clarify and make that guess more accurate: memory pressure is a metric used by the kernel (xnu) with a dedicated thread called memory_status (previously known as Jetsam). This thread is responsible for detecting when the available RAM is low - which in OS X can force swapping, and in iOS kills the highest memory consuming app (as there is no swap). In Mavericks, the two OSes are closer together. Memorystatus issues a kernel note, which the Obj-C runtime eventually translates to an appDidReceiveLowMemoryWarning. Apps are supposed to purge unused or extraneous memory (for example, caches). Darwin's libC also purges memory automatically.\nThere is a specific (though undocumented) system call, vm_pressure_monitor (#296, if I remember correctly), which lets a client listen in on pressure events, and see how many physical pages can be reclaimed.\nYou can view pressure events on Mavericks using Process Explorer for OS X - downloadable from http://newosxbook.com/index.php?page=downloads. That both shows you the pressure \"gauge\", as well as pressure events.\n\nA: Memory pressure is defined by two counters Mach keeps internally: \n\n\n*\n\n*vm_page_free_count: How many pages of RAM are presently free \n\n*vm_page_free_target: How many pages of RAM, at a minimum, should optimally be free. \n\n\nYou can see these easily using sysctl:\nmorpheus@Zephyr (~/Documents) % sysctl -a vm | grep page_free\nvm.vm_page_free_target: 2000\nvm.page_free_wanted: 0\nvm.page_free_count: 73243\n\nif the amount of free pages falls below the target amount - we have a pressure situation.\n\nFrom http://newosxbook.com/articles/MemoryPressure.html\n", "Q: Can't sync contact & calendar to iOS 4.1 device since Mavericks update I just installed Mavericks. I have an old iPhone 3GS and it is running iOS 4.1.\nSince updating to Mavericks, iTunes syncs everything but Address Book and Calendar, however under OS X 10.8 everything was syncing fine.\nDo I need to do something special to make it sync above things?\nAm I the only one with the issue?\nAdditional information: It seems like there is no option in iTunes for contacts and calendar synchronization either. It is like it just disappeared. \n\nA: In order to sync contacts and calender, you have to use iCloud now. \nWith iTunes 11.1.2 and OS X Mavericks they(Apple) disabled the option to sync locally according this Document.\n\nNote:   These instructions apply only if you use OS X v.10.8.5 or earlier. If you use OS X Mavericks v.10.9 or later, your contacts, calendars, and other info are updated on your computers and iOS devices via iCloud. For more information, see iCloud Help at icloud.com.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. So I wrote a small open source app for myself, as a temporary workaround.\nIt's in the iOS AppStore now, for free:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/devicesync-for-ios/id737867459?mt=8\nPlease read the AppStore app description before using it!\nIn the current form it simply \"copies\" calendar entries from iOS to OS X, deleting calendar entries on OS X first.\nThus, be sure to add and update your calendar entries on iOS only!\nBut still, this works well enough for me.\nThree days ago, I pushed version 1.1 to the iOS AppStore, should be available sometime next week. It makes the \"sync\" time range configurable.\nAs time permits, I will add support for contact synchronization and improve merging behavior of calendar entries.\nYou have to get the corresponding OS X app from https://github.com/yep/DeviceSync-for-OS-X/releases\nPlease open the OS X app by holding the control (ctrl) key and then double-clicking the icon. For more information, see https://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290.\nThis app is open source and hence a collaborative effort.

I frequently see regions of the Dell screen glitched by wavy-jittery noise for a few seconds at a time. The size and location on the screen seems random, and is more frequent and noticeable some times than others. No glitches on the Mac screen. This has persisted through OS upgrade from Mountain Lion to Mavericks.\nWould using DVI instead of VGA fix this (worth the purchase of adapter)? Anything else?\n\nA: It could be the monitor, the cable or VRAM/ something else in your Mac going bad.  \nEasiest way to test would be to use the monitor on another computer or with another source (like DVI) and see if the problem persists.  Preferably with a different cable to limit things to the monitor.  \nIf you can borrow a DVI adaptor from a friend, that would be a cheap way to see if DVI would fix it (either by replacing VGA or perhaps the VGA port on the monitor is going bad - it happens).\nFinally if the monitor behaves with everything but your Mac, then it could be a hardware problem with your Mac.  Since your Air uses integrated graphics there is no dedicated VRAM - and since there is no problem with the native screen, the more I think about it, the more it sounds like it's probably a problem with the monitor itself.  \nUnfortunately there isn't an easy way to tell without doing some testing as suggested by others already.

Before Mavericks one could hold the ALT key and move a folder \"A\" onto a folder \"B\" where already an \"A\" existed. In this case Mac OS X asked in Lion if I want to merge - or on Mountain Lion if I want to keep both (which was also a merge).\nI can't find this option in Mavericks.\nDid Apple remove this useful feature?\nAny hints?\n(And yes: I own ForkLift, which can do it - I just sometimes still prefer the Finder).\n\nA: I just found this problem too.  I worked round it by using a simple command line cp -r command in Terminal. It's crazy that you can't do it in the GUI!\ncp -r ./srcFolder/ ./targetFolder/\n\n\nA: OK. I found out myself... Luckily Apple did not remove the Finder Merge functionality with Mavericks. But sometimes it is not offered to the user. But let me explain:\nSupose you have a folder named TARGET with a subfolder TARGET/SomeStuff. And you have a SomeStuff folder somewhere else. Now drag this second SomeStuff folder to the TARGET folder (without any modifier keys pressed) then the Finder will presented you the following dialog (Stop and Replace):\n\nSo, no merge here.\nNow - if you instead press the Alt key while you drop the SomeStuff folder to the TARGET folder there are two possibilities:\n1.) If the files in the two SomeStuff Folder have completely different (not overlapping) contents. In other words: no duplicate filenames. Then finder will give you these options (Stop, Merge & Replace All):\n\nSo, here you can merge. And the result will be a TARGET/SomeStuff folder with the content of both SomeStuff folders.\n2.) But here comes what is sometimes confusing (and actually made me think merging is gone in Mavericks): if there exists at least one filename that is contained in both SomeStuff folders, then merging is not possible. Then the finder will offer you these options (Don't Replace, Stop, Replace):\n\nSo, no merge possible, here too!\n\nA: Short answer\nUsing the command line (Terminal):\ncp -r -n ~/Desktop/src/* ~/Desktop/destination/\n\nThe command above adds the src content and the subdirectories to the destination without overwriting the content already present in the destination.\nLong answer\nEven if the content overlaps, you can still use cp to do it. Assume that you have two folders on your desktop: the src and the destination folders and you want to merge src into destination:\n\nTo merge, just do:\ncp -r ~/Desktop/src/* ~/Desktop/destination/\n\nNOTE When you use this, the content in src overwrites the content in the destination folder and adds the extra stuff that are missing in the destination. It shouldn't matter if you just want to add the missing files from src into destination.\nALSO it doesn't matter how many subdirectories are there, it will just go through each folder recursively and it will overwrite the content and will add the stuff that is missing in the destination folder.\nBUT\nPITFALL If you have huge files (like video files), you don't want to wait until everything is overwritten, it adds a lot of overhead.\nPITFALL SOLUTION: Instead, you can use the -n flag to skip the overwriting:\ncp -r -n ~/Desktop/src/* ~/Desktop/destination/\n\nThis is the description of the -n flag from the man page:\nman cp\n\n\n -n    Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any\n       previous -f or -i options.)\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5088332/overhead-of-a-flag-in-cp-command\n\nA: Having not found my answer above, I am compelled to redirect you to that other answer which rightly advices to use the ditto command:\n\nIn a Terminal, type: ditto from_folder destination_folder, for instance:\n   ditto ./srcFolder ./targetFolder\n\n\n\nA: For users who want an alternative GUI or fear terminal: here is a free App that I found that will merge folders for you.\nhttp://subrosasoft.com/software/freeware/macmerger\nDisclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with the company that makes the app.\nThe copywright is 2012. There is little feedback, but it seems to work fine.\n\nA: I found this from Apple Support (http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14224), you need to choose \"Keep newer\" to merge, works for me:\n\nMerge two folders\nIf you have two folders with identical names at two different locations, you can merge them into a single folder. To do so, you must copy (not move) one folder to the location that already contains a folder with the same name. In the dialog that appears, click Merge.\nThe Merge option appears only if one of the folders contains items that are not in the other folder. If the folders contain different versions of identically named files, the only options are Stop or Replace.\n\n", "Q: com.apple.iconServicesAgent using a lot of RAM in 10.9 I performed a fresh install of OS X 10.9 and now the process com.apple.iconServicesAgent is using >300MB of RAM, that is quite a lot. This process is using the second most amount of memory of all processes, after the kernel task.\nGoogle tells me that other people have this problem, too, but I found no solution so far. \nIs there any way to reduce the RAM consumption of this process?\n\nA: It seems to be something to do with the service that renders icons in Finder, when mine maxed out cpu no icons were rendering in finder.\nI force quit the process and reopened Finder and all seemed well again.\n\nA: Observations\nYou may observe natural rises and falls in usage. \nYou should not treat the usage as a problem. \nBackground: about icon services\nFor an idea of what's done by icon services (the com.apple.IconServices daemon, com.apple.IconServicesAgent processes and related files), run the following command in a Terminal window that's maybe 257 characters wide, or wider: \nsudo fs_usage -w -f filesys com.apple.IconServices | grep write\nThen in Finder: \n\n\n*\n\n*browse a folder that has not been browsed since you started the Mac\n\n*browse away\n\n*browse back to the same folder.\n\n\nYou should find that:\n\n\n*\n\n*the initial browse causes writes (to a cache)\n\n*second and subsequent browses cause no additional caching, for as long as the contents of the folder are unchanged. \n\n\nTo abort the command, Control-C\nFor an unfiltered view of things: \nsudo fs_usage -w -f filesys com.apple.IconServices\nBenefits of icon services in Mavericks\nIt seems to me that Apple's approach to caching icons is of particular benefit to apps/processes where primary functions include reading metadata from a variety of types of file system. Apps such as Finder, processes such as Dock, and so on. \nAs part of a broader approach to maximising performance, icon services should allow presentation with minimal delay of the subset of metadata that is of greatest interest to the user. \nFor the Recent Applications stack in Dock: probably names, icons and dates/times as essentials within a subset. \nFor views in Finder: subsets may be entirely different, depending on what's required by the user. \nAdditional thoughts\nIn HFS Plus (Mac OS Extended), with reference to retired documentation, we have the performance-oriented hot file B-tree, attributes file and so on. With everything else that has been done to that file system, it is now debatably over-extended. \nThe performance-related benefits of icon services should be relatively file system-agnostic. This is pleasing. I expect the benefits to be realised by users of ZFS on Mavericks, and so on …\n", "Q: sync calendar and contacts without iCloud in Mavericks How can I sync calender and contacts in Mavericks and iOS 7 without using iCloud (or any cloud for that matter)? Is the only option really to setup a CalDav and CardDav server in my local home WiFi network? If so, how do I do it? Will I be needing a dedicated machine for the server (I just have one iMac)? Will all my devices automatically be able to sync once they are connected to the local WiFi?

At first I didn't think it was working (which is how I found this thread) but after looking under \"Groups\" from within the Contacts app I saw that, for some reason, only one Group was selected. (Evidently this got switched during a recent upgrade. I'm still not sure.) After choosing All Groups and syncing, all my contacts are now showing up again!\nI am, however, having to use iCloud for Calendar syncing.\n\nA: There is a company which claims ( and we all know what the word\n\"claims\" can mean in the software world ) to be working on a \ncomplete sync utility which will work without iCloud.\nHere is a link to that company ( with which I have no affiliation).\nhttp://blog.eltima.com/2013/11/syncmate-5-is-coming-this-winter.html\nThere is some info on the product they claim will be released soon\nwhich will enable local sync of iOS devices.

Apple recommends not having the battery charged connected to the MacBook if the battery is 100%.\nIn other laptops I had, I could just remove the Battery and use it connected with the Battery Charger.\nHow do I do that with my MacBook Pro? Is there a way to take the battery out? Should I just unplug the Battery Charger and let the battery uncharge? \n\nA: There is no way to remove the bettery without losing the warranty for your Macbook. Simply unplug the battery charger should do the trick.\nIf you want further information on how to maintain battery life, Apple is providing a useful page.\n\nA: Every time we unplug the power, the Mac will start to discharge the battery. In this manner, the battery lifespan will shorten. \nThe answer would be to leave the charger on whenever possible, as the charger actually stops charging the battery once it is full.\nCheck this on your Mac: Click on Apple Icon > About This Mac > System Report > Power \nSee the \"Health Information:\" for cycle count and the following:\nAC Charger Information:  \n  Connected:    Yes \n  ...  \n  Charging: No \n\nHere's an article discussing it: Practical Tips For Taking Care of Your Mac's Battery\nI remember having read an article by Apply saying not to let the battery totally drain, as it will affect the battery lifespan. It's best to keep it around 50% and start charging whenever possible. This applies when not using the laptop for a long time - occasionally bring it out and charge it. \n\nA: The battery in the new MacBook Pro 13″ is not user-accessible. Only the models of MacBook Pro before 2009 had user-accessible batteries.\nThe simple answer is just to unplug the charger and let it discharge. There's not really any need to keep it plugged in, unless you are performing resource-intensive tasks where the battery would be discharged very quickly and the power would be disconnected and reconnected often.\n", "Q: Can I update to OS X Mavericks if I get a new graphics card? I have a 2006 Mac Pro and have been wanting to update to OS X Mavericks but I can't because I have a Radeon X1900 graphics card and that is not supported any more by Apple. I have OS X 10.6.8 running so I have the software to upgrade it but the question is can I update to Mavericks if I get a supported graphics card? Do you think there might be other issues that would prevent me from being to update?\nP.S. Yes my Mac Pro is 64-bit.\n\nA: Which model of Mac Pro do you have? If it really is a 2006 model, that sounds like a MacPro1,1, which isn't supported after Lion (10.7) as it has 32-bit EFI even though its CPU(s) are 64-bit. The fact that you have a Radeon X1900, which was an option on the 2006 model, suggests that you may well be out of luck when it comes to upgrading. \nMavericks system requirements are here - as you can see, only early 2008 and later Mac Pros are supported. That said, if you're that way inclined, there are ways of getting Mavericks (and Yosemite, in fact) working on unsupported machines - see this guide, for example, or this guide from LowEndMac. \nBasically, you need to use a modified EFI bootloader to boot the newer versions of the operating system. Should any of the earlier links expire, searching for \"Tiamo boot.efi\" should find an updated link. You will also need to replace your graphics card - newer versions of Mac OS no longer support the X1900.\nYou can confirm the exact model number by checking About this Mac -> More Info... and then verifying the Model Identifier. Basically\nUpdate 2015-08-3: Add further detail, add Yosemite detail\n", "Q: Restore the RAM pie chart dock icon which was removed in Mavericks? I configured Activity Monitor like this on all of my machines. I also set up my non-techie friends' Macs this way as well:\n\nIt was the best \"health snapshot\" for the Mac I'd figured out, and not hard to set up. I'd advise friends & clients to always make sure they \"see green\" when they're having system speed or responsiveness issues. \nAnd then, this was a great signal that either a RAM upgrade is called for, or some app is out of control.\nBut now, this option was removed in Mavericks. And it's extra annoying because Mavericks promises to use memory better on some laptops. And I was looking forward to seeing how the pie chart compares.\nDoes anyone know a way to (1) simply display this same chart, or even (2) set the Activity Monitor's dock icon to it?\n\nA: I have been using Menu Meters for a while and it works great with Mavericks:\n\n", "Q: What do the \"Energy Impact\" numbers displayed in the new OSX 10.9 mean and how are they calculated? I love the new energy tab in OSX 10.9 mostly because I love data about my machine.  I'm curious how the energy impact is calculated, and what the number represents.  \nIt seems clear from using the OS for a week that apps that are running more CUP/memory intense processes (for me: Mathematica and MATLAB) use more energy, or apps that can't take a nap (like listening to pandora in google chrome).  \nWhat isn't displayed are some of the bigger energy hogs on a portable: Display settings, WiFi, Bluetooth.  I'm wondering if some of this is wrapped into current apps (i.e., if i'm using safari or chrome full screen, will the display power be lumped into this app?) Do display preferences for the app change the energy being used (i.e., working in a text editor with a white-on black scheme instead of black-on white would theoretically use less energy to display).  \nIf these are percents, they do not sum to 100, which is a little annoying.\n\nA: I don't think you would want this numbers to be percentile and adding to 100 at any point because that would mean that your battery would die nearly instantaneously. \nIf I was to make an educated guess just to help you out a bit, your computer (specifically MacBooks) have their battery capacity measure in mAh or milli Ampere-hour typically somewhere in the ballpark of 6500 mAh or 6.5 Ampere-hour. I would hazard a guess (if the moderators allow it) that your are seeing the actual usage to the second of how many mA are going to the specific app per refresh (call time by the Activity Monitor daemon).\nSo if you were to add up the average power draw of your active apps and multiple that per second you would know how long your computer battery would last without power (roughly). Additionally you have to factor in what internal components are working hard (AirPort, Bluetooth, Display brightness, hard drive rotations) and you have yourself the estimated time until depletion.\nOh, and as to how they are calculated. There is a tiny integrated circuit on your main logic board called the SMC and it's job is to allocate DC current to the resource that needs it most. It keeps  track of energy usage and demands by the RAM, CPU, GPU, etc. so that it can help make sure your computer stays energy efficient.\n", "Q: Very slow OS responsiveness, excessive console error messages (1 per second) I have a Mac Mini OSX Mountain Lion (now Mavericks) with 8GB of ram. I am a software developer and don't run extremely intensive applications concurrently on the system or anything that should be TOO memory intensive...\nA few weeks ago I had an issue with the App Store doing an update of XCode. It took so long to simply click a button or even open the apple menu to restart. I once waited over 45 min for the Apple menu in the top left to open in order to shut down the computer properly...\nAnyways, I finally narrowed down the problem to only occurring when the App Store was open, and it was trying to install the update for XCode. I waited days to see if it would finally finish, but the bar never moved... I finally just deleted XCode off of my computer completely and re-installed. This seemed to speed up everything again, and I was back to normal.\nYesterday I encountered some similar issues with the App Store, but a simple restart helped correct the issue.\nOver the past few days I have noticed a major decline in performance and responsiveness.. Again I am not doing anything that should cause these slowdowns. It also takes a seemingly long time for the computer to go from off, to logged in and functional. I checked the Activity Monitor and everything seemed to be within normal limits, no odd readings, and the vast majority of my memory was not in use.\nToday I decided that I would take a deeper look into the system to try and see if I could find any reasons for the issues. I opened the Console and I have potentially found a clue. I am getting the error mDNSResponder[42]: ERROR: send_all(34) wrote -1 of 4 errno 32 (Broken pipe) at the rate of exactly 1 per second, every second. It never stops.\nCould this be a problem?

How would I go about doing that? I don't have an install disk...\n\nA: Problem was a bad hard drive, which should've been obvious, because it was slow getting things INTO memory, but CPU and RAM were nowhere near maxed out.

In both installations, my screen suddenly started displaying (I believe after screensaver or screen shut-off - the computer itself wasn't asleep) these artifacts on the bottom half of the screen (whose colors etc. change as things change on the rest of the screen).  I've attached a screenshot, which actually captures this.\nI tried suspending and resuming but the artifacts persisted.  I was able to make it go away by changing my display resolution.  Also, it just happened again, but this time the entire screen was garbled (unlike in the screenshot below)—I got very lucky in fumbling my way toward changing the screen res, otherwise I'd need to reboot the system.\nOnly software I have installed are VirtualBox (prime suspect), OSXFUSE/SSHFS, Tunnelblick, iTerm2, and Google Chrome.  I have uninstalled VirtualBox for now to see if the problem goes away, but unfortunately I need it for work.\nThis problem hadn't happened before upgrading to Mavericks.  Another issue, which may or may not be related, was that my system did entirely freeze up once yesterday some time after the upgrade (but before I had seen any screen garbling).  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n\nA: This looks like GPU failure/overheating. Try cooling your laptop and see if it still occurs. Maybe Mavericks has just tipped it 'over the edge' in terms of demands and caused a problem that was going to occur in the next couple of months.\n", "Q: Link iPhones contact list to GMail app instead of native mail app?

What can I do with it?\nI am using Macbook Air 2013.\n\nA: It could be a caching bug in 10.9.0. If you have not transferred any files to this computer from a another Mac (via Time Machine for example) then you should be okay.\nI doubt you have an actual hardware issue or limitation. If you were running a 2007 MacBook and you performed an upgrade I would expect this before due to the grandfathering of certain files/preferences/caches. \nIn a fresh system and new model your issue would not be tolerated by Apple. I would suggest submitting some feedback to Apple: http://www.apple.com/feedback/ and get them aware of this issue.\nIf this starts to show up in other apps or with other file types then it might be a good idea to go to an Apple Store or AASP and let them do a check on it.\n\nA: Thought I'd share this comment, since I believe this is the case. I am on a new MBP with HD Intel 4000 and I get the a strong blur on scroll. Doesn't matter if it's Safari or Activity Monitor. However, on iMac with Radeon 6970 the blur is much less noticeable.\n\"I've seen this type of effect on a number of systems and hardware. I think what the software does is create a lower resolution image of the page and uses tat to display when scrolling. This lower resolution image takes less calculation to show the movement of the scroll or zoom, and possibly allows free CPU timeto calculate and pre render what is about to appear in the scroll. When the movement is stopped, it'll then do a complete screen redraw at full resolution.\nThis type of procedure probably comes from mobile type devices where CPU resource can be limited and a balance struck between smoothness and image quality.\"\nSource: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1650687\nAuthor: fisha\nAlso, Apple made a statement about this:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TA27218?viewlocale=en_US \n", "Q: Some videos from YouTube can neither be played on my iPhone nor on the Apple TV Some videos from YouTube can neither be played on my iPhone nor on the Apple TV\nHey Guys, not sure what is going on betwee Apple and Google....nothing wrong with both hardwares and I tried on multiple other iPhones of my friends and it just doesn't work for some videos...not sure if there is a solution.\n\nA: When videos are recorded/saved, or in this case, uploaded to a video playback provider (youtube, vimeo, etc) the video is compressed into a code format for the computer. That compressed video is then decompressed on playback.\nThere are many different video compression formats out there, which is where the issue arises. Most mobile phones support less VCFs than a computer/computer browser does, so compatibility is the problem. \nEvery mobile phone supports H.264 (MPEG-4) which is saved as a .M4A extension, so that's typically what you'd want to save a video edit as. There are other VCFs that will work, but MPEG-4 is the most reliable\nUnfortunately, videos that aren't compressed into a format readable by a mobile OS will not be viewable. The only solution is if the video is recompressed into a new format and re-uploaded. \n", "Q: Fink help!! Not installing in Mavericks! I just installed OS X Mavericks on my Mac.\nNow I'm trying to install Fink via the instructions here\nI have gone up to this line command:\n./bootstrap\n\nBut after that I am not able to run this line command:\n/sw/bin/pathsetup.sh\n\n... because there is no bin directory under sw.\nIs it perhaps because of Mavericks (the instructions have not been updated for Mavericks because it is so new).\nWhat can I do to fix it? (Paging Fink experts.)\n\nA: You didn't specify the version of fink you are using, but according to the Fink Announcement mailing list\n\nNote: be advised that fink-0.35.2 does NOT work for OS 10.9.  If you are \n  testing on 10.9 prior to the official release date, you will want to \n  grab an archive from https://github.com/fink/fink/tree/Futureproof2\n\nAnd in the Fink Beginners mailing list\n\nWe've added support for 10.9 into the master branch of the github \n  repository (https://github.com/fink/fink).  Folks that were using the \n  \"Futureproof2\" feature branch may want to update their git checkouts \n  appropriately to pick up changes that get made after the merge and \n  before we do a release.\nSome other notes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*There is no 10.9 support in any released fink, version 0.35.2 or \n  earlier.  (The first 10.9 support release version will probably be 0.36.0)\n  \n*There is going to be no supported upgrade path from any earlier OS X. \n  The document /sw/share/doc/fink/INSTALL has information about how to \n  capture your list of installed packages.\n  \n\nUpdate\nOn October 31st, fink 0.36.0 was released which does support OS X 10.9.\n", "Q: Xcode Service: Do I need a separate Mac for OS X Server on Mavericks? I am an iOS developer and I want to implement continuous integration in Xcode.\nI have received the following email from Apple:\n\n\nAs an iOS developer, you can now take advantage of continuous integration in Xcode by creating bots with OS X Server for Mavericks that automate the process of building, analyzing, testing, and archiving your apps. As the bots do their work on the remote Mac, Xcode on your development machine displays the build and test reports. Bots can generate a regular release for your QA team, be configured to execute on every check-in, and even test your apps on connected iOS devices.\n\nI have downloaded OS X Server for Mavericks and its looks like an application. \nMy question is can I install OS X Server on my development iMac machine and implement continuous integration? Or do I have to have a separate Mac for OS X server to run Xcode Service?\n\nA: In short, you can, but it will hog up xcodebuild and force your Xcode into waiting. I used to use my development Mac to CI but now I have a dedicated virtual machine (on my VM host server) for that.\n\nA: The short answer is, yes, you can install OS X Server and the Xcode Service on your development iMac. You do not need another Mac for the server.\nIn detail, there are two parts to this question:\n1. Can you install OS X Server on your development Mac?\nYes, you can install OS X Server on your development iMac. You do not need another Mac for the server.\nFrom the time of OS X Lion, OS X Server is just another application you buy from the Mac App Store and install. You can install it on any Mac that already has the OS X client version.\nThe requirements to run OS X Mavericks Server are:\n\nMac computer running OS X Mavericks.\n2GB of memory.\n10GB of available disk space; some features require additional disk space.\n\n2. Can you install the Xcode Service on the development Mac (without using another Mac as a server)?\nYes, you can install the Xcode Service on your development Mac. The Xcode Continuous Integration Guide states (emphasis mine):\n\nNote: A continuous integration workflow typically relies on one or more development Mac computers running Xcode and on a separate server running the Xcode service. However, you can install OS X Server and run the Xcode service on your development Mac. Such a configuration can be helpful for evaluating how to adopt continuous integration. Afterward, you’ll find it more useful to have a dedicated server running the Xcode service, hosting your repositories, and remotely performing integrations.\n\n", "Q: How do I know when an iPhone was switched off?

Is there any way (or App) to know when was it switched off?\nI'm using iPhone 4s with iOS 7.0.3.\n\nA: There is no way to easily find out when the phone powered off due to the battery dying. You can, however, get your battery life by charging it completely (till 100%), let it die, then charge to power it up and then going to Settings > General > Usage > Time since last full charge and adding up the times for Usage and Standby.\n", "Q: Deleting transferred purchases from iTunes cache I'm using a long-lived installation of MacOS X alongside with an iPhone and iPad.

I was just wondering about DND. It was my understanding that DND just silenced notifications (calls, texts, alerts, etc) system wide.\nI thought it just ensured that the screen does not light up and not audible notification is played, however it seems from my testing that when enabled DND actually cancels incoming calls, rather than just silencing the incoming call. Is this correct behavior?\n\nA: The iOS 7 description of Do Not Disturb states(accessible over Settings > Do Not Disturb)\n\nWhen Do Not Disturb is enabled calls and alerts that arrive while locked will be silenced, and a moon icon will appear in the status bar.\n\nSo DND should not cancel incoming calls.\nThis seems to be an ongoing problem/bug on the official apple forums.\n\nA: When Do not disturb is on, the incoming calls won't be shown but only as a missed call.\n\nA: Report it at https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html as bug Report and Apple should work on it.\n", "Q: Why does my OS X still run older php even though I updated it?

Personally I think CommandShiftD or CommandOptionD would be nice.\nWhen I choose for the latter nothing happens in the preferences 'Keyboard' window and my Dock hides. I expected this behavior but OSX gives me no notice of it, I might just have activated something else without knowing it.\nWhen I choose for the first, it looks like it just works as aspected, my key combination gets set. But when I use the shortcut in Safari on a selected word, the page is suddenly added to my reading list (as CommandShiftD is the default keystroke to do so) and the dictionary does not open as expected. \nThis behavior leeds me to two problems about what do I need to know for setting key combination shortcuts.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to see what key combination is already taken, and for what purpose?\n\n\nAs M-K describes the apple manual states yellow warning triangle appears when a short-cut is already taken, but as the screenshots show this is not the case in OS X 10.9 Mavericks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a key combination convention or rule for the different modifier keys? What key would be appropriate for what task? (e.g. when would I choose for Command or Shift or Option or Ctrl) or one of the function keys) \n\n\n\nBelow is my example of two different scripts (Run in Terminal and Launch Terminal) with the same keystroke (CommandF19) to activate them and no error\n\n\nA: 1. Is there a way to see what key combination is already taken, and for what purpose? \nYou can see if there is a conflict with your chosen shortcut. From \"If a keyboard shortcut doesn’t work\":\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, and then click Keyboard.\n  \n*Click Keyboard Shortcuts. A yellow warning triangle appears next to conflicting keyboard shortcuts.\n  \n\n\n2. Is there a key combination convention or rule for the different modifier keys? What key would be appropriate for what task? (e.g. when would I choose Command or Shift or Option or Ctrl or one of the function keys) \nFor dictionary lookups, Apple has already defined Ctrl+Cmd+D as \"Display the definition of the selected word in the Dictionary app.\"\nThe OS X Human Interface Guidelines on Keyboard Shortcuts states the following about when to use these modifier keys and for what purposes. The recommended priority is to use Cmd frequently, use Option sparingly, avoid using Ctrl and use Shift for complementary functions of a common command (of course, you may observe that in certain instances Apple does not follow these guidelines).\nQuote from the Keyboard Shortcuts page:\n\nAs much as possible, use the Command key as the main modifier key in a keyboard shortcut. For example, Command-P uses Command to modify the P key. For a command that complements another more common command, you can add Shift to the shortcut. For example, the shortcut for the complementary Page Setup command adds Shift to the shortcut for Print to give Shift-Command-P.\nUse the Option key sparingly. If there’s a third, less common command that’s related to a pair of commands that use Command and Shift-Command, you can use Option-Command for the third command’s keyboard equivalent. Use combinations like these very rarely. You can also use Option for a keyboard shortcut that’s a convenience or power-user feature. For example, the Finder uses Option-Command-W for Close All Windows and Option-Command-M for Minimize All Windows.\nAs much as possible, avoid using the Control key. Because the Control key is already used by some of the universal access features—as well as in Cocoa text fields where Emacs-style key bindings are often used—it should be used as a modifier key only when necessary.\nList multiple modifier keys in the correct order. If you use more than one modifier key in a shortcut, always list them in this order: Control, Option, Shift, Command.\n\n", "Q: DST adjustment error in iOS 7 Weather app?

So this is probably triggered by something in my user profile.\n\n*The Apple Crash Report shows the main thread as having crashed on a SIGSEGV:\n\nCrashed Thread:  0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n\nException Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x00000000bff45000\n\nVM Regions Near 0xbff45000:\n    Stack                  00000000bf745000-00000000bff45000 [ 8192K] rw-/rwx SM=COW  \n--> \n    CG shared images       00000000c0003000-00000000c000b000 [   32K] r--/r-- SM=SHM  \n\nThread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\n0   y         0x012a1073 wdGetApplicationObject + 8790819\n1   y         0x00790079 wdCommandDispatch + 1425369\n2   ???       0x89fffffe 0 + 2315255806\n\n\n\nA: I have several Machines which run MS Office 2011 perfectly fine with Mavericks. I would suspect some corrupt settings or cache is the reason for your problem. Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*try moving the Folder \"~/Documents/Microsoft-User Data\" somewhere else (f.e. the Desktop) and try starting Word\n\n*try moving the folder \"~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office\" somewhere else (f.e. the Desktop) and try starting Word\n\n\nIn both cases the Folder will be recreated with default settings, so if Word starts without problem again you know the source of your problems. If not you can delete the newly created folders and replace them with your previous one.\nPlease try that and post some feedback. \nUpdate by asker: removing the above folders didn't help ... but removing ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.microsoft.Word.savedState did.\n\nA: I fixed the exact same error by opening a blank document, opening Word->Preferences, clicking track changes and unchecking \"Use balloons to display changes\" - the error is gone and all files open without crashing again.\n\n\nA: I seem to have isolated the problem to Word documents that contain comments.\nI removed comments using Word in Windows.  After that, the document opened just fine in Mavericks.  \nBut: adding comments to a Word document crashes Word, see Mavericks: MS Word crashing on documents with comments\n\nA: Have not found a solution, but two temporary fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The suggestion from \"sigurdurfromnew york\", also reported here on Dec 14 by Maron Kristofersson, to uncheck Preferences > Track Changes > Use balloons to display changes.\n\n*Since I prefer using the balloons to indicate changes in my documents, I kept on searching. After verifying that the problem did not persist when firing Word up while logged in as a Guest User (after first activating such a user in System Preferences > Users & Groups), I narrowed the relevant difference between my user and the Guest User to be this:\nUnder System Preferences > Languages & Region, my preferred language is Icelandic (Íslenska), but the Guest User defaults to English. This turned out to be the key to the second temporary fix: Changing to English as as a preferred language means that Word no longer crashes when I delete text with Track Changes and balloons turned on.\nTo mitigate the hassle of having English as a preferred language I also chose Icelandic under System Preferences > Languages & Region > List sort order. This did not cause the problem to reappear.\nSo, now I am just waiting for an OS or Word fix so that I can get my Icelandic date formats back.\n\nA: To resolve this for me, I opened Word again, then when the error reporting message appeared, on the microsoft error reporting app's menu bar I selected preferences, then unticked a box to disable microsoft error reporting.\nIt worked immediately, I didn't need to log out or restart! Yay, no errors on closing. Word, Excel and PowerPoint are now working. i hope it stays fine and I hope this helps you.\n\nA: I had the problem of Word crashing after updating to Maverics.\nI tried every solution mentioned here and on other threads. I finally threw out everything Microsoft or Office from both Librarys and Application Support.Restarted and installed Office11 again. Before starting anything I opened Office Error reporting and disabled as mentioned here and in FontBook restored standard fonts. \nEverything seems to be working fine. \n", "Q: How can I remove a VPN service when the remove button is disabled? I added a VPN config. Now I want to remove it, but the - button is gray and disabled.\n\nI checked some answers from this Apple Support Communities thread:\n\nIn Terminal: networksetup -listallnetworkservices\n  In Terminal: networksetup -removenetworkservice networkservice\n  In Terminal: networksetup -listallnetworkservices \n\n…but I cannot remove all.    \nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: Some VPN interfaces must be removed from the VPN Profiles system preference, instead of the Network Interface system preference:\nSystem Preference > Profiles > Select VPN profile > Remove.\n\n\n\nA: You can manually delete the service by removing it from the relevant preferences file.\nMake sure System Preferences and any other software that may attempt to switch network locations is quit before beginning.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of the preferences file.\ncd /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\nsudo cp preferences.plist preferences.plist.old\n\n\n*Give yourself permission to the preference file.\nsudo chown $USER preferences.plist\nsudo chmod u+w preferences.plist\n\n\n*Open the preference file. I will use Xcode to open the file.\nopen preferences.plist\n\n\n*Use ⌘F to open Find, and search for the name of your VPN service.\n\n\n*The name of your VPN should be shown in a UserDefinedName key.\n\n\n*Select the ID of the network service above the search result.\nIn this case, I would select the one beginning CD2362…\n\n\n*Use ⌫ backspace to delete the entire dictionary. Make sure that the only data that is deleted is this dictionary and its contents, not any of the other dictionaries.\n\n*Save the file and reboot.\n\nA: In macOS X Sierra after coming across https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3828655?tstart=0 I was able to delete a VPN item that had a greyed out \"-\" button, even thought I had deleted the \"Profile\" it was associated with. I did so by the following commands:\n1: In terminal, networksetup -listallnetworkservices gives a list of the names of the services.\n2: In terminal, networksetup -removenetworkservice \"name of service in quotes\" will remove the desired service - the quotes are needed to take care of spaces and other fancy characters - they could be escaped with backslashes (\\) instead. This might be the bit that messed up the original author.\n3: In terminal networksetup -listallnetworkservices gives a list of the names of the services, hopefully showing that the undesired one is now gone.\n\nA: networksetup -removenetworkservice networkservice\nSHOULD be \"networkservice\"\nThe networkservice was the name of the VPN.\nFor the last one, If you cannot remove the network configuration because you get an error saying it is the only network service on ipv4, click the plus button to add another network configuration, and add one that would be on ipv4 such as 6 to 4, you can then use the terminal command to delete the configuration you were attempting to delete before, and remove the 6 to 4 using the minus button.\nSee: https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/19838/can-t-remove-vpn-network-service-created-by-configuration-profile\n\nA: Prior to Monterey the command was networksetup, which in Monterey became networkservices.\nYou need sudo to delete profiles of another user.\nAlso bear in mind that profiles installed unter another user are not visible in System Preferences.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to select Application \"quit unexpectedly\" dialog When encountering an application \"quit unexpectedly\" dialog box in OS X, sometimes the focus on that dialog box is lost. With only a keyboard, how does one restore focus back to that window? cmd+tab and similar do not work.\n(I've wondered this for YEARS. Any help is greatly appreciated.)\n\nA: Those windows are shown by the UserNotificationCenter process, so you can focus them by opening UserNotificationCenter with Alfred or Launchbar.\nIt is also possible to disable the crash report dialogs completely:\ndefaults write com.apple.CrashReporter DialogType none\n\nThis script can also be used to focus other windows shown by background processes:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with p in {\"UserNotificationCenter\", \"SecurityAgent\", \"CoreServicesUIAgent\"}\n        if exists process p then\n            tell process p\n                if windows is not {} then\n                    set frontmost to true\n                    exit repeat\n                end if\n            end tell\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nSecurityAgent shows password dialogs and CoreServicesUIAgent shows Gatekeeper and quarantine dialogs.\n\nA: You can use Voiceover to activate it - it's not exactly convenient, and binding a hotkey to an applescript is probably better, but this method works without any scripts or third-party tools. Voiceover needs to be enabled for this to work, but you can do that through the keyboard too if you're stuck. Once enabled, the following sequence allows you to activate system dialogs:\n\n\n*\n\n*switch voiceover on with cmd+F5\n\n*open Application Chooser by typing ctrl+option+F1 twice\n\n*navigate to System Dialogs using the arrow keys and press return (or the right arrow)\n\n*press the down arrow to select the dialog in question and hit return\n\n*switch voiceover off again with cmd+F5\n\nA: This dialog not only loses the focus easily. The dialog itself easily ends up buried under all the other windows !\nHere is a way to find this dialog :\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the key Exposé or F9. Exposé will show you all the windows, including the wanted dialog. \n\n*Look for the yellow dialog. \n\n*In Exposé, click the wanted dialog. If you prefer not to click, I think that this variant works too : putting the mouse over the dialog and then pressing Space or Return or Enter, or even just waiting for some time. \n\n\nTo navigate in Exposé with the keyboard, maybe the arrows or Tab work. If they do not work, try with full keyboard access enabled in the System Prefs.\n", "Q: Recovering files from Time Machine backup disk after wrong dd I made a horrible mistake: I ran dd on an external hard drive, that was the Time Machine backup storage, to make it bootable. After a few seconds I cancelled the command, but the hard drive is shaped as bootable image, and the backup folder is missing.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Sounds like you started to overwrite the drive. The data is probably still recoverable, but, as Graham said, you don't want to do anything to the drive until you attempt to recover the files.\nA few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*While I haven't used it, PhotoRec looks like a good option, if you are comfortable with the command line. Despite the name, it can recover all sorts of file types. It only reads the disk, so your data should be safe even if it is unable to recover it.\n\n*For a graphical (and more expensive option), Disk Drill has gotten good reviews. It's pricey at $89, but you can use a free version to preview what it would be able to recover.\n\n*If you're in the market for a general disk protection utility, Tech Tool Pro 7 has a data recovery mode. Also, you can set it up to monitor your drives going forward, which would protect against future errors.\n\n*DrDD won't completely solve your problem, but it is a graphical way of copying the raw data off your Time Machine drive. I'm not 100% sure that the above programs will be able to read from the copy, but if they can, it would give you another margin of safety. It's also designed to protect your data on failing hard drives, so it should be safe to use in your case.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I'm a big fan of Data Rescue for data recovery. If you have a little money to spend, it's one of the best tools for the job.\nIf you have a little more money to spend, Drive Savers may be able to help.\n\nA: Recovering a few files (or even most of them) in a backup does you no good. It's no longer a backup. I wouldn't even attempt to recover from this problem. Wipe the drive, let TM start backing up anew to it, and chalk this up as a lesson learned.\nIt's easy to keep Time Machine itself backed up. Just start a TM backup on a different disk, and occasionally swap the drives. The initial backup will still take a long time, but when you rotate back in a previous TM backup, TM only needs to copy what's new for that drive. If you can keep them both attached, TM will even do the rotation for you.\nI started doing that (keeping multiple TM backups) after losing a TM drive to hardware failure. Then I discovered it's really convenient for off-site backup. TM can bring a backup disk up to date much faster than the other backup solutions (SuperDuper, CarbonCopyCloner) can.\n", "Q: Adding Apps to \"Security & Privacy\" Settings (Automatically) I am looking for a way to automatically add applications to the \"Location Services\" and \"Accessibility\" (Mavericks only) lists in the \"Security & Privacy\" settings pane.\nOptimally I could just change some file (eg plist) to add applications to these lists. If that's not possible, there's maybe some terminal and/or AppleScript way to achieve that?\n\nA: Just found it. The settings are in one of these two files:\n\n\n*\n\n*System-wide settings: /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\n\n*Per user settings: ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\nThey are SQLite databases of the following form:\nsqlite> .schema access\nCREATE TABLE access (service TEXT NOT NULL, client TEXT NOT NULL, client_type INTEGER NOT NULL, allowed INTEGER NOT NULL, prompt_count INTEGER NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT key PRIMARY KEY (service, client, client_type));\n\nExample (MS Office and Address Book setting):\nsqlite> select * from access;\nkTCCServiceAddressBook|com.microsoft.Word|0|1|0\nkTCCServiceAddressBook|com.microsoft.Excel|0|1|0\nkTCCServiceAddressBook|com.microsoft.Powerpoint|0|1|0\n\nFor other services, just pick the correct service name (such as kTCCServiceAccessibility) and the application bundle ID and add it to the appropriate database.\n", "Q: How can I play a midi file from terminal? I'm looking for a most simple command line app (or an on-board tool on Mavericks I am not aware of) to play a midi file from the terminal. As plain as possible, something like play myfile.mid.\nContext: I'm playing around with midi in Python and I need something I can launch from a script. No GUI, no windows, just playback. It must be callable from the Python script to be accepted, but anything that works in terminal should be.\n\nA: You can use VLC with a non-interactive CLI interface with -I dummy:\n/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -I dummy file.mid vlc://quit\n\nTo enable midi support, go to Preferences > Show All > Input / Codecs > Audio codecs > Fluid Synth and set the soundfont to a file like the FluidSynth soundfont from http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php.\nEdit: midi support was removed from recent version of VLC. You can still use fluidsynth from the shell as described by TJ Luoma:\nbrew install fluidsynth\nwget http://www.schristiancollins.com/soundfonts/GeneralUser_GS_1.44-FluidSynth.zip\nunzip GeneralUser_GS_1.44-FluidSynth.zip\nmkdir -p /usr/local/share/fluidsynth\nmv GeneralUser\\ GS\\ 1.44\\ FluidSynth/GeneralUser\\ GS\\ FluidSynth\\ v1.44.sf2 /usr/local/share/fluidsynth\nfluidsynth -i /usr/local/share/fluidsynth/GeneralUser\\ GS\\ FluidSynth\\ v1.44.sf2 file.mid\n\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n$ brew install timidity\n$ timidity file.midi\n\n\nA: This turned out to be a more complicated problem than I originally expected.\nQuickTime X cannot play MIDI files, although QuickTime 7 could.\nAs far as I can tell that means that there is no \"built-in\" solution to playing MIDI files on Mac OS X (for example, afplay does not work). Therefore I believe that any solution will involve downloading and installing some other program.\nOption #1: Download and install QuickTime 7 which still works fine on Mavericks, and then you can play midi files by:\nopen -a QuickTime\\ Player\\ 7 /path/to/your/file.mid \n\nhowever that will only autoplay if the user has enabled that preference, which I believe is off by default.\nOption #2: Use FluidSynth\nTo install it, you have to be using either Fink, MacPorts, or (my recommendation) Homebrew. Once Homebrew is installed, type this in Terminal:\nbrew install fluidsynth\n\n(MacPorts' command would be sudo port install fluidsynth and Fink's would be fink install fluidsynth.)\nHowever, downloading fluidsynth only gets you part-way there. Then you need a \"SoundFont\" file, which I had never heard of before. There is information about them here\nI downloaded one from S. Christian Collins called \"GeneralUser\" which is free. The current version (as of 2013-11-27) is FluidSynth version 1.44. {If that direct link breaks in the future, use the previous link which will take you to the regular web page for GeneralUser.}\nOnce you have downloaded and unzipped that, you will have a series of files including \"GeneralUser GS FluidSynth v1.44.sf2\" (obviously the name may change in the future). I renamed that file and moved it to /usr/local/share/fluidsynth/generaluser.v.1.44.sf2.\nOnce the SoundFont file is place and fluidsynth is installed, you can play a midi by using this command:\nfluidsynth -i /usr/local/share/fluidsynth/generaluser.v.1.44.sf2 ~/Music/example.mid \n\nn.b. There are some (seemingly harmless) error messages which get displayed when you do that. If you want to suppress them use: \n(fluidsynth -i /usr/local/share/fluidsynth/generaluser.v.1.44.sf2 ~/Music/example.mid 2>&1) >/dev/null\n\ninstead.\nObviously I'm never going to remember all of that, so I made a zsh function called playmidi \nfunction playmidi {\n\n    SOUNDFONT='/usr/local/share/fluidsynth/generaluser.v.1.44.sf2'\n\n    if [ -e \"$SOUNDFONT\" ]\n    then \n\n        for i in \"$@\"\n        do \n            if [ -e \"$i\" ]\n            then\n                (fluidsynth -i \"$SOUNDFONT\" \"$i\"  2>&1) >/dev/null\n            else\n                echo \"[playmidi]: cannot find file at $i\"   \n                return 1\n            fi  \n        done \n    else\n            echo \"[playmidi]: SOUNDFONT file not found at $SOUNDFONT\"\n            return 1\n    fi  \n}\n\n(That should work for bash too I believe.)\nNow all I have to do is type:\nplaymidi example.mid \n\nand example.mid will play. \n\nA: According to this post on VLC's own forums Felix Paul Kuehne, the site admin, said \n\nHello, apparently, FluidSynth got lost in the compilation process for the last update. Be assured that it will be back in 2.1.2 very soon!\n\nSo for now either downgrade to vlc 2.0.9, or wait for vlc 2.1.2. This way, your existing solution will work as it used to.\n\nA: Not exactly the answer but there is a small app that can send midi data on the Mac OS X command line. It can also control basic GarageBand functions as well:\nhttp://www.bibiko.de/music/MIDImyAPP/\n\nA: To make things more convenient, you can wrap up TJ Luoma's answer in an AppleScript app:\non open inputFile\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        do script \"fluidsynth -i /usr/local/share/fluidsynth/generaluser.v.1.44.sf2 \" & (quoted form of POSIX path of inputFile as string)\n        activate\n    end tell\nend open\n\nYou can then select Get Info on a random .mid file, change \"Open with:\" to the AppleScript app, and press \"Change All...\" to make it the default way of opening .mid files. Now when you double-click on a MIDI file, it'll open up the Terminal window and play it automatically.\n\nA: The following python3 script will use macOS's CoreMIDI to play any MIDI files supplied as arguments on the command line.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom AVFoundation import AVMIDIPlayer\nfrom Foundation import NSURL\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndef myCompletionHandler():\n    return\n\ndef playMIDIFile(filepath):\n    midiFile = NSURL.fileURLWithPath_(filepath)\n    midiPlayer, error = AVMIDIPlayer.alloc().initWithContentsOfURL_soundBankURL_error_(midiFile, None, None)\n    if error:\n        print (error)\n        sys.exit(1)\n    MIDItime = midiPlayer.duration()\n    midiPlayer.prepareToPlay()\n    midiPlayer.play_(myCompletionHandler)\n    if not midiPlayer.isPlaying:\n        midiPlayer.stop()\n    else:\n        time.sleep(MIDItime)\n    return  \n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    for filename in sys.argv[1:]:\n        playMIDIFile(filename)\n\nHere's a Swift script which will also play MIDI files given as arguments.

Is it possible to crop multiple pages or image files in the new Mavericks Preview application just as described in this answer?\nThe functionality was there with Snow Leopard but disappeared in Mountain Lion.\n\nA: This is only possible when editing a pdf. It isn't possible to apply a single crop to many images that are in separate files. In order to do this, one way would be to \n\n\n*\n\n*Combine the images into a single pdf \n\n\n*\n\n*Open all of them in a single window. \n\n*Use \"Print\" then \"Save as pdf.\" \n\n\n*Use the technique described in the other answer to crop all pages of the resultant pdf.\n\n*Split the images back out into separate files using a variety of techniques, such as Automator's \"Render PDF Pages as Images\" function, or on the command line using ImageMagick as described here. \n\n\nNote: if you're willing to use the command line, you might just want to use ImageMagick directly to crop all of the images.\n\nA: Yes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a PDF.\n\n*If not already enabled, View → Thumbnails.\n\n*Select some pages (click first then select all; command+click or shift+click)\n\n*Use the rectangle tool to select region on page.

After upgrading to OS X 10.9 Mavericks, the System Preferences app occasionally opens itself to \"Security & Privacy\", with \"Accessibility\" selected.\n\nMy guess is that one of the apps listed there really wants to be enabled. But I'm hesitant to do so unless I know what level of \"control\" they are granted. The fact that it's listed as an \"Accessibility\" option is particularly weird.\nWhat permissions would I be giving to an application if I enabled their control on the accessibility list?\n\nA: In essence, the 'assistive devices' feature gives apps the ability to control other apps. It was intended to give assistive applications the ability to read the screen and process information for other methods of interaction, such as VoiceOver or braille readers. However, other apps use the same feature to 'plug in' to other apps.\nFor example, Steam uses this feature to provide the Steam Overlay on top of games. Apps requiring AppleScript integration also require this feature, as well as apps that want the ability to press buttons in other apps. This would allow assistive apps to press buttons in apps per voice commands or other input, however it could also potentially allow apps to press buttons without your consent.\nIt doesn't give apps any more access to your data than the app would already have, however there's nothing stopping it from giving itself access to your data by clicking the relevant buttons in the GUI (i.e. opening Get Info and adjusting the file permissions). Despite all this, it would still require that you enter your password.\nIn conclusion, it simply allows apps to press buttons in other apps and read data from other apps.\n", "Q: Mount Shared Drive via AFP in Terminal I want to mount an external drive, connected on computer A, to computer B.\nI am able to access and mount the drive by connecting to the server through Finder (Command-K), but how can I do this exact action through the terminal? I've been using several formats of mount and mount_afp but nothing seems to work. Something along the lines of:\nmount_afp -i afp://user:pass@ipaddress/Volumes/SharedDrive /Volumes/Shared\n\nIn Finder, I just type the IP of the Mac connected to the drive, input credentials, and mount the selected drive...but it's not working by simply entering the afp://ipaddress, just like the 'Connect Server' command through Finder, in the terminal.\nHow do I do the same connection with a bash command? The end result will be the mounted drive on B.\n\nA: Try:\nsudo mount -t afp afp://user:pass@ipaddress/user /Volumes/Shared\n\n\nA: A couple of things you need to be aware of.\nFirst - the AFP URL needs to contain the name of the share - not it's location on the server. Second, the mount point must be an empty directory that you have write permission to. So your commands might be :-\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/mount\nsudo mount -t afp afp://user:pass@ipaddress/SharedDrive /Volumes/mount\n\n\nA: After some trial and error, I believe I've found a technique that works. First, the mount point must be created with the current user having permission to it:\n$ NAME=(name of remote volume)\n$ HOST=(hostname of server)\n$ MOUNT=/Volumes/$NAME\n$ sudo mkdir $MOUNT; sudo chown $USER $MOUNT\n\nThen, without sudo, create the mount point using afp_mount:\n$ mount_afp -o quarantine afp://$USER@$HOST._afpovertcp._tcp.local/$NAME $MOUNT\n\nIn my experience, this created the mount with properties identical to those created by the UI and did not require passing a password (so was able to re-use credentials already saved in the session).\nSince I use the xonsh shell, I wrote this routine for my profile script to automate this step:\ndef connect_share(name, host='myserver'):\n    username = $USER\n    mount = f'/Volumes/{name}'\n    sudo mkdir @(mount)\n    sudo chown $USER @(mount)\n    url = f'afp://{username}@{host}._afpovertcp._tcp.local/{name}'\n    mount_afp -o quarantine @(url) @(mount)\n\n\nA: See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/171822/154516 and comments for:\nopen smb://<user>:<password>@server/<Volume>\n\n", "Q: PostgreSQL causing slow shutdowns with OS X Server in Mavericks I've found that on OS X Server in Mavericks, the PostgreSQL processes are causing shutdown delays. During a verbose shutdown, I get the following (shortened) output:\ncom.apple.launchd                      System: Still alive with 1/7 (normal/anonymous) children.\n*.anonymous.pg_receivexlog             PID is still valid\n*.anonymous.postgres_real              PID is still valid\n*.anonymous.postgres_real              PID is still valid\n*.anonymous.Python                     PID is still valid\n*.anonymous.pg_receivexlog             PID is still valid\n*.anonymous.postgres_real              PID is still valid\ncom.apple.DeviceManagement.postgres    PID is still valid\n\nThe (*) is replaced by a random string, different for each item.\nI have no experience with PostgreSQL and I don't use any of the database-related OS X Server components (mainly Xcode and VPN) so I have no idea where to start.\n\nA: The com.apple.DeviceManagement.postgres line makes me think that this could be related to Profile Manager services. Does it show Profile Manager running in Server.app? If you're not utilizing this service, disabling it may help to stop the shutdown delays.\nAlternately, if you need to keep these services running, it may be worth looking at some log files somewhere (/var/log/system.log or /var/log/devicemgr/*?) to see if the profile manager service (or any others) are complaining.\n\nA: Any number of services on OS X Server use Postgres. On my server, for example, the Wiki uses it.\nWhile the server is still running try ps ax | grep postgres | less and you will probably see a number of processes, the first ones will almost certainly be some scripts that start Postgres and these should tell you where the logs are located - it will say something like -c log_directory=/Library/Server/Wiki/Logs You might also want to look at /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/bin/xpostgres which is the Python script that should be used to start Postgres by server services.\nThis will start you down the road to discovering your problem.\n", "Q: Why is Mavericks forcing a password reset on every lock screen? I just upgraded to Mavericks. Now, every time I wake it up from the lock screen or standby and proceed to type in my password it rejects it.\nTo get back in I have to select \"switch user\", then type in my username and the (same) password. Afterwards it requires me to set a new password and only then it lets me in.\nThis is, as you might imagine, very annoying. How can I get rid of this new security requirement?\n\nA: I figured it out. Somewhere during the upgrade process the password policy maxMinutesUntilChangePassword was set to 100. So every 100 minutes I had to reset the password...\nTo solve it I used the pwpolicy command:\npwpolicy -u \"MyUserName\" -setglobalpolicy \"maxMinutesUntilChangePassword=86400\"\n\n", "Q: Core Apps Not Launching After Installing OS X Mavericks I Installed OS X Mavericks about a week ago, It worked fine at first but all of a sudden no core Apps will load.\nMail, iCal, App Store, Maps, iMessage all quit and log a console message \"Exited with Code 1\" \nI have tried: rebooting, resetting the NVRAM, and booting my OS in safe mode.

It is during this where you can select to restore from backup, and since your device is on iOS 7, it will allow the backup to be restored.\n", "Q: Is installing Mavericks on Hackintosh legal? As we all know Mac OS X Mavericks is now free of charge officially! Does this mean that it is now legal to use Mavericks on non-Apple hardware?\n\nA: Who said it was free of charge? \nUpgrades to Mavericks are free to people who have paid for a qualifying version of OS X, typically by buying a Mac and perhaps any subsequent OS X upgrades. \n\nA: The license to run OS X hasn't changed significantly with Mavericks so if you were to run it on non-Apple hardware, you would be without a license according to most people that I've discussed this with.\nLegal gets more complicated as it depends heavily upon details about where you live, how you obtained the software, the laws in effect at the time someone decides to test legality and most importantly, the previous case law and perhaps the opinions/feelings/reasoning of the judge or judges that rule on one specific narrow case.\nLegal also could depend heavily upon what you did with the product. For instance, copying a painting for your personal pleasure and private display might not be as illegal as copying a painting to sell it for money or even if you gave it away, if you deprived the person who made the painting of their use and ability to control / sell their work, your use of their property could be legally problematic for you. \nHere are some things we know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple does not sell mavericks as a product. It accompanies current hardware purchases with a very limiting license clearly intending to prevent what you ask unless you live somewhere where that license is illegal.\n\n*Upgrade pricing to people that own a previous version of OS X doesn't involve money changing hands, but is also tied to the Mac App Store licensing process and terms. It also presumes you have a legitimate license to an older version of OS X.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*It is not in accordance with Apple's license to run OS X on a non-Apple hardware as per Apple's license agreement for OS X Mavericks. Since this question is not about a preinstalled version of OS X (which is only on new Macs), the Mac App Store License section is applicable, along with the Other Use Restrictions section that is common for both kinds of installations. The license agreement states (emphasis mine):\n\n2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.\nB. Mac App Store License. If you obtained a license for the Apple Software from the Mac App Store, then subject to the terms and conditions of this License and as permitted by the Mac App Store Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms and Conditions (http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/ww/) (“Usage Rules”), you are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license:\n  (i) to download, install, use and run for personal, non-commercial use, one (1) copy of the Apple Software directly on each Apple-branded computer running OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Lion or OS X Snow Leopard (“Mac Computer”) that you own or control;\n...\nH. Other Use Restrictions. The grants set forth in this License do not permit you to, and you agree not to, install, use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so.\n\nSee the SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR OS X MAVERICKS PDF for more details. You can also get to this agreement by going to the Software License Agreements page, then navigating to Operating System Software Tools and Server, and choosing OS X (Mavericks).\n\n*As an additional point, even though OS X Mavericks is free for Apple Mac users, it's only because Apple has changed how it accrues revenue from Mac hardware sales by adopting the subscription model (which has been in use for iOS devices for longer), wherein Apple defers accruing a portion of the revenue from Mac sales for providing software updates in the future (including free apps and such). Apple has defined this deferral as two years for iOS devices and four years for Macs. This is the only way for Apple to adhere to accounting laws in the U.S. Searching for \"apple subscription accounting\" on the web would yield many results on this topic.\nWhether using Apple's software in violation of Apple's license is illegal is a question with potentially different answers in different legal jurisdictions.\n\nA: Yes, It is legal. \nApple's EULA says not, but their license agreement is in violation of the Sherman Anti-trust act, voiding their end-user agreement (in reference to the DMCA). Nothing is at loss for Apple. Go ahead and install the software. \n", "Q: Windows Get Stuck in Top Left corner after upgrading to Mavericks I upgraded to Mavericks last week. I have a secondary monitor, and I use Spaces. Since the upgrade, I have a frequent problem where windows will get stuck partially exposed in the top left corner of the screen, under the finder bar. I can drag it to the right, but it automatically snaps back into the upper left.\nThe close, minimize, and zoom buttons are all off-screen. If the window is on my right monitor (which is the main display), the missing corner doesn't show up on my left monitor.\nIf I zoom (maximize) the window using a keyboard shortcut or the Window menu in the Finder bar, the window simply disappears off of my screen, seeming to slide upward, even though I have no spaces or displays \"above\" the one I'm working in.\n\nIf I go to Mission Control (Ctrl + Up), then the window appears there as partially out of the space.\n\nThis has happened to three separate applications so far (Chrome, Outlook, and Remote Desktop), so I'm pretty sure it's not application-specific.\nIf I quit the application (sometimes I have to force quit), the problem goes away, but it keeps happening. It seems to occur when I switch to the application after working in another.\n\nA: There is a way to get the windows back to normal without quitting the app, but it's not ideal.\nIf you move the dock, the applications will move back into place, the easiest way is to click the  and go to dock, then change the position, then repeat to put it back to where you had it originally.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/23766770#23766770\n", "Q: Shortcut used by another action/reboot breaks shortcut I think this is a bug, but perhaps it is a unique problem to me for some reason.  I really like independent display switching in Mavericks, and I set it up in what I guess is a unique way.  I have two monitors with 4 displays each.  Displays 1&5 are activated by the same keyboard shortcut ctrl-1.  All the other displays are activated individually with ctrl-2 through ctrl-7.  This worked really well and I liked it until I rebooted.  Then, it broke.\nAfter rebooting, ctrl-1 still activates display 1, but not display 5.  I figured this was not an intended usage, and so I fixed the keyboard shortcut so that display 5 was activated by a different shortcut.  However, the shortcut for display 5 is completely broken until another reboot, regardless of what key is is set to.\nWhat I want is for this to work the way I want - to support one shortcut key for multiple displays.  I do not expect to get that, unless someone knows of a good utility or plug in that will create that behavior.\n\nA: As I thought about it this morning, I realized I could get this functionality pretty simply - with a macro.  An automator script, as a service, was bound to the ctrl-1.  The spaces were moved to option-1.  The service takes no input, and here is the script:\non run\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 18 using {option down}\n        key code 23 using {option down}\n    end tell\n    return \"success\"\nend run\n\nA list of key codes can be found here: How do I automate a key press in AppleScript?\n", "Q: How can I install iOS 7 on my 4th gen iPod touch?

Is it possible to use a Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt cable to connect a new-generation iPad with a new-generation MacBook Air so that the iPad can be used as a 2nd monitor?\n\nA: No, the iPad doesn't have thunderbolt, nor the capacity to function as a screen for another device by any cable.\nYou could use your iPad as an external display over the network though (remember your Macbook can create a network if you don't have one), there are quite a few apps that do this,\n\nA: The app Duet Display allows you to use any iOS device as an external display and your Mac is running at least OS 10.9.

I have the latest version of Macbook Air with Mountain Lion, as of Oct 2013, and since one of the computers is an older one that needs WEP, the Linksys (Cisco) router is set to support both WEP and WPA.\nHowever, with the Macbook Air, when the \"cisco\" is chosen from the list of Wifi connection, it keeps on saying, \"Enter the password for WEP\", and even if we enter the password, it won't connect.\nWhat we have to do is, use \"Join Other Network\", and type in \"cisco\", and choose WPA or WPA2 Personal, and then type in the password, and it will connect, but the thing is, sometimes the network drops, or after the computer is rebooted, we will have to repeat the same steps again -- it won't remember the settings to auto connect (using WPA).\nIs there a way to make this work more smoothly?\n\nA: I set the Linksys (Cisco) router so that all the 2.4GHz and 5GHz support essentially the same thing: WPA Personal and it seems to work fine now.  \nI think the issue was 2.4GHz and 5GHz was set to WEP and WPA, respectively, due to some 2.4GHz device using different security standard.  So I think the Mac might have some issue of not able to remember the connection, being confused by difference in settings of 2.4GHz and 5GHz.\n\nA: delete the WiFi net from the SystemPreferences->Network->Advanced->WiFi list. then reinstall it.\n", "Q: Run script before restart/shutdown Is it possible to execute a script/command right before OS X is shutting down or restarting?\nI'd like to run sudo apachectl stop to stop apache from auto-starting.\n\nA: You can use a logout hook:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook ~/.logouthook\necho $'#!/bin/bash\\napachectl stop' > ~/.logouthook\nchmod +x ~/.logouthook\n\nThe value of the LogoutHook key can only be a path to an executable and not a shell command.

We both recently upgraded to Mavericks and I just installed Server.app.\nProblem is all connection attempts from her account fail, and I can't work out why (after lots of time and effort diagnosing the problem).\nOne ars forum post describes a similar problem, and one of the suggestions is that the connection is being blocked by a SACL. This theory is validated by the fact that I can connect with my own (admin) account.\nMore searching, and it seems that the suggestion is to edit the SACL using the Server Admin app. I guess this has now been rolled into Server.app?\nCan someone please enlighten me, where are Service ACLs configured?\n\nA: You can enable individual access to services for users and groups inside of Server.app 3.0. Select the Users or Groups section from the sidebar, and then click on the user or group that you'd like to configure access for. Click on the action (gear) icon below the list of users or groups, and choose \"Edit Access to Services...\":\n\nYou'll be presented with a list of services that allow access to be enabled and disabled for this user/group.

I have to copy the file to the PC to mount the ISO file. \nIs this due to how Mavericks switched from AFP/SMB to SMB2? Is there a way to fix this?\n\nA: It sounds more to me as if it's a Windows issue than a macOS issue, even though I realize that it didn't start until after the Mavericks upgrade.  Have you tried any other mount tools, such as CloneDrive or PowerISO?  It may be worth trying a couple of other tools as a test.  Are you able to mount the ISO from another Mac?\n\nA: I'm not sure if it's the use of SMB2 that's causing the problem but something that may be worth trying is mounting the share using SMB instead of SMB2. To do that, specify the server as cifs://server instead of smb://server when mounting via Finder.\n", "Q: Safari 7 User Agent is set to “Custom” by default Ever since upgrading to Mavericks from Snow Leopard, Safari’s default User Agent is set to custom.

Does Apple Remote Desktop connect to computers over the internet?\nDoes the client computer need a real internet ip address?\nThe main question is if i can use it to connect to employees laptops no matter where they are, as long as they have an internet connection (similar to Teamviewer)\n\nA: Yes it can use iCloud back to my Mac to locate remote Macs behind a NAT router. Also, if your network allows inbound network connections then that also would work over the Internet.\nAnd no, ARD is not a service where a client runs on each Mac to tunnel out of more arbitrary network connections as Team Viewer, Citrix/GoToMeeting and other solutions that are designed to have the computer that is \"to be controlled\" initiate contact with the administrator.\nFor example, setting up the clients over Bonjour will not work if you then try to access the clients over the Internet.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the scanner.\n\n\n*Select the Network Address scanner type, and enter the public/BTMM IP address of the computer.\n\nYes, the client computer will need a \"real Internet IP address\" for this method to work, or the Back to my Mac address if enabled.\nTo find the Back to my Mac address, make sure that iCloud and Back to my Mac is enabled, then run the following command:\ndns-sd -E\n\nThe final line shows the account number.\nUse the following syntax for determining the address:\ncomputername.number.members.btmm.icloud.com\n\nYou can find the computer name in System Preferences → Sharing.\n\nA: I would add that the method mentioned to use the back to my mac to resolve the ip address behind a nat router will only work if the host and client are logged into the same icloud account.  See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/53784 for a description.  \nI have been unable to get the ARD to resolve with two different icloud accounts, but when I logged into the same account on client and server, it worked fine for ARD and ssh (as shown in the link.)  \nI would submit that the accepted answer will not work for the original poster, because the OP needs to manage multiple employee's laptops who will not have the same icloud account as the IT pro.\n\nA: Back To My Mac is no longer available in macOS Catalina.\nI tried using Apple Remote Desktop and the iCloud/Back To My Mac solution proposed here to remotely connect to my Mac Pro from outside of our LAN whilst travelling.\nWelp, Back To My Mac apparently got killed off in a previous version of macOS.\nI ended up using Screens and setting up our modem/router to allow for secure, external connections. Everything worked well.\n\nToo bad we have to use a third party for something like this now but them the breaks, I guess.\n\nA: I would also add that you can use the IP6-based Back to My Mac address in Apple Remote Desktop to connect over the Internet to remote Macs.  The IP address looks something like this:\ncomputername.27839135.members.btmm.icloud.com\n", "Q: Is it safe to allow apps to access your photos? Some wallpaper apps try to access your camera roll in order to save photos there. Is it safe to do so ? What am I giving developers once I allow them access to my camera roll's photos ?\nI'm just concerned a bit regarding my privacy. \nWhat are they allowed to do with the photos ? Are they encrypted or plain .img files that they can view ?\n\nA: Whether it is safe or not depends on whether you trust the app and the developer's privacy policy or not.\nWhen you give access to an app to photos (either through the prompt that comes when the app tries to access photos or through Settings > Privacy > Photos), the app gets access to write new photos/images to your Camera Roll and to read all your photos on the device in an unencrypted form.\nThe date and time when each photo was taken is embedded within the photo. Plus, if you have enabled Location Services for the Camera app, then an app that has access to the Camera Roll can also find out where you took the photos.\nHow the app then treats the photos and the associated metadata (like date/time and location), if it uploads or sends them elsewhere, is left to the app. For example, once you give permission, iOS apps for popular services like Dropbox, Facebook, Flickr and Google+ can upload all your photos to their services. With iOS 7, these apps can also be allowed to do it in the background (when you're not actively running the app). Most users wouldn't even actively know which photos are being uploaded and when.\nFrom the Data Management in iOS page of the developer documentation:\n\nSimilarly, your app can load, display, and edit photos from the Photo Library, as well as use the built-in camera to take new photos.\n\nSo far, Apple has not implemented any granular settings in iOS within Privacy > Photos to restrict read access to specific photos in the photo library.\n\nA: That is the purpose of asking you to allow access to your photos. Allow only the apps that you trust. In general if you set in security&privacy settings to allow apps only from the mac app store and certified developers, you have little to concern about. \n", "Q: OSX Mail reply with highlighted text as quote In Mail app 7.0 on OSX 10.9, If I highlight a piece of text and then choose Message → Forward it creates a new email with the relevant text as a quote. How do I replicate this behaviour with Message → Reply?\nI believe this functionality was present in an earlier version of Mail.\nEdit: unchecking Preferences → Composing → Quote the text of the original message causes this behaviour.

(Although both displays actually have the menu bar.)\nProblem: cmd + tab Task Switcher sometimes appears in secondary display instead of the primary. Once it starts appearing on the secondary display, it might soon move back to the primary, too.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does this happen? I have seen it more than once but haven't yet figured out the pattern.\n\n*How to configure the task switcher to appear only on the primary display?\nAccording to this similar question, How to choose on which display Application Switcher shows?, the behavior depends on which display has the dock. Follow-up variant question:\n2'. How to configure the dock to appear only on the primary display?\nThis also happens on all later releases through at least Catalina.\n\nA: Edit\nJust realized that I've been here before and it's just above! The answer is: \n\ndon't put the Duet \"below\" your other display in the arrangement! \n\n\nI'm having this issue right now. I'm on Sierra with Duet Display (Thunderbolt primary screen + Duet on iPad mini). All the options (including shutting off Displays Have Separate Spaces do not help. The Menu Bar is on my primary display, yet the dock and task switcher are on the iPad mini.\nThe only workaround I have for now is to put the dock on the right or left. Very weird!\n\n\nA: Great question!\nYou answered #1 yourself - that is, the Switcher appears on the monitor where the Dock was last shown.\nTo change it, just move the mouse to the bottom of the display that you want to show the Task Switcher on (this will temporarily show the dock on OS X Mavericks, until you move the mouse away from the bottom of the screen).\n\nNow the Switcher will appear on that display, until the Dock is shown on one of the other displays.\nNow, how to configure the Task Switcher to appear on the display with the mouse pointer? That's what I want to know.  ;-)\n\nA: As the OP and other answers have noted, the Task Switcher follows the last-moused-over dockbar.\nFixing the Issue\nTo eliminate this behavior in all cases, hide the menu bar on your secondary monitor:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Mission Control \n\n*Turn Displays Have Separate Spaces to OFF\nOf course this will impact your use of Spaces with multiple monitors, but it might keep you sane.\n\nDuet Display & Arrangements with Strange Behavior\nAnother strange note is that if you have a Display that is seen below your primary display in the Arrangement View -- like this example using Duet -- it will get the Dock, and therefore the switcher. Move it to the side or above to avoid this.\n\n\nA: This displays app switcher on both the displays. Works on macOS Big Sur 11.2.1\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock appswitcher-all-displays -bool true\nkillall Dock\n\nAlso works on older versions (Catalina)\n\nA: I answered a similar question here - cmd-tab behavior on Mavericks with multiple displays\nThe Task Switcher does follow the Dock.  If the Dock is on screen 1, the Task Switcher will appear on screen 1.  If the Dock is on screen 3, the Task Switcher will appear on screen 3.  Etc.\nTo make your Dock appear on a screen you can use a couple of methods.\nMethod 1 - Move your mouse to the bottom of the desired display.  Don't stop once you reach the bottom of the display though, try to move it further down, as if you're pushing down on the bottom of the display with your cursor.  This action tells the Dock to move to this display.  This is temporary however, meaning the Dock will stay on this display until you perform this action on another display or reboot your Mac.\nMethod 2 - This will change the default starting point for your Dock.  In System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement you can drag the menu bar from one display to another in this windows display icons.  See the attached picture for reference.  This alters the default preference to always show the Dock on the desired display, the one you drag the menu bar to in this preference pane, when you boot and/or login to your user account.  You can still use method 1 to temporarily change the Dock's location but upon a reboot it will return to the display specified here.\n\n", "Q: iPhone 5 sync won't complete, stalls at waiting for changes to be applied I have an iPhone 5. Since the latest update to iOS 7, my ripped music won't sync to my phone. The sync stalls at \"waiting for changes to be applied\". I've run the sync diagnostic, and it indicates there are no problems. I have plenty of room on my phone, and had nearly 2000 songs on it prior to the update. Now, only the purchased tunes sync.  \n\nA: From this macrumors.com post:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close iTunes, unplug your device and reboot the computer.\n\n*On your iDevice, connect to your Wifi network & leave it on and reboot it too. Now plug your iDevice back to the computer.\n\n*If you have any voice mails, delete them first.\n\n*Everything will sync and the problem goes away.\n\n\nA: 'Waiting for changes to be applied' is a problem with a mismatched app or music library. If you deleted an app from your phone that you normally sync from iTunes, then reinstall the app on your phone or delete it from your iTunes library before syncing.\nMusic is more complex.  If the song was deleted from the phone then delete it from iTunes, or else it may be a corrupt sound file that you will have to locate and delete. Sync one artist at a time and work down to the album and then the track or tracks that won't sync.  Make sure iTunes can locate all of your music.  If iTunes can't locate the track or tracks you will see an exclamation point on the left side of the track name.\nA mismatched library can also occur if you disconnect your phone before a 'cancel sync' is finished.  In this case you have to 'reset sync history' on a Windows PC, or on a Mac backup the phone and restore from backup.\n\nA: I had over 1500 apps on my iPhone 5, and I saw this error several times.\nAfter I installed iOS Console (free download) on my Mac, I could see some error messages in the iOS Console.\nSeveral apps had quite a long name and/or weird characters in the app title. This was stopping them from copying. I think a service zips them prior to copying, and it was jammed on this step.\nMy next step was going to be deleting these particular apps.\nDo any of your song or album titles have any weird characters in them?\n", "Q: Mavericks update broke ssh key-based authentication I regularly ssh to one of my OS X boxes. I have configured ssh key-based authentication i.e. added my client-end ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to server-end ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 with restricted enough permissions.

What is the advantage of buying a compatible Mac external disk?\nUsing Tuxera NTFS I can have an external disk for both, the windows partition (or any windows machine) as well as for the Mac one.\nDoes it make sense to look for a compatible external disk nowadays? \nWhat would be the best way to deal with the PC/Mac compatible problems in terms of disk formatting? Is using Tuxera a nice way to deal with it?\n\nA: Actually you can format any hard disk to macos journaled if you like. So buy the hdd you want, partition it and format it as you like.\nIf you format it as FAT you can use it on both win and mac for read/write, but you cannot use it for time machine backups (time machine requires macos filesystem).\n\nA: You can get any external disk and use it. If you wish to use NTFS as the data interchange format between OS X and Windows, then products like Tuxera NTFS for Mac or Paragon NTFS for Mac or even free ones like NTFS-3G for Mac OS X would do.\nOn the other hand, if you wish to use HFS+ as the interchange format, you can use Paragon HFS for Windows.\nBoth the above approaches would allow you to deal with files larger than 4GB, which is a limitation of the third option, using FAT32 format for the external disk.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro screen glitches after fall My mid-2009 MacBook Pro just had a high speed meeting with my floor. (I thought those magsafe cables were supposed to disconnect when you tripped over them... sigh)\nNow I get strange glitches and flickers on my screen. Strangely, these occur only at high brightness settings. They start to show up when I'm three brightness levels away from the maximum.\nAnother apple.SE question suggests that the glitches could either be due to a short circuit on the display cable, or a defective inverter board.\nIs one of those two issues at play here? Which one?  More generally, what's my problem and how do I fix it?  \nI'm not covered by applecare, so, if possible, I'd prefer to do the repair myself.\n\n\nA: I wouldn't imagine an inverter board would be relevant here, its sole purpose is to control power flow to the backlight.  If the screen flickered black or the brightness seemed to flicker then you might look at the inverter board but I highly doubt it could cause graphic anomalies similar to yours.\nYour examples look more video related, which would point to either the logic board, LVDS (display) cable and/or LCD panel itself.  You can narrow it down using the following diagnostic steps...\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a screenshot (commandshift3), do the video anomalies appear in the resulting screenshot picture?  If so then it's likely a failure with the video card/logic board or possibly RAM.  If not then it's possibly the LVDS cable and/or LCD panel.\n\n*Connect your Mac to an external display, do the video anomalies appear on the external display?  If so then it's likely a failure with the video card/logic board.  If not then it's possibly the LVDS cable and/or LCD panel.\n\n*Does the issue change at all when the display is tilted forward/backward?  If so then it's likely a loose or damaged LVDS cable and/or LCD panel.  I should specify, the LCD itself is probably ok but it's built in controller board could be damaged.  They ARE replaceable but it's likely a lot easier to replace the LCD itself, though thats still quite a task with the unibody MacBook Pros.\n\n*Remove and re-seat the RAM (iFixit has a handy guide), does the issue persist?  If so then I would doubt, but not rule out, that RAM is the culprit.\n\n*Run Apple Hardware Test (Insert the gray \"Disc 2\" that came with your Mac and hold D while powering on) and note any failures.\n\n*Try re-seating the LVDS (display data) cable as shown in step 8 of iFixits display guide.\n\n\nHopefully that helps and at least points you in the right direction, good luck!\n", "Q: OS X Mavericks bash_profile paths don't work I need to create a new path in OS X Mavericks.\nTo do so, I edited .bash_profile:\nexport LC_ALL=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nexport PGHOST=localhost\n\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/heroku/bin\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres93.app/Contents/MacOS/bin\n\nBut it doesn't work.

There is much more network traffic than you think when working with files remotely and on such a slow connection you will really feel it.  Most modern IDE's expect files to be locally available, not on a slow, remote drive.\nI would suggest looking into mirroring your work files between your work and home machine as needed.   To my knowledge there are two basic approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*File synchronization:  Use \"rsync\" to move changed files back and forth as needed.  This is good if you need to edit locally, but compile remotely.\n\n*Source repository:  Work locally until you have a satisfying result, commit the revised sources locally to the repository, and then update the remote sources from the repository.  This works well if you can work fully locally.\n\n\nPlease report back what worked well for you.\n(Incidentially this is why Remote Desktop for Windows is such a good thing.

Any Apple-branded product can be recycled for free.\n\nWe can infer that it's at Apple's discretion to provide free recycling for specific Apple hardware (or non Apple hardware). There is no fixed time line for product ranges to be eligible for recycling through Apple.\nSince the MacBook Air Mid 2013 is not listed in the list of MacBook Air models that can be recycled through Apple (the latest at this point being the Mid 2012 model), your choices now are to sell it to someone else (since it's a recent machine and has a lot of value left) or recycle it for free through Sims Recycling Solutions (which means you get nothing for the Mac, as opposed to the standard process where Apple evaluates the value of the Mac and sends you a gift card if it has any value).\n\nRecycle it for free.\nYou can still recycle it by calling Sims Recycling Solutions at 800-966-4135\nfor a free shipping label and packaging instructions.\n\n", "Q: Software was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer I went to run LibreOffice on my OS X 10.9 and it would not let me install it.

I'm running Xcode (downloaded from the Mac App Store) on my MacBook Pro running OS X Mavericks.\nThe weird thing is I am running version 3.2.6, yet Xcode claims to be up to date. There are no updates in the Mac App Store.\n\nA: You may have Xcode 3.2.6 from an earlier installation and are running it. Note that Xcode 3.x being a pre-MAS (Mac App Store) version, installs into the /Developer folder (by default, although it can be installed elsewhere too), whereas the Mac App Store versions (from Xcode 4 onwards) install into the /Applications folder. To run Xcode 5, make sure you're running the application from /Applications. You can also use Spotlight to find where Xcode 3.2.6 resides on your system.\nIf you wish to uninstall the older version (Xcode 3.2.6), open Terminal.app and uninstall it using the command:\nsudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\n\nA: Xcode 4 was a separate download in the Mac App store. Xcode 5 replaced 4 in the app store. That is why you do not see an update. Download Xcode 5 directly from the Mac Appstore. If you would like to keep xcode 3.2 also installed, right click an xproj file and select to open all these files with xcode 5 to make it the default xcode in your system. But there is no reason nowadays to keep such an old xcode installation.\n\nA: One very good reason in my book would be the interface - not an MDI-like monolithic structure copied from MSVC, but one with a nice, small project window and source files opening in individual windows. It isn't impossible to add configuration files so that Xcode 3 works with the newer compilers, and if you're using external build systems there shouldn't be any issues at all.\nDo I understand correctly that an XCode 3 install isn't touched when upgrading from 10.6 to 10.9?\n", "Q: Apple Mail prints tiny fonts after Maverick upgrade After installing Mavericks on my MacBook Pro 13 (non-Retina) and on my Mac Mini, a printed message from Mail appears in tiny font. This is independent of the printer (tried on Hp and on Epson). After much experimentation I found that I can only increase the printed font size by raising the viewed font size to 16 or above. Even when doing this the mail message header is still about size 8. \nDoes anyone know of a fix to this? Is there a setting in the printer's plist that can be changed?\nThis has been reported to Apple via Mail Feedback and Apple Care.\n\nA: I have the same problem Mavericks since I installed the recent Mavericks Mail update on Nov 8/13 (I had no trouble before that). All I can do as of now is to copy the body of the email to Text Edit, type in the heading information and print from there.  \n", "Q: New York not found in French weather app I have one iphone in English, one in French. \nIn the weather app, in English, I can find \"New York, NY\" no issues.\nIn the French version, New York simply does not appear in the search results!\nKnown issue??\n\nA: Searching for \"JFK\" gives me \"WNYC\". It is the same weather in both cities.\n", "Q: Mavericks Finder spins when opening folders Since upgrading to Mavericks, Finder sometimes hangs when I select a folder and am waiting for its contents to populate the window. This happens primarily in Open dialog boxes:\n\nIt'll spin for about 15-30 seconds before showing the items in that folder. I can \"Go to folder\" and it'll usually show the contents immediately in that case. Why does it spin, and is there a way to make it faster? (It should be instant. I don't go to folders with thousands or even hundreds of items.)\nClarifications: These are just regular, local folders, usually in my home directory... not Remote Disc or network shares or anything fancy. It's an early 2013 Retina MBP, so it has a solid-state drive.\n\nA: I don't understand all the specific technical details, but this is apparently caused by ISPs that perform NXDOMAIN interception. Following that forum post, try running this in Terminal:\nping Backups.backupdb\n\nIf you don't get the following response:\nping: cannot resolve Backups.backupdb: Unknown host\n\n...then your ISP is performing NXDOMAIN interception, which is causing the delay.\nThe procedure to disable the interception depends on your particular ISP. For instance, if you're using OpenDNS (which does interception by default), you can disable it in your account settings.\n\nI was having this exact same problem on my machine, and I was using OpenDNS (but without an account, so I couldn't change the setting). I simply switched back to my ISP's (AT&T) default DNS – which apparently doesn't do interception, since I got the \"correct\" ping response above – and the problem immediately went away.\n(I take no credit personally for this solution; I'm merely reporting it here for everyone else's benefit. It seems to be a very common issue with Mavericks).\n\nA: Note: though answer has now completely changed, this is just a late edit. I hope someone will benefit from this anyway.\nFound a workaround which actually works, finally, from OSXDaily. To summarize, disabling network share automounting does the trick (at least for my few macs I've got Mavericks installed).\nTo disable network share automounting, open up Terminal.app and type in the following commands.\nmacbook:~$ sudo sh -c \"cp /etc/auto_master /etc/auto_master.OLD && perl -i -pe 's/(^\\/net)/#\\$1/' /etc/auto_master && automount -vc\"\n\nWhat this does (for those less knowledge with command line, Bourne Shell and such) is that it first makes a backup copy of file /etc/auto_master, then edits one line of it and finally signals automounter to re-read /etc/auto_master.\nAfter this you will have to manually mount your network shares. More information in original OSXDaily article.\n\nA: Your snapshot shows that the asynchronous progress indicator (throbber) is the portion of the sidebar to draw:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connected servers\n\n*Bonjour discoverable services\n\n*Back to My Mac\n\n\nYou should be able to focus on the networking and isolate whether this is truly the action that is delaying your work or just an innocent bystander being the next thing to be drawn when the system is otherwise paused and delayed.\nTo troubleshoot this I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sysdiagnose from terminal if I can reproduce the issue and see if I could catch a process using CPU or otherwise behaving different than an sysdiagnose when the system is otherwise idle. Skip this step if you don't like looking at system logs and going into terminal. This step may be valuable if you want to report this as a bug - the system shouldn't hang in my opinion to paint network services and should unblock the operation and show network devices later should that be slow.\n\n*Turn off all three items above in Finder preferences for the Sidebar.\n\n*Sign out of Back to my Mac\n\n*Disconnect from the network\n\n\nSince there are several items this could be - hopefully you can narrow things down or comment if I missed a step or more information on the problem comes to light. Also, be sure you don't have any tools like Little Snitch or Network Link Conditioner as they would clearly exacerbate the rendering of the network sharing portion of the sidebar if misconfigured.\n\nA: Is it on every drive you have? Because if it is the same bahviour on different hardware? (Behavioural difference between a USB thumb drive and internal disk)\nIs the \"ls\" command equally slow in terminal or instant? (try terminal and cd and drag an example folder into terminal and hit enter. Then type \"ls\" to see how long it takes to list the folders contents.)\n\n\n*\n\n*This could also be due to HFS+ corruption (run disk utility \"verify disk\" (not the permissions) and see if your (I guess your start up volume is affected) has issues. As it probably will, boot from recovery (hold down cmd+R on boot) and try to repair the disk with disk utility from there. \n\n*Last but not least have you tried setting up a new user account and trying to reproduce it in a new user account?\n\n\nSorry for the many questions but I'm not (hopefully yet) allowed to comment on questions.\n\nA: Just seen this post on Tuaw.com how-to-fixing-the-filestatsagent-bug by\nErica Sadun\nQuote from tuaw.com post:\n\nAt times, your system may seem to be spinning its wheels. A peek into\n  Activity Monitor (found in the Utilities subfolder of your\n  Applications folder) can offer clues as to what's going on....\n..As I discovered, some Mavericks users may find a FileStatsAgent\n  process has been eating away at their CPU. If this happens to you,\n  it's generally due to a corrupt file.\n\nThey then go on to explain about using the open files and ports option in Activity Monitor on the process to see which files may be causing the problem.\nThis may or may not be your problem..\n\nA: There are a number of Apple Support Communities discussions regarding this, and a number of possible fixes given. To summarise in case one works for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Finder App Nap\nThis seems to fix it for almost everyone on ASC who had Finder working fine in 10.8 but now is 'broken' in 10.9.\nsudo defaults write com.apple.Finder NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES\n\n…then log out and back in with 'Reopen windows when logging back in' disabled.\n\n*Clear Finder Caches\nEmpty ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.finder and restart Finder.\nrm -r ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.finder/ && killall -HUP Finder\n\n\n*Reset Finder Preferences\nRelated to above — delete both preference files used by Finder:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple/sidebarlists.plist\n\n\n*Reindex Spotlight\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\n\n*Change the 'Show Scroll Bars' setting\nIt seems that it can be fixed by changing the scroll bar setting in System Preferences → General from When Scrolling to Always.\n\n*Repair Permissions\nTry repairing permissions in Disk Utility.\n\nA: I've been having the same problem for a few weeks, trying every suggestion listed here and other forums but without success.... until tonight!\nTL;DR: Run these 2 commands then reboot.\nmv ${TMPDIR}/com.apple.IconServices{,-bad}\nmv ${TMPDIR}/../C/com.apple.IconServices{,-bad}\n\nLong Version:\nThe problem did not happen when I tried a newly created user account so it pointed to something with my profile.  I removed all the Preferences and Caches from my Library folder but the problem remained.\nAfter examining the system logs, I noticed the following 2 errors would often appear when viewing a folder in the Finder.\n12/16/14 12:24:29.908 AM com.apple.IconServicesAgent[244]: main Failed to composit image for binding VariantBinding [0x2af] flags: 0x8 binding: FileInfoBinding [0x3bf] - extension: mov, UTI: com.apple.quicktime-movie, fileType: ????.\n12/16/14 12:24:29.908 AM quicklookd[8215]: Warning: Cache image returned by the server has size range covering all valid image sizes. Binding: VariantBinding [0xa03] flags: 0x8 binding: FileInfoBinding [0x903] - extension: mov, UTI: com.apple.quicktime-movie, fileType: ???? request size:16 scale: 1\n\nThese are related to creating/loading icons for different file types.  The Finder is hanging while attempting to draw the icons for the file listing so it made sense that it would lag if there were problems with the cache.\nSince the IconServicesAgent isn't an application the user interacts with, the cache/prefs are not saved in the typical ~/Library/ folder but in a special hidden location used for OS-level apps and daemons.  Every user has a Cache and Temp folder in this location at /var/folders/.  We just need to locate and rename the IconServicesAgent's files.  \nWhen a user account is created, the system generates a folder here for the user but named with 32 seemingly random characters.  Since they are random, I can't give you an exact path but the TMPDIR environment variable can.  (If you want to know, run the command echo $TMPDIR to get the path to your own Temp folder.  It will be something like /var/folders/jc/vzc51tfn2jzbzqkr9j3g38gm0000gn/T/ but we don't really need it.  The commands below will just use the variable directly)\nNow rename the com.apple.IconServices folder in the T [temp] directory with this command.\nmv ${TMPDIR}/com.apple.IconServices{,-bad}\n\nNext we need to do the same in the Cache directory, which is in the same parent directory as the T directory.  This command will do what you need.\nmv ${TMPDIR}/../C/com.apple.IconServices{,-bad}\n\nSo now reboot your Mac and after you log back in, the Finder should be quick again.\n\nA: I sometimes have a similar problem: Finder is completely unresponsive, i.e., all Finder windows are frozen, and they all show the spinning beach ball.\nIn that case, for me the only thing that helped was to open Activity Monitor, and kill Finder (i.e., relaunch) it a number of times. Sometimes, I had to relaunch it up to 5 times.\n(So far I haven't been able to pinpoint the culprit. I did not have any network disks mounted.)\n\nA: This happened to me in Yosemite. Some folders had their contents displayed just fine, others got the spin wheel. All folders in question were local folders, and their contents displayed fine with ls in the terminal.\nWhat my problem seemed to be related to was having a network share connected prior to closing the lid on my laptop, then opening my laptop and connecting to a different network where that share was not available. The share was still shown in the left panel of the Finder window, but was not showing any contents. In the terminal mount still showed the share as mounted. With both Finder and the terminal open, I typed umount /Volumes/USBSTORAGE in the terminal. As soon as I did that, the Finder window became responsive and immediately listed the contents of the local directory that was selected.\nIt seems there's some code in Finder that gets blocked when dealing with remote storage that also blocks some local file operations.\n", "Q: Numbers has stopped showing up in Launchpad Numbers has stopped showing up in Launchpad. How can I add it back?\n\nA: Just type your application name in Launchpad's search box found near the top of every Launchpad screen. The icon for the desired App should be displayed on a new screen by itself - click and drag it to the desired location in Launchpad.\nA commandline call may help as well - but be warned that it'll rebuild the Launchpad from scratch and will remove  any customizations you've added:\n rm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db; killall Dock\n\n", "Q: Apps take forever to start on OS X Mavericks Ever since I upgraded my main machine to Mavericks, every time I open a new app, two things happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*the app takes a long time to open;\n\n*the whole system slows to a crawl until the app opens completely.\n\n\nThe interesting part is that this happens on an early 2011 MacBook Pro (with 4GB of RAM), while on an older machine (mid/late 2007 MBP with 2GB of RAM), also updated to Mavericks, everything is a breeze—it’s surreal! (Both machines were upgraded from Snow Leopard.)\nAnd on top of that, Safari is completely broken—see my previous question.\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*repaired permissions;\n\n*cleared system and user cache;\n\n*reseted the SMC;\n\n*ran AppleJack;\n\n\nWhat can I possibly do to make it work as it should?\n\nA: When I see things like this I often suspect disk problems. (This is a HDD, correct?) The first symptoms of soft disk errors are often bad performance.\nOpen the Console and see if you see any disk errors. Also try booting into a Super Duper clone. Since a clone will have the same files, any problem would continue if it were a configuration problem. But if the problem goes away, it was likely a problem with the physical drive. As a bonus, a clone is exactly what you will need if you have a physical drive problem.\n\nA: I suggest you reinstall the application. If all goes wrong, then just reinstall Mavericks. My MBP (mid 2012) takes FOREVER to start up but the apps work just fine.\n\nA: I would suggest clean install of Mavericks (make sure you back up your data first) from a bootable USB install drive.\nThere is also step by step guide available.\n\nA: I did a clean install. The first day it was o.k., but then opening apps takes a long time, watching the bouncing app-icons in the dock. \n\n\n*\n\n*Mavericks fresh install (external HDs kept disconnected, two displays attached)\n\n*iWork (from CD) \n\n*Adobe CS4 \n\n*iCloud activated\n\n*Canon printer driver\n\n\nAfter i gave up when recurring the old behavior i installed back much other stuff, it can´t hurt anymore. Watching the ever bouncing app-icons in the dock, again. Crap.\n\nA: Buy a solid state drive.  Yeah, I know, expensive but EXCELLENT.  If you want an external usb 3 make sure the case has UASP. Very important. \n", "Q: Can't update MacPorts after upgrading to Mavericks I ran port selfupdate and MacPorts tried to upgrade itself to version 2.2.1, but eventually fails. When I add the -v flag, I can see the build fails after these lines:\nchecking for Tcl configuration... configure: error: Can't find Tcl configuration definitions\nCommand failed: cd     /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/tarballs/base && CC=/usr/bin/cc OBJC=/usr/bin/cc ./configure --prefix=/opt/local --with-tclpackage=/Library/Tcl --with-install-user=root --with-install-group=admin --with-directory-mode=0755 --enable-readline && make SELFUPDATING=1 && make install SELFUPDATING=1\nExit code: 1\n\nHow can I get MacPorts back?\n\nA: You need to update the command line tools Xcode installs. For whatever reason, Xcode doesn't seem to want to update them itself, but you can force it by running xcode-select --install. This will pop open a GUI prompt; select \"Install\" and let the installer do its thing. After this, MacPorts should build itself successfully. (You may need to rehash first; rehash in tcsh, hash -r in bash and zsh (I think).)\n\nA: I installed the ActiveTCL distribution from Active State. I vaguely recalled it was necessary; I just bought a new machine, has Mavericks, and I put the ActiveState TCL distro on it as a matter of habit prior to rebuilding my MacPorts install.\n", "Q: Sync Google contacts and iCloud contacts I use CardDav to get my Google Contacts on my iPhone, which works great, but I would love it when those contacts were also in sync with iCloud contacts.\nMeaning when I add John Doe in Google contacts it will show up in iCloud (eventually) and vice versa when I add Jane Doe in iCloud it will show up in Google contacts.\nI've got an iPhone 4S with iOS7 and a MBP with Mavericks.\n\nA: Just saw a question similar to yours, Apple does not allow sync of contacts between various cloud accounts (i.e. between Google and iCloud), however you can use this tutorial to transfer or copy contacts from one iPhone cloud account (Google) to the next (iCloud).\n\nA: Actually I just copied my iCloud contacts to Gmail (copied, not synced) just by following those easy steps (I believe Maverick is required but not sure though):\n- Add both your iCloud and Gmail account to Mavericks' account manager (in the System prefs) \n- Open the Contacts app on your mac (You should see two different contact folder on the left: iCloud and Google)\n- Click the iCloud one, select all of your contacts (cmd+A, shift+click, whatever)\n- Drag'n'Drop them from iCloud to Google.\n- Voilà !\n(It took me more than 5 minutes to converts my 350+ contacts)\n", "Q: How to enable Sqlite on a Mac OS X Mavericks I upgraded my Mac with OS X Mavericks last week.  It appears to have taken away support for Sqlite -- not Sqlite3, but sqlite.  I need that for a website I work on.  I went to Sqlite's website, but all I could find was older versions of Sqlite3.  Where can I find a version of Sqlite?  I've been through the php.ini and can only find one reference to sqlite.  In short, how do I get Sqlite support on my Mac?  I have Sqlite3 enabled and the issue isn't going away.\nI uncommented pdo_sqlite in the php.ini and I still have the issue.\n\nA: As it turned out, this was only an issue because I was using Zend Framework 1.12 and Apple upgraded to PHP 5.4 and 5.4, which in turn dropped some Sqlite support in favor of Sqlite 3.  Here are instructions on how to upgrade Zend to Sqlite 3 support.\nhttps://github.com/gencer/zend-cache-sqlite3\n\nA: First, install Homebrew.\nThen:\n$ brew update && brew install sqlite\n\n", "Q: Will updating my software to Mavericks delete all of my files and software? I'm a new Apple user and have the option to update my software to Maverick. \nI know that on Windows when you install a new operating system, all of your previous data is wiped out. It's pretty much a reformat.\nWill the same happen with Maverick or will I keep all the data I currently have?\n\nA: It's always a good idea to back up your system before installing a software update, especially a major one like a new release of the operating system. That said, assuming no catastrophe strikes, your files and programs will be intact after installing the new operating system. While some prior version of Mac OS X offered several install options, including clean install, archive and install, and install in place, Mavericks offers no such options at the install menu, and by default preserves your files and programs.\nHowever, not all programs will run the same under the new operating system. It is always possible that the install will break something (it did for me), and retaining a backup is a very good idea in case you decide you don't like the new OS, so you want to revert to the previous version, as I am about to do.\n", "Q: Safari and Chromium on Mac get input language from other apps In my system, two 'input sources' (languages) are enabled, and I use different languages in different 'documents' (apps).\nI have Chromium or Safari open (a Webkit browser, that is to say) with English language selected for input. Then I switch to (for example) Skype where I use Russian. And when I switch back to the browser, it has Russian language selected as the current input language—the browser picks the language from another app.\nThis happens only when I switch to the web page itself. If I click in the address bar instead (from Skype or from the browser), the language will switch to English. And if I then put focus in the page again, it will still be English (i.e. the address bar acts as another 'document').\nSo, every time I switch to the browser to type something, I have to make sure I change the language to the proper one first. Languages seem to work fine in other respects across the system (though I recall having the same issue in the Terminal before but it disappeared, possibly with an update).\nWhat could cause this behavior? Is there a solution? Is it a known issue?\nVersions, for the record:  \n\nOSX 10.8.5 (build 12F37)\n  Chromium 30.0.1599.101 (227552) from FreeSMUG\n  Safari 6.0.5 (8536.30.1)  \n\nAll browser extensions are turned off, no Flash in the open pages (because this happens even on the 'new tab' page).\nThe issue is not new, I had it since 10.7.\n\nA: Welp, since different input sources for different documents are no longer in OS X as of 10.9, I don't have the problem anymore.\nNow I use Punto Switcher to switch the language for different applications, and it does that fine (although it seems to hang language switching altogether once in a while).\n", "Q: Mavericks QuickTime player not recording computer audio I was recording the screen on my computer that I had updated to Mavericks, and when I replayed the video, there was no audio except the audio captured by my mic.\nThe old Qucktime worked fine, but now it's not.\n\nA: I was able to do this by going to Utilities>Audio Midi Setup\nClick the + sign to add a new device, choose Create Aggregate Device and click both the Built-In Microphone and Built-In Output checkboxes. Then right click the Aggregate device you just created and choose. Use this for Sound Input. Now this device will appear as in input choice in QuickTime Player X.\nNow open QuickTime Player X, choose New Screen Recording and click the drop down arrow. You will now see Aggregate Device as a Mic choice.\n\nA: Make sure you selected an input source(i.e. your internal microphone):\n\nEDIT: I tested it with Mac Os X 10.7.4.

I would say, the hunt is on. If your are like me, having a old Mac Pro, with 4x HDD (8 TB total) and your preparing for the new Mac Pro (yeah!). Then the question becomes: where do you move your old MP data to something new?\nTwo candidates:\n\n\n*\n\n*LaCie BIG5 Thunderbolt\n\n*G-Dock EV Thunderbolt\n\n\nYou can't not really compare these, however for the moment their the only 2 products i could find.\nMy Thoughts:\nI like that the LaCie is BIG (starts with 10TB), on the other side the G is easy to extend and you can easily take one HDD and hook-it up with your Macbook as a external disk (sweet).\nHowever, the G EV series seems only to come in 1 TB disks (thats a bummer). And -as far as i know-- no possibility for extra (empty) enclosures (where you can put in your own (2TB) disks). Im not sure about the ambient level, i hate fans running all the time, so keeping it low as possible is welcome!\nSo, finally, my question is, what would be a good extension for your HDD space, and how are you guys thinking of 'solving' this? The SSD that comes with the MP will not be enough for the most of us!\nMy criteria:\n\n\n*\n\n*thunderbolt 2\n\n*low noise\n\n*easy to expand (hot swap?)\n\n*possibility for LAN connection?\n\n\nEdit 1:\nI didn't mentioned it, but the new MP are fitted with TB2 (20 gbps vs 10 gbps), which means a TB1 drive doesn't take full advantage of the available TB2 connections.\n\nA: The Pegasus R2 disk enclosures use Thunderbolt2 (newest Thunderbolt spec, 20Gb/s) and they come in diskless configurations (you put your own existing Mac Pro disks right in) or pre-populated configurations. I already ordered the diskless model for myself. No network support, however.\n\nA: We've been using the Drobo 5D with Mac Mini servers for a while and have been quite happy. I think they'd make a pleasant addition to the '13 MP.\nThey're Thunderbolt (or the 5N model is a network option), very quite and hot swap. In addition to supporting five 3.5\" drives they have an mSATA to cache and accelerate commonly accessed files. I'd imagine one (or two) would fit nicely on your desk next to your new MP.\nA few notes, that may be advantages or disadvantages depending on your usage. Drobo's only support the proprietary \"BeyondRaid\" technology. That means you can't just drop your existing drives right in and access the data. The drives must first be formatted by the system (thus wiping any existing data). Also, again because of the BeyondRaid, you loose some disk space (similar to RAID-5 or RAID-6, depending on your configuration). So filling up the 5 bays with 4TB drives results in ~14.5TB of usable storage. However you can have a drive fail, replace it and have it automatically rebuilt without ever un-mounting the volume.\n\nA: It took a bit of time, i think the new LaCie 2big and 5big are pretty decent. thunderbolt 2! \nHuge amount of storage, and should be silent. Unfortunately its TB2/USB3 only, no LAN connection.\nNow waiting for my new MacPro. Can't wait.\n", "Q: Why does the fan speed up like they do when there's a firmware update? This is purely a question that will only sate my curiosity.\nIn other systems, when there's a firmware update going on, there is no fan speedup (or none as intense as in the MacBooks). Now, in the case of MacBooks, no matter how fast it is, it just briefly speeds up the fans then when it's done, the fans reduce their speed to their normal level.\nDoes anyone know why this happens?\n\nA: The fan speedup happens because normally the fan speeds are controlled dynamically in response to CPU temperature by the firmware (and as the CPUs are typically underutilized, there is rarely or never any need to run the fans at anything like the maximum speed).\nHowever, when the firmware is being updated, that dynamic temperature control is not possible - for safety the speed is just set to the maximum and left there until the update is complete.\nThis is true for all systems (even PCs - you will often notice a high fan speed for a moment when booting them as well)\nSo the real question is why is the difference between normal and maximum fan speeds is so great in the laptop (MacBook) systems as opposed to Mac desktop/tower/mini systems - and the answer to that is simply that the laptop hardware has much smaller clearances and therefore poor airflow without fans running.  So for safety and increased CPU speeds on laptop systems, more powerful (louder, faster) fans are needed (although they will eat your battery, as much or more than the increased CPU power consumption itself when the CPUs are fully utilized).\n", "Q: My 2011 MacBookAir boot screen does not list MBR USB flash drives anymore – Why, and how to list them again? I have a MBR-formatted, bootable USB flash drive with GRUB. I have tested it successfully on other computers - one with BIOS and another one with UEFI.\nI usually boot my 2011 4,1 MacBookAir with that flash drive. The last time I did that was 21 October.\nYesterday, I restarted, pressed Option after the gray screen as usual, but I only saw \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Recovery\" - I do not see the flash drive, which is typically labeled \"Windows\".\nI zeroed the key and reinstalled the bootloader, but that did not fix the issue. However, when I connect a GPT-formatted disk, the boot screen shows it with the label \"Windows\", as it normally does.\nIt would be helpful to know whether other people can (or cannot) reproduce the issue on the same model.\n\nA: Solved - if no partition of the disk has the bootable flag, the disk does not appear at the boot screen.\nIn my tests, if the partition that has the bootable flag has been formatted with mkfs.vfat /dev/sdxn command (without options) using mkfs.vfat versions 3.0.14 or 3.0.17, the disk appears at boot, but, when the disk is selected, the bootloader is not run. Instead, the message \"This is not a bootable disk\" is printed.\nThe partition that is flagged as bootable does not have to be the one that contains the bootloader configuration files, and it may have MBR partition type 83 and/or ext4 or btrfs filesystem.\n", "Q: I updated to Mavericks — now my G5 is so slow I can't stand it! Everything takes time now since I upgraded to OS X Mavericks. Starting applications, switching from monitor to monitor, sending mail, downloading mail, typing... you name it, there is a beach ball for that.\nI'm no programmer, just a simple graphic designer so I can't read processes or error files. I just need to know what to do to fix my Mac so I can work again!\nPlease! When Mac is sad, Hanna is sad.\n\nA: Mavericks System Requirements\nMavericks requires an Mac with an Intel processor (system requirements), so I don't know how you installed it on a G5. Can you provide more information on the model of Mac you have, including the year?\nSimply Overview for Reverting to an Previous OS\nThere are two ways to revert to a previous OS version, both require erasing the computer and starting over. The difficulty and time required will depend on the status of your system backup(s), or for that matter if your even have a backup. Below is a simple overview of the steps required. Further assistance can be provide once we determine your situation.\nMade Backup Before Upgrade\nHopefully you created a backup before the upgrade. If so, you should make a separate second backup of any files/documents that you have worked on since the upgrade (if possible, make a second complete backup). Reinstall from your pre-upgrade backup and then copy over any files/documents from your second post-upgrade backup.\nDid not Backup Before Upgrade\nIf you didn't make a backup before the upgrade, you'll need to make one now. Once you have the backup complete and tested that you can boot from it, you can reinstall the pervious version of the OS that you were using. Once the system is backup and running, you can use Migration Assistance to move over all your Apps and documents from your post-upgrade backup.\n", "Q: Mac App store download failures and fake complete notification I just upgraded to Mavericks on my new Macbook Air and I am facing issues downloading apps from the Mac app store.\nWhen I click on the install button on any app, it does the usual animation of jumping into the Application folder and then the button immediately says installed. If you go to the dashboard you can see the new app icon with the progress bar inside it which has moved all the way to the end and the cancel button on the upper left corner. It remains this way forever.\nNo it doesn't matter if the app is big or small; it always behaves this way although I have had random apps succeeding.\nThe problem is not just the fake complete notification, the app never gets installed and sometimes it gives an error saying that the download failed and asks me to retry again from the purchases menu in the App store.\nI have even done a complete re-installation of Mavericks but it did not help.\nPS: The first time I upgraded to Mavericks, I was able to download Pages and iPhoto without any issues. The problem started sometime after that.\n\nA: I spent a long time with customer support on this; several weeks actually.\nOne of the things you can try is to remove the folder that is listed in the console log when the issue happens. To do this, open console and leave it running. Next attempt the download and when you get the failure message, go back to console and you will see entries which say that system was unable to access a folder. Using finder, open the folder just above the folder that is named with a random sequence of strings.\nFor eg:\nfile:///var/folders/nc/qmbww7hd0cl24ylyqnldqxv80000gn/C/com.apple.appstore/409183694/mzps155989934935175015.pkg#Keynote6.pkg\nIn the above case, delete the folder nc. Make sure the appstore is closed when you do it. Restart the computer after this.\nBut what really fixed the problem for me was a very simple change.\nClick on the wifi symbol on the menu bar and click open network preferences. Click on the location drop down and click edit locations. Remove all the locations in the resulting window and create a new one with a completely new name.\nRestart the PC and connect to your network and attempt the download again. This fix is what worked for me. In case you have the same issue, try it out and let me know if it worked. \n", "Q: Flash not working on a specific site in Safari 7 Mavericks I've tried the following site in Safari:\nhttp://www.2dayfm.com.au/listen/\nwhich seems to activate plugin but stalls while loading:\n\nThis site works fine in Chrome...

I find that my two-year-old will often delete photos...most of the times by accident.\nIs there a mode on the iPhone or some other software that will help thwart this?\nIs there a way to control which apps a child can access?\n(I'm hoping that Apple would build it right into the OS.)\n\nA: Yes, start with Guided Access which easily locks one app in full screen mode and then move on to restrictions once you have a feeling for what you want to open up past one app at a time as your two year old gets more able to use more than just one game at a time..\n", "Q: Since upgrading to OS X Mavericks, I can't open any files on a SMB share from my Windows 8.1 PC I have a PC with Windows 8.1 and a Mac with Mavericks. I have a folder on the Mac that is shared with the PC. When I'm on the PC and I try to open a file that is shared by the Mac, such as an ISO file (a disk image), then I get a message saying that I cannot open the file, or the file is in use (it depends on the app/filetype). I have the same problem when I open a video file. Strangely, text files and PDF files are just fine. And if I copy any of the problematic files to the local Windows disk, then I can open them just fine.\nThe specific error messages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*AVI files opened in VLC: \"Your input can't be opened. VLC is unable to open the MRL.\"\n\n*ISO files opened by Windows Explorer: \"Sorry, there was a problem mounting the file.\"\n\n\nThis only started happening after I upgraded to Windows 8.1 on the PC and Mavericks on the Mac. Mavericks upgraded its SMB version from SMB1 to SMB2, so perhaps that is related?\nDoes anyone know what the problem might be, and how I could fix it?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: This seems to be a known issue as I remember running across a work-around the other day at TUAW:\nhttp://www.tuaw.com/2013/10/27/did-mavericks-kill-your-network-drive-access-heres-a-fix/\nBasically what they are telling you to do is replace the SMB:// in the Go > Connect To Server... dialog box with CIFS://\nI gather this forces the Mac to use an older version of the SMB networking standard that is the default on Mavericks. Not sure if this will work in VLC and not sure how to compensate for the issue on a PC but this should help when you are working on the Mac end of things...\n\nA: There is an issue with accessing files on the mavericks machine from a windows 8.1 machine that is not fixed by dropping the mavericks back to SMB1. It must relate to directories are certain types of files, because many operations succeed. Syncing larger recursive folders with Vice Versa or GoodSync always fails.\n\nA: This post provides some clues:\nhttp://cammodude.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/os-x-109-mavericks-workaround-for-smb.html\nI can't test it myself, but adding smb_neg=smb1_only to /etc/smb.conf and then restarting the sharing server (uncheck then re-check the box) might work. I note on my mac there is a /etc/smb.conf.old file that might be a good starting point.\nDISCLAIMER: Messing with this could break a lot of things.\n", "Q: Reminders App Hangs after Mavericks Upgrade A couple of people on twitter share this issue, but I cannot find any discussions of it nor solutions. \nSince moving to OS X 10.9, Reminders app keeps pinwheeling, and won't respond. It doesn't crash, so I have to force-quit it. This happens on both my 2008 iMac and my 2013 Air. On my Air, I can tell something weird is happening because upon launching Reminders the fans kick on loud. \nThe data seems to be syncing fine from iCloud, so it doesn't look like a sync issue is causing this.\nAny ideas about what could be causing this issue and how to fix it? \n\nA: I started to do the same as mentioned above -removing all location-based reminders including completed ones... (had to go directly to iCloud.com)\nAs I was going through, I found one that had \"location: null\", deleted it (or just removed the location part of it) and then, before deleting any more, tried my reminder app on my Mac computer (running Mavericks that wouldn't open/crashed). AND IT WORKED\nSo to be clear, you don't have to delete ALL location based reminders -just any that happen to have \"null\" in the location which, of course, messes with it's head! (I must've bumped it on/not done it right).\n\nA: I can confirm that deleting all location-based reminders fixes the problem.  \nYou have to delete all location-based reminders, including those in the Completed list. \nThe next time I launched Reminders, it popped up right away.\n\nA: I had a similar problem after upgrading to OS X 10.10 Yosemite. The main window would not appear after launching the Reminders app. Clicking again on the icon on the Dock would cause the window to show up and the left pane did contain my reminders lists but the right pane where the actual reminders should show was blank. The window was also unresponsive to clicks.\nI logged into icloud.com to take a look at my location-based reminders as Daniel suggested but I wasn't able to identify any that had a location listed as null. I decided to create a new reminders list, drag all of my uncompleted reminders to it (none of which had locations), and then I deleted my original reminders list to get rid of all of my completed ones. So I never actually found the offending one but that fixed the problem for me -- I can once again open the Reminders app on OS X.\nyosemite reminders hang\n\nA: It seems to be caused by location dependant reminders. Worked fine for me until I added an at location reminder on my iPhone. Removing the reminder from iPhone \"fixes\" the problem on Mavericks!\n", "Q: How to deactivate all python ports I just started using enthought's canopy to manage my python packages; thus I want to disable and/or uninstall all of my macports python packages.

I have an iPhone 4. I just updated my phone to the most recent iOS (7.03). My iMessage won't let me send from my phone number, and people are receiving my messages from my email. The phone number is there but is grey and won't let me select it. Why is it disabled? How do I fix this?\n\nA: Assuming you did not change any other settings after the upgrade (like Restrictions), your iMessage may need to be reactivated. When you look at Settings > Messages, you would also see that it displays the message \"Waiting for activation...\".\nThere are several ways to get it activated, and sometimes it may take a few tries since Apple's servers may not respond in a timely fashion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iMessage on Settings > Messages.\n\n*Turn off your iPhone (hold the power button until the slide to power off prompt appears and slide to power it off).\n\n*Turn on your iPhone after a minute or two.\n\n*Make sure you're connected to WiFi (usually more reliable than Cellular).\n\n*Go to Settings > Messages and turn it on. Accept the prompt for the warning that carrier fees may apply for the activation SMS.\n\n\n\nIf the above does not work, you can also follow the steps from iOS: Troubleshooting FaceTime and iMessage activation (edited steps below):\n\nIf you see \"Waiting for Activation\" when trying to activate your phone number with iMessage or FaceTime on iPhone\nTo resolve this issue:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Ensure that you have an active Internet connection. You can complete activation using Wi-Fi or a cellular data connection.\n  \n*Ensure that your iPhone is set to the correct time zone: tap Settings > General > Date & Time.\n  Note: If Set Automatically is on but the incorrect time zone appears, turn Set Automatically off and choose the correct time zone, date, and time.\n  \n*Verify that you can send SMS messages. You need a valid SMS messaging plan to activate FaceTime and iMessage.\n  \n  \n  If \"Waiting for Activation\" still appears after you perform these steps, turn FaceTime and iMessage off and on in Settings > Messages and Settings > FaceTime. You may need to wait up to 24 hours to complete activation. Most attempts will take less than an hour, but some attempts may take up to 24 hours. If your issue isn't resolved after 24 hours, please contact Apple for assistance. If you've recently performed a remote wipe on your iPhone, wait 24 hours from the time you performed the remote wipe, and then turn iMessage off then back on.\n\n\nA: I was able to stop the email messaging and get it to switch over to using my phone number with two of the contacts this was happening with by going into settings, then iMessage and turning it off, making sure MMS Messaging was on. Then I went into Face Time and turned it off. I then went into messages and selected Edit, top left and deleted all previous messages from the contacts this had been happening with. I then went in to contacts and deleted there email address. I then closed all apps and powered down the phone. After a few minutes I turned it back on selected the person in contacts and sent the an iMessage. This forced the iPhone to send the message like an old text over MMS.

The iMac was taken to the Apple store where they misdiagnosed the problem as a hard drive issue.  After the hard drive was replaced, when I got home, the machine continued to crash just as it had before.  I'm now going back to the Apple store.\nPROBLEM SOLVED:  It was simply some 3rd party software that was conflicting with OSX Mavericks, even though my mac was still crashing in Safe Mode.  See the answer below for more information.  Since the Mac still crashed in Safe Mode, within seconds of it starting up, I was unable to uninstall the 3rd party software.  So, I had to take the machine to the Apple store, where they used some special equipment to keep it the Mac alive while they uninstalled the software, and it worked!!!\n\nA: This is hardly a hard disk issue; From the kernel panic, it seems the TCP stack is to blame, with no packet control block. The suspect is the firewall module, so what you might want to do is tell the Apple Store folk to disable the built in firewall NKE (Network Kernel Extension)\n\nA: First, try starting the machine in Safe Mode to re-confirm that this is a third party software issue and not related to hardware:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down your Mac and wait 10 seconds.\n  \n*Press the power button.\n  \n*Immediately after you hear the startup tone, hold down the Shift key.\n  You should press the Shift key as soon as possible after you hear the startup tone, but not before.\n  \n*Release the Shift key when you see the gray Apple logo and progress indicator (spinning gear).\n  \n  \n  To leave safe mode, restart the computer normally without holding down any keys during startup.\n\nIf it works fine in Safe Mode without issues, then you could try uninstalling some potential culprits seen in the log. The backtrace in your log shows the application firewall crashing. The key suspects in this case, based on what was loaded most recently, are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.speedbit.driver.vadriver 1.0.8\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall the Speedbit Video Accelerator for Mac from your system and see if it helps.\n\n\n*com.seagate.driver.PowSecLeafDriver_10_5    5.2.3 and com.seagate.driver.PowSecDriverCore 5.2.3\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall any Seagate Diagnostics Tool that you may have and see if it helps.\n\n\n\nA: I had a similar issue, however I could boot in to safe mode and nothing crashed. However, if I'm not in safe mode crashing in 5 minutes.\nThis would happen even on the login screen if I waited for 5 minutes. This was before any user was logged.\nI took my Mac Mini to the Apple Store and they were stumped. They showed me how to roll back to 10.8 via Time Machine and it's stable.\nI've been uninstalling software, upgrading apps, and running any disk optimization tools. \nI haven't tried to re-install Mavericks yet to see if anything has changed but I'm not hopeful.\n\nA: com.seagate.driver.PowSecLeafDriver_10_5    5.2.3\ncom.speedbit.driver.vadriver    1.0.8\ncom.seagate.driver.PowSecDriverCore 5.2.3\nthese appear to be the problem. find out what they are and uninstall.\n\nA: I had the same problem after installing this Video Accelerator App (which is more of a malware to me) and solved it following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your computer, click on the icon of VA on the menu bar and select: Video Accelerator off.\n\n*Open Terminal, run su and type your root password.\n\n*Run cd /System/Library/Extensions, then rm -rf VADriver.kext\n\n*Reboot your computer and use the App uninstaller to remove it from your Mac completely.\n\n\nA: I think it is the MAC Family Tree 7.0.3 which is causing the problem.\n", "Q: iPhone display of incoming calls and texts My iPhone displays phone numbers on incoming calls. How do I get it to display the name of the caller\n\nA: iPhone will displays the name of the caller only if the incoming number matches with that of any of the saved contacts.\n\nA: To add the person as a Contact so the caller ID displays as his/her name:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Contacts App in your iPhone. \n\n*Create a new contact by clicking the + icon at the top right.\n\n*Enter a First name and other information.\n\n*Tap the add phone (Green + icon) and add the phone number for the person. Repeat for other numbers such as Home and Work.\n\n\nNow when the person calls you will see his/her name as a caller ID.\nYou can also do the reverse from the Phone app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the Recents icon at the bottom.\n\n*Tap the info icon (looks like an 'i' in a circle)\n\n*Tap Create New Contact\n\n*Add the person's name and, if needed, change the phone number type.\n\n", "Q: How to disable iTunes from playing Voice memos? I have the latest iTunes 11.1.2, and is sync'ing the iPhone 5s with it.  However, one thing I found disturbing is that, I may record Voice Memos on my iPhone 5s, either as a personal diary or even for business summary.  The Voice Memos, however, will be sync'ed and added to Songs in iTunes.\nThat means, even if my Mac is locked by the screen saver, any person can press the Play button (the F8 key on the keyboard) and start playing my songs and be able to hear all my voice diary or business summary.\nIs there a way to not let the Voice Memos be added to the \"Songs\"?  They are not songs by nature any way.\n\nA: I believe this will help:\nSelect voice memos, \nRight click, \nGet Info, \nOptions tab, \nCheck \"Skip when shuffling\"\n", "Q: Keyboard and Trackpad stop working on brand new Macbook Pro with Mavericks? I just got a brand new Macbook Pro (2.4 GHz Intel Core i5) with OS X 10.9 Mavericks preinstalled. It's working great and I love the retina screen, but I've had a recurring issue daily where the Keyboard and Trackpad suddenly become completely unresponsive.\nIt's hard to pinpoint exactly what I'm doing when it happens, but generally I'm in the midst of using Google Chrome and navigating around. It happens in the midst of use, not while I'm away from the computer. Some time after using the laptop for anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour they just become unresponsive. I can't move the cursor at all with the trackpad. And none of the keys on the keyboard are functional at all. I can't change volume. I can't adjust screen brightness. No letters work. I can't use Command+Tab to switch between applications. The only thing that surprisingly works is hitting the Power button on the keyboard. This will shut off the screen. Then when I try to hit the Power key again it will prompt me to log back in with my password, but I still can't type or move the cursor.\nThe only thing that gets me back up and running is to hold the power button down until it completely shuts down. Then I have to boot everything back up and it works fine again for awhile until it happens all over again at some indeterminate time.\nI'm not running any virtualization software so that's not an issue.\n\nA: This is a known issue, and a fix is coming.\n\nSymptoms\nApple is aware of rare circumstances where the built-in keyboard and\n  Multi-Touch trackpad may become unresponsive on 13-inch MacBook Pro\n  with Retina display (Late 2013) computers and is working on an update\n  to resolve this behavior. \nResolution\nIf you experience this issue, reset the keyboard and trackpad by\n  closing the computer’s display for approximately one minute and then\n  open it.\n\nSources: MacRumors.com, Apple Knowledge Base\n", "Q: Unlock read-only USB key A free 8GB USB key given to me shows up in Snow Leopard as read-only.\n$ mount\n/dev/disk1 on /Volumes/USB DISK (ntfs, local, nodev, nosuid, read-only, noowners)\n\nHow can I mount it read-write? According to the provider of the USB key:\n\"The USB needs to be unlocked. Right click USB-properties-security-select everyone-edit-permissions for everyone-Allow full control\"\nBut I think these must be instructions for a different OS.\nI'd be fine with reformatting it - there's nothing valuable on it.\nAttempting to force the issue with mount doesn't seem to work:\n$ sudo mount -w -t ntfs /dev/disk1 \"/tmp/USB\"\n$ touch /tmp/USB/foo\n-bash: foo: Read-only file system\n\n\nA: It's read-only because it's formatted with NTFS (the Windows filesystem), which OS X can only read without the help of third party software. If reformatting isn't a problem, then that's likely the easiest way to go. If you need to transfer between OS X and Windows with the stick, use the FAT filesystem. If you're just using it with Macs, the defaults will work fine.\n", "Q: OS X Mavericks wakes my Mac from sleep every hour or so Ever since upgrading to Mavericks, it looks like my Mac Mini wakes from sleep about once an hour or so. In the Console, I get the following message:\nOct 30 02:12:06 gary-mac WindowServer[93]: CGXDisplayDidWakeNotification [89885620192550]: posting kCGSDisplayDidWake\nOct 30 02:12:06 gary-mac WindowServer[93]: handle_will_sleep_auth_and_shield_windows: Deferring.\n\nAnyone know why it's doing this?\nUsually when the computer wakes from sleep, whether manually or automatically, there is a \"Wake Reason\" line, but in this case there isn't one. My guess is that this is because since Mavericks, \"Sleep\" doesn't actually put the Mini to sleep. It seems to be more \"on\" than it used to be. Is there a way to revert the behavior to how it was before Mavericks?\n\nA: Turns out it was because I had \"File sharing\" enabled in my \"Sharing\" System Preferences pane. I've always had this setting enabled, and I could sleep my Mac just fine before Mavericks. However starting with Mavericks, if I sleep my Mac with \"File sharing\" enabled, then the Mac won't sleep.\n\nA: Since I started to share files on my Mac, I had the insomnia issue as well. There is a great little tool called PleaseSleep which is freeware and supports Mavericks. It will help your Mac to stay asleep.\nDirect download link\nUnfortunately, the product is not maintained anymore, as the developer Dragonone.com stopped.\n", "Q: Cinch doesn't work | How do I enable access to assistive devices in OS X 10.9 Mavericks? Cinch requires us to \"Enable access to assistive devices\". However this option is not found on OS X Mavericks > System Preferences.

The columns available when viewing processes in the memory tab now include \"Memory\", \"Real Memory\", \"Real Private Memory\", \"Real Shared Memory\" and \"Purgeable Memory\".\nI would have thought that since \"Virtual Memory\" has disappeared and \"Memory\" has appeared that they are equivalent, however that doesn't seem to add up because shouldn't then \"Memory\" be always greater than or equal to \"Real Memory\"?  (If I'm interpreting the terminology correctly, Real Memory is the number of pages currently resident in RAM, and Virtual memory is the number of pages total, including those swapped out to disk, compressed, etc....) However in Activity monitor, \"Memory\" is always less than \"Real Memory\".  Can anyone explain what this mysterious \"Memory\" metric is?\n\nA: For each process there is \n\n\n*\n\n*Real Memory (always at least as big as Memory)\n\n*\n\n*Total Memory currently consumed by an application (including Virtual pages)\n\n\n*Memory\n\n*\n\n*Memory used in RAM\n\n\n*Purgeable Memory\n\n*\n\n*Memory which can be cleaned by MMU, if another process needs more real memory.\n\n\n\nThen, for the system in total\n\n\n*\n\n*Physical Memory\n\n*\n\n*The amount of RAM installed.\n\n\n*Memory Used\n\n*\n\n*The amount of RAM being used and not immediately available.\n\n\n*Virtual Memory\n\n*\n\n*The amount of disk or flash drive space being used as virtual memory.\n\n\n*Swap Used\n\n*\n\n*The space on your drive being used to swap unused files to and from RAM.\n\n\n*App Memory\n\n*\n\n*The amount of space being used by apps.\n\n\n*Wired Memory\n\n*\n\n*Memory that can’t be cached to disk, so it must stay in RAM.

Every time I connect my iPhone 5S (7.0.3, but have had this issue since 7.0 with both 5S and iPhone 4) to my computer (Latitude E6410 with Windows 7 Pro) I get prompted to Trust the computer. I trust it, and each time I reconnect the USB cable, the prompt returns.\nI am not alone. \nGoogling this issue, it seems to affect a large number of Windows 7 users. There isn't a single solution that appears to work for everyone, but this one seems to have helped some:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS1567\nHowever, it presupposes the presence of the AMDS service. I do not have this service, I presume because I do not have iTunes installed (and I would prefer not to install it). Nowhere could I find any information from Apple about whether iTunes is required for Trust. \nSo my questions are:\n(a) is it true the iTunes is required for establishing \"Trust\"?\nand \n(b) if so, is there a workaround?\nNote: this post (related to Linux) would imply to me that it should work without iTunes:\niOS7 won't trust linux computer\n\nA: Definitely yes. You must have iTunes installed in order for the \"Trust computer\" option to be remembered.\nWhat you can do is the following:\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily install iTunes, do not run the program itself on your computer\n\n\n*Connect the iPhone and tap \"Trust\"\n\n\n*Go to the newly-created Apple Lockdown folder on Win 7 it is found here:\nC:\\ProgramData\\Apple\\Lockdown\n\n\n*Copy the whole folder and paste it to a location you can remember (i.e. PC Desktop)\n\n\n*Fully uninstall iTunes from your computer\n\n\n*Install the iOS drivers without installing iTunes (these drivers are needed in order for your PC to correctly recognize the iPhone\n\n\n*Restart PC if needed\n\n\n*Navigate to:  C:\\ProgramData\\\n\n\n*Add a new folder named \"Apple\" and inside it paste the \"Lockdown\" folder along with its contents.\n\n\n*This will keep your iPhone trust setting without the need for iTunes being installed\n\nA: This is a security feature to prevent computers from automatically downloading content from your phone.\nSimple fix in Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your phone into your computer.\n\n*Open Control Panel\n\n*If you are viewing by category, click on \"Hardware and Sound\", then \"AutoPlay\".

How do we set up the guest account so it restricts Internet access to all applications and scripts in all ports?\nUsing parental controls only restricts web access, and I'm looking how to prevent any application to access the Internet.\nI'm looking for a free solution that works even if the (guest) user runs malicious scripts. USB access is required for the guest account.\nIn Ubuntu we can restrict user access with a command like this:\nsudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p all -m owner --uid-owner example_user -j DROP\n\n\nA: Please read this carefully and have another device with internet access, in case you are locking yourself out.\nIn OS X you will use the OpenBSD based tool pf which stands for \"packet filter\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Helpful man pages are man pfctl and man pf.conf\n\n*You need sudo access.\nEdit /etc/pf.conf to your desired needings:\nAn example pf.conf would be simple as this and look like this\n## blocking rule\nblock out user guest\n\nNow activate pfctl with sudo pfctl -e and load your config with\nsudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf. \nFor checking the syntax of the config file you can use pfctl -nf /etc/pf.conf.\nIf you want to deactivate the firewall, pass the command pfctl -d.\nTesting the new configuration is as simple as curl -I apple.stackexchange.com. The firewall should block this for you.\nHowever, I'd be careful with restrictions. If you are losing your Mac or it gets stolen, the guest account is the only account which one will be has access too(hopefully) which in return should have access to the internet to track it down(if \"Find My Mac\" is enabled).\n", "Q: Recovering iPhone 3GS on iOS 6 My precious iPhone 3GS which I've treasured for four years has finally had its first \"issue\".\nI decided yesterday to finally get rid of the update available indication (the \"1\" badge) that's been sitting next to the Settings.app icon and run the update on my iPhone 3GS (iOS 6.1.3).  It downloaded fine but unfortunately it came up with an error message when it tried to apply the update (direct to phone, not via PC/iTunes).\nInconvenient, but I can just recover it from the last restore, can't I? Unfortunately when I try to recover the phone it sits there for 15 minutes then gives an error message because it can't find 100 tracks (in fact it can't find any, but I presume that it stops keeping track after 100) then it pops up with another message saying it can't find the apps.\nThe music is definitely there - I played a few tracks via iTunes to check.  Am I doing something wrong?  Sure I can reinstall everything from scratch but will lose any progress/settings in apps and there is quite a lot to lose.\nI'm running the latest iTunes on a PC and have all media on an external drive but it syncs fine with my iPad and plays media fine.\n\nA: I've managed to fix my problem :)\nThe root cause of the problem is that my external drive (WD My Book Raid 1) has my library on it and had gone into hibernation while the phone was restoring the ios.  This meant that when iTunes had finished installing the operating system on the phone and tried to reinstall the content it could no longer see the external drive.  Why my drive is doing this is a different problem.  Details of what I did to fix the problem...\n\nPlease note that these instructions are specific to my issue of an iPhone 3GS running IOS 6 with iTunes on a PC and the library on an external drive.  It worked for me but proceed at your own risk.\n\nSet iTunes to play content from the library so it is constantly accessing the drive and stopping it hibernating.\nMake sure the iPhone is disconnected and turn it off ( to turn off press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a few seconds until the red \"slide to power off\" slider   appears, and then slide the slider).\nIn iTunes go to (menu bar) Edit, click preferences then devices in the top of the popup window.\nIn the device backups box is a list of the backups stored on your computer for your device with a device name and date.  In my case the several failed attempts to restore the phone had left a few backups that are newer than when the phone was last working.  I highlighted and deleted all backups FOR THAT DEVICE created since the phone was working.  NOTE - YOU WILL LOOSE ALL CONTACTS, TEXTS, LOCALLY STORED CALENDAR ENTRY'S ETC. CREATED SINCE THAT BACKUP\nOnce you've deleted any unwanted backups click OK to exit.\nConnect the iPhone to your PC\nPut the iPhone into DFU (recovery) mode.  There are various videos / guides online just search or try this one which is MAC specific but identical for a PC.\niTtunes will then guide you through recovering the phone.\nFor me, once the phone operating system had loaded (15 mins ish) this initially came up with an error message (100+ tracks couldn't be found...) but it did back up everything fine (took several hours).  I even got back all scores on games etc. so am very happy.  Of cause all progress, changes etc. made since the last backup were lost, but I'd rather loose a couple of weeks information than everything.\nNote to self - backup more often!

At the moment I'm using both uname and sw_vers\ndarwin_version=`uname -r`\nosx_version=`sw_vers -productVersion`\n\nBut if I want to display the commercial name (Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks, ...) I have to manually maintain a list of osx version - commercial name pair.\nI'd like to avoid that manual mapping and rely on system data. Is it possible ?\n\nA: Well as you said it : it's a commercial name and it's barely present in the OS it self. It no real wonder, it has no meaning for devs (far less than a version or a build number). \nAFAIK It's mentioned in some help pages, but that's almost all.\nSo until someone would prove me wrong, there is no CLI for that (excluding curl stuff, which would imho not be a suitable option here).\n", "Q: Mail.app stopped working after upgrade to OS X Mavericks Mail.app is not working since the upgrade to OS X Mavericks.

Postbox seems to be built on the Thunderbird engine (which also works well) but it adds additional features. I use multiple Gmail and IMAP accounts, but I don't currently use any POP accounts -- based on past experience with Thunderbird I wouldn't expect any problems.\n\nA: Suffered the same pains as you, I think, when upgrading my machines to Mavericks, especially with gmail accounts. I solved my problems by moving all the gmail accounts to the AirMail client. It is good, it has a modern look (it did cost me a couple(! :-) ) of bucks on the App Store), with a lot functionality and it is being actively maintained. They have a stable version for sale on the App Store, but also a Beta channel that is as good and gets more frequent fixes (I use their Beta version).

When a program uses that memory for computation, the amount used for the disk cache is used correspondingly.\nWhy do you think it’s bad that your memory is used?

Apple announced the new iPad Mini models, and they look spectacular. I've never owned a device with a cellular data plan before, and the idea of near-ubiquitous connectivity sounds truly amazing. But buying a model locks you in to a particular carrier, and the carriers have very different pricing structures when it comes to data.\nHow would someone who has never used a device with a cellular data plan determine the amount of data they likely would need? Are there web sites with use cases of \"this set of uses uses approximately this much data\"? Ways to track data use from an iPod touch or MacBook Air to get a comparison? Without having used one of these before, what resources could help a consumer make an informed decision about how much data s/he is likely to consume before purchasing a device and thus locking into one carrier's pricing structure?\n\nA: Addressing your query head on - several US carriers have very nice planning tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verizon Wireless Data Calculator\n\n*AT&T Wireless Data Calculator\nBoth are quite close to what I'm seeing for my usage patterns (one calculates 2.5 GB and the other 3.15 GB) in practice.\nI would say to take these with a grain of salt since with iOS 7 - you now have exceptionally good information on exactly which app used exactly how much data. That coupled with automatic data alerts that you can configure from the carrier to alert you at whatever levels you want, you can easily shut off parts of cellular data (or all cellular data) to shape your usage without having to downgrade your cellular service.\nIn effect, iOS 7 makes it easy to steer your usage to fit your budget if and when you find yourself using more data than planned.\nAlso, in the US - you are not locked into any level of data as the service is month to month. I often have months where I tether 2 or 4 GB extra data for business reasons. I have a shared data plan between my phone and iPad so a quick online session upgrades that month to the next higher tier of data. I set an alarm to undo that change at the end of my bill cycle and there are no fees to increase and decrease - just fees for the data (and overage should you go there for a month). For me, the extra $10 for a month is far less than the overage of $15 per GB and simpler for me to manage when bursts or overages happen (I'm looking at you iTunes match streaming all night on an iPad while in my bag with the smart cover closed :/\n\nA: It's very hard to track existing data usage, much less project future usage on a device that you haven't previously owned and are potentially just guessing how you will use it.  Who knows what wild and wacky use cases you will find once you start using it?\nOther iOS devices now track data usage from iOS7 onwards, but only for mobile data, not Wifi so you can't for example work out how much mail you were previously receiving on your iPod Touch over Wifi in order to take a guess at how much you may subsequently receive in the future over mobile data connections.\nMy biggest mobile data users over the last month has turned out to be Facebook > Podcasts > Safari > Mail in that order, but even this is not common usage, because during this period I spent time away with no Wifi on a social event that ended up with a lot of photo viewing/uploading on Facebook that I would normally do from home on a Mac, and forgetting to pre-download my podcasts for the several hours drive there and back...Luckily I had pre-loaded the map routing over WiFi so that was OK.\nWhat I can do, again anecdotally, but perhaps more relevant, is know that I have only ever gone above 1Gb once since I got an iPhone, and I consider myself to be a relatively heavy user in some respects.  I recently downgraded from an unlimited plan to a 1Gb one because it saved me a little money, and approximately half the time I don't even get above 250Mb per month.\nAs for pricing, I can't comment on US pricing structures, but in the UK, I can get an iPad from anywhere fully unlocked to all networks, and my own choice of carrier provides monthly data plans on a pay as you go basis from £5 for 500Mb, £7.50 for 1Gb and £12.50 for 3Gb, so if you were in the UK my advice would be to use a carrier with no contracts and choose what you might need each month based on your anticipated usage (If I am going on holiday, I simply won't buy one until I get home for example).\nSo the key answer is forget about trying to anticpate or judge what you might use, and get yourself an unlocked iPad, and a carrier that allows you to change your data plan to suit your immediate requirements rather than get locked into a 12 month contract.\n\nA: As far as I can see the safest way is to get the lowest plan that fits your needs, watch your usage closely and upgrade if needed because even if you lock into a 2 yr plan with a US carrier you can upgrade your plan without penalties which can't be said the same when downgrading. \n", "Q: Disable \"Tags\" prompt in OS 10.9 Save dialog In Mavericks, the Save dialog now offers the ability to add Tags to the file you're saving:\n\nSupposing I want to remove this prompt, likely by running a shell command involving defaults write com.apple.finder.

Is there a way to configure Quicksilver so it will open folders in new Finder tabs? Right now, when I use QS to navigate to a folder location and select the \"Open\" option from the actions pane QS opens a new Finder window at that folder location. \nNow that there are tabs in the Finder, I'd like it to bring an existing Finder window to the front and open the selected file in a new tab. Is that even possible, since tabs are a new feature of Mavericks?\n\nA: For folders, as with any other type of file, Quicksilver just asks OS X to open the file. The OS decides what to do from there.\nIt’s the same as typing open /path/to/folder in Terminal. So, if you can get that to open folders in a new tab, Quicksilver should start doing it too.\n(I think Finder would need a preference to control this behavior, and I don’t see one.)\n\nA: Just for the record: A Quicksilver Action Apple script for Open in New Tab was posted on the Quicksilver blog: Opening Folders in Finder Tabs.\n", "Q: Cannot send iMessage from MacBook Pro I have been using my MacBook Pro for nearly 2 years.

Also, I cannot use FaceTime on my Mac.\nI reviewed through the internet for some solutions, but nothing seems to work, such as deleting files, changing setting on the Flash Player.\nHow can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: It has something to do with not having a serial number on your Mac (after motherboard repair or so).

However, since upgrading to Mavericks, this account no longer appears in the \"Users & Groups\" System Preferences pane. I believe this is because it conflicted with the built-in \"Shared\" folder in /Users/Shared, so Mavericks probably had trouble with this account when upgrading OS X.\nHowever, the account itself still works, with my old password. Is there a way to delete this account, even if it doesn't appear in \"Users & Groups\", without deleting the /Users/Shared folder (which is separate; the folder is part of OS X, and my \"Sharing only\" account has no Home folder).\n\nA: I have had this issue as well and I found a solution:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS4404 on the Apple support website.\nJust type the following two commands in terminal:\nQuit and reopen System preferences and the sharing account will show up:\nsudo dscl . create /Users/root GeneratedUID FFFFEEEE-DDDD-CCCC-BBBB-AAAA00000000\nand then:\nsudo dscl . create /Users/accountname UserShell /bin/bash\nReplace \"accountname\" in the commands above with the missing account name.\n\nA: This helped me a lot!

I'm running Mac OS X Mavericks and I have several apps set up to use fullscreen mode.  There's no dock at the bottom of the screen, and it doesn't appear either when I scroll to the bottom of the screen like it normally does in non-fullscreen mode.\nHow can I reveal the dock when in fullscreen mode?\n\nA: After you reach the bottom of the screen with the mouse cursor, keep sliding your finger down in the trackpad.\n\nA: It appears that the trick is to move the cursor to the bottom of screen like I normally would, but KEEP MY FINGER ON THE TRACKPAD when I get there.  If you take your finger off of the trackpad, the dock won't appear, but if you keep it there then it will.\n(There are other reports that moving the cursor to the bottom of the screen and then repeating the same action again can make the dock appear, but I had inconsistent results with that technique.)\n\nA: You can check this out yourself:\nWhen you fast-move the cursor to where your Dock is hidden or when you pause right there and let the cursor hover. No Dock.\nHere’s the trick:\nYou need to move the cursor very slowly. That’s all you need to do. If you move it too fast to the edge of your screen, the Dock won’t show up.\n\nA: When you are in non-full screen mode the dock appears when you move cursor to bottom. But, in full screen apple developers probably didn't want you to be distracted when you take your cursor down(say to select a text at last line of the document), that's why you need to keep your cursor there and not move your finger from trackpad. In other words, dock is not a preference when in full screen mode.\n\nA: You go to Setting>Dock>Uncheck Auto hide dock\n\nA: The real trick is you have to think your dock is hidden 1 inch bottom of the full screen app's bottom part. Then you have to move your cursor more deep than you would usually do.

My question is in the title: does OS X allow to set a shortcut with backspace, like  Ctrl+Option ⌥+Command ⌘+backspace (in my case to an Automator service)? \nEdit:\nYou might think \"Try it yourself\"; well, I did it. In System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts, I tried to add this shortcut to my service and it doesn't work. The problem seems to be with backspace. Ctrl+Option ⌥+Command ⌘+m works well.\nDoes anybody know a workaround that allows me to use the backspace key in a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: To change the shortcut of a service, run plutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/pbs.plist, open the plist, and change for example\n<key>(null) - Some Service - runWorkflowAsService</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>key_equivalent</key>\n    <string>@~a</string>\n</dict>\n\nto\n<key>(null) - Some Service - runWorkflowAsService</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>key_equivalent</key>\n    <string>@~&#x8;</string>\n</dict>\n\nThen restart to apply the changes.\n@ is command, ~ is option, and &#x8; is delete (Windows backspace). Forward delete (Windows delete) would be &#x7f;. The shortcut strings use the same format as in DefaultKeyBinding.dict.\nTo change a global shortcut set in the App Shortcuts section, run plutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist, open the plist, and change for example\n<key>Some Menu Name</key>\n<string>~@a</string>\n\nto\n<key>Some Menu Name</key>\n<string>~@&#x8;</string>\n\nThen quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.\nApplication-specific shortcuts are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/*.plist and ~/Library/Containers/*/Data/Library/Preferences/*.plist.\n\nA: The favorite answer here is substantially correct. However, pasting &#x8; for Backspace didn't work for me. It wound up as 8 in the menu. The technique that worked for me was to open the Emoji and Symbols viewer.\nYou can follow the instructions in that answer up to the point where you need to type this string, and then use the instructions below:\n\nYou can press Control-Command-Space, or if that keyboard shortcut doesn't work, you can activate a menu from the Keyboard section of the Keyboard system preference pane by checking \"Show keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar.\"\n\n*\n\n*Use the shortcut, or from the menu bar, find the keyboard and emoji input menu  and choose \"Show Emoji and Symbols.\"\n\n*By default, you'll see the Emoji window. In the top-right corner you'll see the same icon, which you can click to switch to the Symbols viewer.\n\n*From the list on the left, choose Technical Symbols.\n\n*Look for the symbol for \"Erase to the left\" (), which for me appears at the beginning of the third row.\n\n*Make sure your text insertion point is positioned where you want to insert the symbol.\n\n*Double-click on the symbol to insert it into the text.\n\nFrom there you can save your plist and continue with the instructions from the original answer.\nAlso note that if you have Xcode installed, or another app that can read and edit plist files natively, you don't have to convert the plist to XML.\n\nA: While it's not free, Keyboard Maestro will solve your problem.\nHere's a very simple example: Just set the Hot Key to ⌘Delete (by pressing ⌘+⌦) and assign a menu item for it to activate. You can also specify the applications that the shortcut will work in, so you can reuse the trigger.\n\nOf course, given that's it's a very powerful macro program, you can set it to do much more complicated tasks—from running Applescripts to manipulating Markdown.\n\nA: *\n\n*Step 1 - get karabiner (if it's not already on your mac, which it might be). \n\n*Step 2 - open Karabiner\n\n*Step 3 - go to \"change backslash key\"\n\n*Step 4 - click \"change backslash to forward delete / + (Fn+backslash to backslash\"\n\n*Step 5 - close window.\n\n\nThis makes the backslash key the delete key.

Using Wireshark I managed to\n  see that packets were being dropped when transferring over the network\n  - the same patterns didn't exist with the same transfer over wireless or the same transfer wired to a Windows server.\nSo I Googled a little and came up with the following command:\nping -c 1 -D -s 1500 smbserver\nIt basically pings the server with an MTU of 1500, to which I got:\nping: sendto: Message too long\nNote that I also get this error on a Windows server - but what may be\n  the issue is that when your software gets this response it is supposed\n  to automatically decrease the MTU until it finds the optimal one for\n  transfer of packets - something that Mavericks appears to be doing\n  with Windows servers but not with Linux ones.\nSo using the ping command I can find an optimal MTU for transfer:\nping -c 1 -D -s 1320 smbserver\nNow I get the answer:\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.829/0.829/0.829/0.000 ms\nI had to mess around trying to find the optimal level but it gives you\n  an idea on the test.  After this I take my number and go to:\nSystem Preferences -> Network -> USB Ethernet -> Advanced... ->\n  Hardware -> Configure: Manually -> MTU Custom: 1320\nAfter this, I disconnected my shares, re-established them and then\n  tried another transfer up to my Linux server.  Success! Granted it's\n  not what I'd deem to be full speed, but to get a 5GB transfer down\n  from 8 hours to 30 minutes seems better.   It has taken it from\n  completely unusable to tolerable.\nI'm not entirely sure what the root of the problem is as I'm not a\n  networking expert, as the stepping back of MTU appears to work on a\n  Windows server and not a Linux one, and it worked fine in previous\n  versions of OS X, my guess is that it is driver and/or stack related.\nBTW I tried updating to 10.9.1 via the Developer download before\n  trying this, the 10.9.1 upgrade didn't fix the issue for me before I\n  went troubleshooting.\n\n", "Q: Backup, share, or save iPhone voicemail messages? Is there a way to export, save, share, or e-mail voicemail (not Voice Memos) from the iPhone?\nI am guessing there are some under-the-hood ways to get at the files once you sync to a desktop, but is there any way to do it straight from the iPhone?\nI have seen this response for jailbroken phones.\nHow can I backup and archive my iOS voicemail messages?\n\nA: I believe there are applications that can extract the voice messages from your phone but they cost money and required the phone be plugged in to the computer.\nThe simplest way is to connect your phone to your computer with a 3.5mm audio cable. Use a simple audio recording app, such as Audacity, click record and play the voice message. \n\nA: I've used Decipher Voice Mail for a year or so and it saves all my iPhone voicemails as mp3 files on my computer. Great little program that enabled me to save my grandmother's voicemails after she passed away.\n\nA: I used a third party app called TouchCopy to save my iPhone voicemail messages to my computer.\n\nTouchCopy allows you to play and copy Voice Mail messages you have received on your iPhone. To view all Voice Mails stored on your iPhone, click the Voice Mail button in TouchCopy.\nTouchCopy will copy messages from your iPhone if your iPhone supports Visual Voice Mail. These will be voice mails that are provided as part of the Visual Voice Mail data plan from your mobile service provider.\n\nSource: Copying iPhone Voice Mails with TouchCopy\nNote that the voice mails actually need to be stored on your iPhone rather than by the network operator for it to work.\n\nA: I have a Google Voice number that I just forward important voicemails to.\nTo do this in a typical voicemail system, you'd press 6 for more options, then 2 to forward it.\nYou can keep them in your Google account pretty much as long as you want, or you can simply download them at will.\nI hope this is helpful.\n\nA: Most people use PhoneView for this. It's an app from Ecamm:\nhttp://www.ecamm.com\nYou plug the iPhone to the Mac, and it all shows up on the computer. \n\nA: I have used http://VoicemailsForever.com It was really simple and took me just a few minutes to get it done.\n\nA: Here are a few more programs that let you export voicemails from your iPhone to your PC:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMazing (not free, and only allows you to export one voicemail in trial mode)\n\n*iBackupBot (not free, but allows you to export all voicemails in trial mode)\n\n*iExplorer (not free, and does not let you export any voicemail in trial mode)\n\n\nAll three programs run on Mac or Windows.\n\nA: No - iOS versions up to and including iOS 9 do not allow you to forward, edit, share or otherwise push a voicemail that is stored on the device.\nYou'll need to avail yourself to a jailbreak mod (I don't recommend this) or a tool to read the files from the phone when it's paired with a computer. You can use USB or WiFi pairing and there are many choices of apps to grab the voicemail files but they depend on your choice of computer OS.\nLastly, contact your carrier - they might allow you to forward a message that's still on their servers or be able to assist you. Again - there are hundreds of carriers, so that's more a thing to research for your specific carrier or change carriers if you can find one to help with this function/feature.\n\nA: Apple has released a support document for how to save iOS Voicemail messages:\n\nSave and share Visual Voicemail messages on your iPhone\nSave your Visual Voicemail messages as notes or voice memos, and share them using Messages, Mail, or Airdrop.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205012\n\nApple's advice is to save the voicemail message via the Notes or Voice Memos app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Phone > Voicemail.\n\n*Tap the voicemail message that you'd like to save, then tap the share button.\n\n*Choose Notes or Voice Memos. Then save your voicemail message. Or choose Messages, Mail, or AirDrop, then type and send your message with the attached voicemail. You can also share the voicemail by tapping an AirDrop contact.\n\n\n\nA: You can use the iOS Screen Recording feature to record the Visual Voicemail playback within the iOS Phone app.\nThis video recording will be saved to your iCloud Photos Library. You can then adjust the Date & Time on the video so that it appears in your library exactly when the Voicemail was actually recorded.\nThis technique also saves the Visual Voicemail transcription of the Voicemail message, which in nice to have as a preview of the audio when scrolling through your Photo Library.\n\n\n\nA: Connect your device to iTunes using USB or Wi-Fi, select the device, then the Music tab and check the Voice Memos option, then sync the device.\n\nA: Have Siri call your voicemail for you...

I don't know if this is a unique problem, but the screen brightness is automatically adjusting on it's own. \nIf I set it for about half the bars (50%), I'll be working, then notice that the screen is brighter than normal.  I'll check and it'll be at 75% or higher. Then, when I open the MacBook from sleep, sometimes the brightness is at 100% and sometimes it'll be 10%. \nWhat gives? Is there a automatic adjust brightness setting on the new OS that I need to turn off? \n\nA: There is an automatic brightness adjustment setting, but it's not new to Mavericks.  In System Preferences, check Displays; the setting is called \"Automatically adjust brightness\".\n\nIt adjusts based on a light sensor near your MacBook's built-in camera.  I've found it to be fairly good, but occasionally tipping my MacBook Air's display back a little further back than usual will make the light sensor detect more light and brightens the display considerably.\n\nA: Sorry for the 'me too', but my 2012 MBA started to behave like that after upgrading to Mavericks. That is, with stable ambient lightning conditions, the screen background lightning is fluctuating. When I open the Preferences/Displays panel, I can see the slider move up and down by itself.\nI eliminated the symptom by unchecking the \"Automatically adjust brightness\" box, but it seems like a bug in Mavericks.\n", "Q: How Can OS 10.9 Kotoeri Keyboard Layout Behavior Be Reverted To That of 10.8 and Earlier In OS 10.8, you could set the keyboard layout for Japanese input in Kotoeri Preferences.  The default was US, which generates the correct layout for a JIS hardware keyboard.  In 10.9, Apple deleted this preference setting, and the keyboard layout is now set by whichever layout was most recently used.  So now anyone who normally uses something other than US winds up with output that does not fit a JIS keyboard, unless they go to the trouble of switching to the US layout before they do so, which is major inconvenience.  It seems like one should be able to fix this via some sort of .plist modification or \"defaults write\" command line input, but I can't figure out how.\nAnother way to put it is:  How can one make US the default layout for Kotoeri input in 10.9, even when US is not on the list of user keyboards, but something else like French is.\n\nA: This bug was fixed by Apple with update 10.9.1 of 12/17/2013\nhttp://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2013/12/mavericks-update-fixes-japanese-input.html\n", "Q: Does Safari on OS X Mavericks Ignore Browsing History Preferences? I have posted in greater detail about this on a blog post at\nhttps://browserprivacy.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/does-safari-on-os-x-mavericks-ignore-browsing-history-preferences/\nbut this excerpt is the gist of my question:\nTo verify that Safari has actually deleted my cookies as the GUI suggests, I sometimes check my ~/Library/Cookies folder where Safari and other applications store cookies in files with names like com.apple.appstore.cookies, Cookies.binarycookies, and a file I had never seen before called HSTS.plist.    A quick Google search revealed very little pertaining to this particular HSTS.plist file, but HSTS may stand for HTTP Strict Transport Security, a web standard that allows web servers to mandate browsers interact with it using only HTTPS connections.  I was surprised to see my previous (as in pre-Mavericks) browsing history comprised of over 100 sites I had visited within the past few months listed in this ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist file.\n  HSTS.plist Structure\nOpening my ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist file in TextWrangler revealed the following structure:\n<?xml version=”1.0″ encoding=”UTF-8″?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC “-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN” “http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd”&gt;\n<plist version=”1.0″>\n<dict>\n<key>com.apple.CFNetwork.defaultStorageSession</key>\n<dict>\n<key>HSTS Content Version</key>\n<integer>1</integer>\n<key>HSTS Store Schema Version</key>\n<integer>2</integer>\n<key>accounts.google.com</key>\n<real>-infinity</real>\n\n <… and so on, with “real” values of either infinity or -infinity ..>\n\n</dict>\n<key>hstsd Disk Storage Schema Version</key>\n<integer>1</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nPerhaps oddly, I also found no search results when I searched Google for “hstsd Disk Storage Schema Version”.\nThis ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist file contained browsing history that I apparently had no way of permanently deleting, and which could potentially be used as a fingerprint for tracking (if accessible via WebKit) by Apple or others. Another thing that amazed me was that this file persisted in the sense that the HSTS.plist file and its original contents were replaced within a few minutes—perhaps via iCloud syncing…even though this machine did not have iCloud or any “Internet Accounts” enabled—even after multiple iterations of disabling all plug-ins, “Reset Safari..”, toggling “Private Browsing” on and off, and restarting the machine plus all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Closing Safari and other applications, deleting the HSTS.plist file, restarting\n\n*Closing Safari and other applications, deleting the re-spawned HSTS.plist file, saving a blank text file to ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist, making its permissions read-only and myself owner, and then restarting\n\n*Logging in with another user’s account (with Administrator rights), deleting the HSTS.plist file, and restarting\n\n*Logging in with another user’s account (with Administrator rights), deleting the HSTS.plist file, saving a blank file with the same filename in that file’s location, setting its permission to read-only with another user as the owner, and then restarting\n\n\nUsing fseventer, I was able to see that this HSTS.plist file (and the browsing history it contained) re-spawning behavior occurred whenever I opened Safari and toggled Private Browsing mode. At least on this machine, HSTS.plist never re-spawns itself unless I’m connected to the internet.\nThis leaves me puzzled, so I would appreciate any reactions or responses you may have in the comments.  Could this be:\n- malware?  This seems less likely, since a scan of the hard drive in safe mode with clamXav turned up clean.\n- an artifact of a previous non-standard configuration?  Perhaps this behavior is somehow related to something like Safari Mobile Bookmarks Sync (which I had disabled), or some sort of upgrade hiccup associated with upgrading a fully-patched copy of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 to OS X Mavericks 10.9 a few days prior?\n- a potential new cookie-like vector that Apple and/or advertisers could potentially use to fingerprint users via a snapshot of their HTTPS browsing history, even when using Safari’s Private Browsing mode?  This would be an outrage.\n- a new “feature” associated with Safari’s implementation of HSTS?  Given the potential privacy implications, this would also be an outrage.\nAside from completely wiping the machine and reinstalling everything from scratch, I’m not sure what to do to get this artifact of old browsing history off of my machine. Even if this ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist is just a simple cache of HSTS-enabled websites visited, it’s highly undesirable because it leaks browsing history–even in Private Browsing mode, and even across the GUI-accessible history and cache-clearing functions–and appears to be a highly persistent potential vector for fingerprinting users.\n\nA: Isn't it just a list of sites known to request https only ?.\nmine is - domains are there that I've never visited, and the list is similar to the\n \"// Force HTTPS for sites that have requested it\" section of http://pastebin.com/WQijpvR4\n", "Q: Deleting files with applescript messes up Finder's CoverFlow I wrote myself a little script to delete JPG+RAW files by just reviewing my JPG (who loads faster thant CR2).\nI've put the following code in an Automator service bound to a keyboard shortcut.\non run {input, parameters}\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set myFile to item 1 of input\n    set {dispName, nameExt} to the {displayed name, name extension} of myFile\n    set extLength to length of nameExt\n    set nameWithoutExt to (characters 1 thru ((length of dispName) - extLength) of dispName) -- with the . at the end\n    set rawfile to ((parent of myFile as string) & nameWithoutExt & \"CR2\") as string\n    \n    set fileIndex to index of myFile\n    \n    delete every item in {myFile, rawfile}\n    \n    select file fileIndex of window 1\nend tell\nend run\n\nIt works well but it seems to mess with Finder's cover flow : The pictures are not deleted in the coverflow.

Since there's no actual gain by doing this, a 1080p30 capture card should suffice.\nOn the apps side, according to benchmark tests by phonearena.com on the iPad 3rd Generation, it was able to go up to 60fps (depending on the test). But note that this is just graphics rendering frame rate, not video decoding or even video recording (the latter is just 30fps according to Apple's specifications page).

IMAP has better support for multiple devices, and leaves the messages on the server by default. For more info on POP vs. IMAP here's a good link.\nNote that you shouldn't just change the protocol, since a part of your messages has been downloaded to your device and deleted from the server. If you change the protocol, you may experience data loss. Instead, create a new account with IMAP and the same logins, and move the missing emails to the new account. After this, it's safe to get rid of the POP account and start using the IMAP version.

For example, I do this for a folder in which I store a handful of scripts I made myself, along with a few key utilities, such as mozjpeg, that I want the system to always use instead of the defaults it comes with (that way all the jpeg files saved by pretty much any program get automatically compressed by up to 10 % more than the regular system cjpeg utility would compress them - I've read that the reason it isn't default on most systems is because it's much slower, but when you're talking something like 0.14 seconds as opposed to 0.02 seconds, the \"slower by a factor of 7\" doesn't really mean much of anything... assuming this is not a server, of course). I know plenty of people will probably warn about the potential \"danger\" of making edits this deeply in the system, but I'd say that if you're looking for an answer like this, you probably know enough to deal with any utility naming conflicts that may potentially arise in the future, and simply making your changes in /private/etc/paths really does propagate them to all users/logins/instances possible - all programs, shells, etc will use the paths in that file to build the base of their $PATH variable. \nTo be honest, I'm quite surprised no one else here mentioned this yet. All that messing around with launchd and distractions about SSH-specific uses... this is the solution anyone searching for this basic issue is really looking for - the clean, straight-to-the-source, always-working solution.\nBy the way, in case you're wondering, on OS X /etc is simply a symlink to /private/etc, so you could just as easily do sudo nano /etc/paths and get to the same exact place. The above path is just the complete actual path of the file.\n\nA: The correct file, prior to Mavericks, was ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist. This is no longer supported. \nIn Darwin, and therefore in Mac OS X, the proper place to set these is in /etc/launchd.conf to apply to all processes; if relating to user shells specifically, use the appropriate shell files instead, depending on the shell in question. See the launchd.conf and launchctl man pages for more. \nThat said...\nIf you're goal is specifically to see these applied for ssh sessions then you need to be aware that ssh, for security reasons, doesn't apply environment variables in this manner. In fact a ssh session normally receives a much more restrictive set of environment variables from the OS as it's not what is known as a \"login\" or \"interactive\" shell, it's classified as an \"non-interactive\" shell. (See man bash for more on shell types.) The way ssh handles environment variables is well covered in the ssh/sshd docs and man pages. \nFor ssh -- which is it's own shell, akin to bash -- environment variables for the session are stored in ~/.ssh/environment as the per-user equivalent of setting these for bash or csh, etc in their relevant launch files. This is probably where you want to set your ENV variables for your user ssh sessions, though you don't detail why you're looking to assign ENVs globally in your original post, which would have been helpful in providing a solution. I'd suggest you set them explicitly on a user per user basis to maintain proper security based on each respective account following the least restrictive privilege/attribute best practice. \nIf for some reason you wish to ignore he security implications of this, then set PermitUserEnvironment in your ssh configs. Note that this is disabled if UseLogin is enabled. IMPORTANT: Realize that this means that user accounts set to use /bin/false as their shell - the typical method for disabling a user account -  can now potentially get around this restriction and could now become active, which is dangerous. Many accounts are set to use /bin/false as their shell as a security expectation. \nBottom line is you shouldn't be doing this globally and expecting ssh to propagate ENV for security reasons. Your question is, effectively, purposely asking how to defeat several mechanisms that exist for security reasons. \n\nA: If you are using bash, then setting the environment variables in /etc/profile will apply for all users.\nFrom the bash manual on OS X Mavericks, with my emphasis (this has not changed from previous versions):\n\nWhen  bash  is  invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading  that  file,  it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.\n  ...\nIf bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well. When invoked as an inter-active interactive active login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from /etc/profile and ~/.profile, in that order.\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem, specifically ~/.bashrc wasn't being sourced when I connected to my machine via SSH. I found that changing a configuration setting for SSHd did the trick. Perhaps your problem also lies with the SSH daemon?\nModify the SSH service's configuration file as follows:\n# /etc/sshd_config\nPermitUserEnvironment yes\n\nThen restart the Remote Login service in System Preferences > Sharing.\nFrom the sshd_config manpage:\n PermitUserEnvironment\n         Specifies whether ~/.ssh/environment and environment= options in\n         ~/.ssh/authorized_keys are processed by sshd(8).  The default is\n         ``no''.  Enabling environment processing may enable users to\n         bypass access restrictions in some configurations using mecha-\n         nisms such as LD_PRELOAD.\n\n(In case it helps, I've written up how I tested this on my personal wiki)\n\nA: If others search for how to set environment variables for processes started from a normal graphical login session, you can use /etc/launchd.conf. To for example add /usr/local/bin to the default path, run\necho setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin|sudo tee -a /etc/launchd.conf\n\nand restart to apply the changes. Another way to apply the changes is to run launchctl</etc/launchd.conf;sudo launchctl</etc/launchd.conf and relaunch processes.\n\nA: Hmm... As of Mac OS X 10.10.5 and probably earlier, man -s5 launchd.conf tells us: \"launchd.conf is no longer respected by the system.\"  I have too much stuff going on right now to put a dummy variable in the file and restart to see if it really does work or not after all, but the documentation says it should not work.\nI'm pretty sure it won't. Do man launchctl and you'll see: \"The /etc/launchd.conf file is no longer consulted for subcommands to run during early boot time; this functionality was removed for security considerations.\"\nWhat you can do is put all the environment variables you want to be global-ish into some file, perhaps called environment in keeping with Linux, or (in case Apple decides to do something with that later – you never know) environment.conf, like I did, then source this via /etc/profile:\nif [ -f /etc/environment.conf ]; then\n   source /etc/environment.conf\nfi\n\nor, if you prefer the compact format:\nif [ -f /etc/environment.conf ]; then . /etc/environment.conf; fi\n\nIf you use some other shell than bash, and it uses the same variable-setting syntax as bash (as does zsh, I think), you'll need to also source this file from that shell's system-wide rc file (e.g. /etc/zshrc). If you use a shell that uses a different syntax, e.g. tcsh, you'll need to either maintain a similar file for that shell and source it from the shell's system-wide rc file (e.g. /etc/csh.cshrc for tcsh), or better yet create a script that auto-generates it, so you only have to edit one file to add/change variables. This isn't the place for such a tutorial; a few seconds on Google turned up how to convert [t]csh variable exports to bash syntax, at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2710790/how-to-source-a-csh-script-in-bash-to-set-the-enviroment, so there's probably something available to go the other direction.\nIt's been my experience that Mac OS X is moving further and further away from predictable rc file behavior.  As of at least 10.8, it no longer seems to load /etc/rc.common, /etc/rc.conf or /etc/rc.<anything>, nor (since at least 10.9) will it load /etc/bash.bashrc for interactive nonlogin shells (which it certainly should be doing, just like it loads ~/.bashrc for them, still, as of 10.10). Then again I have Fink, MacPorts, and Homebrew all installing stuff, so maybe one of them is interfering with default dotfile behavior. YMMV.\n\nA: I know this question was focused on macOS Mavericks (which I believe defaulted to /bin/bash for its shell). I arrived at this post looking for an answer on macOS Monterey (which defaults to /bin/zsh).\nSwitching to bash by executing /bin/bash provided a helpful message which ended up leading me in the right direction:\n\nThe default interactive shell is now zsh.\nTo update your account to use zsh, please run chsh -s /bin/zsh.\nFor more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.\n\nShell Profile\nI used to be able to apply global shell configurations using the /etc/profile, but I learned that zsh uses its own /etc/zprofile. Editing the /etc/zprofile was the solution I was looking for.\nFor my setup, I went with the common approach of creating a /etc/profile.d directory containing multiple .sh files. I then appended the following to my /etc/zprofile to source the files:\n# Profile Scripts\nfor PROFILE in $(ls /etc/profile.d/*.sh); do\n  source \"${PROFILE}\"\ndone\n\nSSH\nI did a test with ssh from another local computer to verify the concerns of environment variables. This approach seemed to yield the environment variables defined in the /etc/profile.d scripts without issue.\n", "Q: Is there a \"windirstat\"/\"Disk Inventory X\" type iOS app?

How can I prevent this? I have a desktop with two computers.  On one side I have a Windows PC, and on the other side is a Macbook running OS X Mavericks that is plugged into a Thunderbolt display.\nI use a wireless keyboard and a magic mouse.  Today, I've been working on my Windows PC, and though my Macbook is booted up, I've left the screensaver running and I haven't touched any of my Mac devices.\nOff and on, all throughout the day, the login window keeps popping up on my screensaver.  It appears, time's out, disappears and within 10 seconds it appears again.\nI've double-checked and nothing is resting on my keyboard and no cables are touching the magic mouse.  I know the mouse isn't being bumped or jostled.\nWould anyone happen to know if this is an OS X bug or, possibly, a bug with the mouse, sending in micro-movement data to the Bluetooth listener?  If so, is there a fix?\nI really like my Thunderbolt display.  I'd rather not have screen burn-in from the login window constantly overlaying the screensaver, if I can avoid this.\nAlso, I am not looking to disable the login prompt from the screensaver.  I work in an office and it is general practice to always lock your computer(s) when you step away from your desk.  I need the login window to pop-up when I need to log into my Mac.\n\nA: I have the same problem, and it turns out it is being caused by Firefox. This seems unlikely, so I'll lay out the facts below.\nAt first, I assumed it was mplayer, VLC, or QuickTime player, all of which will disable the screensaver while they are doing their magic. Especially the first, which is installed via Homebrew and isn't properly written for OSX. However, much playing with these indicated they're not the problem.\nLater, I guessed it was my attached bluetooth devices. So I've performed two experiments:\n\n\n*\n\n*I turned on my screensaver then powered off both the keyboard and trackpad, which are the only two input devices attached to bluetooth, yet the problem persists.\n\n*I plugged in a USB mouse/keyboard then turned bluetooth off entirely from the OSX menu bar item. The problem persist even with bluetooth turned off entirely.\n\n\nAfter some time, I guessed it was a USB device. I have several USB items plugged in, including several hard drives, a vape pen, and Android device. Unplugging these made no difference.\nFinally, after the problem had been going on for several days, Firefox needed a security update and a restart. After restarting it, the screensaver/display sleep worked properly.\nNow, whenever I have the problem, if I quit Firefox, the problem goes away. If I restart Firefox, sometimes the problem goes away, but sometimes it persists.\nI have NO IDEA why Firefox would be triggering this, and if it weren't for the above facts, I wouldn't really believe it myself. If anyone else has this problem and uses Firefox, please try to corroborate?\n\nA: I had the same problem on arch linux using Xfce Desktop and xscreensaver.

I haven't defined a URL for my server on the local network; 8088 is I gather the default port for the Software Update Server; but I don't know where or what the file is called either.\n\nA: Summary:\nThe simple way to configure a client to point to your Software Update server is using the following Terminal command on your client:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL http://su.domain_name.com:8088/index.sucatalog\n\nReplace su.domain_name.com with your server's fully qualified domain name as specified in Server.app. You can find your FQDM by going to Server.app → [server name] → Access: Host Name:\n\nYou can change your FQDM by clicking the Edit… button on the right.\n\nMore detail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a host name by going to Server.app → [server name] → Access: Host Name → Edit…. If you wish to access your server over the internet without VPN, choose Domain Name. Otherwise, choose one of the Local Network options.\n\n\n*Switch on the Software Update service.\n\n\n*Once the service has started, you can find the FQDM in the Access section.\n\n\n*Using this FQDM, you can find your CatalogURL by substituting this into the following URL:\nhttp://[FQDM]:8088/index.sucatalog\n\nFor example, if my FQDM is reported under the Access section as server.example.private, my Software Update catalog would be located at http://server.example.private:8088/index.sucatalog.\n\n*On your clients, you can configure them by running the following Terminal command:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL [your-catalogURL]\n\nReplace [your-catalogURL] with the URL that you got from step 4.\nYou can revert your settings by running the following Terminal command:\nsudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL\n\nAlternatively, you can use Profile Manger to provide OTA configuration using the Custom Settings section of your configuration profile.\n", "Q: How to recover my texts on Pages?

It stopped working 2 days ago. It won't open on the phone. iCloud is working fine and so is iCal on my MacPro.\nHow do I get it to work again? \n\nA: Make sure you have a Calendar set up in iOS, either an iCloud calendar (Settings -> iCloud) or another one (Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars). If your only calendars are read-only, like Facebook Events and Birthdays, you won't be able to create events.\nIn iOS 7 and 8, you can check the calendars that have been set up by tapping \"Calendars\" at the bottom of the calendar view. If you don't see an iCloud calendar or another one you can edit, you'll need to create one.\n\nA: The initial set of troubleshooting steps might be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attempt a backup of the device.\n\n*Power off the device.\n\n*Check that the calendars are still working by logging into the web interface using a computer while the iOS device is powered off to ensure that the service is up and your account is working properly.\n\n\nAt that point, you can restart your phone and start down troubleshooting if it still is misbehaving.\n\nA: Go to \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" , under \"Accounts\" go to \"iCloud\" and make sure the \"Calendars\" is on \"ON\". \n", "Q: Does free iWork on iOS entitle me to free iWork to Mac? I have recently become the proud owner of a new iPhone 5s and have benefitted from the free iWork apps that are available to new devices.\nI also own a 2012 MacBook Pro running Mavericks. Now I have the iWork apps on my iPhone, does it entitle me to them on my Mac via 'purchased' or are they different apps altogether being on different platforms?\n\nA: Actually no, iOS and OSX version of iWorks are 2 different softwares although linked by iCloud (AppStore & Mac AppStore \"are\" independent). iWork for OSX is free for every Mac bought after October 1st 2013. \nThere are some workaround to get the 3 OSX apps (Pages, Keynote & Numbers) for free without any illegal download. \nDoes Apple know that or do they do that on purpose ? That a good question that I do not know the answer.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro not booting after update to Mavericks I installed Mavericks (upgrading from Mountain Lion) on my MacBook Pro (from early 2011) and the install seemed to go fine. However, this morning while I was working on PowerPoint, it switched off with no warning at all (it was connected to AC power and battery was full). Then, it refused to boot. After the spinning bar under the logo, it just gave a gray screen and was completely unresponsive. I tried to boot into safe mode by pressing ⇧ shift while booting and it reached a blue screen with vertical black stripes and was again unresponsive.\nThen I tried clearing the NVRAM with ⌘⌥PR and it again reached an unresponsive gray or blue screen if I waited long enough. Tried Internet Recovery but after downloading something for an hour it again gave the blue screen with vertical stripes.\nAny idea what I can do? Can I use a Linux LiveDVD or something to extract some data I have on it?\nETA: Ran the hardware test from the included Applications DVD and it did not find any troubles. Trying to boot with a LiveDVD did not work. Did get to the stage where I select from the range of boot options but then the boot did not complete. Tried with Ubuntu and CentOS.\n\nA: Most likely a hardware failure. See here: http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/14/apples-2011-macbook-pro-lineup-suffering-from-sporadic-gpu-failures\n\nA: I would tackle this problem (as a last resort) by booting into the recovery partition of the machine in question and using the Terminal from there, copying every file/directory you need onto an external drive. Hopefully the drive isn't formatted as NTFS, but you will need to format it to FAT or HFS(+) if it is. \nIf you are familiar with the UNIX shell, you will have no problem backing things up from the recovery partition's Terminal. Once everything is backed up, format and reinstall Mac OS. \nIf you can't get into the recovery partition, a Linux LiveCD/LiveDVD may be your best option. I believe Linux can mount HFS+ drives for read-only (and perhaps write, I have not tried in a while). Boot into Linux, mount the drive and copy everything onto an external drive as I mentioned before (either using the shell or any GUI utilities they give you).\nOnce again, this should be a last resort. It will work this way, but will leave you with a clean slate. \nAlternatively, you could restore from a Time Machine backup (from the recovery partition) if you have one. \n\nA: The blue screen with stripes is most likely a hardware failure / logic board / GPU error, but you could try booting the Mac into target mode (hold t at boot) and connecting it to another Mac over Thunderbolt (or Firewire) to see if the hard drive is readable.\nAlso, since recovery boot and single user mode boot are failing, two copies of the OS have failed to boot so it's not likely a software issue unless your Recovery HD broke long ago and Mavericks install didn't fix or detect that brokenness.\nYou could boot off an external source, but I'd seek repair assistance from Apple or a trained Mac technician unless that was unworkable for whatever reasons.\n\nA: I have the same issue as you. It is a GPU failure. I have a solution for that which is I am using.\nFirst reset the PRAM. It will boot with waves on the screen. The screen will go grey with no Apple logo. It will shutdown itself after sometime. Boot now and it will work. Download a software called gfxCardStatus. Change the GPU to Intel HD. Never use Flash or Phoroshop or any graphics heavy app.\nIf your Mac is stuck at Boot screen with the wheel, reset PRAM and follow the above instructions. It should work.\n", "Q: How do I give accessibility permission to my AppleScript and System Events in Mavericks?

You need to give permissions on an app by app basis. Unfortunately, SystemEvents.app is not in the list of apps to give permissions. How can I make it appear? Is there another solution that does not depend on downloading utilities from third-parties?\nThis is the error message I get:\nerror \"System Events got an error: Can’t make {424, 699} into type list.\" number -1700 from {424, 699} to list\n\n\nA: Your problem is independent of the accessibility permission. \nReplace your click line with something like click window 1 and it will ask you to allow or deny access to the accessibility features. \nThere is a problem with click at and I don't know what it is.  \nEdit : My conclusion after some tests : click at is broken. \nThe release note of AppleScript updated with the release of Mavericks does not state some kind of removal of this feature. Some that might be a bug. \nI submitted a bug report to Apple. \nEdit : The issue has been fixed on Yosemite, click at works well again ! \n", "Q: TarPit not working in Mavericks One of my favorite applications appears not to be working after making the upgrade to Mavericks.

I just loved this application since on command line creating a tar.gz would also include the .DS_Store files, and other similar nonsense.\nSo, is there a workaround and making TarPit work again?

I'm not sure if my issue is the same, but I don't have enough reputation here to comment on that question.\nI just upgraded from Snow Leopard (10.6.8) to Mavericks. Before the upgrade, I was able to visit http://localhost; but now I can't. I checked my hosts file, and it looked ok (but this isn't quite my area of expertise):\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost \nfe80::1%lo0     localhost\n\nI am still able to visit 127.0.0.1. This wouldn't necessarily be a huge deal, but I'm trying to use Sinatra on Thin which isn't working after the OS upgrade either (it was working on my Snow Leopard setup), so I fear there may be an underlying issue that could have other negative effects. Thanks.\n\nA: Everything seems to be working now. I can access localhost again, and my app is running Sinatra on Thin as it was before. Thanks to bmike, I did a bit of searching on why my loopback was unreachable and came across this article. I moved my old hosts file (/etc/hosts) to hosts.old and made a new one in its place that simply contained:\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting. Do not change this entry.\n##\n127.0.0.1           localhost\n255.255.255.255     broadcasthost\n::1                 localhost\nfe80::1%lo0         localhost\n\nThen, I ran dscacheutil -flushcache and rebooted my computer*. After that, things appear to be working normally again. I can only guess that something weird happened with my old hosts file. I also took Giacomo1968's advice and blew away ruby 2.0.0 (I still had ruby 1.8.7--you cannot uninstall ruby entirely on a mac, since it uses ruby for other things) and rvm and reinstalled those; but I'm not sure that had anything to do with my success, as I still had the same issues until I followed the steps outlined above.\nNote: the above hosts file contains virtually the same thing that I say my hosts file contained before (see original question); however, there were other things in my original hosts file that I did not share in my question (I just shared what I thought was the relevant part), so perhaps something there got borked when I upgraded--I wish I knew for sure.\n*Rebooting is probably not necessary. I actually had this problem after setting up a new user from a backup drive on my machine at work (which is running Mountain Lion) and (just today) followed the same steps above (minus blowing away ruby and rebooting the machine), and it worked. This leads me to believe that the heart of the issue was a borked /etc/hosts file.\n\nA: I have no such problems connecting to a web server when it's actually listening on port 80.\nIf you have no web server running, here is what you should get from terminal to show that name resolution is working on all network interfaces before the telnet gives up connecting to port 80:\nmac:~ me$ telnet localhost 80\nTrying ::1...\ntelnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused\nTrying 127.0.0.1...\ntelnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused\nTrying fe80::1...\ntelnet: connect to address fe80::1: Connection refused\ntelnet: Unable to connect to remote host\n\nShould you get different results, I would use scutil to determine reachability for your network destination:\nmac:~ me$ scutil -r localhost\nReachable,Local Address\nmac:~ me$ scutil -r loopback\nReachable\nmac:~ me$ scutil -r 127.0.0.1\nReachable,Local Address\n\nIt might be worth checking if you have LittleSnitch or another firewall that has rules that are blocking network access or reboot into Safe mode to test if some kernel extensions or other conflict is preventing the default reachability and access to local ports. Also, you will most certainly want to check whatever web server you are running to ensure it's really listening to port 80:\nmac:~ me$ sudo lsof -i :80 | egrep \"PID|LISTEN\"\nPassword:\nCOMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nhttpd    1645 root    8u  IPv6 0x513627eaa81c8205      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd   15851 _www    8u  IPv6 0x513627eaa81c8205      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\nhttpd   72969 _www    8u  IPv6 0x513627eaa81c8205      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)\n\nAlso, quit all web browsers or be prepared to filter those network connections from the above lsof command as it shows all connections over port 80.\n\nA: Mavericks (OS X 10.9) uses Ruby 2.0. Not clear on what you were using under Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6.8) but perhaps a major change in version broke something?  In my experience Ruby upgrades are never easily backwards compatible and—IMHO—very frustrating to maintain from a system administrator’s point of view for reasons like this.\nI would recommend reinstalling whatever Ruby gems you have in place and try again.\n", "Q: How to enable HiDPI mode on external display in OS X 10.9 Mavericks? The usual method of using Quartz Debug doesn't seem to work anymore. \n\nA: actually it works on external displays such as TVs, but the list in System Preferences is limited. you can try two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*either hold \"alt\" when clicking \"Scaled\" button, or\n\n*install one of the menu utilities such as http://www.resolutiontab.com/\nthe first one didn't work for me as it kept only showing \"tv friendly\" resolutions (720p, 1080p and 1080i). the second did indeed show 960x540 HiDPI i was after for my tv.\n\nA: Running\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true\n\nnd restarting worked for me:\n\nI only tested it with the internal display of an iMac though.\n\nA: It seems to me that OSX is preventing TVs (or the other way around) from using HiDPI on non-scaling mode. For example if your TV is 1080p, the 960 X 540 HiDPI won't work, but 1280 X 720 HiDPI mode will (but it will be blurry because it is really running 2560 X 1440 on a 1920 X 1080 display).\n\nA: Alright, here we go: reversing this from the top-down, and explaining why it doesn't work for some people.

separately. If the display is detected as a tv mode (can check in system profiler), no hidpi suffix will be shown (it's also filtered out by default, more on that in a bit). Note that if your display is erroneously detected as a tv, then you can fix it with an edid override. Search online about how to force rgb mode.\nAlso note that if it's detected as a display that natively supports hiDPI (which fyi is determined by checking if the \"native resolution\" of a display is a hiDPI resolution), then it will not show the (hiDPI) suffix in the string even though when selected the computer will still use hidpi rendering.\nNow we get to the question of what resolutions are shown. This part is mostly handled by CGS, but syspref doesn't present all of them to you. When you hold option, it chooses between displaying userModes vs. trimmedModes. userModes basically filters the display modes list given by CGS based on a  bit in the flag field of CGSDisplayModeDescription struct that tells it whether this mode is user-visible or not. trimmedModes goes further and eliminates more things, based on logic that I don't care to reverse.\nThis is why, for instance, you see that when using an app like RDM it presents more resolutions than what you see even when holding option in system preferences.\nAlso note that the list of \"raw resolutions\" can be influenced by setting a display override. This site is great for generating the display override file, and is basically necessary if you want to use a hidpi mode with a non-standard resolution. E.g. if you have a 1440p display, and want to use hidpi with an effectively scale of 1300p or something, then you will need to use a display override. (This is also how things like BetterDisplay work). SwitchResX is also another tool for creating display overrides.\nAs mentioned before though, even though a raw resolution is offered doesn't mean it's visible in system preferences. You can either use RDM to work around this, or patch -[MPDisplayMode isUserVisible] in MonitorPanel.framework to always return true.\nBelow is some code you can use to play around with MonitorPanel.framework:\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n#include <ApplicationServices/ApplicationServices.h>\n\nconst int kMaxDisplays = 16;\n\ntypedef struct {\n    uint32_t mode; // 0\n    uint32_t flags; // 4\n    uint32_t width; // 8\n    uint32_t height; // 12\n    uint32_t depth; // 16\n    uint32_t dc2[42];\n    uint16_t dc3;\n    uint16_t freq;\n    uint8_t dc4[16];\n    CGFloat scale;\n} CGSDisplayModeDescription;\n\nvoid print_binary(unsigned int number)\n{\n    if (number >> 1) {\n        print_binary(number >> 1);\n    }\n    putc((number & 1) ?

I think that the old /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration folder is no longer used or working the same in Mavs as in previous releases..\n\nA: Have a look to a different script for the same purpose, but with a slightly different approach. It uses the same SystemConfiguration trigger, thus. The problem on Mavericks seem rather to be respawning the original script over and over by launchd.

A common problem that I'm having with MacPorts is that I will go to install a port, and it will list a port as a dependency that I have installed outside of MacPorts.\nFor example:\nI have Qt5 installed outside of MacPorts, and I absolute do not want MacPorts to install Qt4, but it is a dependency for the port I want. I want the port to use Qt5 libraries which I have installed in another location.\nAlso, I have Python 2.7.5 and Python 3 installed outside of MacPorts. However, when I go to install some ports that have Python as a dependancy, MacPorts tries to install port python27 — I do not want this port installed. I want to manage Python versions outside of  MacPorts.\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: In general, MacPorts uses only a small collection of “system” libraries and tools; it really has no facility for using separately built libraries, tools, environments, etc.\nSee the entries titled “Why is MacPorts using its own libraries?” and “Will MacPorts link to system libraries rather than its own?” in the MacPorts FAQ.\n\nYou might be able to adjust individual Portfiles to use your already-built stuff, but you will really be working “against the grain” of the MacPorts system; you will likely run into many difficulties when undertaking such an approach.\nIt might prove easier to just manually build the software that you are ultimately interested in; that way you have better control over which libraries it uses. If there are a lot of (non-Qt, non-Python) dependencies, and if you do not mind building them through MacPorts, then you could still use MacPorts to provide other dependencies:\n # make sure the list of other dependencies looks reasonable\nport echo depof:someport and not python27 and not qt4-mac\n\n# install the other dependencies\nsudo port install depof:someport and not python27 and not qt4-mac\n\n# configure; the way to specify the library locations will vary, but might be like this:\nCFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib \\\n  ./configure --with-qt=/my/qt5/installation --with-python3=/my/python3/installation\n\n", "Q: Lost second Game center account of my daughter I updated the last iOS 7 for my dhaughters iPad.

Now after the update the game center is not letting me to log her in with her nickname but is telling that this name is already in use!? What can i do to not to loose all her games?\n\nA: A game center account is simply an AppleID.\nYou can go to https://appleid.apple.com and recover her password for the AppleID you want to use in Game Center. It might also be a password problem, so checking that the account is in good standing will give you better error messages and options to recover by using the website instead of logging in through iOS.\n", "Q: Which version(s) of Mac OS X have Ruby installed by default?

I had issues with an old battery (since replaced) where OS X would just die at low battery instead of hibernating, but even then it didn't reboot after turning on.  However, this has only started since I upgrade.\nAny suggestions?\nI have a mid 2009 13\" Macbook, OS X 10.9, 4GB RAM and a 256GB Crucial M4 SSD.\n\nA: Assuming you aren't running any 3rd party utilities or have previously changed your hibernation settings here is what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*run sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3\n\n*Verify your disk using disk utility. repair any problems.\n\n*delete the sleep image sudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\nif that doesn't fix it try an SMC reset\n\nA: Turned out to be a different issue.  Turns out that a number of services were locking OS X's ability to sleep - the main culprit seemed to be Internet Sharing being enabled accidentally.\nI had a look at:\npmset -g assertions \n\nAnd tracked down the processes that were listed.  When the battery got low, these overrode everything and the laptop turned off instead of hiberinating.\n", "Q: Why does my iTunes play count indicate certain tracks have been listened to hundreds of times when I've only played them a few times? My iTunes play count is indicating that I have played certain tracks hundreds of times which is incorrect as I have only played these tracks 10 or 15 times. It also seems to have done so only with one or two artists and on a couple occassions where they have recorded the same song. Why does this happen and can it be corrected?\n\nA: Playcounts are embedded persistently in the media files.\nWhen you share audio files, you also share their play count.\n", "Q: Can not charge iPhone 5 from Macboook after Mavericks upgrade I have a Macbook and usually have it plugged into power.

I'd like us to start a magazine that's digitally distributed but Newsstand apps would be too complex (plus there's no revenue model) from what I have read on this site. On the other hand, the iPad app Creative Book Builder is too simple. Using web based applications like Glossi.com has limitations in Safari.\nIdeally, I'd like to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Work on iPads (in an app) OR Macs \n\n*Work collaboratively\n\n\nAny suggestions? I don't mind if the collaborative element is restricted to that different students send me the different parts, but the compiling and distribution should lead to the magazine being readable on our iPads.\nAny suggestions for an app or workflow? Thanks. \n\nA: It seems to me that if your okay with the work being done on Macs, the starting point would be to check out Apple's own iBooks Author (free, app store). It has a variety of layout choices and distributes through the iBookstore (including at a price of free, if that's what you want).

I intend to upgrade to a larger hard drive (actually an SSD). In the past when not using FileVault, I used Carbon Copy Cloner to copy the entire disk to the new hard drive. Can this be accomplished with a FileVault protected drive?\n\nA: SSD is different, it needs a separate driver from OS to work properly. It is better that you archive your drive using time machine, install OS X as usual and than, during the last install step, restore your home directory. This will ensure that your system uses all correct drivers and your SSD will live a healthier life.\nWhen archiving with time machine, you can drag /System into the exclusion list to avoid archiving OS X itself (you'll be reinstalling it).\n", "Q: How to turn off slide transition when switching between two full screen applications on OS X Mavericks? Application switching cause one application to slide into another. Most times this is fine but am working on a MacBook Air and the slide transition causes motion sickness at times, especially after prolonged use (4+ hours). Looking for a way to turn off these animation.\nTotalspaces2 has a turn off slide transition option, so I am pretty sure it's possible. Lion, Mountain Lion had Terminal commands for animation. I tried them all, and they don't work with Mavericks. I'm looking for Mavericks terminal commands to achieve the same.\n\nA: In MacOS Sierra:\n - Go to System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Display \n - Check in the box \"Reduce motion\".\n\nThis new function will speed up the animation between various display motion techniques such as using the mission control, switching desktops etc.\n\nA: There is no way to disable the animation but you might want to look at TotalSpaces, which replaces the builtin workspace manager. You can disable transitions altogether with this (as well as use different animations and layouts for spaces). It's not free ($18) but there is a 14 day free trial.\n\nA: defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool NO\n", "Q: Can I revert to the Mountain Lion style labels instead of Mavericks tags? How? I don't like the almost invisible little colored dots (tags) that have replaced the full-length color highlighted labels used in Mountain Lion.  Is there a way to go back to using full-field labels?\n\nA: Good news for all that miss the color-backgrounds from 10.8 and below. The free Extension \"XtraFinder\" has a new Option in Version 0.19 called \"Leagacy Color Label Painting\" (in \"Appearance\") which brings back the color background for the finder in listmode. \n\nA: In fact that was the way labels behaved since System 7 (MacOS 7)\nI really don't remember if they were present in System 6 though.\n\n\nA: Restoring coloured labels are a new feature in TotalFinder:\n\nThis feature mimics old Finder behaviour. I implemented this option\n  because many people requested back colored labels from Mountain Lion.\n\n\nA: I have the same problem, and so do others: just search the Apple support discussions. The only solutions currently are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall OS X 10.8\n\n*Install PathFinder, a third party patch that brings back labels\n\n*If PF is too pricey, try asking binaryage (makers of TotalFinder) to also enable this feature, as TotalFinder is only $18, compared to Pathfinder at nearly $40.\n\n\nThere's also a few other semi-workarounds, like coloring folders using 3rd party tools (though this is tedious and only works for folders, not files)\nAnd remember to tell Apple that you want labels back! If enough people speak out, they will change it.\n\nA: I too mourn the loss of the \"labels\" feature for the new \"tags\" action in Mavericks. My short term solution is to change the standard blue folder icon to a color icon that mimics the color scheme I used before. This at least puts the identifier to the left of the file name and stands out better. The example below uses colored circles for the folder icons.\n\nIf you aren't sure of how to change the folder icon this is a link to a tutorial screencast from  the macmost.com website - MacMost Now 465: Creating Custom Folder and File Icons\nThere are several free sources for Mac icons. I've used the \"Pixelmator\" application and the \"Img2icon\" app to create a custom icon library.\n\nA: Labels are still present in OSX 10.9.\nIf you turn on an old program (like Adobe CS5 or other older versions) you'll see that in teh Apps' open&save menus the files are presented with the old label system.\nAlso if you consider the fact that Tags replaced Labels in a way that all your previous labels turned into tags you'll get to the only conclusion possible:\nthat the option for labeling is still present in OSX 10.9 but must be switched off.\nThere must be a simple command you can drop into terminal to change back to labels.\n\nA: There is no officially supported way to do this (and no unofficially supported hack that re-enables it either that I was aware of until I read the answer that mentioned PathFinder). The behaviour of Tags in Mavericks as compared to Labels in every previous version of OS X is very different, and you cannot pick and choose elements to work in one way and have the rest to work in another, it's all or nothing I'm afraid, so if you are on Mavericks the best you can do is hope for a feature as part of a future OS update that adds extended options to tags. I'm sure further tag options will be forthcoming, as it's essentially a V1 feature at present, and maybe this will be one of them.\n", "Q: What file systems does Apple use in iPhones? HFS\nWWDC 2012 Session 709, ￼What’s New in the File System, presented by Deric Horn included the following observation: Journaled HFS+ everywhere.\nIn the iOS Developer Library, NSDictionary Class Reference contains references to HFS. \nDo iPhones use HFS Plus?\nJournaled or not journaled?\nI'd like an authoritative reference.

HFSX is a variation of HFS+ with one major difference. HFSX is case sensitive.\n\nHFSX is reported by Apple as Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Case-Sensitive).\nThere are two main partitions of HFSX: the OS and the user data. Prior to these partitions is the usual MBR partition (around 100 MB).\n\nSSHing into my jailbroken iOS 6 device seems to support this, since I can create case-sensitive directories.

It also works for Boot Camp volumes and other PC disks.\n\nWith iPartition, resizing a partition is as simple as selecting it, grabbing the resize handle and dragging. Not only that, but if you have several operations to perform, iPartition lets you queue them up and run them one after another, so you can have a cup of coffee while iPartition works. This feature, coupled with iPartition’s ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when necessary, makes iPartition the easiest partitioning tool that you’ll ever use.\n\n\n", "Q: Hiding Apps for power saving iphone 5s On my iphone 5 I could make apps \"disappear\" by double clicking on the home button and then temporarily remove the ones in regular use by holding finger on them until the shook then cancelling by pressing the cross.This preserved battery power.

With the October 2013 iWork update, the new UI is great but it seems one cannot store documents as 'flat file' any more.

I'm trying to avoid downloading other versions of Xcode due to very slow internet connection.\n\nA: iOS Simulator 5.0 and 5.1 do not work on Mavericks. See this, granted you have a developer account with Apple.\n\nThe iOS simulator does not duplicate some of the low-level parts of iOS. For example, it uses the host OS X's kernel instead of trying to virtualize the iOS kernel. The iOS simulator requires that these subsystems look sufficiently similar between the simulated iOS and the host OS X. When a new host OS X changes too much it can break old simulators. At that point somebody makes an engineering and cost decision to either update the old simulator or drop support for it.\n\n", "Q: 20Gb of sleepimage OSX Mavericks I realized that I'm always I receive a message informing that my startup disk is almost full.

I was recently inspecting the Usage tab in my iPhone's settings. The Messages app is #2 on the list with almost 700 MB. Anecdotal reports have it that the app can take up multiple GB of space. So what is in there? \nIs every photo and video sent being stored in the app's data? If so, does that mean if I take a photo or video and send it out, it is being stored on my phone twice? And can I remove the photos and videos without deleting the entire message thread?\n\nA: Yes, videos and photos are stored in messages and they take up too much space. Try deleting any large discussion thread you do not need if you would like to free some space. Or, if you would like to weed out individual photos or videos, you can tap and hold on any message bubble for the context menu. It will appear with two options: \"Copy\" | \"More\". Tap \"More\" for a list of checkboxes to appear on the left side of the screen. This allows you to easily delete one or more (large) individual messages.\nUp to iOS 6 messages just weren't in the usage tab, and consequently one couldn't easily see how much space it consumed.\nAlso note, that you are just deleting those messages off of that device. If they are iMessages, and you have other devices (a Mac or OSX device) with those accounts synced there, the messages will stay there.\n", "Q: How to preserve Time Machine backups and start over with a new one? I make my Time Machine backups on an external hard drive. Recently I upgraded from Mountain Lion to Mavericks. Now I need the ability to freeze those old backups I've done with Mountain Lion in case I need to go back with the hole system.\nWhat I tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop Time Machine and rename backup folder on the disk. On Mavericks the Time Machine folders can't be renamed or moved.\n\n*Remove the external drive from Time Machine preference pane and read the drive - Time Machine backups continue on same folder and in some time in the future overwrites old backups.\n\n\nHow can I achieve what I want?\n\nA: The simplest way is for you to note the date and time of your last backup in Time Machine on OS X Mountain Lion. You can get back to it at any point in time in the future just by restoring to the backup with that date/time (this will remain on the disk as long as you have adequate space so that Time Machine does not delete these older versions).\n\n\n*\n\n*You can easily find this date and time by navigating into the \"Backups.backupdb\" folder on the Time Machine disk and looking at the timestamp for the \"Latest\" folder (it is actually a link - so you can even open it to see the latest backup folder name with the date and time).\n\n\n\nIf you do not wish to note down the date and time of your last backup with OS X Mountain Lion, the next simplest way is to change the computer name either on the Mac on OS X Mavericks before you do your first Time Machine backup on it or on the Time Machine backup disk for the older backup.\nIn either case, this will make Time Machine create a new folder with the new machine name on the disk and it will do a full backup the first time (so you need adequate disk space to hold almost two copies of your Mac). This way, you can restore from the old or new backup in the future (if you rename the computer name on the Time Machine disk, then you would have to revert that to do a full restore of the old system).\n\n\n*\n\n*To change your computer name, go to System Preferences > Sharing and edit the Computer Name: text.\nOR\n\n*To rename the computer name on the Time Machine disk instead, use the following command in Terminal.app:\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass mv /Volumes/<TMDiskName>/Backups.backupdb/<ComputerName> /Volumes/<TMDiskName>/Backups.backupdb/<OSXMountainLionBackupComputerName>\n\nSubstitute the following in the above command before running it:\n\n\n*\n\n*<TMDiskName> is the name of the Time Machine volume name\n\n*<ComputerName> is the current computer name (which you will continue using for OS X Mavericks)\n\n*<OSXMountainLionBackupComputerName> is the name of the snapshot for you to do a full restore from in the future (you would have to rename it back using a similar command as above before the full restore)\n\n\n\nA: This answer adresses more scenarios when one needs to preserve one or more Time Machine backups.)\nTime Machine is not designed for preserving old backups indefinitely (i.e. For permanent archives). Even if there is plenty of free space on the backup disk, Time Machine will delete a backup after 24 hours in case it's not the furst backup of a day. If it is, Time Machine will keep it for 30 days unless it is also the first backup of a week, where the start of a week is defined as the time and day of the initial backup (thus not necessarily Monday or Sunday). The life span of the first backup of a week is not time limited. However, the oldest backup is deleted if space is needed for a new one, unless it's not the last remaining backup.\nSo, later, if you decide to restore the latest backup Time Machine has ever made on the old system, it may already not be available, and you may need to pick an older backup instead that Time Machine has kept according to the aforementioned rules.\nBasically, you have two options if you want to preserve one or more backups:\n\n*\n\n*Start a new set of backups to a new disk or partition, or\n\n*preserve the backup by other means than Time Machine, and continue backing up to the same set of backups.\n\nNote that if you install the system on an erased disk or partition, and put your data back (whichever way you do it, including Setup Assistant and Migration Assistant), or if you restore the whole system (again, whichever way you do it, including a restore from a Time Machine backup using OS X Recovery), then the first Time Machine backup will probably be a full backup (not an incremental one which could save a lot of backup disk space and time). However, you may be able to prevent it by following this guide.\nStarting a new set of backups to a new disk or partition\nThis may be preferred, as it will allow you to restore your old system in the future most easily, by restoring from a Time Machine backup using OS X Recovery.\nYou might be able to create a new partition on your current Time Machine backup disk even without erasing it by following the steps here.\nDepending on free space and other preference, you may want the new partition to be either for future backups of the new system, or it can hold only the single latest backup of the old system, selecting the new partition temporarily in the Time Machine Preferences just before the system upgrade, but continuing backing up to the old partition after that. You may also consider adding some exclusions, so that it holds really only the old system without the data you are already backing up to the old partition.\nTo see the old set of backups after starting a new one, you'll need the Browse Other Backup Disks option.\nPreserving a backup by other means\nThis can be done even via the Time Machine interface, either before or after upgrading the system, by restoring the old system backup to a chosen location, such as a different folder on the Time Machine backup disk or another backup disk.\nAnother way is making a clone of the old system or its Time Machine backup via a specialized software like Carbon Copy Cloner.\nMoving the Time Machine Backups.backupdb folder to a different location on the backup disk, using a little modification of the command supplied in M K's answer, to isolate it from the reach of Time Machine, will also do the trick, but it would require a reverse process every time you need to access the old backups via Time Machine or perform OS X Recovery. On the other hand, making a permanent backup this way is much faster, as it doesn't require copying anything.\n\nIt is also worth noting that if you want to keep a backup just because you want to retain an option to downgrade OS X, then you have also another option. If you have purchased or downloaded an older version of OS X in past using the Mac App Store, you can download its installer again from the purchase history in the Mac App Store. It's not possible to run the older installer from a newer version of OS X though – first, you would have to erase the partition the current system is on and install the older OS X version fresh. Then you can use Setup Assistant or Migration Assistant to copy your data, accounts, and/or settings (apps won't work) which you've backed up via time Machine on the previous system with newer OS X.\n\nA: Thanks for the thread and answers. I have a 2 TB Time Capsule so have space to keep the entirety of the previous Time Machine backups as well as new ones.\nI used above information, from the great answer already provided, but created a new folder on the TMDisk first, once the TMDisk was showing mounted in the sidebar I added new folder in the same place as the Backups.backupdb one and called it backup2013. \nThen I did the following in Terminal, after modifying the original in TextEdit.\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Helpers/bypass mv \\\n/Volumes/**TMDisk**/Backups.backupdb/**machinename** \\\n/Volumes/**TMDisk**/**backup2013**/**machinename**\n\nSubstitute the following in the above command before running it:\n\n\n*\n\n***TMDisk** is the name of the Time Machine volume name\n\n***machinename** is the computer name (regardless of old or new)\n\n***backup2013** is the extra folder created to house the pre-Mavericks backup\n\n\nAs before this is where the snapshot will live for you to do a full restore from in the future (you would have to rename it back using a similar command as above before the full restore - hence saving it in a text file).\n…and I also moved the **machinename**.sparsebundle to a backup folder in the standard Finder view of my Time Capsule. I also saved the TextEdit doc to the same folder so I can reverse it later if needed.\nImportant\nI then promptly panicked when I opened Time Machine and only saw the new Backups.backupdb, this will be because I drag and dropped the machinename.sparsebundle to another folder on my Time Capsule.\nI located the other folder and double-clicked on the machinename and it then mounted the old image as a separate device in the sidebar.\nTime Machine also now seems to have reset its name to default.\n", "Q: iTunes store search from iPhone When I go to search the iTunes store from my iPhone the page displays a \"No Results for\"...

I had Mountain Lion till yesterday when I decided that today I would have \"upgraded\" to Mavericks. \nWith Mountain Lion everything worked fine until 5am tonight when I last used the wifi on that operating system.\nSo I backed up few files that I really needed and made a clean installation of the operating system. Everything went exceptionally fine and In a matter of an hour I found myself logging in into Mavericks.\nEverything else works fine (as far as I can tell) but downloads and everything that it has to do with the internet connection is very very slow. The symptoms are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloads started from browser often don't start on a lot of websites (Minecraft.com, Utorrent.com, etc). They are shown as they going with 0Kb/s for an hour or so). This happens with both wifi and ethernet connection.\n\n*YouTube videos refuse to load (the page loads, but the video stream is stopped at the beginning and doesn't go any further, ever) with wifi and loads very slowly with the ethernet connection.\n\n*Minecraft updates or dropbox synchronization are very very slow (takes hours to update few files or download the recent snapshot) even with a 7MB/s connection.\n\n*Speedtest.net says I have a download speed of 5Mbps and a ping of 72ms.\n\n*The Stack Overflow chat works very badly. Messages are synchronized slowly within long periods of time and messages sent by me are shown 2 times or shown in green (which means they were not really sent).\n\n*The Wi-Fi connection doesn't give me any error messages, and generally no particular messages are shown at all.\n\n*In Safari downloads start but they don't go faster than 2Kb/s.\n\nIn the meantime here's the status of uTorrent:\n\nAnd here's the status detected by Speedtest.com:\n\nI've never had any of such problem earlier. I can recognize that there's a 5% chance that these problems are something else related, but to be realistic, I'm pretty sure that it is Mavericks or something linked to it.\nHow do I fix these problems?\n\nA: It happened that the last update (OS X 10.9 (13A603)) solved this issue on my Macbook Pro 13' of mid 2010.\n", "Q: iMac crashes after upgrade to OS X Mavericks We have an iMac and after upgrading to OS X Mavericks.

I think that's when it was in use though.\nYou may want to try unloading the kexts or maybe even uninstalling VirtualBox altogether to see if that solves your issue though.\nYou can unload the kexts if you want by running these commands:\nsudo kextunload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxUSB\nsudo kextunload -b org.virtualbox.kext.VBoxDrv\nIt will prompt you for your admin password since sudo is used. There shouldn't be any errors, but if there are, let me know and I'll try to help.\nBe advised, this may break VirtualBox. This is just a temporary testing solution. If you find VirtualBox to not be the cause of the problem, or you want to re-enable the kexts for some other reason, simply replace kextunload with kextload in the above commands. It does what it sounds like it would do. Loads them instead of unloading them.\nIf you don't have any more kernel panics (crashes) after this, then VirtualBox was likely the culprit. If not, say something anyways.

When importing CDs in iTunes you have the option to enable error correction. With the exception of the obvious potential for slower import speeds... is there any reason not to have this enabled?\n\nA: Possible reasons why you might wish to disable error correction are\n\n\n*\n\n*if you are looking for the fastest possible import,\n\n*have a very old computer where resources are limited, or\n\n*want iTunes to use less CPU time.\n\n\nEnabling error correction allows iTunes to read the error correction data on the disc, and use this to verify the read audio data. Disabling the error correction makes iTunes ignore this information and presume that the data that is read is correct.\nError correction data is basically a summary of the last few bytes of data on the disc. If the total size of the data matches the size reported by the error correction data then the data is approved and iTunes continues importing. If not, iTunes re-reads the area of the disc, and as a last resort 'guesses' the content of the malformed data. Forward error correction - Wikipedia\nThis additional verification causes an increase in import time.

What I would like to know is wether it is possible or not to retrieve album name for each song I have given only song name and artist name (and maybe the song file itself, of course).\nAll I found when searching for it is the unknown album problem when updating iTunes, or the album artwork retrieval from album name.

I've noticed since updating to Mavericks last week (though this is a new Macbook, and I've been on Snow Leopard forever so not sure if this is 10.9 or 10.8 or what....) that horizontal scrolling in the Finder via two-finger trackpad movements is not working well.\nI've tried turning inertia on and off, no difference.  Toggled everything in Trackpad in System Prefs, still no difference.  It seems \"sticky\" -- if I move my fingers continuously, the Finder scrolls in tiny fits and starts, but if i swipe, I get a normal inertia scroll.\nHorizontal scroll works fine in Safari and Chrome, and in other programs; only Finder gives me trouble. Vertical scroll is fine in all contexts.\nHas anyone else experienced this? I'm not having much luck Googling this, and wanted to check in here before posting as a bug / calling in a support ticket.\n\nA: No. Horizontal scrolling is butter smooth in Finder for several of my machines. I've tried several different resolution settings on the Retina MBP as well as tried mouse and trackpad scrolling on older machines with less CPU / GPU power than the 13 inch MacBook Pro.\nNone lag in any manner scrolling horizontally as opposed to vertically in my experience. Due to the voting on this question, perhaps there are some issues for certain configurations or something else that I'm doing differently than you, but even for all different views (icon, list, hierarchical, etc...) and finder windows with a thousand files in the folder, I'm not able to see slowness when scrolling horizontally.\n", "Q: Automatically mounting an external Firewire drive after reboot, without login I have an iMac that is running Mavericks with OS X Server. I have the Time Machine service set up on that machine, referring to a directory on an external drive that is connected via Firewire. Other Macs in the house use this as the Time Machine backup location.\nAll works fine as long as someone is logged into the server. However, if the server is rebooted, and nobody logs in, then all client machines' Time Machine backups fail with an \"unable to connect to disk\" error. As soon as anyone logs into the server, everything starts working again.\nSo, apparently the external drive is not mounted until somebody logs in. What is the easiest way to fix this?\nI have found various pages around the net showing how to use automount and the /etc/auto_master configuration file to mount remote NFS and SMB shares automatically. Is this the way to do it, and if so, what do I put in /etc/auto_master for an external local drive?\nOr do I need to create an /etc/fstab file and put something in it? (I find conflicting information about whether that is still used or has been deprecated.)\nOr do I need to do something with launchd?\nFWIW, here is the output of mount -v when the external drive \"My Book\" is mounted:\n/dev/disk1s3 on /Volumes/My Book (hfs, local, journaled)\n\n\nUpdate: After experimenting more, it seems that sometimes everything works as expected (that is, external disk gets mounted and clients can backup), and sometimes it doesn't.  Maybe there is a race condition between when services start and when external-drive mounting completes?\n\nA: I just upgraded one of my servers from Snow Leopard to Mavericks and I ran into a similar problem. I knew that I had fixed it before and the method still seems to work in Mavericks.\nIn /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/ you need to add the file autodiskmount.plist with the following content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>AutomountDisksWithoutUserLogin</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nIt should go without saying, but you will need admin privileges to do this. I believe you will also need to reboot. Then, without logging in on your server, check if the other computers on your network can see the external drive.\n", "Q: Trackpad (+ spotlight) semi-unresponsive, Mavericks on a 2010 MBP Ever since I upgraded my 2010 Macbook Pro from Mountain Lion to Mavericks, an issue has been occuring at seemingly random moments. Without warning, my trackpad will no longer allow me to click or use gestures, although moving the cursor around is still possible. Also, both Spotlight and the application switcher (cmd+tab) stop appearing, although the latter does function (but without any graphical feedback).\nI've read some articles about a similar issue with the new rMBP's, so this might be related. Apple does seem to explicitly limit their acknowledgement of the bug to those new rMBP models, however. (related question)\nThe fact that Spotlight and the application switcher also die on me seem to indicate that it's a software problem. Rebooting my Mac helps without fail, but is quite inconvenient at times..\nIs there a fix / solution / more elaborate diagnose available? Am I the only one or is this more widespread amongst the older generations of the MBP?\n\nA: If you physically cannot hear/feel the bottom of the trackpad actually click the switches on the right and/or left of the trackpad, then this is probably a hardware issue that only coincidentally occurred with the software update. I have experienced a large number of older MacBooks with failure-to-click issues that are the result of a bulging battery pushing on the back of the trackpad assembly. \nA short-to-medium term solution is to use the \"System Preferences\" -> \"Trackpad\" controls to turn on \"tap-to-click\", but eventually the battery will need replacing. This will have the added benefit of giving you a longer time-between-needing-recharging compared to your four year old battery.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*shutdown your computer\n\n*reset PRAM\n-- power it off\n-- power it on while pressing these four keys at the same time:\n--- (\"Command\", \"Option\", 'p', 'r')\n\n*After the second time the computer starts up and you hear the startup chimes, you can then release the buttons\n\n*restart your computer again without holding any buttons down \n\n*now click on finder to get the correct menubar options\n\n*now click on \"Go\"\n\n*Then click on the Utilities option \n\n*Find your \"Disk Utility\" app and open it (you can simply open Disk Utility if you know where it is or search for it using spotlight as well)\n\n*Be sure and select the correct drive in the left menu then click \"verify disk permissions\"\n\n*next click \"repair disk permissions\"\n\n*then you can restart your computer again\n\n*hopefully your issue will be solved.\n\n\nNot sure if this will help since your problems started occurring right after an update.\nMaybe though so please let me know if this helps.\n", "Q: Mavericks: Second Apple Thunderbolt Monitor Intermittently Ignored I run a mid 2012 MacBook Pro as my main system.

I recently upgraded both of them from Mountain Lion to Mavericks and now neither of them can “see” each other, despite both having File Sharing and Remote Login enabled in the “Sharing” section of System Preferences.\nI used to be able to SSH into the other Mac, and the other Mac would show up as a device in Finder, but no more. Is this related to the SMB issue I’ve seen around the Internet?\nWhat can I do so I can browse between my Macs via Finder and SSH again?\n\nA: From your question it sounds like you can ssh into the machine but not connect via Finder. This leads me to think this is a File Sharing setting, not a Remote Login setting as the two are independent. So my answer applies to File Sharing settings.\nIf you go to System Preferences, then Sharing and for the File Sharing service, choose Options...\nBy default Mavericks has Share files and folders using SMB and Share files and folders using AFP selected but no users selected under Windows File Sharing.  \nIt also appears (in my testing) that with these selections, when you try to connect to another computer listed in the Finder sidebar, it attempts to connect using SMB and does not fall back to trying AFP if the SMB connection fails.\nThe answer I found was to either\na.

The problem is that I am paranoid and concerned about discovering that I made changes to a file over time in the past and that I want the version that disappeared between weekly backups. (Yes, yes, I use git and other version control solutions for many things but I like to be paranoid and hate things I can't configure myself).  \nIs it possible to change how long hourly and daily backups are kept for and if so where? \n\nA: If you want control over the retention policy, Time Machine isn't really the right tool for you; it's really designed to avoid requiring the user make decisions, and as a result it's not a good choice for someone who wants to be able to make decisions. The retention policy definitely follows this principle; there's no way (at least as far as I've ever seen) to adjust its retention policy.\nIn fact, there's not even any way to guarantee snapshots will be retained at all. If Time Machine decides it needs the entire backup capacity for the current backup (say, because you just connected your big external disk full of videos and it wants to back that up -- this happened to a friend of mine), it'll actually remove all old snapshots to make room. Note that there is an option in the preference pane to notify you after old backups are deleted.\nBasically, Time Machine places priority on getting the current data backed up vs. retaining old data, and there's no way to change this. (It is, after all, a backup system, not an archiving system.) If your priorities differ, you really should find another archiving tool.\n(BTW, you did misread its normal policy slightly: it keeps the daily snapshots for a month, and only after a month does it thin them down to one a week.)\n\nA: In practice this is not an issue. I explain this to people often when they are thinking whether they want to trust Time Machine or augment / choose another option.\nIf you keep your backup disk connected always, you will end up with 24 backups a day other than when a daylight savings time event passes.\nSince the hourly snapshots get consolidated into a daily snap - as long as your file was not created and deleted in an hour - it will exist on backup for a day. Once your file has sat on the filesystem for more than an hour, it will exist for a month on the backups. Once your file has existed for a week, it will exist on the backup until the drive fills and that weekly interval gets pruned.\nMost people can always keep every important file for ever if you leave it for a week before deleting and you cycle in a new backup destination as soon as your previous one fills.\nI mitigate this by having two destinations always. As soon as the first gets close to filling, I remove it from the \"active destination\" list and put it in cold storage. I add a new drive to the rotation and then let the current full on remove intervals until I split the difference between when the new will fill and the \"old\" stops pruning old backups. The cost of this  is less than $50 a year to me to store data, and the cost is getting cheaper as storage continues to be a commodity and grows denser faster than costs rise.\n", "Q: App offering audible alarm for low battery on Mavericks? I installed the update to Mavericks a few days ago, and while it's mostly been great there is no longer a sound that goes with the low battery warning. I have several programs which suppress the visual notifications, which makes for very unpleasant interruptions when the machine goes into standby.\nI contacted Apple support about it and they said that there is no way to add a sound to the notification using settings available in the operating system. They suggested I use a 3rd party app, but although I have found some which offer low battery pop up windows, I'm having trouble finding any offering an audible alert.\n\nA: You could write a short script and run it via cron every couple of minutes.\npmset -g batt\n\nRunning the above will show your current battery usage. You can then parse it out and you can make it alert you with something like:\nsay \"low battery power\"\n\nThat will speak out \"low battery power. Or to make it beep:\nprintf \"\\a\"\n\nI have a desktop, so can't see the pmset output, a quick google shows something like this would do it:\nif [[ `pmset -g batt | awk -F'[^0-9]*' '{ print $3 }'` -lt 10 ]];then say \"Battery low\";fi\n\nYou can put that into a cron to run every 5 mins or so.\nTo add this to cron to run every 5 minutes, do:\ncrontab -e\n\nand type in a line that looks like this:\n*/5  *  *  *  *  if [[ `pmset -g batt | awk -F'[^0-9]*' '{ print $3 }'` -lt 10 ]];then say \"Battery low\";fi\n\nThen save and exit. The crontab editor will be whichever is set as your default editor in $EDITOR. For me that vim, default OSX it's nano.\ncrontab -l\n\nThat lists out your crontab. For more info see: enter link description here\nTo use launchd, you'd be better off putting that into a shell script, then putting a launchd plist file in your ~/Library/LaunchDaemons folder. That's somewhat out of scope of this answer, Lingon is a great tool to control LaunchD files. See LaunchD for more information. You shell script would be be the same command as used above, with\n#!/bin/sh\n\nas the first line. Save it somewhere, make LaunchD run it.\n\nA: Instead of performing a cron job like above, why not simply set up a voice to read notifications aloud? you can do this in the dication and speech setting\n\nA: You can make the computer speak the alerts (including low battery alert) by going into 'System Preferences', clicking on 'Dictation & Speech', choosing the 'Text to Speech\" tab, and putting a check mark in front of ‘Announce when alerts are displayed’. \n\nA: There is an app now in the App Store, called BattMan, which I think will do what you need. BattMan lets you choose the battery charge level (as percentage and remaining time, whichever comes first) and will display the notification, but also play a sound (which you can separately enable/disable).\nYou can download it from the Mac App Store.\nFull Disclosure: I am the developer behind it. \n", "Q: How do I batch convert a bunch of pngs or other images into a single PDF on Mavericks? I took a bunch of screenshots and I want to make them pages in a single PDF. Selecting all four in Preview and exporting to PDF only exports two (?), separately. The \"Export to PDF\" File menu function adds a strange white border around the screenshots (and orients the page as portrait). So I converted each to PDFs individually and then combined them manually. I tried the solutions here, but Mavericks' Preview doesn't appear to work that way anymore. What's the best, free, hopefully built-in way to automate this?\n\nA: You can use the convert command if you install ImageMagick. ImageMagick isn't always a simple install, but if you install Xcode and Homebrew it should be fairly painless.\nconvert *.png foobar.pdf\nhttp://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php\n\nA: There is an Automator action - New PDF from images. It creates a single multi-page document from input images. You can create a workflow or app that would process your images that you drop onto it.\nIf I create an application in Automator with that single action, I can drop my images onto it, and it'll create a PDF with one page per image.\n\nA: Preview's \"Export As PDF...\" places the converted image onto the default paper size, e.g. A4 or US Letter. That's why you get the \"strange white border\" around the image.\nUsing Preview's \"Export...\" menu item, and selecting PDF as the format will merely convert the image to PDF without placing it on a page.\nApple's Automator action \"New PDF from Images\" works well, but suffers from Automator's limitations in where output files can be saved.\nA python script that will combine images (supplied as arguments) into a PDF file can be found here. It can be used in an Automator \"Run Shell Script\" action to create a Quick Action/Service.\n", "Q: How to install Gnuplot on mac 10.5.8? I use Mac OS 10.5.8 and I want to install Gnuplot. I have found some advice on the net but it is not useful for me. Can anyone give me some clear steps of what is needed? What programs do I need and where can I find them exactly? A step-by-step solution invoking terminal commands would be appreciated.\n\nA: http://brew.sh/\nInstall brew. The website lists the requirements, and the step by steps command line instructions. In short, it's:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL --insecure https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\"\n\nThen:\nbrew install gnuplot\n\nYou're on 10.5.8 so installation requires '--insecure' as the older version of curl didn't have the CA secure certs packaged in.\nBrew is also very handy for installing software in general. It's a unix package manager in the style of apt.\n", "Q: How can see ALL devices (including ethernet) connected to Airport Extreme? I am running Airport Utility 6.3.  I can see the list of WIRELESS clients connected.  I can't see anywhere in the utility where I can see WIRED/ETHERNET clients connected.\nOther posts on this site refer to an Advanced Settings Tab on Airport Utility 6.x. or else Manual Setup.   I don't see this anywhere in the GUI.  Under the Network tab, you can reserve static IPs, but that's not what I want, I want to see which WIRED (not just wireless) devices are actually connected.  I'm trying to troubleshoot an issue with my DirecTV box which doesn't seem to be connecting even though I have reserved an IP for its MAC address.  Yes, I can ping the IP, but the point is if I want to set it to DHCP, I wouldn't know the IP, and it would be nice to just see what all the devices are.   \n\nA: iNet\niNet will scan your network for all connected devices and show you a list of devices with their hostnames and IP addresses. It also has a dedicated mode for AirPort routers showing devices connected and relevant information about each one.\n\n\nA: The airport utility is for wireless devices.  The Network Utility shows all devices under display routing table information.  The data can be difficult to interpret.  \n\nA: I can't but wonder why AirPort Utility doesn't let the user not only enlist the connected devices, but also manage them in some way (a black list comes to mind, Forcing a device to reconnect by disconnecting it temporarily, and so on).\nUsing AirPort Utility 6.3.1 I can only see as a pop-over window, a list of WiFi devices connected to my TimeCapsule - many of which show no name, or device-type. Now I wonder --- Is there some intruder? Maybe a neighbor who cracked my network password? \nOr is it just my wife's new iPhone?\nAnd what network those devices are connected to? the \"regular\" network, or the \"guest\" network I've set up?\nThe utility is so short of answers, and of any reasonable control over connected devices. A shame.\n\nA: Open the airport utility and press the option key when you open the airport extreme and you will see a summary window on that window you will see all connected devices and some statistics. \nUnfortunately apple has removed the log option actually it has removed all the advanced options in the last version of airport utility... :( \n\nA: There's a great shell command that scans your network on all interfaces that are connected. \nThe command is arp -a. \n\nA: I am wondering why this is not available by default in Airport Utility 6.x as well. I was able to achieve the same by installing a FREE app called Fing. This is available for both Android and iOS devices.\nFing displays devices connected by ethernet as well as ones connected by wifi.\n", "Q: How can my website tell safari it's ok to save passwords? When I logged into my website in safari, I got the following message:\n\nsafari will not save your password because MyWebsite requested passwords not be\n  saved\n\nWhat meta tag/value do I need on my site to tell Safari it's ok?\n\nA: Make sure you don't have autocomplete=off in any of the forms.  This is the primary way that a website can tell a browser not to save passwords.  By default, if the website doesn't have anything, the browser will be happy to save passwords, so odds are that your website contains something like that somewhere.\n", "Q: Why do I need a credit card when I am downloading a free app from the app store on a iPad mini? I am trying to download a free app but it keeps telling me to provide a credit card. I try to avoid it but it won't let me and I don't have a credit card.\nHow can I use App Store without a credit card?\n\nA: I don't know of any way to set up an existing Apple ID for use with the App Store without supplying a credit card (or other payment source) (unless it's an iCloud account, I think -- it's not completely consistent). Don't ask me why this is, it makes no sense to me. There are a couple of ways to set up a paymentless account though:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Apple ID account as part of the purchase of a free app (see Apple Support article HT2534). You'll need to sign out of your current Apple ID, then start purchasing a free app, and tap Create New Apple ID when asked what ID to use.\nThis means that your App Store \"purchases\" will be under a different Apple ID than whatever you have set up under your current ID, but since they're free apps anyway, that's not too big a deal. If you want to purchase non-free apps later, you can always add a credit card (or iTunes gift card or whatever) to your old Apple ID and do those purchases under it, but it may be a bit alloying to have to maintain multiple identities. Note that the new Apple ID will have to be linked to a verified email address (other than the one your current ID is linked to).\n\n\n*Add a credit card to your current Apple ID, \"buy\" a free app, then change the account's payment type to \"none\" (see Apple Support article HT1918). Since you never actually buy anything, the card never gets charged. I haven't really experimented with this option, but AIUI you can continue to purchase free apps under the account even after the credit card is removed.\n\nA: I don't know the answer to \"how can I use App Store without a credit card\", but I think I can partly answer the \"why\" question in your title.\nThe reason is that credit card, apart from being a source of payment, is also a way to identify your country or region. For instance, with a U.S. credit card you can make purchases in the U.S. App Store, but with a Chinese credit card you can't—you need to go to the Chinese App Store. Why? Because different countries and regions are subject to different terms of services on the App Store, even for free apps.\nI hope the credit card thing isn't all that ridiculous now.\n", "Q: How does Apple's free apps program work? Apple recently announced that iLife and iWork suites are free with new Macs and iOS devices, but how does it work? Is it preinstalled? What happens if I wipe out the system—will it still be free in the App Store? Does it associate the apps with purchases on a single Apple ID?\n\nA: Whenever buying anything from Apple in the recent past that came with software, it's been linked to my Apple ID, so perpetually available in the App Store.\nEg. buying a Macbook just as Mountain Lion came out, it shipped without it, but was available for free from the store with it when I logged in with my Apple ID.\n", "Q: How can I get my iPhone to automatically download podcasts I have subscribed to? I am using the standard podcast app that comes with iOS 7.  I have subscribed to about 8-9 different podcasts.  Commonly I will take my phone with me when I leave the apartment, and then when I get on the subway I will attempt to listen to a podcast.  Invariably, the podcast won't play because no cellular connection is available.  To solve this issue I have indicated through the podcast app that I would like episodes to be automatically downloaded when they become available.  However, they don't get automatically downloaded.  This absolutely infuriates me.\n\nA: Indeed, check the \"Refresh Podcast\" option and set it to every hour. \nAlso, set Auto-Downloads to ALL\n\nA: Do you have the \"Refresh Podcast\" set to an appropriate interval? I.E. The frequency with which you would like it to query the podcast server for new episodes. \n", "Q: OS X Mavericks Maps: can't send direction to iPhone First of all, I have solved the problem. It took me quite a while to figure out, so I'll share the solution here in case anyone runs into the same problem.\nTo put it short, you should be able to see a \"Send to $NAME_OF_YOUR_IPHONE\" entry in the share menu of Maps.app. If you don't, then turn on \"Documents & Data\" in OS X's iCloud settings (System Settings-->iCloud). If you want more context, read on.\nFirst you need to make sure you Mac is running OS X 10.9 (which is sheer nonsense, how would you have Maps.app otherwise); your iPhone is running iOS 7 (I guess most iPhones do); and your Mac and iPhone are signed into the same iCloud account. If you do, and you don't get the right share entry, then don't try to sign out iCloud on your Mac, as some people suggested. I've tried it myself and it does not work for me. The problem is that, I'm not a big fan of mobile devices, so I usually have the \"Documents & Data\" sync option off; as soon as I signed out and signed in again, I turned off \"Documents & Data\", so nothing happened. Only when I turned it on and relaunched Maps.app did I begin to see my iPhone on my Mac.\nSo, that is my trick and it worked here. I'm not sure whether it would work for others, so if you tried my trick and nothing happened, please don't complain to me. Thanks.\n\nA: This question is also its own answer.\n", "Q: QuickTime can't play 4k video while VLC can I'm on mountain lion 10.8.5 and recently my friend gave me a 4K resolution video. When I used QuickTime player, the video is very sharp and some of the text in it can't be seen correctly. However when I used VLC to play it, it played without any errors and I can clearly see the text. I like the UI of QuickTime player, so is there any way to make it appear on QT?\n\nA: Let's be honest : appart of the UI, Quicktime X a crapy software in term of compatibility. And it became crappier since the development of Perian has stopped. And on Mavericks it's even worse (Perian doesn't work anymore ...). The cause : QuickTime X is based on the AV Foundation Framework which is only powerful with H.264 stuff (yeah the file format sold on iTunes). \nVLC is powered by a different video library than QuickTime and it's know to be one of the most compatible player yet. \nTLDR: So no there is no there is no solution yet. Let's hope the situation will evolve. \n\nA: You might want to consider using MPlayerX. It has a very clean interface and works very well, supporting pretty much any format like VLC (and unlike QuickTime, which supports pretty much nothing).\n", "Q: Migrate from OS X 10.9 back to 10.8.5 I made the mistake of thinking OS X 10.9 Mavericks was an improvement over 10.8.5 Mountain Lion and my system now is slugish, applications constantly crash, and it's generally horrible. I would like to migrate back to 10.8.5 and need my applications and settings to be transferred back onto a partition containing 10.8.5. \nI tried both migration managers and 10.9 will only move others settings over to itself, while the 10.8.5 version does not recognize the 10.9 startup volume as one it can migrate data from. I'm guessing Apple doesn't consider people might need backward compatibility, thus have seemingly left those like myself to determine a fix for issues that are a direct result of this.\nIs there a solution is there for this situation? I really would like to 'migrate' back to 10.8.5\n\nA: The easiest way would be do a Time Machine backup of your 10.9 Home and Applications folders only.\nThen do a clean install of 10.8.5 and boot up in recovery mode and restore your 10.9 Home folder, and pick which applications you wish to restore from your 10.9 Applications folder.\nI've had to do this rolling back to previous OS X versions and have rarely had too many problems.\n\nA: If you have a full backup of Mountain Lion from before the upgrade\nPerform a full restoration.\nIf you do not have a full backup of Mountain Lion from before the upgrade\nThere is no migration (no downgrade) from Mavericks to any lesser operating system. You could: \n\n\n*\n\n*backup\n\n*install Mountain Lion\n\n*from the backup, manually copy or restore selected non-system items. \n\n\nCritically\nSome data from Mavericks may be unusable with Mountain Lion. \nIf, for example, the database for Mail was upgraded by Mavericks then you should not expect that database to be reusable with Mountain Lion. \n", "Q: USB drive won't show up on boot I plugged the USB thumb drive in, booted my MacBook Pro (8,1) up and held the option key.

But I would like to also use the external `hard drive for Time Machine. Will that work? \nWill it use up all the remaining space, leaving me no room to add new media?\nShould I (and can I) partition the external hard drive without losing my files?\n\nA: Time machine will use \"up to\" all the partition. So at the beginning there is going to be free space remaining. This free space will lessen with the time. When the partition is full, TimeMachine will delete the oldest backups.\nSo yes I would suggest a partition and yes the Disk Utility will allow you to partition your hard drive with a low probability of data loss. (When formatting there is always a probability of dataloss but it's really low). \n\nA: If there is anything in iTunes that you want to backup, you should buy an additional drive instead. You don't want to have both the data and the backup on the same physical drive. Personally, I'd get another drive rather than mess around with repartioning drives that are not backed up.\n", "Q: How to fix multiple errors when installing Homebrew on OSX Lion (mainly OSXFUSE and Mono related) I'm trying to install Homebrew but I'm getting multiple errors when brew doctor is run.\nI'm a complete noob at this and I've tried uninstalling Homebrew and re-installing, but still not working.\nHere's what it shows:\nWarning: /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework detected\nThis can be picked up by CMake's build system and likely cause the build to\nfail.

(Related: disabling emoji systemwide) I use the Chinese keyboard on OS X Mavericks, and I'm sure this is the case for other versions of OS X, where when I type in Chinese, like 爱情 and emoji like hearts come up.. which is annoying because the emoji takes up a space that otherwise would be filled with relevant characters and I don't use emoji. While not urgent, it'd be nice if I could just get rid of them once and for all. \nI've looked through the keyboard settings for Chinese and couldn't find an option to disable the emoji and also did some Googling online if you can do a system-wide disable of emoji, and couldn't find anything.\n\nA: The following method is produced on OS X 10.9.\nThe emoji definition file is at /usr/share/mecabra/zh/common/emoji.plist.\nYou just replace it with an empty plist file (back it up first). The input method will not start again if you simply remove or rename the file. I use the following Python code:\nfrom plistlib import dump\n\ndump({}, open('emoji.plist', 'wb'))\n\nThe Python version I use is 3.4. You have to use sudo to replace the file.\nThen you reload the input method by doing killall SCIM, and then activate the input method again. If the SCIM process fails to start, log out and log in again. Now the Chinese input method would be emoji-free.\nPS: I like the emoji feature. Emoji is the first reason I use the Apple Chinese input method rather than other third party ones.\n", "Q: Time Machine error creating the backup folder on a spacious hard drive I have upgraded recently to Mavericks, and am setting up Time Machine on this system for the first time (it wasn't set up with the earlier OS, Mountain Lion.)\nTime Machine successfully backs up once after I boot the laptop.  However, every time it tries to back up again while the laptop is running (I don't normally perform a full shutdown and reboot very often!) it fails with the error message: \"An error occurred while creating the backup folder.\"\n\nI would like to eject the drive and plug it in again to see if this helps, but clicking the Eject button in Finder shows this message:\n\nand I have not wanted to do a Force Eject.

Ever since I updated my iPad mini to iOS 7, my son (4 y.o.) has been making sneaky in-app purchases. What's worse is he knows how he's doing it, but won't spill the beans when I ask him how. Whatever his 'trick' is, it doesn't seem to work on our other iPad, which has not been updated to iOS 7.\nI think I figured it out last night. After I input my password to install a (free) application, it seems he can hop in to an app and make a purchase using the 'cached' password. In the past I thought the password would be requested again for in-app purchases.\nHave there been any changes to AppStore passwords in iOS 7, specifically the length of time before the password will be asked for again, or a change that allows in-app purchases during the 'caching' period? Or is this simply a change in his behavior?\nI've disabled in-app purchases now. Slightly annoying but it does solve the problem.\n\nA: You can leave in-app purchases on if you wish.\nOnce you have enabled Restrictions then at the bottom of the second section, Allowed Content you will see Require Password and underneath they even have a little prompt Require password for purchases.\nChange this from the default of 15 minutes to Immediately and your problem is fixed.\n", "Q: Install Mavericks from usb drive on new HDD I replaced my old HDD with a new one.

When in a browser (Chrome or Safari), the following keyboard shortcuts both launch the MacOS Mail app, and there doesn't seem to be any way to change or disable them.\nCommand+I\nCommand+Shift+I\nCmd-I / ⌘-I is particularly annoying because of course that is much more often used to italicize text.\nIs there any way to disable this shortcut?\n\nA: I am a Linux user when using a desktop but OS X for laptops. My need is to insure that I have the same shortcut for the Inspector using Chrome. It was very inconvenient to have the Mail.app popup each time that I would confuse the shortcuts. \nI should add that in order to make Linux closer to OSX I swap the control and the alt keys on the Linux side. This allows me to use Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v and many other shortcuts in the more ergonomic position of the command key, e.g. OS X Cmd-c, Cmd-v. In the pictures you will see that I have mapped Ctrl-Shift-I which would not make sense in the Linux side otherwise.\nHere is my shortcuts setup\n\nThe important part of the setting is to know that the OSX shortcut must be mapped to the exact name of the menu entry. I stated that I am using High Sierra because \"Email Link\" is the menu label. This could also be dependent on the Chrome version I suppose. Make sure the spelling is identical.\nThe steps to reproduce are\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Menu System Preferences ...\n\n*Keyboard Menu\n\n*Shortcuts Tab\n\n*App Shortcuts from the left Pane\n\n*Click the Plus sign under the right pane\n\n*Select YOUR APP from the applications list, in my case Chrome\n\n*Add the name of the menu label, in my case Email Link\n\n*Add some shortcut you will not use, in my case Cmd-Shift-E \n\n*Then, add another shortcut for the target operation, in my case Developer Tools\n\n*Add the desired shortcut, in my case Cmd-Shift-I\n\n\nA: The command-line solution given in another answer eventually worked for me but I needed to do one more thing:\nafter defaults write com.google.Chrome NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\\0', \nI entered the command: \nkillall cfprefsd (and killall Finder for good measure). \nThis stopped the annoying Cmd-Shift-I shortcut on Chrome from creating a new mail message, but I can't get it to stop happening in Safari, unfortunately.\nkillall cfprefsd clears the preferences cache\nkillall Finder restarts the Finder\nThe GUI method described at the top didn't work at all for me, but maybe because I didn't clear the prefs cache.\n\nA: Unfortunately none of the answers given here were able to prevent Command+I from triggering Email This Page in Safari for me (running macOS Sierra). The only way I have been able to prevent that behavior is by using FastScripts to map Command+I to an empty AppleScript. The script must be stored in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari to prevent it from disabling use of the shortcut for italics in other applications.\nUnfortunately this approach has the side effect of disabling the use of Command+I to toggle italics in Safari where that is its default behavior, such as in Google Docs or in this answer box on AskDifferent. For me that's worth avoiding being thrown into my email inbox whenever I try to italicize text in a text box in Safari that doesn't support it.\n\nA: The accepted answer is not working on my MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra system.\nI found a solution to disable Command+Shift+i in Chrome:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the Chrome extension Shortkeys.\n\n*Open the Shortkeys's preference panel, add a command+shift+i shortcut like below:\n\n\n*Restart Chrome.\nNow you can say goodbye to the annoying Mac Mail!\n\nA: You can change the shortcuts from System Preferences:\n\nIf you want to disable the shortcuts, edit the NSUserKeyEquivalents dictionaries directly:\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\\0'\ndefaults write com.google.Chrome.canary NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Page Location' '\\0'\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Email Link to This Page' '\\0' 'Email This Page' '\\0'\n\nThen quit and reopen Chrome and Safari to apply the changes.\n\nA: Taking a look at Chrome's keyboard shortcuts helps.\nCmnd+Shift+I is to \"Email the current page\". It's a bit annoying because it's so close to the developer tools (Cmnd+Opt+I).\n\nA: You can also use Better Touch Tool to override the shortcuts (globally or for any specific application).\nGiven I was already using this app, it's been the solution for me since none of the other answers mentioned here worked for me (High Sierra), and I didn't want to install new software.\n\nA: The easiest way that I could find is to assign the keyboard shortcut to activate one of your installed extensions\nchrome://extensions/shortcuts\n\nA: The answer from Glorfindel worked great for me! I'm suprised that it's not voted much better.\nTo stop this pesky Mail app from launching you just need to assign it's shortcut (Cmd-Shift-I) to something else:\n1) assign it to making a copy of the screen to the clipboard - it stops it in Safari, Chrome, Finder (looks like everywhere)\n\n2) assign it to launching Developer Tools in Chrome - the only disadvantage Mail will still be launched in Safari - you get Developer Tools always!\n\n", "Q: Tagging system files I noticed that system files and folders cannot be tagged using the UI in Finder and I am wondering whether there is a workaround – Terminal based or otherwise.\nThere are a number of system files I'd like easy access to and tags would serve that purposes.\n\nA: I would suggest doing what @Lauri Ranta proposes : doing this with xattr\nUsing xattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \"$(xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo 'file1')\" \"file2\"\nyou can copy the tag from file 1 to file 2. \nSince /System/ is not writable for users, you just going to need to use sudo. \nEdit:  To see the tagged files, you'll need a Finder with root access. \nYou can get it as using : \nkillall Finder &&udo /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/MacOS/Finder\n/!\\ But Warning. A Finder with Root access is very dangerous and you could easily destroy your system. \nEdit2: With the Root Finder you can directly change the tag without using the command line. But Again, root Finder is baaaad. \n", "Q: How can I edit a file without altering its modif date? How can I edit a file without altering its modification date ? In command line. Is vi able to that ?\n\nA: The only way I can think of is to store it's modification date before altering it and then to set it back again. \nI'm not aware of any CLI tool that would allow you to do that, however years ago I've written something in C that I used to set the modification date on a file to arbitrary value. I know this is not the answer that you're looking for, but I would do this the following way: \n\n\n*\n\n*get the original access time and the modification time for a file, before you alter it. For this, you can just use stat() system call (read more about it by issuing man 2 stat). \n\n*alter the file, using vi or any other editor you like\n\n*set the modification time back to what it was. This can be done using the utimes() call (again, you can read more by issuing man 2 utimes command). Please note, utimes() sets both the access time and the modification time.\n\n\nEdit \nActually it seems like there's already a CLI tool that can do that. According to this answer: How to change the creation (st_birthtime) date/time of a file in Lion?, you can use touch command to change those times: touch -m changes the modification time and touch -a changes the access time (you can use both options in one call). All you'd need to do then is use the stat command line on the file before you modify it and display its access and modification times. Then do the edit and after that, use touch to set the access/modification times back to their values from before the edit.\n\nA: You can use touch -t to change the modification and access times, touch -m to change the modification time, or touch -a to change the access time. All of them also change the creation time if the target time is before the original creation time.\n$ ls -lT test.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 lauri  staff  3 Nov  3 15:13:42 2013 test.txt\n$ date -jf %s $(stat -f%m test.txt) +%Y%m%d%H%M.%S\n201311031513.42\n$ vi test.txt\n$ ls -lT test.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 lauri  staff  3 Nov  3 15:18:18 2013 test.txt\n$ touch -t 201311031513.42 test.txt\n$ ls -lT test.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 lauri  staff  3 Nov  3 15:13:42 2013 test.txt\n\nstat -f%m specifies the format string as the modification time. In date -jf, -j disables setting the time and -f specifies the format.\n", "Q: How to enable missing tag search in Spotlight? OS X Mavericks adds better support for tags. You can search tagged files using Spotlight with the query tag:tagname. \nHowever, this stopped working for me a few days after upgrading form OS X Mountain Lion. Whatever I search for, no results. My tagged files are still tagged and I can use them via OS X’s “smart folders“ and third-party tools. It even works in Finder windows when entering only tagname and choosing the proposed tag. I use OS X 10.9 (13A603).\nIs there any switch to enable it in the Spotlight dialogue again or could it just be a bug or even a known issue? I haven’t found anything so far. \nThank you for your help.\n\nA: I don't know the definitive answer, but we could usually solve these issues by rebuilding the spotlight index. Takes a couple of hours, but most issues are fixed that way:\nsudo mdutil -E / #deletes the spotlight index\nsudo mdutil -i on / # starts the reindexing process\n\nAdditionally, you can use the commands here for an even more lowlevel approach\n", "Q: Is InsomniaX working on Mavericks?

You'll have to boot from a different disk than the one that you are trying to erase. Mac OS X won't erase the disk from which it is currently running.\n\nA: You are attempting to modify a disk that the system still wants access to, causing it to fail to unmount it.\nBoot into the Recovery HD by holding ⌘R on boot, open Disk Utility and try from there.\n", "Q: How can I find what process is starting apps in the background? I keep seeing CIJScannerRegister running. I'd like it to never run. Every time it appears I use launchctl to remove its listing and that kills the app. But it reappears later.

I've looked through /System/Library/Launch{Agents,Daemons} and cannot find any matching entry in there. How can I find the process that is launching it and tell it to stop?\n\nA: CIJScannerRegister is of no use if you don't have an old Canon Inkjet, but Mavericks really wants to have it running all the time.\nIt's in /Library/Image Capture/Support/LegacyDeviceDiscoveryHelpers, but if you remove it it will appear again in the form of a \"Canon Inkjet Printer Software Update\" in the App Store.\nThe only solution I found was to delete the executable inside the app bundle so the OS thinks it's still installed but it can't run.\nIn Terminal:\nkillall CIJScannerRegister\ncd /Library/Image\\ Capture/Support/LegacyDeviceDiscoveryHelpers/CIJScannerRegister.app/Contents/MacOS/\nsudo rm CIJScannerRegister\n\n\nA: You can use the PPID to find out which process started another process : \nps axo stat,ppid,pid,comm\nPPID referes to the PID of the process who started it. \n\nA: Run Activity Monitor (from /Applications/Utilities), click on the CIJScannerRegister process, then press Cmd+I (or use the Inspect button or go to View > Inspect Process).

Is it possible to clear all the data (messages, pictures, videos) when the phone does not have a signal and is not connected to the internet?\n\nA: No, the iPhone must have some form of internet connectivity to receive the signal to erase.\nSince you have disabled the phone's mobile internet, the only way it will receive the signal is if another SIM card is put in the phone which would enable the data, or it is connected to a Wi-Fi network.\n", "Q: How to disable default keyboard layout shorcut in OS X 10.8? When I select the \"Simplified Pinyin\" layout in Mac OS X 10.8, the shortcut Shift+6 is assigned to \"Display smileys\" (see screenshot below).\n\nHowever, since this is a French keyboard, Shift+6 is normally to print the number 6, which means I can no longer type this number.\nIs there any way to disable or change this keyboard shortcut?\nEdit:\nI've tried reassigning the menu item to a different shortcut but that didn't work:\n\nIs there any other way to change or remove this shortcut?\n\nA: You can change the shortcuts from the keyboard preference pane:\n\nIn 10.9 the Show Punctuation and Show Facemarks menu items were combined into a single item that has option-shift-B as the shortcut.\nOn some keyboards you can also insert 6 by pressing fn-O.\n", "Q: Mail.app in Mavericks moves Gmail mails to Trash instead of Archiving them In OS X before Mavericks, Mail.app with a Gmail account would remove messages only from the inbox when deleting them,  but leave them in the All Mail folder; essentially archiving them. In Mavericks it now moves them to the Trash entirely. What gives?\n\nA: Mavericks Mail.app is now actually aware of the All Mail folder and has \"archiving\" as a separate concept, just like iOS does. The old delete-from-inbox-to-archive was arguably a hack in Gmail's IMAP implementation which now no longer works. Now \"Delete\" actually means delete and \"Archive\" means archive.\nThe new command is in the menu under Message > Archive, its keyboard shortcut is ⌃⌘A. You can add the Archive button to the toolbar via View > Customise Toolbar... if it's not there.\nApparently you will also have to show the All Mail folder to IMAP clients, which is something you have to configure in your settings on the Gmail website. I have not confirmed this though, I always had it on anyway.\n\nA: I created a simple Mail.app plugin that you can install to restore the pre-Maverick archiving behaviour.

This is a general graphics question although I would especially like to apply it to my Early 2013 Macbook Pro Retina 15\". I have gfxCardStatus running and whenever I connect one of my 1280x1024 or 1920x1200 external monitors, it tells me it has to switch to the dedicated graphics chip to continue running - and promptly the battery indicator in the top menu bar recalculates a significantly lower remaining time (when running on battery). Here is another example where connecting multiple external screens made the fans in the Macbook Pro go mad and the whole system react slowly even when otherwise idle.\nThis confuses me for two reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*My old Macbook Pro (2009, non-retina, internal GFX) could effortlessly drive the same external display with only an internal graphics chip. Why can the new Macbook Pro not do that?\n\n*I have been using multiple monitors since 2000 when I bought my first TFT and hooked it up to the second output of my NVIDIA Geforce2 card. Why do graphics cards in 2013 choke at driving three or four screens when graphics cards in 2000 could do two easily (even with 3D support) and hardware nowadays is several orders of magnitude faster?\n\n\nA: It's likely that the external display connections are simply wired directly to the discrete GPU. The internal display is connected to a gmux chip that handles switching between GPUs and it probably would have been significantly more complex to route the 3 external ports the same way.\nI think it's fair to assume that most users connecting external displays will have AC power available, so this seems like a fine way to simplify things.\nIt's definitely not an issue of graphical power - I use an external 2560x1440 monitor with the new Iris Pro-only 15\" rMBP and previously used it with an Intel HD 3000-equipped 13\" MBP, both of which handle it fine.\n", "Q: Open command doesn't like non escaped characters even between quotes?

Here are some examples:\n$ echo ~\n/Users/gordon\n$ echo \"~\"\n~\n$ ls ~/Library\nAccounts        Fonts Disabled      Printers\n[...]\n$ ls \"~/Library\"\nls: ~/Library: No such file or directory\n\nNote the last command above: since ~ is inside double-quotes, it doesn't get replaced by the path to my home folder, and then ls just treats is as a normal filename (that happens not to exist). The same thing is happening in your open command.\nSince the file you're actually trying to open has other shell metacharacters in its name, what you should do is partially-quote the path: leave the ~ outside the quotes, but make sure the filename part is inside quotes. Something like this:\nopen ~/\"Library/Messages/Attachments/87/07/079C263B-0586-48C6-B721-3C6AABAC76DF/Messages Image(1020754653).jpeg\"\n\n\nA: Well I did not read correctly the output of the error.  \nopen is one hell of a *. \nIt adds the working directory ahead of the command when using quotes. \n/Users/Kyro/Library/Messages/~/Library/Messages/ doesn't make any sense. \n\nA: As an appendix to @Gordon Davidsons answer:\nFrom the Bash Man Page:\nEXPANSION\n\nExpansion is performed on the command line after it has been split\n  into words.  There are seven kinds of  expansion  performed: brace\n  expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command\n  substitution, arithmetic expansion, word splitting, and pathname\n  expansion.\n\nTilde Expansion\n\nIf a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), all of the\n  characters  preceding  the  first unquoted  slash (or all characters,\n  if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a tilde-prefix.  If none\n  of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in\n  the  tilde-prefix  following the  tilde are treated as a possible\n  login name.  If this login name is the null string, the tilde is\n  replaced with the value of the shell parameter HOME.  If HOME is\n  unset, the  home  directory  of  the user  executing  the  shell is\n  substituted instead.  Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the\n  home directory associated with the specified login name.\nIf the tilde-prefix is a ~+', the value of the shell variable PWD\n  replaces the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a~-', the value\n  of the shell variable OLDPWD, if it is set, is substituted.  If the\n  characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number\n  N, optionally  prefixed  by  a +'  or  a-', the tilde-prefix is\n  replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as\n  it would be displayed by the dirs builtin invoked with the\n  tilde-prefix as an  argument.   If  the characters  following the\n  tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading +' or\n  -', `+' is assumed.\nIf the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word\n  is unchanged.\nEach variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes\n  immediately  following  a  :  or  the first  =.   In  these cases,\n  tilde expansion is also performed.  Consequently, one may use file\n  names with tildes in assignments to PATH, MAILPATH, and CDPATH, and\n  the shell assigns the expanded value.\n\n", "Q: No more notification for iMessage with Mavericks I did the upgrade to Mavericks few days ago.

I can send messages on my iPhone to the same people that I want to message to using my iPad, with no problem.\n\nA: iMessage is actually an instant messaging service, like Google Talk or AOL Instant Messenger, except iMessage is made by Apple and is only for Apple products. Only an iPhone with cellular can send SMS messages as well, and can automatically associate phone numbers of registered iMessage users with iMessage accounts, so if you try to use the app to send a text to a phone number registered to an iPhone, it will send an iMessage instead. iPads cannot send SMS messages to non-Apple devices nor an iMessage to a phone number not registered with iMessage from a Wi-Fi-only device.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3529\n\nA: Actually, you can send SMS from your iPad to anyone, just like your iPhone can text non-iPhone users. It's a complicated multistep process to set it up, but here goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, make sure you're signed into iMessage on your iPad in Settings > Messages > iMessage.\n\n*Jump over to your iPhone and confirm you're signed into iMessage and iCloud with the same account here, too.\n\n*Still on your iPhone, go to Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding.\n\n*Inside Text Message Forwarding, flip the switches to enable sending text messages on one device at a time. Then look at that device – you'll see a confirmation number that you'll have to enter on your iPhone.

This, in my opinion, makes it essentially useless. Since most of my messaging contacts do not have apple products, I turned off my iPad Air messaging and simply use my iPhone for all of my text messaging. I consider this to be a design flaw in iPad Air which will hopefully be recognized and corrected sometime in the near future. \n\nA: iMessage sends the message through Apple to the intended recipient. Because the iPad is WiFi without cellular [data], SIM cards cannot be inserted and therefore the iPad is not able to message non-Apple users. As noted, 'only sim-cards have access to the GSM network to send SMS messages'.\nUpdate: You can now send text messages through your iPad if you have an iPhone.

Any user account can be a member of multiple groups. On my system the only member of staff is root; admins are all in the admin group. wheel is another group name you'll frequently see for some system files; it's a popular group name on Linux systems to assign to files so that admins can edit them without using their password in sudo.\nIt should also be noted that Mac OS X supports access control lists that provide more granular control over file permissions than traditional Unix permissions; IIRC the + in the file permissions list indicates there are such extended permissions associated with the file.\n\nA: Alternative methods for listinggroupsand theirgid:\nList sorted by group name:\ndscl . list /Groups PrimaryGroupID\n\nList sorted by group gid:\ndscl . list /Groups PrimaryGroupID | tr -s ' ' | sort -n -t ' ' -k2,2\n\nList groups with members:\ndscl . list /Groups GroupMembership\n\nNote: neither dscacheutil nor dscl list members of the group staff other than root.

I understand that the Samba has been removed from OS X, and Apple has developed their own version. I remember trying connecting to the Samba drive when I first upgraded to Lion, and it didn't work so I gave up. But now I need it. Back in Snow Leopard, I used to write smb://URL/username. I didn't have to enter an IP address, but rather a URL to the network drive followed by my username, and it used to work perfectly. It's a URL because this network drive is hosted on campus at my university. I now receive the following error:\nCheck the server name or IP address, and then try again. If you continue to have problems, contact your system administrator.\nAs far as I know, nothing has changed on this network drive side.

If you have a spare bootable drive you might want to install a fresh copy of Mavericks and boot from that to see if your issue goes away,\n", "Q: Why is the Caching service stuck waiting for push token and never starts on OS X Server (Mavericks)? I've installed OS X Server app on a Mid-2007 iMac running OS X Mavericks. The installation was successful, but the Caching server doesn't start. The Server application graphically indicates that the server is started, but sudo serveradmin status caching indicates as follows:\ncaching:CacheStatus = \"STARTING\"\ncaching:StartupStatus = \"PENDING\"\n\nWhen I examine /Library/Server/Caching/Logs/Debug.log, the last two relevant lines are always:\nRegistering for notifications\nWaiting for push token\n\nYet, when I go to the server's Settings pane in the Server app, the \"Enable Apple push notifications\" option is checked, and the details dialog available after clicking \"Edit...\" indicates a valid push notifications certificate. When I click \"Manage your certificates\" in the same dialog, the \"Apple Push Certificates Portal\" website indicates a valid certificate as well.\nThe cache doesn't want to start - what's up? How do I get the elusive push token?\n\nA: The clue came from the system log, looking at the entries from Apple Push Services Daemon (apsd):\napsd[69]: Hardware SerialNumber \"System Serial#\" looks incorrect or invalid\n\nIt turns out that this machine had a logic board (motherboard) replaced a while ago by Apple, and they never bothered to flash the machine's serial number. The only fix is to look for the tool that Apple technicians themselves use to flash the serial number onto a new motherboard.\nI had to write down the serial # from the bottom of the stand and double-check on apple's support status site to make sure it matches my system. The serial flash tool will only let you set a new number, it won't change it, so if you mess up you're out of luck.\nAfter running the tool and rebooting the system, the caching service started correctly without further ado.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut using 'Mac Driver' in WINE I would like to map the Command key to the Control key but, have it affective only while running a WINE application using the new 'Mac Driver', not X11. I tried a registry edit but, I don't know what I'm doing and google hasn't been very helpful. \nNo third party software! I don't want to hear about anything like KeyRemap4MacBook.\n\nA: I was looking to solve the same issue in order to use the same hotkeys inside Wine as for regular OS X applications. No information on that is available from what I can tell so the easiest solution turned out finding the source code of winemac.drv. The important function is macdrv_compute_keyboard_layout() which does lots of various computations but for the modifier keys it all essentially boils down to taking values from default_map (all modifier keys are marked as \"fixed\"). Unfortunately, as of Wine 1.7.10 there is no configurability here so the map values have to be changed by modifying the compiled file.\nFor me the compiled file was located under /Applications/Wine.app/Contents/Resources/lib/wine/winemac.drv.so. It's generally a good idea to create a copy of the original file before changing it. You need a hex editor to open it. First let's have a look at the following two lines:\n{ VK_RMENU,                 0x38 | 0x100,   TRUE },     /* kVK_RightCommand */\n{ VK_LMENU,                 0x38,           TRUE },     /* kVK_Command */\n\nAccording to the virtual key table VK_RMENU has the value 0xA5 and VK_LMENU the value 0xA4. In other words, the binary representation of these two lines looks like this:\nA5 00 38 01 01 00 00 00\nA4 00 38 00 01 00 00 00\n\nI found this byte sequence at the offset 0x62770, for your Wine build things might be slightly different. We want to map the Command key to VK_LCONTROL and VK_RCONTROL meaning that these two entries have to be changed into:\nA3 00 1d 01 01 00 00 00\nA2 00 1d 00 01 00 00 00\n\nNow I would also like to map the Option key to Alt because I need a working Alt key. By default both Option keys are unmapped, meaning that they are represented by a sequence of eight zeroes in the table and need to be found by position. The left Option key is the third entry after left Command, the right Option key is the sixth entry after left Command (for me offset 0x62790 and 0x627A8 respectively). The first entry can be changed into:\nA4 00 38 00 01 00 00 00\n\nAnd the second into:\nA5 00 38 01 01 00 00 00\n\nYes, these are the values originally assigned to the Command key. I actually only changed the entry for the left Option key, this way the right Option key can still be used to produce special characters.\nThis isn't a great solution, more of a hack that will have to be repeated each time Wine is updated. Also, remapping the Option key only works for keyboard shortcuts like Alt-F4 but not for Alt-F. Still, it does the job for now and in future Wine developers will hopefully add some configuration here. I filed the corresponding change request as bug 35351.\n\nA: Wladimir's answer (and other help he provided on his own site) made it easy to put together a modified copy of the source code, so that the Mac driver maps the Alt key to the Option key and the Win key to the Cmd key, plus a patched copy of the winemac.drv.so file. Details here:\nhttp://www.columbia.edu/~em36/winekeymap.html\nAll credit goes to Wladimir.

Thanks.\n\nA: OSX stores details of all downloaded files and applications in a database per user, which you can find here: -\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV*\n\nI expect that if you were to find the relevant entry and delete it from the database, it would solve your problem.\nYou can read more about that here.\n", "Q: I lost all my calendar events after updating to iOS 7 After updating to iOS 7 on my iPhone 5, I lost all the events on my calendar in the months previous to the update.  How can I recover those?\n\nA: Do you use iCloud or another cloud service to store your calendars? If yes, it may be related to your sync settings. The standard is to synchronize only events up to 30 days back. If you want to change to another period, go to the calendar section of the system settings and choose a sync period there.\n", "Q: Is it possible to manage the iCloud keychain? I like to know if it is possible to manage the iCloud keychain, means, deleting elements. I tried the under the OS X keychain app in the iCloud tab but after a clean install of OS X, everything was restored. So, is it possible or not?\n\nA: As described in Apples iCloud FAQ: To delete the Keychain completely, you have to deselect Allow approving using security code in the iCloud Account details under system preferences. After that, turn off the Keychain usage on every device that is using it. This will delete the complete keychain. Turning on the Allow approving using security code will result in a clean keychain.\nIf you want to edit items stored in the iCloud keychain you can do so via the Mac OS X keychain app or from your iDevice in the Safari preferences.\nMac OS X example: On the left, select iCloud and delete / edit items on the right.\n\n", "Q: CVS on OS X Mavericks Apparently, Apple has removed CVS under the OS X 10.9 Mavericks devtools (and yes, it's really gone). For the uninitiated, CVS is the Concurrent Version System, a tool for keeping files up to date between different machines and users (developers).\nI have some legacy projects that still require it (no, I cannot change it to use SVN, much less git).\nWhere is the best place to get a version that works under OS X Mavericks?\n\nA: edit:\nAs remarked in the comments git requires a working cvs client which makes this approach just a nice interop layer but not a solution to the problem of a missing csv client.\nAnother option would be to use git as a cvs client and directly push to the CVS server.\nDepending on your needs this could be sufficient cvs interop + a advantage of using git locally.\n\nA: A unix-ish package manager is clearly the way to go. I have moved from fink and Macports to homebrew, which has a recipe for cvs:\nbrew install cvs\n\nFor historical completeness, you formerly had to use the \n (slightly hard to find) recipe for cvs: brew install homebrew/dupes/cvs.\nAfter only very minimal testing, it seems to work.\n\nA: The easiest way for most programs is to install with a package manager like Macports, Homebrew or Fink. The porters will have worked out the issues about porting the code to OSX so it should be as simple as follows (for Macports)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install macports, download the .pkg file and run it\n\n*Install Xcode and its command line tools\n\n*Add /opt/local/bin to your path - the installer attempts to do this for you so you probably just need to check\n\n*Install the port sudo port install cvs\n\n*Run cvs either with the full path /opt/local/bin/cvs or use your PATH\n\n\nA: CVSNT runs on Mac OS X 10.9, and supports HQX encoding of resources etc.   Beta for 10.9 is available here:\nhttp://march-hare.com/cvspro/#downcvsnt\nIf you previously used Mac CVS X then this (CVSNT) is the 'command line' that was previously included.\n\nA: I just had this same problem, and a big issue with Macports, Fink etc. is that they pull in lots of other depedencies which is confusing and unnecessary if all you need is a single tool like cvs. In my case, trying to install it using macports resulted in a popup asking me to install a java compiler (?!) and dozens of other packets had to be built so I quickly pulled eject :)\nIf all you need is cvs, just building it yourself is easy and more clean and the resulting binary integrates with all the existing libs etc. on the computer. You do need Xcode installed and its command-line tools, but if you need cvs, I'm sure you already have this installed.\nGet the cvs sourcecode from:\nhttp://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/cvs/source/stable/1.11.23/\nun-tar it into a folder, enter the folder, and run ./configure\nYou then (unfortunately) need to edit the files in src/ and lib/ to rename their getline function into, say, getlineX, because getline clashes with a libc function.

It does seem to trigger again near the end, so I'm currently using a delay and then checking for the existence of a .inprogress backup, but it's not really an ideal solution, and sometimes Time Machine's cleanup stage will trigger the process multiple times.\nIs there a more specific path that I could watch that will trigger my process only when Time Machine has finished a backup?\nI realise I should perform my checks anyway to be sure, but currently my process is triggering several times per backup, which isn't what I want.\n\nA: A simple solution is to use the tmutil command to manually trigger the backup and follow it up with your process (as part of a shell script that does both these steps).\n\n\n*\n\n*First, turn off automatic backups from System Preferences > Time Machine or using the command tmutil disable\n\n*Use tmutil startbackup --auto --block to trigger a backup once every hour (the --block option is required to make the execution wait until the backup is finished)\n\n*Follow this with launching your process\n\n\nSee man tmutil for more information on using Time Machine from the command line.\n\nA: Okay, so after setting up a launch agent to log information for a while I've come up with a combined solution.\nQuite simply I created a launch-agent that watches the com.apple.TimeMachine.plist file for updates like-so:\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n <plist version=\"1.0\">\n <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>org.example.backupd</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>do something</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n         <string>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist</string>\n     </array>\n </dict>\n </plist>\n\nThis file is updated every time Time Machine performs a backup, and runs towards the end (during the cleaning up/finishing stage I believe). With this in mind it is possible to invoke a script with the above watch path that checks to see if backupd is still running; if it is then the script sleeps for a minute and checks again, repeating until backupd has finished, before proceeding with whatever it needs to do.\nThis now allows post-backup actions to be triggered such as performing secondary backups (in my case via rsync to a NAS), checking the size of the last backup and other handy things.\nAnyway, this solution seems to be the best way to do it, as I couldn't find any path to watch that triggers reliably after a backup is complete, but this should run close enough to the end of a backup to be useful.\n", "Q: How to suppress the “OS X Spotlight search information was removed” warning? Whenever I open an old Pages document in Pages 5, I now get the following warning message:\n\nSome changes were made to your document.\nOS X Spotlight search information was removed.\n\n\nIs there a way to suppress this annoying and useless warning forever? Like, a shell script I can run on a list of documents to remove the search information all in one go? (I assumed xattr would help with this, but I couldn’t find any specific metadata on the files.)\n\nA: Simply save the document and you will be asked if you want to upgrade.

The rest of the device works fine, so we are using it for development purpose on our build server (we are using some third-party libraries which have not been built for the iPad simulator architecture so we must have a physical device connected to be able to build). The trouble is that we have bought a new build server and since our iPad is running iOS 7 we get the authorization dialogue: \"Trust the currently connected computer? Trusting this computer will allow it to have full access to your device and all of its data.\" Since we cannot tap the \"Trust\" button the new machine is not able to use the iPad for development.\nSo my question is if it is possible to authorize the computer without having a working touch screen.\n\nA: No.\nIf you could simply override the setting from the computer, that would defeat the purpose of iOS not exposing internal data until it has been approved through the touch interface. \n", "Q: Detecting lost iphone using IMEI number My iphone was stolen today, i erased my iphone thereafter.

There you can select which books you want to sync to your iOS device.\nIt appears to sync your pages placement too.\n\nA: I had this same problem. I was seeing it in iTunes, but continued to see it when I upgraded to Ventura where finder is used to sync. Originally, I thought it was because I was running an older version of the OS, but when I upgraded the problem persisted. For a long time I got around the problem by using air drop to sync the eBook to my iphone or ipad. I just recently noticed that in my iCloud settings, sync books was turned on (which I didn't want because I have a lot of ebooks and I don't want them all synced to my mobile device). When I turned off ebooks in my iCloud sync setting, all of my eBooks in the Books app started showing up again as options for syncing.\n\nA: I assume the book in question doesn't show up in iTunes when syncing your iPhone?\nYou have to get the epub onto your iPhone and open it with iBooks. I used Dropbox to get it on there, I assume Mail would also work. If it states that it can't show epub files, just use the share button to open with iBooks.\n\nA: I’ve been having a hard time with this as well. Basically the only work around solution I’ve been able to have any success with is to save the ebooks & PDF’s (ones obviously not purchased via iBooks) to a desktop file which is then uploaded to the Cloud. This is then accessible to all of the devices. On my iPhone I have a “File” app which is part of the iOS 11 update & I can then download the desired books onto my iPhone that way. It’s a hassle but at least I’m not having to get my MacBook out each time I want to read something that hadn’t stayed on my device after a backup/sync with iTunes.

When I open iBooks on my Mac, those samples do not show up, even when clicking View > Show iCloud Books.\nThe solution for me was to search for the book in the iBooks Store on my Mac, then download it on the Mac.  After that, my notes and highlights appeared in both places and synced across iCloud.\n", "Q: How can I configure OS X Mavericks to use a UK PC keyboard layout? I'm using a non-mac USB UK keyboard with Mavericks.  Because Apple's idea of a UK keyboard is different to a non-apple UK keyboard, some symbols are wrong, e.g. \" and @ are swapped.\nHow can I get set my keyboard layout to match a non-mac UK keyboard?\n\nA: To get this working correctly (without downloading anything extra) I had to go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources.\nBritish was the only option I had there, but clicking the + icon brought up a list which included British - PC. Simply add that one, THEN remove the original British option using the - icon.\nMy keyboard was correctly mapped to the British default after that. It didn't work until after I removed the original British option, so only British - PC was in Input Sources.\n\nA: If the British PC layout from apple is not right, some alternatives can be found at\nhttp://liyang.hu/osx-british.xhtml\n\nA: I agree with the previous answers. Alternatively there is a software called Ukelele with which you can remap your keyboard as you like. I didn't find this answer before when I was looking for the \"proper\" British-PC layout. With the app it takes 5-10 minutes to redo your keyboard - there are ready-made samples inside which you can use as a templates.\nI hope it helps.\n\nA: After downloading alternatives from the link suggested in Tomg's answer, I realised while making them active that there is already a \"British - PC\" layout installed by default.\nTo activate it was Settings->Keyboard->Input Sources->Plus sign & find it from the list, and then click the input source icon in the menu bar to select it.\n", "Q: Pictures attached to messages \"vanishes\" I get a notification on the main screen of a picture that was messaged to me and can see the picture, but when I go into the message the picture isn't there.\n\nA: Restart the iPhone and try again. \n", "Q: Activate iPhone with any sim?

One thing to keep in mind though is you may want to skip setting up iCloud until after you remove the borrowed sim card.\nAfter you've ejected the sim go into Settings > Phone > My number. Either clear the number out (which will be the number of your borrowed sim) or type in your actual phone number. The reason being is iCloud (specifically, iMessage) will want to tie the phone number from the borrowed sim to your iMessage account. It could potentially end up with you receiving iMessages intended for the person you borrowed the sim from.\n\nA: When you borrow a sim card from somebody to active your phone it will say Type in your Icloud you type in their icloud if not icloud it may so aol it will not affect their sim card or phone.

There are some workarounds and apps given here: Is there any way to change the snooze time for alarms on the iPhone?\n\nA: There is a Snooze option on the lock screen in iOS 7 - the snooze time is 10 min.\n\n\nA: Launch the Calendar app from the Home screen of your iPhone or iPad.\nTap on the name of the event you'd like to change the default alert for (or add an alert if you have default alerts disabled).\nTap on the Edit button in the upper right hand corner.\nTap on Alert.\nChoose the alert time you'd like the Calendar to remind you at and then tap on Done in the upper right hand corner.\n", "Q: Remove past versions from Spotlight searches? Is there a way to prevent Spotlight from indexing past versions of documents (see attached image). On my system it seems to always recommend an old version as the top hit, requiring me to scroll through or mouse over the results to get the actual document.\nIn case it matters, this particular example is a Numbers spreadsheet stored in iCloud. \n\n\nA: I ended up copying all of my documents (I didn't really have that many) out of iCloud to the local disk, and then deleting them from iCloud. The old versions were still showing up in Spotlight, so I added the entire drive to Spotlight's Privacy list to delete the index. Then I put the documents back into iCloud, removed the drive from the Privacy list, and let it sit for a few hours while it reindexed everything.

It sends out a byte stream, which I want\nto read.\n\n\nProblem: \n\n\n*\n\n*When I am trying to pair my 5th generation iPod touch with windows\nPC, even though everything goes fine on the PC side, my iPod is\ngiving \"Device not supported\" error.  \n\n*My iPod is not even detecting\nthe Bluetooth-HID dongle. Although my Mac-mini detects it, but I am\nunable to pair it.\n\n\nFindings till now: \n\n\n*\n\n*When I searched, I read on Apple discussions that \"The iPod does not have the necessary BT profiles to pair with a computer.\" On another thread it says, \"It only support bluetooth for stereo headphone/speakers, some peer to peer apps from the app store, some keyboards.\" Fair enough. \n\n\nIf iPod cannot actually pair with the PC or the Bluetooth-HID dongle, are their ANY Apple devices which are capable of doing the same? Again my main aim is to read the byte stream from the dongle for which pairing seems necessary. \nI would be really thankful if you could please share your experience and provide some guidance.\n\nA: Actually you can get the BT Stack needed to connect to pc but only if you jailbreak your iPod Touch 5Th gen.\n you can do this simply with pangu and iOS 8.x and you just search for BT Stack in Cydia and install that and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: eBook formats - Kindle to iBook and back? I am thinking of moving my extensive eBook library to iBooks or Kindle. Has anyone done this, and what does it take?\nI just don't want book libraries in multiple proprietary formats, and have to look for content across apps.\n\nA: Note that there are now three main eBook formats   \n\n\n*\n\n*PDF which is not reflowable text and is used mainly for graphical books. There is a open specification for this.\n\n*MobiPocket(Kindle files with extension .mobi (and encrypted as .azw)) The specification is not published and so Amazon can change it when they want.\n\n*ePub which is most of the rest including iBooks. This is a published specification and there are open source tools that can create, edit and validate that the book meets the specification.\n\n\nIf the books do not have Digital Rights Management(DRM) then Kindle books can easily be converted to ePub as the format is similar, the reverse can also be done but you might lose some information as ePub data contains more things than Kindle data.\nThe easiest way to convert is to use Calibre which is a tool for managing ebooks including conversion, loading to devices and organisation of a library of books.\nDRM books are tied to the application with which you bought them. An exception is that many ePub EBooks (but not iBooks and not Kindle) use Adobe's DRM and so can can be used in several devices.\nThere are plugins to Calibre, which are not legal in many countries, which allow removal of the DRM and thus use in Calibre allowing conversion between the formats. However I belive that there is no plugin for decryption of iBooks files.  \n\nA: Super easy!\nOpen iBooks, drag & drop the book you want to convert to the Desktop. It will create an .epub file. Then open it with Calibre and use it to convert the book to the format you prefer, eg. AZW3 for the Kindle.\nThe way back you can imagine it, it is the same but in the opposite direction.\n\nA: Apple iBooks are very limited and therefor should be avoided if at all possible. Other eBook types are much more friendlier to use.\n", "Q: Command+C (copy) with the left command key does not work I'm facing a strange problem. When I type ⌘+C with the left command key, it does not work anymore. The left command key is working for ⌘+V or ⌘+X or any others so it's not a hardware problem.\nThe C key is working too. The right command key is working for ⌘+C.\nI tried changing keyboard language, adding a shortcut, reset NVRAM, activated/deactivated VoiceOver (tip found on a site) to no avail. I'm on a MacBook Pro with Mavericks.\n\nA: What has worked for me was force-quitting Finder (basically after trying all what you have suggested yourselves).\n\nA: One of your applications may utilize the cmd+c shortcut, which is not shown in system preferences. \nI have GoldenDict installed and one of its hotkeys to \"Use the following hotkey to translate a word from clipboard\" is \"cmd+c c\", which brings this problem. \nSolution: use another hotkey or disable it.\n\nA: It was a weird experience for me, had the same problem. After long unfruitful research through internet, I took MBP to the Genius Bar. Even they tried with networked operating systems like 10.9, 10.8 and others too. Nothing worked, later after long technical discussion they decided it may be an hardware issue (due to shorting, also option button was not working during startup OS switching). After top keyboard cover replacement it worked! Again something unexplainable, yet worked!\n\nA: Make sure when you press CMD+C your Edit menu in the top flashes, this indicates it works as expected.\nIf it doesn't, go to Keyboard settings in System Preferences and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore defaults Modifier Keys...,\n\n*Restore defaults in Shortcuts tab,\n\n*In App Shortcuts click the + button and test if Keyboard Shortcut input box will react on your combination.\n\n\nIf Edit menu flashes and it still doesn't work, then the first thing to do is to restart pasteboard service by the following commands:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.pboard\nlaunchctl start com.apple.pboard\n\nIf still doesn't work, here are some other suggestions to troubleshoot the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-test in different applications just in case.\n\n*Re-test if works when using contextual menu (without using the shortcut).\n\n*Re-test alternative combination such as CMD+X for Cut instead. \n\n*Run Console to see your System log queries if something obvious is happening.\n\n*Test if the Clipboard works from the terminal via:\n$ echo test | pbcopy\n$ pbpaste\n\nIf Paste menu item is no more greyed out, then maybe it's a problem with Paste command.\nIf you're advanced user, use dtruss or fs_usage to debug it, for instance:\n$ sudo fs_usage | grep -C4 MyAppWhereCopyDoesntWork\n\nand then notice other apps which appearing exactly when you press the shortcut which potentially you could consider quitting for testing purposes.\n\n*Disable any recent programs that you run or restart your computer.\n\n*Disable VoiceOver as suggested here.\n\n*Force quit the Finder (e.g.: killall -HUP Finder).\n\n*If still doesn't work, consider rebooting the system, especially in Recovery or Safe mode to re-test.\n\n\nAs for a workaround, you can install Karabiner app and remap your shortcuts by configuring private.xml file (see Misc tab). For more suggestion, please check the following posts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remap Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl-X only\n\n*How can I reassign the copy/paste keyboard shortcuts?\n\nA: Thank you for your insights! after clearing the cache, resetting PRAM, repairing disc and permission, nothing.  Then it worked for a few minutes. Finally, I decided to use Keyremap4macbook and assigned the fn key to work like left command. It works, so I leave it like that. Problem half solved...\n\nA: I talked to the Apple support and reset my hardware by pressing shift+ctrl+option and the power button at the same time. Then release everything. To restart your computer, just press on the power button again.\nIt doesn't damage anything and even got back on the internet pages I was on.\n\nA: In my case, it was because \"Command+C\" in Input Sources conflicted with \"Command+C\" of Copy command.\nI went \"System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Input Sources\", and found \"Select the previous input source\" item, then changed it to \"Control+C\". Then the \"Command+C\" Copy command worked.\n\nA: I had the same issue and went into System Preferences>Shortcuts>Keyboard and deselected everything. I was having issues with cmd-z, cmd-x, cmd-v, and deselecting all of these (I didn't use them anyway) allowed all of these to work again. \n\nA: *\n\n*Open System preferences \n\n*Select Keyboard \n\n*Select Shortcuts\n\n*Select Restore Defaults\n\nA: *\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Select Keyboard\n\n*Select Shortcuts\n\n*Select Keyboard\n\n*Select Move focus to next window\n\n*Click on the key combination\n\n*Set it to whatever you want\n\n\nA: You might have a wrong keyboard layout set up on your system, i.e. Dvorak keyboard layout. If you switch to the proper layout you might fix the problem.\nGo to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources. Then click on \"+\" and add the keyboard layout of your preference. \nNote:\nDvorak users should know that there are a few types of the keyboard: Dvorak, Dvorak - Left, Dvorak - Right, Dvorak - Qwerty. Each of those acts differently when combination \"Command + C\" is pressed.\n\nA: Funny trick to make it work:\nSystem Pref > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts (left sidebar).\nAdd a new item \"Copy\" and type the shortcut CMD C.\nIt works!\n\n\nA: I came across this issue due my ongoing struggles with the keyboard of a late-2016 MBP: \ncmd + c suddenly stopped working. The problem was the esc key, which remained pressed because of some minor piece of dirt. With blowing and pressing the key repeatedly it returned to its normal position and cmd + c started working again.\n(Now I have to solve  issues with two other keys. Don't buy this  piece of hardware, the keyboard will give you pain. Mine was already replaced, but new piece is also prone to keyboard damages due to dust and other small pieces of dirt you encounter in every office and every household. It's just bad design.) \n\nA: I had the same problem. \nOn top of the problem with not having ⌘ CommandC, after a while I wasn't able to do a capital \"E\" by holding ⇧ Shift...after a while more than 10 random keys activated \"mission control\"...so you can imagine my frustration.\n...but luckily I sorted.\nThe problem was with Lightroom Classic CC and once I did restart preferences in LR everything was ok again.\nIf you using the newest LR CC 8. Try Maybe it work for you.\nReset Procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Lightroom.\n\n*Hold down ⌥ Option⇧ Shift while restarting Lightroom. \n\n*Overwrite the Preferences when prompted by the dialogue.\n\n*Close Lightroom.\n\n*Restart Lightroom.\n\n\nA: I had such an issue on macOS Big Sur but when I updated it to Monterey it was solved.\nPlease try updating your OS.\n\nA: This issue is real and I think every mac user experience it on a weekly basis, but likely people continue to doubt themselves over if they actually command c or not properly.\nThe fix. If you are using Karabiner like real hacker should:\nJust add this to your karabiner complex configurations:\n[\n    {\n        \"from\": {\n            \"key_code\": \"c\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n                \"mandatory\": [\n                    \"left_command\"\n                ]\n            }\n        },\n        \"to\": [\n            {\n                \"key_code\": \"c\",\n                \"modifiers\": [\n                    \"left_command\"\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"key_code\": \"c\",\n                \"modifiers\": [\n                    \"left_command\"\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"key_code\": \"c\",\n                \"modifiers\": [\n                    \"left_command\"\n                ]\n            }\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"basic\"\n    }\n]\n\nNow that should make the copy flash a few times in the menu.\nYou can increase or decrease as much as you want. Personally I have a few more.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but after one copy command (cmd + c) with the right command key, the left command key started working again!\n", "Q: \"sudo apt-get install\" on OS X Mavericks My understanding is that you need to install 'Fink' before an apt-get will work in the Terminal on OS X, but there isn't a Fink binary installer yet for Mavericks.\nDoes anyone know what the best alternative would be for \nsudo apt-get install \n\non OS X Mavericks?\n\nA: Fink has been released for OS X Mavericks. Per their latest news item…\n\n2013-10-30: fink-0.36.0 released.\nfink-0.36.0 was released on 31 October, 2013. This is the first release to work with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). We are currently in the process of making packages available.\n\nYou can download Fink from fink.thetis.ig42.org.\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you just want a package manager.\napt-get is just an interface for Aptitude, a deb packaging system. DEB isn't tied into Mac OS like it would be your average Linux distro, so you'd need an alternative.\nFink will do this on its own, other alternatives are MacPorts or Homebrew.\nIf your goal is to be able to execute a command, say like (something) install program and it'll install the program and its dependencies for you, either of these three will do that for you.\nI'd personally suggest Homebrew. http://brew.sh/\n", "Q: Pinning desktops to monitors in 10.9 Is there a way to pin desktops to monitors like you can pin app windows to desktops?\nSpecifically my problem is I use a macbook and plug and unplug my external monitor a few times a day. Rearranging my desktops and full-screen apps every time is a pain in the rear end and so I hope there's a setting for that that I just can't find.\n\nA: There was a way to do this a few years ago. I think it was on SL with some third party software, but sadly I can't remember what it was called. Could be discontinued though...\nEdit: I remembered: Put the app to the desktop where you want to have it.

Occasionally, I would like to use my iPad (3rd gen, iOS7) as a second screen (an extension, NOT a mirror) for my Macbook Pro (Mountain Lion).\nIs this possible without paying for an app in iOS7? Does Mavericks or iOS7 include any new related functionality? I am aware that there have been improvements for second displays in Mavericks.\nSee also: How to use the new iPad (3rd gen) as a second screen? and Is it possible to use an iPad as an additional computer monitor?\n\nA: You will need an app to get this working properly, the nice new features in Mavericks are still essentially limited to traditionally connected displays via cables (DisplayPort/HDMI/Thunderbolt), rather than wireless connections.  There are many you can try, but my (unaffiliated merely personal preference) recommendation is Air Display.\nNote that because the 2nd screen will be transferred over Wifi, you need to ensure that the iPad has a solid connection to the same LAN as your main Mac - being close to your Mac might be no good if they are both a distance away from the router...  As such, any usage of the iPad 2nd screen that requires fast refresh of window contents might not perform in any way like a proper monitor would, but it should be great for normal non video/gaming OS X apps.\n\nA: Nope, Mavericks does not include this kind of features. \nYes you'll need to use 3rd party apps. \n\nA: check out Splashtop if you haven't yet.  I think you'll pay a small amount for the iPad app, but the Mac app is free and also works for remote connections.\n", "Q: VPN Passthrough problems with Airport Extreme Today I started trying to work from a network that uses the Airport Extreme version 7.7.1.  Typically I use a VPN client (Viscosity) which gives me access to the various servers that my company runs on.  I can connect to the open VPN without any issue but am experiencing mixed results from there forward.  \nOnce connected to the VPN I can access a couple of the servers through a web browser and SSH from the command line but timeout while trying to connect to the rest.  If I bypass the router and plug directly into the modem via ethernet everything works perfectly.\nI've tried setting up port forwarding on the Airport Extreme with no success and disabling \"Back to My Mac\" settings.  There are a number a threads out there where people have had issues with VPN and the Airport Extreme but nothing quite like this.\nI'm baffled why I can connect to the VPN and some of the servers while others are failing.   Again, I am sure that the VPN/servers are configured properly as this problem goes away when I remove the router from the picture.\nPlease let me know where I'm going wrong!\n\nA: The problem was that the Airport Extreme router was configured to use the same range of IP addresses as the VPN, so while I was able to connect to the VPN there was some issues when trying to SSH into some of the servers where there was an IP conflict.  It is possible to change the \"IPv4 DHCP Range\" in the advanced network options of the Airport Extreme which solved my issue.\n\nA: You have to enable IGMP Snooping on the Airport extremefor some reason. This worked for me and now my Cisco VPN works fine. Edit the Airport and go to the Network Tab and Network Options. Enable IGMP Snooping.\n", "Q: How can I determine what application is asking \"Where is GrowlHelperApp.App?\" I recently upgraded to OS X 10.9 Mavericks and am now seeing a \"Choose Application\" dialog pop up every minute or two asking: \"Where is the GrowlHelperApp.app?\". I don't particularly want to buy the new version of Growl, so how can I determine which application is looking for it so that I can change it's preferences or remove it?\n\nUpdate: It turns out that it was an old Dashboard widget that was looking for Growl. I found this out by deleting all of my Dashboard widgets since I haven't used it in a while, but I'd still be interested in finding out how one would discover what is launching this dialog.\n\nA: You could have used sudo opensnoop to see what files are being opened or fseventer to see what files are being modified.\nThose dialogs are often shown by AppleScripts that have reference a missing application. You could also have tried running mdfind GrowlHelperApp, but it doesn't search the contents of compiled scripts or scripts saved as applications.\n\nA: Helped me solve this problem I am having an awful lot of time. The mdfind GrowlHelperApp with combo of deleteting the resource files found helped me to remove the annoying popup window.

I set up my iBooks but synchronization only happens between a single Mac and devices running iOS 7. What's the point of using iBooks, if when I'm not in my laptop, I want to read the book on my iMac, but iBooks doesn't get synced across Macs...Did I miss anything?\nThanks for any hints, answers, such as using File sharing with Dropbox, Team Drive, etc. to try to synchronize the iBooks database and Data Contents. I only tried the Books folder from  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data but it didn't work.\n\nA: You might have the wrong idea (in Apple's eyes) about syncing through iBooks. You will not be able to have content magically appear on your second Mac, if the book is not purchased through the iBooks Store. Syncing does not work iTunes Match-like.\nFor non-iBookstore files, like MobileRead epubs, you will need to transfer the same epubs you imported onto iBooks on machine 1 to machine 2 and import them again. I hope you still have copies of these files -- because as far as I can tell, iBooks splits up epubs you import into it, and you cannot get them back out as an epub again. (I would love to be wrong about this.)\nThe good news is: Once you have imported these files, syncing between Macs works for notes, reading positions and highlights, as long as you have enabled \"Sync bookmarks, highlights and notes across devices\" in iBooks preferences. Again: iBooks will only sync said bookmarks, highlights and notes, NOT the books themselves. You will also need to have logged in with the same Apple ID on both devices.\nNeedless to say, you should also make sure to run the latest version of iBooks (currently 1.0.1).\nThis might be the only advantage of (and reason for) not being able to change metadata in iBooks -- at least the software knows which files are identical...\n\nA: I fond this from apple support forums. I know this comes late but hopefully this helps people who are having this problem in future.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy this directory on the old mac from\n/Users//Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBook/Books to your new mac.\n\n*Open iBooks\n\n*File->Add to Library... and select all the Files in this Books Directory for importing.\n\n\nIf something goes wrong, you can close iBooks, delete the\n/Users//Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBo ok directory and start iBooks again. This will reset the structure inside iBooks and you can start from begin.\n\nA: you can create an ePub file of a single book by dragging it from the iBook app to the Destkop.\n", "Q: Finder windows keeps turning off and on All of a sudden my Finder windows keeps disappearing and reappearing every 30 seconds or so.

I was just browsing the web, wasn't installing/uninstalling anything.\nBTW, it's a 2010 iMac with Mavericks.\n\nA: I just solved it on my side, are you running Google Drive? If so, turn it off and the problem goes away. I did so on my machine and it was back to normal, the moment I started Google Drive, the Finder Windows flashed again.\nYou can see more people with same issue on the Apple Discussion forums\n\nA: I had to kill off Finder preferences and reboot, then I was good to go:\ncd ~/Library/Preferences\nrm -rf com.apple.finder.plist com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\n", "Q: No access to an old Apple ID due to incorrect information The Apple ID which is linked to my iPhone can't be accessed. I have tried 'Find my ID' but it won't accept my birthdate and emails are not being received to any of my current or old email addresses.\n\nA: Contact Apple Support, as they are are able to access and recover account details - something nobody outside of Apple can do for you.\nBe prepared with any information you might have. Helpful details include (but are not limited to) current/previous addresses, credit card information, and purchase receipts that are automatically mailed to you following any (app/music/movie/etc) Store purchase.\n", "Q: Unlock Verizon 4S iPhone I just purchased used iPhone 4S from a Verizon customer in the United States. I would like to unlock it and take it to Europe and use it on a GSM network. How can I do this?\nPhone info:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 4S\n\n*iOS 7.0.2\n\n*Baseband 5.0.0\n\n\nAre any of these factory IMEI unlock services good? Has anyone tried it?\nhttp://www.officialiphoneunlock.co.uk/\nhttp://unlockiphonevip.com/\nhttp://www.yourappleiphone.com/\n\nA: Verizon will unlock the phone for global use only, provided you've been a customer in good standing for at least 60 days. Otherwise, they will refuse to unlock it, and under no circumstances will they unlock it for domestic use.\nAlternatively, you may find unlocking services on eBay, but these aren't as popular for Verizon phones as they are for AT&T.\nThere are no \"Ultrasn0w\"-type software unlocks anymore, so going through official channels is the only option, unfortunately.\n\nA: Verizon might unlock this for free. But they denied it even though I have an account with them. So my last hope, but it went through was the site for 3rd party unlocking http://www.flyunlock.com/verizon-usa\nMine was iPhone 4S\n", "Q: Aperture 3 Library from pre Mavericks to Mavericks I made a backup from all my files including my Aperture library. After moving to Mavericks (clean install), there is a new Aperture version and I am not able to import my old library getting the message: Library was made with older version of Aperture, please update to newest version and try again (loosely translated from german). How should I do this now?\n\nA: The answer is easy: Open the library, you will be asked to update it. Do it. Than one can import it.\n", "Q: How to install Snow Leopard virtual machine on new iMac with Mountain Lion? I got a 2013 iMac with Mountain Lion (10.8.5 now) and incompatible with Snow Leopard. I need SL anyway.\nGiving up all my old applications and buying new ones is not acceptable. First, this is not my way of thinking and, second, some cannot be replaced.\nMany posts say that you can use Snow Leopard with VirtualBox but I could not find anywhere the \"how to\" (in this particular configuration).\nFor instance, I followed these 2 protocols, almost similar:\nhttp://www.maketecheasier.com/install-mac-os-x-snow-leopard-in-virtualbox-on-windows/\nhttp://www.macbreaker.com/2012/02/snow-leopard-virtualbox.html\nbut they use Windows as host system and something is not working (for me) with Mountain Lion.\nI made many attempts, with VirtualBox 4.2.18, using pretty much everything: Snow Leopard DVD, SL Server DVD, a .dmg of both. I've also got Combo 10.6.8 updates for both (but I'm not sure if it can be used before installing). With another MacBook, I managed to install a SLS on external hard drive and update to 10.6.8. Was unable to use it anyway.\nInevitably, I ended up with the message:\n\nFATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted.\n\nI have no idea of what support to use and even, probably  important, if it should be set on Primary or Secondary Master? (in Settings / Storage)\nIs it possible at all?\nWould it work better with VMware Fusion? Anybody successful?\n\nA: To attach the DVD image, you need to first convert it from dmg format to iso using DiskUtility.\nThen in the Virtualbox settings go to the storage settings and click on the little DVD icon next to where the popup menu with Sata1 is and select the iso image.\nThat said, I haven't been able to get it to boot successfully - it shows the apple logo but then gets stuck at the spinning wheel...\n", "Q: Can I add 100 Phone Numbers to a Single Contact? My bank insists on sending me account info SMS (texts) from ~100 different numbers. They all start the same, only the last two digits differ.\ne.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*+43 664 6601301\n\n*+43 664 6601302\n\n*+43 664 6601303\n\n*...\n\n*+43 664 6601399\n\n\nCan I add all of them to a single contact? Preferably without having to type them separately.\nI tried \n\n\n*\n\n*+43 664 66013\n\n*+43 664 66013,\n\n*+43 664 66013*\n\n*+43 664 66013#\n\n*+43 664 66013##\n\n\nbut the iPhone doesn't recognize any for the caller id.\n\nA: As far as I am aware there is no reference to wildcard characters in vcard.\nIf Mac OS or iOS supported such feature it would not be supported by other devices.\nBut you can add the 100 phone numbers by hand. I would recommend exporting the contact as a vcd file then add all the numbers by hand. Copy paste will be faster than writing them one by one in the Contacts app:\nTEL;type=WORK;type=VOICE;type=pref:+43 664 6601301\nTEL;type=WORK;type=VOICE;type=pref:+43 664 6601302\nTEL;type=WORK;type=VOICE;type=pref:+43 664 6601303\n...\nTEL;type=WORK;type=VOICE;type=pref:+43 664 6601399\n\nAnd import it back.\n\nA: I had to do something similar recently, but with 2000 phone numbers, so I wrote a small python script, vcard-wildcard, to generate vcards with multiple numbers based on a wildcard. Beware that attaching >100 numbers to a single vcard may cause your phone to become unresponsive for a while when you attempt to import the generated contact.\nExample usage:\npython vcard-wildcard.py --company \"Robocallers\" \"(555) 555 55??\" > bigcontact.vcf\n\n", "Q: Mac OS X Mavericks keeps jumping to the first desktop My screen (desktop/spaces) keeps jumping to the first \"desktop\". There are no running apps on that desktop (except finder). After the first few times this happened I pressed ⌘ Cmd-⌥ Opt-⎋ Esc and restarted finder.\nWhen it continued to happen I quit all open apps and restarted the computer.\n(I run a few apps full screen, and usually keep the first desktop open for any quick work or apps I will use, if I will have an app open for a while that doesn't have full screen, I create a desktop/space for it and run it off on the side somewhere).\nThe screen just keeps taking me back to the first one. It is getting to the point where it is too annoying to ignore. So far typing this I have counted it happening seven times.\nWhat I have tried, besides restarting Finder, and restarting the Mac, in Mission Control settings I disabled Automatically rearrange, and Group windows by applications (to be honest I don't know what Group windows by application means, I assume it has to do with what screens a new window of an already running app will open on), and When switching to an app, switch space.\nI tried rearranging spaces, I moved the Desktop to the third space (this must be a Mavericks feature, I don't think I have ever been able to do that before), and it keeps jumping to that Desktop (third space). I have also tried creating a new desktop space and deleting the old one. It keeps jumping.\nI also don't think this is finder calling for anything. The menu bar remains the same for the app I was using, and only becomes finder when I click on the desktop.\nI could just not use spaces, but what would the point be?\nI don't know if this would be an easy thing to help anyone with, but maybe something similar has happened to someone before.\n\nA: It is Google Drive, it's causing Finder to crash and restart, which is why it keeps jumping back to the first desktop. \nIt's related to the \"Show file sync status icons and right click menu\" setting. If you turn this setting off in the Google Drive preferences, the problem should go away.\n\nA: Same thing here. Would appear to happen only when the WiFi is connected, but on further research into this it appears to be related to Google Drive. Close the Drive sync application or disconnect from Wifi and it's ok.\n", "Q: Switching wifi networks from an iphone I wonder if there's an App which helps me to easily switch to another wifi network without going through the \"settings\" screens of my iPhone. Nowadays more and more cars provide their own wifi network which you have to login to to give commands to the car. So an easy temporary switch to the car's network would be great.\n\nA: Without a jailbreak this is not possible because Apple doesn't allow this kind of feature on the App Store. \n", "Q: What's the benefit of using shift (for slow animation) when minimizing windows? I came across this today by accident:\nIf you try to minimise a window in OS X 10.8 (might be in others) while holding down the shift key the window will very slowly go into the Dock. The whole animation is slowed.\nAny ideas what the purpose of this is?\n\nA: Steve Jobs shows this off the first time he is showing OS X, at Macworld 2000.  He mentions that the effect was designed for that one demonstration.  It's amazing that it is still around 14 years later.\nhttps://youtu.be/AcGzCIlz8y0?t=6478\n\nA: There is no purpose of this. This is just a easter egg and purely for \"entertainment\".\n\nA: As with @napcae's answer, the \"slow motion genie\" effect is just a bit of fun, but I have used it in the past to demonstrate (usually to Windows users) some of the finer points of the Mac OS X display subsystems.  Namely, that rather than drawing each window on a pixel by pixel basis (think of Windows systems that leave random stray parts of windows as you drag them around and the window subsystem struggles to keep up with all the redraw mechanisms resulting in scroll bars hanging in mid air, or that nasty windows trail thing), OS X essentially draws a windows contents using something that is more akin to a 3D game engine mapping a texture to a polygon.  You can demonstrate this by having the following command ready in a terminal window, and quickly executing it while you slow-minimise a window:\nkillall Dock\n\nThe dock process is the thing that governs all this sort of thing, and if you kill it it will happily respawn a new one, but the operations that it was part way through completing won't get finished or reversed.  You will end up with a half minimised window that is warped into a strange shape and yet which is still fully usable.  Check it out with textedit, and note that you can still type in it (selecting text is more difficult!), or try it with a Quicktime movie window and notice how the thing is still playing.\nEssentially its not just a daft effect, it's demonstrating the window drawing capabilities of the display layer, and how they are managed in a superior way to many other desktop OS window systems.\nNote that this effect has been around since at least 2001 (according to a Google search), and I first knew about it in 10.4 where I saw it used to show off the new graphical window manager that used the Quartz Extreme engine to draw the windows.  If I recall the details correctly essentially every windows is basically made up of Quicktime, Open GL or Quartz 2D data source, the latter of which is essentially internally rendered into postscript (essentially all your window dressing elements, toolbars, scroll bars, are a PDF...), which is then rastered into a single window combining all the elements (Your PDF window dressing, with it's quicktime or openGL contents, or a mix there of for a web page etc) as a 3d \"texture\" on a 2d plane by Quartz Composer to make the window you see.\nFor more details read the following 2 pages from the Siracusa Tiger Review over at Arstechnica which discusses the way in which the window manager has evolved and has a pretty good explanation of how it works, which is by and large the same now as it was for Tiger (or at least, the changes are not as large since Tiger as they were before Tiger which is when the GPU started to take over pretty much all window drawing tasks from the CPU)\n\nA: This functionality is decidedly NOT \"just a bit of fun.\" Please do not make up answers when you don't know them, or make assumptions based on your limited use and knowledge of functionality.\nThe primary purpose of being able to slow down the animations would be evident if you thought about the purpose of animations in the first place. Ask yourself, why not just cut from the view of (say) a desktop with some application at the front and others behind it to a view of (say) an application's windows? The first answer that comes to my mind is this: Animating such a process allows a user to visually track the movement of a normally-sized window as it shrinks and moves to its new size and location on the screen. Otherwise, I might not be able to tell which window went where.\nTry this: Add a new Desktop workspace and set the screen resolution to 800 x 500. Open on it 60 Finder windows of the same size. The experiment will profit from having several windows with similar tab configurations, views, contents, and names. Now open approximately 60 windows in a web browser. To emphasize the point, let each window be the same size, and let each be the current results from Google of some short search string. Use Mission Control to help you keep track of one of your windows. I think you'll find it can prove difficult. Slowing the animation suddenly makes it manageable.\nI'm shocked that more people don't appreciate this accommodation for people with differing visual and attention abilities. \n\nA: It's disabled on new macOS, try this command to enable it by Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock slow-motion-allowed -bool true && killall Dock\n", "Q: Remove HTC Sync Manager from autostart Every time I start my laptop, the HTC Sync Manager is launched automatically.

Or do I actually have to remember the password that Keychain came up with?\nThe logic thing would be that it actually changes that password, so when I need to enter that website from a different computer, I will still have to use that hard to remember password. Which means I need to keep an extra passwords list somewhere accessible. \nI've been looking all over, but I can't seem to find it, so I figured, I'd ask you people.\nCan you help me out?\n\nA: While Keychain Access and the iCloud Keychain is specific to the Mac and iOS, there are other applications such as 1Password and LastPass which have various syncing options (Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, and even web-based) so you would never be without access to your passwords.\n\nA: If you change your Twitter password, you obviously can't use the old password anymore on other computers.\nIf your devices are running OS X 10.9 or later or iOS 7.0.3 or later, you can use iCloud Keychain to sync keychain items.\nYou can show a password stored in the keychain by opening Keychain Access, selecting the keychain item, pressing command-I, and selecting Show password.\nYou can also move a keychain to another computer by moving the keychain file (like ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain) or by using Migration Assistant.\n", "Q: New Numbers has no Auto-Complete?

that the kernel panics didn't happen before the upgrade, that yes, the RAM is the culprit. It could be perfectly fine working RAM for a PC, but Macs are picky about their RAM, which can lead to problems including kernel panics.\n\nA: Since your drivers don't include any special one, it's possible from the RAM. If the RAM doesn't reliable, sometimes it will corruption of kernel data then cause these type of issue as well.  I had some experience with no stable RAM rather than fault RAM.\n", "Q: How to see VPN connection statistics? I live in China, which requires me to use several VPN's to access the outside web.  Occasionally, some VPN's are either totally blocked or suffer from high packet loss.\nIn Windows, it is easy to see statistics such as the packets in/out, the compression ratio, and most importantly for me, the packet loss ratio.  Is there a way to see VPN connection quality information OS X?\n\nA: Nothing as nice and easy as Windows provides, however you can get the info you require if you enable verbose logging on your PPTP connection:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences → Network.\n\n*Select your your VPN service from the list of services on the left.\n\n*Click Advanced….\n\n\n*Then tick Use verbose logging and click OK, then Apply.\n\n\n*In Terminal, run the following command:\ntail -f /var/log/ppp.log\n\n", "Q: How to stop vibrating on new Mail using iOS 7? Whenever I get a new message in my mail, my phone vibrates. How do I turn off this behavior?\n\nA: The only way to do that is to go into \"Sounds\" in Settings and pick \"None\" as the sound for Mail. This is bad because without Sound there will be no indication of new email when the phone is locked. Hope that in a future iOS release, this option will be added.\n\nA: you can also do custom vibration, which I found was great. under sounds --> new mail--> vibration-->custom--> create new vibration. Just tap it gently once only and remove our finger. Hit stop and then save.\nI found it this was much better than using any of the custom tones. Esp if you are your using your iphone for work and when its on the desk, it vibrates everytime you get an emai and the whole office knows.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Go to; Sounds -> New Mail -> Vibration (at the top) -> Select \"None\" (in the bottom)\n\nA: Go to Notification Centre > Mail. Then choose the account you want.\nThen choose alert sound > vibration.\nThere is a 'none' option at the bottom.\n\nA: right above your volume keys on the left side of your phone, you will see a knob.. make sure you dont see the orange mark. if your sounds setting is set on vibrate when silent and you see the orange mark on the knob above the volume knobs or keys your phone will vibrate when you receive new mail. left side meaning on the left of your phone not on the screen.\ntry if that works.\n", "Q: Shoud I upgrade to Safari 6.1? I have a Lion machine and a Mountain Lion machine. Software Update has offered to upgrade Safari from 6.0.5 to 6.1 on both machines. Is this upgrade worth it? Any issues or glitches? I didn't find any comments on this upgrade on the web.\n\nA: Upgrading to latest software version is generally a good idea for security and performance reasons.\nSpecifically Safari 6.1 brings its lot of security fixes: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6000?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US.\nIn terms of functionalities, Safari 6.1 brings the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shared Links: See links shared by people you follow on Twitter;\n\n*New sidebar (Reading List, Bookmarks and Shared Links to the left of the browser; can be hidden);\n\n*One-click bookmarking;\n\n*(Performance enhancements) Safari Power Saver: Only play content from accepted plug-ins;\n\n\nSee more here: http://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/22/apple-releases-safari-6-1-for-mountain-lion-with-shared-links-new-sidebar-power-saver-and-more/.\nWhether you should upgrade to Safari 6.1 is up to you.

I've been using iWork for a while and have created some pretty elaborate designs in Keynote and Pages, but I haven't come across a problem like this before or even an option to link/embed images.\nIn Keynote, all my images are now linked to an external source on my hard disk, rather than embedded in the file itself. When I attempt to copy media in any manner (alt-drag or cmd+c/v or duplicate a page), a grey \"placeholder\" box is produced with a question mark in the middle and a diagonal line across it (see top right corner of the image).\nIt only works when the source image is in the same place on my hard disk.\nWhen I insert an image or other media file (insert -> choose) into Keynote, there doesn't seem to be an option to link or embed like there is in other applications such as Adobe Illustrator or InDesign.\nWhy is Keynote all of a sudden treating images in this fashion? How can I fix this to re-enable embedding of images?\n\n\nA: go to Keynote > Preferences > under general Preferences make sure under Saving: \"include Preview in document by default\" and \"copy auto and Movies into Document\" is checked.\n", "Q: Finder in Mavericks will not tag files on network drives Is there a workaround? How can I fix this?\nThese files are on SMB shares to Windows servers with a NTFS file system. Is there a better way to connect to windows shares? Please guide as I am new to the Mac world. Thanks.\n\nA: I'm also having this problem. I've seen a few users comment on it on different forums and Apple's Support. No one has offered a real answer, other than this seems to be a problem with Apple's implementation of SMB or the way the Finder interacts and reads those Volumes (or the way attribute files are saved/stored/read on them).\nThe format of the servers volume doesn't really matter and should be transparent to the client. All Finder can see is a SMB share, whether that share is on an ext3 filesystem or a NTFS one is quite irrelevant.\nI've tested connecting to the same volume with AFP, SMB (which in Mavericks now uses SMB2 by default) and CIFS (forcing Finder to use the SMB v1 protocol). As far as I know, tags info are stored in .DS_Store files for each folder.\nConnecting with CIFS or SMB, tag support is buggy. Tags sometimes appear for a few seconds and then disappear. In addition to the .DS_Store file, a ._FILE_NAME file is created for each file. Getting the properties of the file sometimes shows the tag.\nConnecting with AFP tags work as expected. Just a .DS_Store file is created. But no tag info is available if tag was assigned while mounted as SMB.\nIs a pity, because SMB2 is faster than AFP in my tests, but sacrificing tags for it is too bad.\n\nA: I think there are some problems from Apple's side regarding this. \nI have had files on shared Dropbox folders that is getting tagged (by others) and messing up my local tags. So there are some problems here I think.\n\nA: The reason why tags work in dropbox, is because dropbox keeps a copy of the files on your local drive, these tags are not indexed on the network, so when other use shared folders on your dropbox, they are not checked, and you will see the tags as soon dropbox syncs with your mac\n\nA: If you have problems tagging a folder inside a smb drive, you can try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Right click folder, select Create Alias\n\n*Alias will be created on the desktop. If you wish, move the Alias somewhere you like\n\n*Tag the alias\n\n", "Q: Text copied from Terminal with formatting in Mavericks (10.9), Yosemite (10.10), and El Capitan (10.11) After the update to Mavericks (10.9), anything copied from Terminal is pasted in the target app with the same formatting as in Terminal, in my case, white monospaced letters on a black background, e.g.:\n\n(I pasted some text from Terminal into a New Mail window.)\nPreviously (10.8 and earlier) only plain text was copied, without any formatting at all.\nThis happens in apps that are capable of receiving rich text formatting.

I have an old build script that makes mention (perhaps erroneously) of /usr/64 for things like library search paths when building on OS X.\nThis directory doesn't seem to be populated, or even exist, on any modern OS X that I can find, and I'd like to remove these references if that they are truly stale.\nWas /usr/64 a real thing on OS X at one point? If so, what was it used for, and with what release did it cease to be relevant?\n\nA: /usr/64 never existed in OS X, go ahead and remove it.\nThere was, however, a directory called \"lib64\" (or /usr/local/lib64), which offset /usr/lib. This was found on some Linux operating systems back some years ago, when the transition from 32bit to 64bit was still in its infancy. It may still be used today as a remnant of that era. Microsoft Windows also had a similar structure, separating 32bit from 64bit.\nOS X has never used such a separation of libraries or even executables.\n", "Q: My 2,5 year old Macbook Pro wakes from sleep every other hour after installing Mavericks Okay so, I own a 2,5 year old (Early 2011) Macbook Pro which works just fine. After the release of Mavericks I decided to reinstall it from scratch since I had been upgrading it step-by-step since Snow Leopard and it would feel good to reinstall it from scratch.\nWell, I did that a while back ago, and only yesterday did I remember that I had forgotten to install an IRC client. So, I installed Limechat which is what I normally use. Well, today at work, I realized that my computer at home was logging in to IRC every other hour just to get a ping timeout 3 minutes later.

Attachments from outlook only open word & excel as read only Whenever I receive an email in Outlook that has either a word doc or excel attachment it only allows them to be opened as \"read only\" documents.  How can I have them open as regular documents as they did with Entourage 2008?  Thanks.\n\nA: This is a feature of Office 2011 Outlook.  The behaviour is not limited to Mavericks or Word or Excel files.\nWhen you double click an attachment to open it, a copy is saved under your Library folder (in ~/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/Outlook Temp).  This folder is not generally visible or intended to be accessible to users hence the \"Read Only\" attribute of the file. \nYou can either\n\n\n*\n\n*double-click the attachment in Outlook (to Open it in its default application) and then Save As... to, for example, your Documents folder before editing or\n\n*right-click and Save As... in Outlook itself, in which case the file will not be \"read only\".\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but you could try giving yourself write permission to ~/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/Outlook Temp with chmod.\n\nA: If you click on the \"preview\" button next to the attachment file name in the message header and then click \"Open with MS Word\" on top of the preview it will open as a regular word document that can be edited.  Works the same with Excel and presumably other file types, though I haven't tried any others.\n\nA: Here is the easy work around.\nIn your email, either preview the attachment by clicking the preview button in the email, or click on the attachment and press spacebar (both will preview the attachment). In the actual preview window, there is a link to \"Open in Microsoft Word\" or \"Open in Microsoft Excel\". When this link is clicked from the preview pane, it opens as the full version, not a read only version.  Solution obtained!\n\nA: You can't. They did it on purpose so you don't accidentally ruin the original.\n", "Q: What's the BSD equivalent of the linux date command for adding subtracting days/weeks/months from a given date? I have a given date, such as 2013-10-31 and I need to accurately determine the next day (taking into account DST, leap years, leap minutes, timezones, etc).  I have no way of knowing whether the date is at the end of a month/year/etc, and I sincerely hope not having to care about that.\nIn Linux, I simply type: \ndate1=\"2013-10-31\"\nday_after=`date -ud\"$date1 1 days\" +%Y-%m-%d`\n\necho \"$day_after\" => 2013-11-01\n\nHowever, when I try the same in Darwin/BSD:\ndate1=\"2013-10-31\"\nday_after=`date -v1d -ujf\"%Y-%m-%d\" $date1 +%Y-%m-%d`\n\necho \"$day_after\" => 2013-10-01\n\nHow can I get BSD to do proper date calculations?\n\nA: You must specify + in your date adjustment or BSD assumes that you are giving it an actual day of the month to use.\ndate1=\"2013-10-31\"\nday_after=`date -v+1d -ujf\"%Y-%m-%d\" $date1 +%Y-%m-%d`\n\necho \"$day_after\" => 2013-11-01\n\n", "Q: Desktop refreshing icons every 15 seconds or so I've been on Mavericks since it was open to the general public.\nBut yesterday it started frequently refreshing he desktop icons, over and over again, possibly every 10-15 seconds.

Often I'm just reading a web page or some email and I'll notice the desktop repaint all the icons, then read a bit more, then notice it doing it again.\nMacbook Pro retina, Mavericks.  Have noticed on 2 extern displays (Apple Thunderbolt display at work and on 1080p TV/monitor at home).  Laptop itself is typically closed.\nI've posted other questions about desktop icon placement, not sure if any of that is related, just full disclosure.\n\nA: Just searched for people that have this problem, because I had the same problem today. After searching the internet for about half an hour I found a little post that was old and short on Apple forum.\nI guy said it is Google Drive that triggers it. I uninstalled Google Drive, and WOW my problem was gone.\nSo if you are a Google Drive user, try to uninstall (reinstall) and see. I say reinstall because I have had Google Drive on my Mac before without the problem, but for now, I have it totally uninstalled.\nNOTE: I did uninstall with a software for the purpose, I'm using AppZapper, but there are many others of that sort. I also deleted the .DS_Store file on desktop (just in case it was corrupted). If you want to delete the .DS_Store file, you need to have hidden files shown (or use the Terminal) on your mac.\n\nA: Mine was doing it too, although it wouldn't refresh the icons for files that I downloaded (i.e., if I downloaded a .zip file, it would just show the intermediate loading icon). \nI don't use Google Drive for the Mac, but have read that for those instances to avoid uninstalling, all you have to do is (as of right now) go to Google Drive preferences and disable the «Show file sync status icons and right click menu».\nI personally deleted the .DS_Store file as @JW_ mentioned and everything is back to normal (for now)! Beautiful!\n", "Q: Burning Folder to DVD I've only been a mac user for a little while so I'm still getting used to OSX so bear with me ...\nI find some things OSX does to be inexplicable frankly.  I'm a software engineer and very technical but some things I find myself presented with by this OS I just cannot rationalise.\nI've connected my SuperDrive and I have a folder on my external G-Drive that I wanna put on the DVD, it's got 3.09Gb of data in there.  Should be simple enough, right?\nWhy then when I double tap on the folder I'm presented with this message?\n\"Are you sure you want to create an empty disc? ...\"\nIf I sit here and wait without pressing anything another box then pops up over this offering to burn the folder with options for the burn speed ...\nI mean ... What??  What on earth is it going to burn?  Am I going to end up with a coaster?\nArticles online talk about creating a burn folder, why on earth would I want to create another folder just to put these files in in order to put them on a disk?\nI know I'm still thinking in \"Windows\" speak but this is just ridiculous ...\n\nA: I'm assuming a \"G-Drive\" is an external (USB or Firewire) hard disk, right? If it's some online solution (Google etc.) you'll probably need to copy the files to your local disk first (e.g. to your desktop). Downloading speed would never match your DVD burner speed anyway.\nThe normal procedure of burning files to CD or DVD is extremely simple. You create a \"burn folder\" much like you create a \"project\" in Windows burning software, only the paradigm is far simpler, you do not need to learn (or buy) another application just to burn files to disk, everything is in Finder. Burn folders are just normal folder except for that they \n\n\n*\n\n*only contain aliases (links) to the files that are to be burnt (just like your \"burn project\" in Windows)\n\n*contain some extra attributes for the disk like burn speed, volume label and so on\n\n*are treated specially by OS X when it detects a burnable disk is inserted\n\n*automatically calculate the space required and warn if the files don't fit\n\n\nTry not to think so much, it helps losing all the complicated workarounds you were used to in Windows ... :-)\nDo this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder, in its menu select File > New burn folder\n\n*Drag all items to be burned into this folder. Finder will create aliases, not copies. If you only have one folder to burn, drag its contents into the burn folder. Rename the burn folder how you want your disk to be named.\n\n*In Finder, open the burn folder. You'll see a button at the top labeled \"Burn\". Click.\n\n*Insert DVD, follow instructions.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also just insert the DVD and OS X will ask what to do with the empty disk: if you select \"Open in Finder\", it will automatically create a burn folder for you and show it in the sidebar. Drag items into it, select \"burn\" like above and follow instructions.\nHere's a tutorial with screenshots (showing outdated OS X versions, but visually, not much changed since then): http://www.macforbeginners.com/page.php?id=187\nIf this procedure doesn't work as expected, maybe you can share some screenshots showing what exactly went wrong.\n", "Q: Time machine backups not recognised after OS upgrade I finally updated my OS from 10.6.8 to Mavericks 10.9 yesterday on my late 2009 iMac 27\", but when I got to the point of switching back on my Time machine (connected to a time capsule 2 Tbytes) it doesn't see the previous backups. \nHow can I make Time machine see the previous backups?  Also: Can I continue on the same time capsule to add to the backups I was doing under 10.6.8 ?\nThanks for your input.\n\nA: The format of the backup has changed a lot between 10.6.8 and 10.9. There were several upgrades and some newer versions recognised backups from previous versions. This could be one of reasons why Apple recommends upgrades for each new OS sequentially.\nIf you continue backups, most likely Time Machine will do one of two:\n\n\n*\n\n*override your current backup\n\n*create a new backup bundle\n\n\nI am not sure what it chooses and when but I had both those cases happening. If you do not need old backups, just remove them. If you need them, you can move them to a subfolder.\nOne more solution for you could be to remove and add a Time Machine disk.

Not enough reputation, I have to wait 8 hours.\nI found a workaround, by using VirtuaBox and Windows. I asked VirtuaBox to host the disc drive, and I could access the file just fine from the virtual machine. I hope this helped!\nI have received a disc with a program I have to install.\nThe problem lies in the fact that I have to access a .txt file which contains the program's serial it – it's a personal back-up copy – and I do remember that this file is inside the disc.\nThe problem is that the serial can be seen and opened from Windows, but not from the Mac, which shows its own \"version\" of the disc: that is, the readme file, and the applications to install the software. And nothing more.\nMy question is, is there any way to access this disc as if I were reading it from Windows? That is, displaying the actual file system, without those Mac-only options?\n\nA: This old hint might work but I don't have a CD reader to test.\nIt requires using the Terminal which is not that hard.\n", "Q: How does iWork for iOS know what account to use for icloud? I saw a student selling a used iPad with the offer of including Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. They said they would wipe the device then reinstall iWork. \nWouldn't logging in associate the iWork apps with that iTunes account for icloud purposes? If not, how do these apps figure out which account to use?\nIf I was seing my used iOS device, I would want to be sure that my icloud account isn't on someone else's iPad. Can I be sure that this won't happen?\n\nA: You can use different accounts for iCloud and the App store by logging in in Settings. For document storage the iCloud account is used.\nKeeping iWork apps on an iPad you sell is probably violating the license agreement. And there will be no way to update the applications later because this would require the original iOS App Store password.\n", "Q: Download app update once, install twice/thrice? I have a very slow internet connection and would like to be able to download app updates (iTunes, Aperture, iWork etc.) just for one machine and be able to update 3 machines offline on home network. Is this possible on Mavericks? \n\nA: The \"Caching Server\" is one of the features of OS X Server. Whenever one of your computers (iOS or OS X) downloads an update it is cached on the server.  This link has a simple description: Caching Server\nThis is the official solution that Apple provide.  It does mean another level of complexity to managing your network and only you you will be able to decide whether you want to follow the OS X Server path. From my point of view, I would not unless I intended to use some of the other features of OS X Server (e.g. centralised Time Machine). The server Mac can continue to be used for desktop activity.\n\nA: Yes, there is a way.\nYou can install Mavericks Server (Server costs $20 from the Apple Store), and activate the Caching Server.\nFrom Apple:\n\nThe Caching server speeds up the download of software distributed by\n  Apple through the Internet. It caches all software updates, App Store\n  purchases, iBooks, iTunes U (apps and books purchases only), and\n  Internet Recovery software that local Mac and iOS devices download.\n\n", "Q: iMac 27'' mid-2011 stuck on startup (grey screen) Okay, so I'm having the dreaded grey screen on my iMac - precisely :\n\n\n*\n\n*i'm having it doing a normal startup\n\n*i'm having it trying to boot from recovery partition\n\n*i'm having it trying to boot for internet recovery\n\n*i'm having it trying to boot in safe mode\n\n*verbose mode is no help because it ends with a grey screen before I've time to read anything\n\n*i have a windows partition which also fails to boot, except in safe mode - from where I can access all my HD partitions without any error by the way\n\n*fsck -fy in single user mode reveal no volume error\n\n*an extended Apple Hardware Test reveal no hardware error whatsoever\n\n*replacing RAM modules didn't change anything\n\n\nSo I'm stuck : what can possibly cause the problem if it is neither the OS (remember I'm having trouble with both MacOSX and Windows), and nor the hardware (at least if AHT is indeed reliable) ?

See this Apple article regarding a known video card issue:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130820015305/http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5167\nFrom the article:\n\nApple has determined that some AMD Radeon HD 6970M video cards used in 27-inch iMac computers with 3.1GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 or 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processors may fail, causing the computer’s display to appear distorted, white or blue with vertical lines, or to turn black. iMac computers with affected video cards were sold between May 2011 and October 2012.\n\n", "Q: Skype hangs since upgrading to Mavericks Since upgrading to Mavericks the latest version of the Skype app (6.9 rev 701) hangs frequently, pretty much every time on wake after the laptop goes to sleep.\nI've heard some suggestions about downgrading to an earlier version in the 6 series, any decent workaround for this problem?\n\nA: It would be worth upgrading as significant changes have been made for anyone in this situation. \n", "Q: USB install Drive vs USB Recovery Drive I have two USB sticks:\n\n\n*\n\n*An \"installation\" drive created with Disk Utility by locating the .dmg file hidden in the contents directory of the Mavericks installer. I used an 8GB stick for that. ( this method )\n\n*A \"recovery\" USB stick ( 1 GB stick ) created with Recovery Disk Assistant. ( this method )\n\n\nThe answer:\nDo I need both of them ? If I do, why? If I don't, why ?\n\nA: They do different things. \nRecovery USB allows you to boot your Mac and run recovery software and \"investigate\" Tue condition of the software, hardware, etc. To use that to reinstall OSX requires an active internet connection (Ethernet I think) to download an image to install again.\nInstall USB does a'll that, and can perform a full reinstall with no internet connection. \n", "Q: Sync between Mac & PC version control system Having both a PC & Mac for work, I would like to synchronize development between both devices. I could just use Dropbox or Google Drive, but I would like to have version control (git or otherwise).\nIs there a way to run a version control system (git preferably) between these two devices?\n\nA: I was facing the same question a while ago, and I decided against a solution based on Dropbox or similar tools.\nTake a look at https://bitbucket.org/ - they offer free private Git repositories.\nIf you don't mind hosting your stuff on a public repo, you could also use GitHub, but if it has to be private, check out BitBucket. This is a real Git host, so you can pull/push, even if your machines are on different networks.\nDropbox always sounded like the wrong way for this. It can certainly work, but why do it like this when you can use a real Git host for free?\n\nA: Several ways.\nThe one I use is use a source directory on the local PC or MAc drive and then push to a git clone in a dropbox directory. I can then pull from or push to the dropbox directory locally and dropbox symcs to the other machines.\nIf both machines are on the same network you can create a git server on one (easier on the Mac) and push/pull to the other machine\n", "Q: Migration Assistant (going from 2011 MBP running Mavericks to 2013 rMBP running Mavericks) broke Apple Mail I recently ran Migration Assistant on a 2011 MBP running Mavericks to a brand new, fresh install on a 2013 rMBP and it has completely hosted Apple Mail.\nIt moved over all of my accounts in the Internet Accounts prefpane, but Mail itself thinks that it has no accounts.  So when I launch Mail, it asks me to add an account, and if I hit cancel it quits because it thinks it has no accounts.\nIf I remove the accounts from the Internet Accounts PrefPane and add them through the Mail interface, the Mail check-box associated with the account gets unchecked.\n\nA: Turns out I'm not the only person this has happened to.  From this Apple Support Community Post, if you quit Mail, uncheck the checkboxes from the Internet Accounts prefpanes for anything Mail related, and then delete the files in the Container folder as mentioned in the posting, everything seems to work.\n", "Q: Javaws unable to locate JRE on 10.9 Mavericks From the command line, running javaws results in the message:\n$ javaws\nNo Java runtime present, requesting install.\nUnable to locate a Java Runtime to invoke.\n\n$ java -version\njava version \"1.7.0_40\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_40-b43)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.0-b56, mixed mode)\n\n$ /usr/libexec/java_home -V\nMatching Java Virtual Machines (3):\n    1.7.0_40, x86_64:   \"Java SE 7\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_40.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.6.0_51-b11-457, x86_64:   \"Java SE 6\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0_51-b11-457.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.6.0_51-b11-457, i386: \"Java SE 6\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0_51-b11-457.jdk/Contents/Home\n\nI'm running OSX 10.9.\nWhat's the matter?\n\nA: I had the same problem.

Now, instead of seeing a progress bar as it scans there is just a similar delay with no progress bar, and the only choice it gives me is to \"Import 2054 pictures\".  There are only something like 5 new pictures I took today that I want to import .\nI'm assuming this is the fault of the Mavericks upgrade, and need to figure out how to get the old behavior back.  I have read about a \"hide previously imported photos\" but I don't see that anywhere under preferences (was it moved in this version?). I'm a bit puzzled as to why it occurred around the Mavericks upgrade though, as I'm running iPhoto '11 , version 9.5 (902.7) which is is 3 years old.\n\nA: For some reason, the update to Mavericks caused iPhoto to forget the location of my iPhoto library, which was on an external drive.  I held down the option key while loading iPhoto and confirm that the default library was a newly created library on the local drive and that my external drive library was present but not selected it.  When I selected it, I was informed that I had to upgrade it to the most current version.  After this was complete, plugging in my SD card resulting in iPhoto recognizing the existing photos as duplicates.  Unfortunately, unlike the old version it no longer gives any progress as it reads the card and processes it, but at least the issue is resolved.\n", "Q: How to change lower case am/pm on the menu bar to uppercase? \nI find the time shown on the menu bar on mavericks a bit annoying.

After this, I sync this appointment with the Exchange server CommandR. Now I expect this new appointment to be living on the Exchange server and I expect this appointment to be synced with my other devices (iPhone and company website), and it does.\nBut when I reverse things and create an appointment in the Exchange calendar via the company website it gets synced to my iPhone, but it does not show in the OS X Calendar app. What about invitations?

Is that possible?\nI’m using Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).\n(Mike Scott mentioned in How to show hidden files and folders in finder? that this might not be possible to show only specific files/folders that start with a dot but it would be nice with a definite answer – and instructions for how to do it, if it is indeed possible.)\n\nA: If you do not wish to use a symbolic link (which is a good workaround), as mentioned in another answer, you can use the free app invisibliX to toggle the visibility of hidden files quickly or to hide specific files. You can even set your own keyboard shortcut from System Preferences > Keyboard.\nThis is easier to use than resorting to the Terminal to change Finder settings back and forth.\nIf you wish to see hidden files in Open/Save dialogs, pressing Cmd+Shift+.

That's a feature. \nEither you show all files starting with dots or you hide them all. \nchflags hidden myFile can make hide a file but not unhide files hidden because of the dot. \n\nA: One way to get around this would be to create a symbolic link to .htaccess and call it something without a dot. For example:\n$ cd site_root\n$ ln -s .htaccess htaccess\n\nThen you can open htaccess from Finder and you'll actually be editing the .htaccess file.\n(You could even make the second command ln -s .htaccess \" .htaccess\", which would visually look like .htaccess but be visible because of the leading space.)\n\nA: I just created this one-liner bash script that creates symbolic links for all dot-files in your home directory.

For me, the problem turned out to be that my environment variables (in particular, JAVA_HOME) weren't being set, which is because the instance of Bash (or whichever shell you have it use) doesn't start as a login shell OR an interactive shell, so your profile script (e.g. ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, etc.) doesn't run automatically.\nFor me, the solution was to add the following to my script:\nsource ~/.profile\n\nThe source command causes the commands in ~/.profile to be executed in the current shell; this way the environment variables being set by that script will be available to the instance of Bash that platypus starts.\nNote that it's important that you don't just execute the profile file as a shell script itself; that will cause it to run in its own shell, which will exit immediately afterward; any variables it sets will cease to exist as soon as it exits. This is why we have to use the source command.\nAs an alternative, you can just set the necessary environment variables directly in your script.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Enabling Intel VT on Macbook Pro 9,2 (Mid 2012) I want to enable (if it's not) Intel VT-x to speed up the Android emulator.\nHow can I see if it's enabled and if not how to do it ? \n\nA: Apple says VT-x technology is enabled on Intel-based Macs.\nIt seems to be (after this page) that only first Intel-based Macs may have some problem with VT-x so it should not be your case. \n", "Q: iTunes Connect closed this holiday? iTunes Connect was closed for a week last year around the christmas holidays.\nDoes anyone know if there will be a similar period of time where iTunes Connect is closed this year?\n\nA: They do it every year.

Most of the time the first step to troubleshoot an OSX application problem is to login to the Guest account and see if a problem persist. The reason for this - I presume - is that the ~/Library folder of the guest account does not contain any, possibly corrupt preference files.\nOver the years of using my Mac my ~/Library folder has become cluttered with preference files and folders of applications. Some of these applications are no longer installed.\nIs there a way to \"start over\"? Some way to delete all existing preferences, and then let the applications currently present populate it again when the application is started?\nEspecially the Application Support and Preferences folder is full of old, irrelevant files.\nI know I could do a fresh install, but then if I restore the user from Time Machine obviously the ~/Library is restored as well.\n\nA: Yes the process is simple in concept but takes a long time to finish. Worse, it’s likely to not benefit you in any meaningful manner that you couldn’t achieve by making a clean new account and copy your documents from your backup.\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of your system and perhaps a perfect image of ~/Library\n\n*Delete files as you feel is best\n\n*Investigate and solve all the broken programs that stored assets in ~/Library as well as settings.\n\nStep 3 repeats quite often and the best way to work on step 3 is unironically, set up a clean new user and troubleshoot / investigate why your broken account doesn't work as expected.\nIn reality, most programs work fairly well to patch together the files they need in ~/Library and the breakage generally is Apple Loops for Garage band (older versions especially) and keychain / caches of really seldom used passwords that when needed cause frustration and more lost time than any perceived problem that letting thousands of small, probably unused files lie in ~/Library\n\nA: If you log into the Guest account and everything is running as you suspect, simply create a new user (make sure they are an administrator). Log into the new account and then take ownership of the previous user's Documents, Photo's, Music, etc. folders and move them into the new profile. Depending on how many files you have to move this way it is a quick and easy way to \"start over.\" :D\n\nA: Ummm, while there could be damaged files in your ~/Library folder it is more likely to be a damaged preference file. And rebuilding the ENTIRE ~/Library folder would be difficult and time consuming. Possible but a bit of a PITA...\nHow I would proceed would be to move the contents of the ~/Library/Preferences folder elsewhere (say, to a temp folder on your desktop. then reboot and see how things are behaving.\nOnce you have determined that the system itself is OK you can start with your Apps. Just launch them one at a time and see how they are doing.\nNote that some Apps store serial numbers inside the preference file and you may have to re-register the software to use it.\nOddly enough this is one of the few troubleshooting steps that remains from the Classic Mac O/S.\n\nA: *\n\n*First, take a backup of your system.\n\n*In addition to the ideas described in the answer to What programs exist to find and delete orphan files left after deleting an app?, you can use the paid app CleanMyMac 2 that has a feature to remove unused files from applications you may have trashed in the past without using an uninstaller utility.\nQuote from CleanMyMac 2 - Features:\n\nDelete old apps\n  Instantly uninstall programs on your Mac that you no longer use along with all associated files, or remove all files that remain from previously Trashed apps.  \nNo more Leftovers\n  If you used to uninstall applications by dragging them to Trash, then you have tons of apps leftovers! Find and remove them using CleanMyMac2. \n\n\n*After removing the orphaned files, if you still wish to redo all your application configurations like a fresh install, then take another backup of your system and delete files from ~/Library/Application Support and ~/Library/Preferences. In the case of applications that use installers (as opposed to drag and drop into /Applications or ~/Applications), you would have to run the installers again.\nNote: I have intentionally omitted /Library and the folders within it that are sometimes populated by some application installers. If that cannot be dealt with a test application, it may be risky to do it by hand.\n", "Q: Remove symbol link In terminal, I have made a symbol link like following:\nln -s ../../../../ jni/prod\n\nIt symbol links prod directory (which is 4 levels up from current location) to jni/prod . \nI'd like to emphasize that it symbol links a directory NOT a file.\nNow, I want to remove this symlink, how to do it?\n\nA: If you find yourself confused about where a file really exists, cd to the directory you expect and use rm -i and refrain from adding any path - delete the file in the current directory. Also, in unix, everything is a file - including a directory. You do have saving grace that trying to delete a file that looks like a directory will pause unless you are recursively deleting files.\nWorst case, you could use ls -lai to inspect the inode numbers to be sure a file is really symlinked and not hard linked.\nIf that doesn't help, make a temp directory and play with links:\ntouch foo\nln foo bar       # hard link\nln -s foo baz    # sym link\nls -lai\nrm foo\nls -lai\n\nAt this point, you have the hard link file bar left and a sym link to the missing \"foo\" file. Since in your case, the link is in a different directory than the target, you shouldn't have too much problem deleting the item you wish.\n\nA: A symbolic link is a file even if the link is to a directory.  So if you simply did an rm that will get rid of the link:\nrm jni/prod\n\n", "Q: Does Windows or Linux have any tools for accessing a FileVault2 encrypted drive's contents? I'm looking to mount (and access files on) my FileVault2 encrypted drive on a non-OS X box, and am wondering if anyone has done this with Windows or Linux.  \n\nA: On Linux, the libfvde project aims to support decoding FileVault2. Yogesh Khatri wrote an overview article where he suggests starting with libfvde's wiki.\nOn Windows, the company Passware claim support for decrypting FileVault2 drives as part of Passware Kit Forensic 13.1. A CNet article mentions the software and highlights the feature in an included screenshot:\n\n", "Q: Adding a MAC to a Windows Domain - well not quite I am a Windows SYS Admin. We already have some MAC's, but I am not happy with the way that I CAN'T really admin them.\nSo, my question:\nAs we get a new MAC now, what's the correct way to add it? (It's never really a part of the domain - I know that)\nI will have 1 admin user on this MAC, and the owner as well (total of 2 admins) - IS there a difference to which account is created first?\nCan I make it, that the user's account will be able to see his currently private folders on our File Server (SMB protocol?) - if our AD users are: first.last - can that be the login to the MAC? \n\nA: First off, Macs will happily bind to Active Directory domains - there's some variation between versions of AD and OS X, but if you're on AD 2008 or newer and OS X 10.8.3 or newer you won't have any problems.  Use the Accounts preference pane, open Directory Utility for more control, or use dsconfigad from the Terminal.  Once a Mac is bound, you will see it in your AD domain's Computers, just like anything else.\nThe UUIDs will be different, based on the order of account creation, but there is no functional difference between any two accounts that have been granted administrative rights.  You can also specify AD groups when binding to grant admin rights (typically AD domain and enterprise admins).\nAccessing the SMB share will be based upon that share's owner and permissions.  If the user logs in to the Mac with his AD credentials, they should be able to easily connect to the share; with a small amount of effort you can easily add the share to auto-mount at login.\nYou might want to check out AFP548 for more resources on Macs and AD.\n", "Q: Retrieving apps and Music from 2 iCloud accounts to one iPhone I have 2 iCloud accounts. not because of any crafty idea or security concerns but because I forgot my password and it was easier to just setup anther account. \nNow I just upgraded my phone to a 5S and want to get all my apps and music on the new phone but they're backed up on two accounts. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: The apps are not « backed up » on account, they are at most link to an account.\nYour only solution : \n\n\n*\n\n*If you still have your first password : Change your iTunes login in the iPhone and download the apps linked to that account. You'll get the cloud icon on the App Store if the app is linked, a price/free else.\n\n*You do the same thing with the second account. \n\n\nNB:  If you really forgot your password, you're going to need to rebuy the apps with your new account. \n\nA: I can confirm the first answer.\nI attempted to update my Apple ID with a new email address and ended up creating a second account, and then purchased a movie. I didn't discover my error until I opened iTunes and discovered all my iPhone apps were gone. \nIf you can remember your original Apple ID password, you can change the iTunes ID and download all your purchases, and then change back to the other account if you need to.\nApple's password recovery method surely tries your patience.\n", "Q: How to selectively (un)subscribe IMAP folders in 10.9 Mail.app I cannot find a way to selectively subscribe to IMAP folders in Mail.app in 10.9\nIs there a way? Am I missing something there? It seems the IMAP implementation in Mail.app is still quite buggy and plays especially bad with dovecot IMAP servers. \n\nA: In theory: Control+click an IMAP folder in Mail, and select Get Account Info from the context menu. In the resulting dialog, select the Subscription List tab. Then subscribe and unsubscribe as desired.\nIn practice, I'm not sure whether that actually works; I can't test it on my particular system.\n", "Q: How can I map the Windows key to option in Microsoft Remote Desktop version 8? In Remote Desktop Connection version 2.x you could map the remote windows key to the local option key (instead of the command key) in preferences. In the new Microsoft Remote Desktop version 8 from the App Store I can no longer find this setting. Is this feature tucked away somewhere and I'm missing it?\nOne option might be KeyRemapForMacbook as discussed here, but I want to know if there is a solution that doesn't require third party software.\n\nA: Indeed, this appears to no longer be possible without 3rd-party software.\nAdding the same preference key to the new app seemed to not make any difference - it appears that this ability has been removed from the app.\nAs you mentioned, KeyRemap4Macbook would work with the private.xml that you linked to.\n\nA: Here's the private.xml I ended up using in KeyRemap4Macbook to remap the keys. In particular note that I set it up so that the physical command-tab combination still activates app switching just like in the old version of RDP.

With either the downloadable or disc version of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac (e.g., Home and Student edition), can I selectively install only Word and Excel?  I do not want/need Outlook, PowerPoint, Messenger, or Remote Desktop (all of which are included with all editions of Office for Mac according to the descriptions).  I know this is possible with the Windows version of the same, but I wanted to verify for the Mac version as I've never used it.  \nFurthermore, I don't want to enter my admin password to install Office (the implication is that with the password it isn't an isolated installation as a .DMG, for example, but that it is installing components throughout the system).  I do not want any extraneous MS processes, applications, or components running on my laptop (Macbook Pro Retina 2012, running Mavericks). Does the installation require an admin password?\n\nA: You can customize the Office installation, but I do not recall if that includes the ability to not install specific applications or not. Look for the \"Customize...\" button in the installer. \nThe installer does require your admin password because it writes to specific system folders (as appropriate) which require administrator access. There is no avoiding that. \nHowever, there is good news: Office for Mac does not store your password, and will not install any background processes that would slow down your computer. Despite its reputation and many people's inherent dislike of anything Microsoft, Office for Mac is a relatively good \"citizen\" of the Mac community. \n\nA: During installation, you can choose to install specific applications.  Click on the \"Customize\" button in the installer.  I always go for custom installations when I can; for Office:Mac, I don't install the Microsoft Document Connection since I don't use Sharepoint.\nThe administrator password is required to install Office, as with pretty much any modern Mac application, because Office:Mac writes to /Library.  The days of drag-and-drop Mac installers are all but gone except for the most trivial of applications.  This is a system dialog and not an Office:Mac dialog, so the installer or the individual applications within Office:Mac never see your administrator password.  In the future, if you want to fully delete Office:Mac 2011, this article explains exactly what gets stored where and how to delete it.  \nOutlook is not included with all editions of Office:Mac 2011.  It is only included with the Home & Business Edition, not the Home & Student Edition.  (I realize that you don't want it; I'm including this information here for others who might read this question and get confused.)\nAfter installation has completed, you will be asked if you want Microsoft to check for updates automatically.  If you do this, you will have one process that runs on your Mac: \"Microsoft AUDaemon\".  If you prefer not to let the auto-updater do its job, Microsoft generally issues updates on the second Tuesday of every month, and you can check for updates manually by going to Help -> Check for Updates in any Office:Mac application.\n", "Q: Connect MacBook Air to Cisco 2811 Console (RS-232 serial) I'm trying to console connect into my business's Cisco 2811 console with my MacBook Air with a Thunderbolt to Gigabit adapter. I've googled around for a day and haven't found any information.\nHow can I connect to my router with my MacBook Air using the Thunderbolt adapter?\nEDIT:\nI've purchased the proprietary Cisco console cable which is an RJ-45 to DB9 rollover \ncable.\nThen I purchased a DB9 to usb adapter to plug into the MBA but when I try to follow \nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/connectedgrid/cgr1000/hardware/cgr1240/app.console.html#wp1049053\nI don't get anything under usb.\n\nA: Serial is not Ethernet, these are two different protocols, so connecting it to your thunderbolt adapter won't work. You can use a USB-serial cable for this, I've had good experiences with cables with a PL2303 chipset on OSX. \n\nA: The \"console\" port on a Cisco router is for a serial connection, so you would need a USB-to-serial adapter and the appropriate cable to connect that way. Cisco routers can also be set up to be configured via telnet, and I think the nicer ones do SSH (or maybe all the new ones do now, I don't know, but SSH adds a lot of code for router firmware that is supposed to be tight and devoted to the bare minimum required for routing packets). So you would be able to connect to it that way without special equipment or programs, from anywhere within its internal network and possibly its external one, depending on configuration.\n\nA: If SSH is enabled on the router you can plug into the network interface of a connected switch (or anywhere on the network) and open Terminal. \nType> SSH XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX being the ip of the router, ex. 10.0.1.1)\nIf SSH is enabled you should be prompted for a username or login depending on the device. The 2811 may just ask for a password at that point (been awhile since I have logged into one).\nIf it times out then SSH is not enabled on the router and this is a configuration on the router itself. Then the USB to serial to Cisco Console Cable is going to be your best route to connect. I use Tripp-Lite USB to Serial adapters and have had no problems. They are about $20.\nI have used both these methods as a network admin and it works for Cisco switch configs.\n\nA: I use a mac to connect to cisco routers daily.\nYou are on the right track.  You have the correct equipment... Now you need to install a driver for the USB to serial adapter.\nIf you have OSX 10.x and you purchased a generic adapter such as the TRENDnet TU-S9 USB to serial adapter, you can simply download and the driver from here.  Install it, reboot, and you should see /dev/tty.usbserial when you run the command ls -ltr /dev/*usb*. \nIf you are using some other USB to serial adapter, post the output of the command ioreg -p IOUSB -l and I will try to help.\n", "Q: Linux-style window resizing Redhat Linux has this really nice feature where I can hold down the Window key, middle-mouse click-and-hold somewhere in a window, and drag to resize the window.  It doesn't have to be the very corner of the window.  The corner that is resized depends on which quadrant of the window I clicked in - for instance, if I middle-mouse clicked somewhere in the lower-left of the window, dragging would lock the upper-right of the window, but resize based on shrinking/growing the lower left.  Using the left click instead of the middle click can move the entire window (this can only be done on Mac OS X by grabbing the title bar).  \nI'm specifically only interested in these 2 features - are there any apps available that can accomplish this?\n\nA: Zooom/2 is the closest thing I could find so far.\nSadly, it's discontinued and hasn't been actively worked on since 2011.  It is $20 shareware.\nThe functionality is pretty close, however it doesn't allow you to use the middle- and right- click buttons as modifiers, so it's not possible to mimic Linux functionality, but it's close enough.\nThe other major drawback is that it doesn't work with Photoshop :(  I suspect this is Apple's fault, however.\n", "Q: How to break an audio file into tracks when burning to CD I have a lecture that fills an entire CD when I burn it using iTunes.\nThe problem is, it isn't broken into tracks, it is a single track and it makes jumping around difficult.\nHow can I break it out into say 10 minute tracks?\n\nA: You could use any free audio editor for Mac OS X, e.g., Audacity, to manually break it up into tracks.  Might be a bit more tedious than you were hoping for, though.\n\nA: Magic Cutter (on the App Store) can do this more automatically -- it can split by time or \"by silence\", scanning for pauses in the audio. I assume you want to break more than just one lecture, as you want something more convenient than the perfectly good Audacity answer. \n", "Q: OS X 10.9: Deleting Keyboard Input Sources This is really similar to:\nHow to remove or disable a default keyboard layout?\nHowever, I am new here and have no ability to comment or make remarks towards this to voice further problems.\nIn OS X 10.9, I need to remove input sources in System Preferences > Language and Region > Keyboard Preferences > Input Source.\nTo be clear, I want these gone completely; if I were to click the add button then I want there to be nothing but the basic English layout available. \n\n**Edit:\nThe solution can be as dangerous as editing near-/root-level files in the OS as long as there's a possible solutions\nIf no possible solution can be found can anyone recommend third-party software or a way to lock system preferences?**\n\nA: If others got here searching for how to disable all input sources except a custom keyboard layout, you can edit the com.apple.HIToolbox plist:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the current input source to your custom keyboard layout.\n\n*Open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist (in 10.9) or ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist (in 10.8 and earlier).

In your case one of the english input sources. \n\nEdit : OP want's to remove all the input source from the list (accessible by clicking the \"+\" button). And that's not possible. \n\nA: [edit: Disregard this answer - it addresses custom keyboard layouts which you can remove by deleting them from the \"Keyboard Layouts\" dir. Op wanted an answer for default Apple languages preinstalled in the system]\nThe easiest way to remove a custom keyboard layout from \"Input Sources -> +\" list (when clicking the add button) is to use Keyboard Juggler (see section \"Companion Application\"). \n\nKeyboard Juggler is a simple app designed to simplify the work flow of\n  editing keyboard layouts. It simply gives you a way to move keyboard\n  layouts in and out of the folders that macOS uses for enabling the use\n  of keyboard layouts, without having to use the Finder or show hidden\n  folders.

I have a 27\" Korean IPS with a full size DisplayPort input (not Thunderbolt). Is it possible to drive this monitor daisy chained off a 27\" Apple Thunderbolt monitor, using a mini DisplayPort output to fullsize DisplayPort cable? The Apple monitor would be driven by my late 2011 MacBook Pro.\nCouldn't find a clear answer on this, as I think people are confusing DisplayPort and Thunderbolt quite a bit. My guess is you can't do this, because perhaps you can only daisy chain a thunderbolt monitor to another thunderbolt monitor?\n\nA: From Apple's Thunderbolt Ports and Displays FAQ:\n\nCan I connect a Mini DisplayPort display to my Apple Thunderbolt Display for computers that support using more than one display?\nMini DisplayPort displays will not function if connected to the Thunderbolt port of an Apple Thunderbolt Display. Displays connected via Mini DisplayPort video adapter or cable to the Thunderbolt port of an Apple Thunderbolt Display will not work.\n\nSo as you guessed, you can't daisychain a non-Thunderbolt display to a Thunderbolt display. You can only do it with two Thunderbolt displays (or of course, two displays on different ports directly connected to your Mac).\n", "Q: Mavericks - ssh to host under search domain I am VPNed in to a network which has its own search domain, and it mostly works - I don't have to type the domain in the browser, and the host command resolves to the correct IPs.\nHowever, when I try to ssh to a host on that network, ssh tells me it could not resolve the hostname.\nThis is very perplexing as I have never seen this issue before - the system is either resolving correctly or not at all.\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\nThanks.\n\nA: Have you tried to SSH to the IP address?

Is there a way to see if any song is explicit/clean if I bought any songs from the iTunes store and synced it in via iTunes via Cydia apps? (iOS 5, iPhone 4, Mac 10.9 Mavericks)\n\nA: If explicit you should have a little E next to the title\n", "Q: How can Mail.app in Mavericks show a messages plain text alternative? A few days ago I wanted to verify that a simple multipart html/text mail I was about to send would render correctly in different mail clients. Does anyone know how to let Mail.app under Mavericks show the plain text alternative for an email? It used to be an option in the menus in previous releases, but now it seems to be gone.\n\nA: Apparently there is no way to do this with mavericks' Mail.app.\nThe option in the menu is gone and setting it by hard in the plist file doesn't seem to work anymore either, according to this post and this post.\nUnfortunately you have to switch to a different mail client if you want to have proper multi-format support.\nOr, for testing purposes, you could just send you the email in plain text and see how it looks and then verify that both parts are present by looking at the raw mail text (which Mail.app still lets you do).\n", "Q: How to type blank character with Mac keyboard?

Since then several WiFi networks are rejecting my password (rejecting wrong passwords immediately, and giving timeout for correct ones) or even not showing up in the WiFi list. In the meantime, some other networks are OK.\nIs there a post-upgrade task to clean up or reset the Wireless configuration or drivers?\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing saved wifi records from Network preferences - Advanced\n\n*Removing wifi passwords from Keychain Assistant\n\n*Removing Wi-Fi profile from network preferences and recreating it\n\n*Changing the Service Order with Wi-Fi to top (under the gear next to +/-)\n\n*Unfortunately I often have no access to routers to reboot or change channels\n\n\nA: My new MacBook Air was effected by this problem (but the old white MacBook was not).  Here's what I did 2 days ago in System Preferences in this order: renew DHCP Lease, uncheck Keychain in iCloud, and then restart the computer.  So far so good.\n\nA: I renewed DHCP lease (but I guess this doesn't do anything when the computer isn't connected to a network?), deleted the network, rebooted, and then I was able to connect.\n\nA: For others finding this thread because they too have the problem:\nOn my wife's MacBook Pro, the answer turned out to be that the laptop could not differentiate between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz version of the wireless, and if it connected to a different one previously, OS X told her the password was wrong. \nThe cure was to 'split' the two wi-fi networks by adding '-5' to the 5GHz version SSID, then the Mac could tell them apart.  It has the same pass code for both networks (although they could be different pass codes) and is now happy to connect to either, every time.\nWhy this suddenly crops up for some may be traced to relative signal strength on each frequency, and maybe a new router having the 5GHz band for the first time, but with the same SSID. (That is how they are normally set up, but Apple has problems with this setup.)\nHTH someone.\n", "Q: Why do I have a dozen copies of certain preference file in my ~/Library/Preferences folder?

I think OSX tries something like putting automatically your login/password, but it doesn't work. But the result is that the window to connect never shows up.\nI had such a problem few months ago on OSX 10.8 and it was difficult and unclear how to solve it. It involves keychain and other things.\nIt seems that this problem still exists on OSX 10.9.\nSo is there an easy way to avoid these problems?\n\nA: From your screenshot it looks like your browser is opening (and later failing to open) a login screen in a new window. Try using a different browser.\nYou might also try \nSystem Preferences -> Network -> [with \"Wi-Fi\" selected] Advanced ->\n uncheck \"Remember networks this computer has joined\"\nand / or\nKeychain Access -> [with \"System\" keychain selected] -> delete the AirPort network password\n", "Q: On OS X is it possible to override DHCP assigned DNS servers but still keeping them for fallback? By default I would like to use the google public DNS servers and to fallback to intranet ones when these are failing.\nIs this possible? ... I am looking for a setup that would not break when I move my laptop no other networks.\nIt would be acceptable if I found a solution specific to this wifi network connection (to do the trick only in this case, and to use defaults for others).\n\nA: You can use ipconfig getpacket to find the DNS server that DHCP recommended:\n$ ipconfig getpacket en0 \n...\ndomain_name_server (ip_mult): {192.168.3.2, 192.168.42.1}\n...\n\nSo, assuming you are using the Wi-Fi adapter and its device is en0, you can:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ndefault_servers=$( ipconfig getpacket en0 | \\\n   perl -ne'/domain_name_server.*: \\{(.*)}/ && print join \" \", split /,\\s*/, $1' )\nnetworksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1 $default_servers\n\n\nA: Yes, you can add the Google DNS servers at the top of the list and follow those with your own (intranet servers).\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Network\n\n*Select your network interface from the list on the left\n\n*Click the Advanced button on the right\n\n*In the DNS tab of the dialog, click \"+\" to add or \"-\" to remove entries (you can also edit entries by double clicking or selecting and clicking on the address)\n\n*Add the Google DNS addresses as the first two entries\n\n*Add your intranet DNS servers below those\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Click Apply\n\n*Close System Preferences\n\nA: There's also a way to do this from the command-line if you're a network administrator looking for a way to do this in a batch:\nnetworksetup listallnetworkservices\n# look for the correct network device here, probably \"Wi-Fi\"\nsudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nReplace \"Wi-Fi\" with the correct network device.

It comes with mavericks and I haven't booted the machine yet. I know for certain that I will erase mavericks and install 10.6. However, if things go wrong, I would like to be able to reinstall mavericks. and restore the situation as it was as out of the shop. What do I have to do in order to achieve this ?\n\nA: No you won't be able to install Snow Leopard, it's not compatible. \nBut you'll be able to build app that a compatible with older OS X from XCode. But you won't be able to test it's behaviour on older platform from this mac. You'll need older macs. \n\nA: Chances are 10.6 won't work on your Mac Mini. As this hardware didn't exist when 10.6 was the main OS X version it probably doesn't have the right drivers for your hardware.\n", "Q: Safari Top Sites auto-refresh It seems that Safari 7.0 (for Mac) doesn't refresh the previews (anymore). Is there a way to turn this (back) on?\n\nA: You can hit cmd+R while viewing Top Sites to manually refresh.\n((I'm still trying to figure out how to restore automatic refresh.))\n\nA: It is now no longer possible to refresh the Top Sites with Cmd-R (certainly it doesn't work in Safari 10.)\nThe only way I've found to do it is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the Develop menu (Preferences->Advanced->Show Develop menu in menu bar)\n\n*Choose Develop->Empty Caches\n\n\nThis will clear all Safari caches including Top Sites. The Top Sites thumbnails will gradually fill back in with newly-refreshed versions. (Very gradually—I assume Safari does it quietly and in the background, while it's idle. It took about five minutes for a new Top Sites tab I opened to gradually fill its thumbnails in as I was doing other things.)\nThis doesn't re-enable the \"auto refresh\" there used to be, but hopefully it might help someone like me who had a temporary network issue that seemed to corrupt all the Top Site thumbnails and just wants to force a refresh from scratch.\n", "Q: Returning to simple pop-up characters panel? One of my favorite new Mavs features is the pop-up characters panel.  Its operation is detailed here. It is summoned via control+command+space and looks like this:\n\nAt some point, however, the key combination started summoning the full Character Viewer instead:\n\nThe latter is a bit more awkward to use than the panel was.  How did I get set this way and how I can get back to using the pop-up panel?\n\nA: The button in the upper-right corner of Character Viewer was the culprit.  If I summon Character Viewer and click it, Character Viewer shrinks:\n\nFrom then on, further presses of control+command+space summon the pop-up panel instead.\nAs to how I got to the full Character Viewer, opening Character Viewer from the menu bar Input menu (which can be turned on in System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources):\n\nthen clicking the button in the upper-right corner of Character Viewer twice—once to shrink the window, once to restore it—appears to set a preference that I'd like the key combination to pop up the full Character Viewer instead of the pop-up.\n", "Q: Mac as wi-fi hotspot: how many devices can connect? Is there a theoretical or practical limit to the number of devices that can be connected to a Macbook Pro sharing its internet connection as a wi-fi hotspot?\n\nA: On OSX Yosemite (beta 10.10.3), on MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012), today (2015-04-28), I've connected 15 different devices (Android, iOS, Win, OSX) via WiFi hotspot (sharing internet via Ethernet), and reported very low decline in internet bandwith with each new device connected.\n\nA: It can connect at max 7 devices, I have tried to connect more but wasn't able to.\n\nA: I regularly try connecting 27 Wi-Fi modules (ESP-12F) and find that typically around three or four don't connect. It's slightly different every time, so the limit is probably 24.\nIn my case I'm using a Mac Mini 2009 model to share the internet.\n\nA: I don't know about limit but I'm using 5 devices (3 mobiles and 1 macbook air and 1 windows 8 laptop) without any issue. data transfer ratio is also good. \n", "Q: bash: Searching with ls Is there a bash command that can be used as Spotlight or an option with ls that only prints files containing certain text? I want to be able to open Terminal and type something ls -SOMEOPTION filename and find all the files that have filename in their name, and this option could be used with -R and it would work as a replacement for Spotlight.\n\nA:  find . -type f -name \"*filename*\" -exec grep -il 'mywordinthefile' {} \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*find search for file recursively in a directory. \n\n*First parameters is the directory you want to look in. Here it's . so the current directory. You could use ~/Documents for example or any other directories. \n\n*-type f- option is to only return files, not directories. \n\n*-name option takes a pattern to find specifics filenames. \n\n*grep is used here to find the word/pattern you want in the files found by find. \n\nA: To find all files which contain a certain string, you can use just grep on its own: \ngrep -R /path/to/directory \"myword\"\nIn the example above, \"myword\" is what you're looking for, and /path/to/directory is the directory you want to search through. -R tells grep to run a recursive search (i.e. to start at the path you specified, and go into each subdirectory in there). \nEDIT\nI've re-read your question and I think you're looking for how to find files that have a certain filename. For this use: \nfind /path/to/directory -name \"*glob*\" -print\nwhere /path/to/directory is where you want to start your search (and find will also look in the subdirectories) and \"*glob*\" is a full or a partial file name that you want to look for. Please note, you can use wildcards (. and * for any single and any multiple characters match, respectively) in the glob. As a variation to this, you can use, as proposed by others: \nfind /path/to/directory -name \"*glob*\" -exec ls -la {} \\;\nin the above, what you put after the option -exec is any UNIX command with paramteres (in this case ls -la). The {} will be substituted by the file name find finds, and the \\; is a termination string. \nEDIT 2\nPlease note, the commands above give you similar results to Spotlight, but they don't use Spotlight at all. \nIf you'd like to use Spotlight from command line, you can use mdfind command, which is a command-line interface for Spotlight. Typing mdfind on its own will give you a quick help for using it with a few examples. man mdfind will give you a more detailed manual for it. \nEssentially mdfind takes a search string (and optional modifiers) as it's argument and it's the same as you would type in Spotlight's text field when using it in a GUI.\n\nA: To find files with a specific string in the filename, use\n    find . -type f -name '*<filename>*' 2> /dev/null\n\nSubstitute <filename> with the string that you would like to look for in the filename.\nThe redirection at the end is to avoid printing errors when certain files/folders are not accessible.\n\nYou can put this command in a shell script, called say, lsf that would contain the following:\nfind . -type f -name \"*$1*\" 2> /dev/null\n\nThen make it executable using\nchmod +x lsf\n\n\nYou can also put this in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file instead of a shell script as described above (the command is still named lsf here):\nmyls()\n{\n    find . -type f -name \"*$1*\" 2> /dev/null\n}\nalias lsf=myls\n\n", "Q: How to transfer photos from OS X Tiger to iPad iOS 7 My mom got an iPad Air as a birthday present. She has been using an iBook G4 running 10.4.11 until now.\nI am trying to migrate her photos from the iBook (iPhoto) to the iPad. Is there any easy  way to do so?\n\nA: No easy way no. \nG4 with 10.4 means a (very) old iTunes version (9.2.1). For iTunes 10 you need a least Leopard. \nTo sync with iOS7 (the default OS of the iPad Air) you'll need iTunes 11.1.  \nOther options : \n\n\n*\n\n*Use a another (more recent) mac to do it \n\n*send the images with an app or mail (veeeeeery long) \n\n\nA: If I plug my iphone 5s into our old Sony Vio (2003) it sees all the photos as if the phone was a camera. We have a G5 Powermac and a much newer MacBook Pro. Neither will allow me to get photos from the iphone. The only draw back is the photos are number img001 etc. Once brought back to the Mac though, the Metadata is intact. \nI always thought Apple was a great platform. they invented \"plug and play\" but the simple task of getting photos off a phone , via USB (which has been around for years) seems to much to ask.\nTo solve the nice file names that the iphone issues (based on date and time, I am writing a script (in Applescript) to apply the date and time data to the file name.

Their VPN runs via a Java network client from Juniper Networks, and it appears to require write-access and chmod permissions on several folders. I can get around this by enabling \"Run in Safe Mode\" in Safari, which is what the client is recommending I do. I can't find anything about the security ramifications of doing this and I don't feel comfortable downgrading security on my system, even if it's for a client I trust. On the other hand, I don't know if I was running the software in \"unsafe mode\" before the update without knowing it (which is what I'm afraid was probably the case). \nDoes anyone know what the ramifications of running Java apps in \"unsafe mode\" are? \nThere is a knowledgebase article (Google cache) on this, which says they are working on a certified client. I understand it won't be out for another month.\n\nA: It looks like unsafe mode allows the Java app full access to your filesystem, which is enough that a malicious Java app could do anything it wants (take over your computer, infect it with malware, spy on you, etc.).  So, the name \"unsafe mode\" does seem appropriate here.\nIt's your call whether you want to take the risk.  Personally, I wouldn't, on my own personal computer.  I might set up a virtual machine and run the VPN client inside the VM, or ask the client for another solution that doesn't involve shooting holes in your computer's security.  Right now, Java security is a bit of a mess; it's a shame we don't have better solutions available.\n", "Q: How to further determine what rogue Firefox (upload) processes are doing Config and issue\nI have a late 2011 MBP, running Mac OS X 10.7.5, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5, with 16GB 1600 MHz DDR3.\nI have just updated my firefox 20 to 25, this issue also occurred with v 20.\nWhen I am uploading files, or just general browsing, sometimes I get a few firefox processes which start to use up CPU cycles, consequently my fans start to spin up.\nIf I quit Firefox, the processes stay active.\n\nHere is what I have done so far:\nps aux|grep firefox\nmacbook-pro:~ <my user>$ ps aux|grep firefox\n<my user>  29061  84.7  0.0  3699392    304   ??

Here's a somewhat tedious process to troubleshoot this further. It may be a bad plugin or a corrupt profile.\nStart Firefox in Safe Mode so you can confirm if this problem is due to any plugin or extension. If it works fine in Safe Mode, then you would have to go a bit more slowly and disable one at a time to see which one makes a difference.\nYou can do also use Firefox with a newly created profile. If that makes a difference, then your old profile is corrupt in some way and you could just start using this profile and add your previous extensions one by one (don't forget to copy over bookmarks from the previous profile if you decide to stick with the new one).\nYou can look at the crashes by going to the about:crashes page (from the address bar) and load an easy-to-read crash report that may point to issues.\nAlso look at the instructions and information in Firefox uses too many CPU resources - How to fix.\n\nA: This is still occurring.\nAs a work around every time the processes \"runs\" away I issue the following command, since even if I upload one image, there may be up to ten \"rogue\" firefox processes:\nfor i in `ps axu | grep '[f]irefox' | awk '{print $2}'`;do kill -s 9 $i; done \n\nI tried to get the above done with the cut command but could not get it to work. I have posted a related question here.\n", "Q: Launchd script's output not being logged to system.log Sample script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello?\"\n... (other things)\n\nWhen run via launchd, it definitely runs (the other things are being done) but nothing shows up in system.log. I'm running OS 10.9.\nI tried replacing that line with\nsyslog -s \"HELLO?\"\n\nbut that also shows nothing.\n\nA: You can use the command loggerinstead.\nFor example logger \"test\" will result in\nNov  7 17:37:20 bounty.local napcae[82311]: test\nin the file /var/log/system.log.\nAltough you can use it, I'd recommend to write to your own log file.\n", "Q: Mis-Matched messages from the Message app between two phones? We have two iPhones running iOS7, and they share an iCloud account, but have separate AppStore accounts.  Both phones are getting messages from the other phone.  Why would this be?  Is it something I can change, or would it be something more along the lines of the something that the phone company can fix?\n\nA: Under Settings > Messages > Send & Receive \nDo you have different accounts or are some of them shared ? \n", "Q: Spaces in Mavericks: apps do not remember their space I've switched to Mavericks and i wonder if the behaviour i'm seeing is a bug or a \"feature\".\nIt used to be that whenever you created spaces you could assign apps to a specific space, say Mail.app to space #2. In 10.8 that functionality was lost, but apps seem to 'remember' the space they were closed in. So if i opened Mail.app, dragged it to space #2, switched back to space #1 and open Mail.app again it would still open in space #2.\nUnfortunately this seems to be broken in Mavericks. If i try the same thing the app simply opens in the space where i'm currently in, so i need to drag the app to the correct space again. Very frustrating. \nDoes anyone know a solution to this problem or should i try to file it as a bug with Apple?\n\nA: Since Lion you assign app to a Desktop/space from the dock.\nDoing this, app will open in the designated space regardless of the space you actually are. \n\n\nA: I had the same problem and I think I solved it.\nWithin System Preferences goto Mission Control uncheck \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on their recent use\"\n\n\nA: Mavericks had an issue at one time where the Dock would mess up spaces.\nI used to use an Applescript, saved as an app, to relaunch it…\nquit application \"Dock\"\nThat's all it needs.\nTakes a few seconds to relaunch itself, then should behave again afterwards, til next time.\nOther things to try, if that's not the fix...\nMake sure you don't have 'Displays have separate Spaces' or 'Automatically rearrange…' checked in System Prefs > Mission Control\nThen  \n\n\n*\n\n*Go through all the apps that are not behaving…\n\n*Set their space to none & quit.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Switch to the 'correct' Space.  \n\n*Launch your app.\n\n*Set to 'This Space' again.\n\n", "Q: Can the Macbook's webcam be ON without LED indication? Was reading some topics online about hackers accessing user's webcams (on Windows) to spy on them etc, and I am now interested to know if I'm at any risk. \nTo make it simple, these are my questions :\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Safari allow websites to activate the webcam without my permission ?  \n\n*Can the webcam be activated without the LED being lit ? \n\n*Are there any known trojans that affect macs and leave them vulnerable for such hacks ?\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: This research paper reported by the Washington Post and Ars Technica says yes. \nThough it was only tested on \"old\" Macs (Late PPC, early Intel) \n\nA: \nCan Safari allow websites to activate the webcam without my permission\n  ?\n\nDon't worry about Safari enabling your webcam. The browser would have to use something like flash/plugin to request access.  You would be more susceptible to rogue installed apps for accessing the webcam.\nI believe Apple's own find my device can take photos of the user (if it is stolen). I recall seeing news about people taking photos of their thieves and reporting it to police.\n\nA: Any software that so chooses may ask you to initiate a FaceTime session. It cannot start one without your say-so.\nThe FaceTime cameras (like yours) cannot be active without the LCD on. \nThere aren't really any hacks that matter. \nThere are a number of really lame, goofy hacks in some web plugins (Flash), that could be used to access a Flash player that displays your camera's stream, for example, but you'd have to have the camera on, or accept a FaceTime session, or whatever. \n", "Q: Unable to conform activation I am trying to get our home devices supervised, starting with an iPhone 3GS running 6.1.3.\nI'm using a Mac OS X Server (iMac - OS X 10.9 and Server v3) and Apple Configurator 1.4.2.\nFirst step, Prepare. I turn on the supervision flag, accept the rest of the defaults and click go.\n6.1.3 is reinstalled on the iPhone fine, then AC errors out with, 'Cannot Conform Activation'.\nI tried multiple times, all with the same result. I do see a dialog on the iTunes-like window that appears about a Carrier upgrade, but AC has failed before I see that.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Turns out it was just something on Apple's side and the activation went through today!\n", "Q: Any suggestions for an ultra-lightweight spreadsheet-like application? Does anyone have a suggestion for an ultra-light spreadsheet application which is very fast and snappy?\nI do most of my deep analysis using advanced statistical programs and I manipulate small-to-medium sized text files using an editor like TextWrangler. However, I occasionally want to put small amounts of data, like from a csv file or cutting and pasting data from an HTML table, into a spreadsheet for some quick manipulation.\nUnder Windows I used to just fire up Excel, but the Mac version of excel is painfully sluggish for this task and Numbers or OpenOffice are not much better. Plus it takes forever for Open/Neo-Office to fire up, when all I want to is a very quick task.\nAre there any lightweight applications made for this task? No charting functionality, no advanced computational features, just a number grid with very simple calculations. Basically, the TextWrangler/Textastic equivalent of Word/Pages/NeoOffice but for grid data.\n\nA: Not sure if anything will ever beat Excel for Windows XP. \nBut I think Google Spreadsheets are a close second. Zippy enough without all the graphics and sluggishness of Numbers / Excel for Mac. \nThen again, it runs in your browser. \nHTH.\n"]
