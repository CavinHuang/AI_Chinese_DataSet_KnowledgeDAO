["Q: How to open an Excel workbook that ends with a specific string using Applescript I am new to Applescript and I am trying to open a xlsx file that ends like DK.xlsx. Tried using the following code, but it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong here? Please help.\nset sourcefilepath to \"Macintosh HD:Users:nprabu:Documents:Work:Project:Q1 2018:\"\n\nset sourcefile to name of every file of sourcefilepath whose name ends with \"DK.xlsx\"\n\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n\n    open workbook workbook file name sourcefile\n\nend tell\n\n\nA: Because you're new to AppleScript and because the script you gave had myriad rudimentary errors, this answer is quite long as I thought it appropriate to explain how to correct the script and why the errors arose in the first place.\nHowever, for the benefit of any readers for whom this would be TL;DR, here are two three versions of the script in their complete form, each differing in how file(s) are sought and the command sent to Excel in order to open it/them.\nDisclaimer:  I haven't been able to fully test the scripts, as I do not own a copy of Microsoft Excel.  I have formulated these snippets based on an online version of the AppleScript dictionary.  If you encounter any script errors, your feedback will help me correct them.\n① This version uses the open workbook command as per your original script, which only accepts a single file reference.  Therefore, the search conducted will return whichever single file it finds first with the appropriate filename ending.  Note: See below for why the Excel command might not work, and why I have provided a second version of the script should this be the case:\n    set sourcefilepath to \"Macintosh HD:Users:nprabu:Documents:Work:Project:Q1 2018:\"\n\n    try\n        tell application \"Finder\" to set sourcefile to ¬\n            (the first file in the folder sourcefilepath whose ¬\n                name ends with \"DK.xlsx\") as text\n    on error\n        return display notification ¬\n            \"No filenames ending in \\\"DK.xlsx\\\"\" with title \"File Not Found\"\n    end try\n\n    tell application \"Microsoft Excel\" to ¬\n        open workbook workbook file name sourcefile\n\n② This version uses the standard open command that accepts one or more file or alias objects.  Use this version if you need to open multiple files easily or the above version of the script fails to open the file:\n    set sourcefilepath to \"Macintosh HD:Users:nprabu:Documents:Work:Project:Q1 2018:\"\n\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set sourcefiles to ¬\n        (every file in the folder sourcefilepath whose ¬\n            name ends with \"DK.xlsx\") as alias list\n\n    if sourcefiles is {} then return display notification ¬\n        \"No filenames ending in \\\"DK.xlsx\\\"\" with title \"File Not Found\"\n\n    tell application \"Microsoft Excel\" to open the sourcefiles\n\n③ Addendum: Emergency Script:\nThanks to @user3439894 for testing these scripts and reporting some odd behaviour from Microsoft Excel regarding how it responds to the standard open command (see the comments thread attached to this answer).\nEssentially, it behaves as expected if Excel is not already running, and will open multiple files (in the background).  However, if Excel is already open, it will only open one file out of a given file list, and the one it chooses to open is seemingly random.\nTherefore, I'm adding this third version of the script as a less graceful approach to opening multiple files, but one that will surely cope with Excel's personality issues:\n    set sourcefilepath to \"Macintosh HD:Users:nprabu:Documents:Work:Project:Q1 2018:\"\n\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set sourcefiles to ¬\n        (every file in the folder sourcefilepath whose ¬\n            name ends with \"DK.xlsx\") as alias list\n\n    if sourcefiles is {} then return display notification ¬\n        \"No filenames ending in \\\"DK.xlsx\\\"\" with title \"File Not Found\"\n\n    tell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n        activate -- Bring Excel into focus\n\n        -- This loops through the list of files and\n        -- opens them one at a time\n        repeat with sourcefile in sourcefiles\n            open the sourcefile\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n\nYou can, of course, try and replace open the sourcefile with open workbook workbook file name (sourcefile as text), should that command be working in your version, but otherwise you'll be fine just using open. \n\nA Detailed Breakdown\nRetrieving your file(s)\nThe first few errors in your original script arise from this line:\nset sourcefile to name of every file of sourcefilepath ¬\n    whose name ends with \"DK.xlsx\"\n\n(I have split the code over two lines for readability; this doesn't affect how AppleScript executes the commands.)\n▸ Firstly, this command needs to be sent to an application that can handle file and folder objects.  The two options you have are Finder and System Events.  Finder is suitable and most commonly used for file commands.  To send a command to Finder, you simply add a tell clause at the start of the line:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set sourcefile to ¬\n    name of every file of folder sourcefilepath ¬\n    whose name ends with \"DK.xlsx\"\n\nYou also need to specify that sourcefilepath is a folder object, which I've done by adding the object specifier folder in front of the variable.\n▸ Your question as it is stated, together with your choice of AppleScript variable name, implies you are wanting a single file to be opened.  However, the command we've just been looking at tells Finder to get every file, which will always return a list of items (although it may be a list containing only one item), rather than a single item.  If there are multiple files whose names end with \"DK.xlsx\", then all of them will be returned in this list.  This will cause problems when it comes to opening the files using Excel's open workbook command, which can only handle one file per command statement.\nIf you are reasonably sure there's only one filename that ends in \"DK.xlsx\", then you can change every to first:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set sourcefile to ¬\n    the name of the first file of folder sourcefilepath ¬\n    whose name ends with \"DK.xlsx\"\n\n(I prefixed some terms with the to make it more readable; AppleScript happily copes with or without the being present.)\nThe other consideration is that open workbook requires that the full path to the file be specified.  However, by requesting that Finder returns just the name of the file(s), you will only be given the filenames without the path.  In order to retrieve the full path, remove the request for the file's name property and instead retrieve the file object, which you can then coerce into text:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set sourcefile to ¬\n    (the first file of folder sourcefilepath ¬\n    whose name ends with \"DK.xlsx\") as text\n\n▸ If it turns out that you do, indeed, wish to retrieve multiple files that end in the suffix \"DK\", then its best to coerce the list of file objects into an alias list (which is a list of aliases).  This is so we can use the standard open command instead of open workbook, as the former can accept a list of multiple file aliases, enabling you to open many files with one single command.\ntell application \"Finder\" to set sourcefile to ¬\n    (every file of folder sourcefilepath ¬\n    whose name ends with \"DK.xlsx\") as alias list\n\nOpening the file(s) in Excel\nYou didn't mention which version of Microsoft Excel you're using, which may turn out to be pertinent information.  This forum question from 2009 is from a user who reports running into trouble when using the open workbook command.\n▸ BUT...  Let's assume for now that the command will work with your version, and that you only wish to open a single file.  The syntax as you've got it is all correct, and the adjustment I mentioned above to retrieve the full file path will prevent the open workbook command from throwing an error because of a bad file reference.  One stylistic note: you can write the tell statement and the open workbook command on a single line, then delete the end tell line:\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\" to open workbook workbook file name sourcefile\n\nNo one form is better than the other, so it's personal choice.\n▸ The forum post I mentioned above that reported a malfunctioning open workbook command also cited the same problem when using the standard open command.  However, this Stack Overflow post provides the likely cause, and reassures me that this open command will work where the open workbook command may not.\nBasically, in the same way that the Finder application needs a folder object to be specified explicitly as being a folder, Excel needs the file object to be specified explicitly as being a file (or alias):\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\" to open file sourcefile\n\n▸ The benefit of this open command is that it can accept lists of aliases to open many files at once.  Therefore, if you decide to keep the version of the Finder command that retrieves multiple files, make sure you coerce it to an alias list, which you can then use like so:\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\" to open sourcefile\n\nNote here that the file object specifier is absent when opening multiple files, because the variable sourcefile is already of the correct type, namely alias list.\nClosing comments\nThe final versions of the script I supplied at the beginning are slightly different in how I chose to implement the changes I've detailed here.  I also felt it wise to include some basic error-handling in case a file could not be found, which would throw an error and might lead you to wonder if the code was faulty.\nIf you find that the file successfully opens in Excel, but that it remains in the background concealed behind other applications, you can add this command to the script to bring Excel into the foreground and make it the focussed application:\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\" to activate\n\nor—combining it with the existing Excel commands:\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n    activate\n    open file sourcefile\nend tell\n\n\nIf you need any of this clarified or if you have any further minor questions relating to this, leave a comment and I'll get back to you.  If you find this helpful or if it solves your problem, do consider selecting this answer or any other that proves more useful so other forum visitors know this issue has been addressed and can benefit from it if they have a similar problem.\n", "Q: How to configure \"DiskImageMounter\" like in /etc/fstab? Today I wanted to check the /etc/fstab on macOS and found that there is no /etc/fstab anymore. Ok, maybe its a long time since I've used it on OS X but i was always sure that the OS X had not too many differences from \"UNIX\" (since it is supposed that macOS (High Sierra) is indeed a UNIX). \nBut i had to realize that there is no possibility to admin or configure the fstab anymore. Now, there is an executable called \"DiskImageMounter\" living in /System/Library/CoreServices/DiskImageMounter.app/Contents/MacOS/ which seems to do the disk administration. \nBut how we can configure it like with a \"normal\" Unix like with /etc/fstab? Is it possible?\n\nA: You are correct. There is no /etc/fstab file, but the use of the /etc/fstab file by macOS has not be removed. You just have to create this file yourself.\nAn example of a possible lines in the /etc/fstab file are given below.\nUUID=F21AD81B-B114-456C-B2A0-BF4452E4842D none apfs rw,noauto\nLABEL=Macintosh\\040HD none apfs rw,noauto\n\nA description for the fields can be found by entering the command man fstab.\nYou may want to refer to this question: How to prevent auto mounting of a volume in macOS High Sierra?\nWhen using ls -l /etc/fstab to determine ownership and permissions, you should get the same as shown below.\n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  123 Dec 31 08:48 /etc/fstab\n\nUPDATE (provided by iggie)\nA modification of this answer can be used for ssh keys on an external FAT or ExFAT drive (e.g. mounted via VeraCrypt or whatever). Add the following line to your /etc/fstab file, even if it doesn't exist: \nLABEL=PRIVATE none msdos -u=501,-m=700\n\nThis assumes your user ID is 501 (try ls -n ~) and the label on your FAT or ExFAT volume is PRIVATE. \n", "Q: High Sierra: WindowManager and kernel_task - Now you see it, now you don't! I have long had issues with both Window Manager and kernel_task taking up seemingly inordinate amounts of resources on my systems going back in the OS release cycle for as long as I can remember, but since I had my MacBook Pro 13\" i7 back from the shop with a new SSD, screen, and battery, I did a restore from TM and updated it to 10.13.3 and I actually don't even see either WindowManager nor kernel_task running at all! I will add the this machine has performed better than it ever has, this is likely attributed that to the fact that its puffy batteries were replaced. Who knows what impact those things were having besides warping the chassis.\nAs I mentioned in another post, on my i7 Mini, suddenly had performance issues while running Sierra for a machine that hitherto been a wonderful machine for the 5 years she's been running without hardly ever a beachball. Honestly, it's been faster than even the newer MacBook Pro 15\" 2015 I was issued at work- even though its still the 2012 version. (It was the highest end CPU chipset available - 2.3 GHz - and I maxed out RAM to 16 GB and swapped in a fast SSD with a dual disk kit so it was even at baseline a fantastic machine for the price.)\nUnfortunately, as I reported in that other post, it suddenly started suffering from the notorious kernel bloat issue where those familiar processes became the machine's sole purpose as they were generally up top of the proc table as I have seen it on many other troubled Macs in the past. I was downright emotional about it and I received some great suggestions as to how I might resolve it, but since the machine had been upgraded so many times (it literally has not gotten a fresh install since Mountain Lion, yet no performance issues until just now, oddly) I opted for a full install. It was due. I had my installation checklist well defined along with settings (I just need to Automate it next!) so the mini is now running on what is effectively a fresh install of High Sierra. While right off performance is so much better, once I installed Chrome and it synced up with my Google account, crazy things happened and I am now picking its mess off so I can start fresh. Dunno if its an bad extension or what, but its a sloppy mess.\nThe bigger mystery is that I still see WindowManager now kernel_task near the top of my process table frequently, and though my machine is not limping like it was before, the mystery continues: why are they not even visible on my rebuilt MBP? Is there something hiding those processes when in fact they really are running? It doesn't seem like it as resource usage remains very low. The fact both machines are running the same version of High Sierra I simply don't get how they could be so different. They have practically flip-flopped in their behavior. Even without Chrome my mini gets slammed by the evil duo (WindowManager nor kernel_task) like by Safari. It's a mess!\nSigned,\nConfused in California\n\nA: No, there's nothing specifically hiding those processes in Activity Monitor or top.\nIf you're using Activity Monitor, make sure that on both machines you select the menu View and then \"All processes\". If you select only to your own processes, you won't be seeing for example kernel_task anymore.\n\nA: Just so there is some answer here that isn’t a divertissement (and thanks for the suggestions, commenters) I found that by turning off ALL of my extensions resolved the issue(s) so whatever data/code that is polluting Chrome is within an extension. Also, reinstalling extensions doesn’t resolve it either, which probably means there is something broken not in the extension install code, but something it writes locally, which I need to take up with the extension creator once I have isolated which one is the offender. I have turned on the two I need most (LastPass and XMarks) and so far so good, but now that I have located a page that loads “funny” consistently with all extensions on, I am about to try each of the extensions one at a time until I find which one breaks that site. When I do, I’ll take it to that specific vendor if I cannot isolate its prefs.\nI posted this because this process (as it has many variants) is kind of a core skill in troubleshooting Chrome extension issues, both local and across installations that share a common Google profile) and can used by anyone experiencing Chrome “inckiness” that is traceable to a misbehaving extension. I will post my findings in a comment as the specifics of my actual findings are ancillary to this point, as the meat is in the how. Thanks.\n\nA: I tried all kinds of things for months to stop a crazy amount of CPU usage from Kernel_task. The solution that finally worked for me was clearing the system/app cache. I moved all the files/folders to another folder and rebooted. \nhttps://macpaw.com/how-to/clear-cache-on-mac\nHope it helps someone else.\n", "Q: Mad Catz RAT 3 Mouse Drivers/Software Does anyone happen to know where I can get the RAT3 drivers?\nI have a 2015 MBP.\nCurrently my Mac will not do any hovering of the mouse and I think it may be due to the lack of drivers for the mouse.\nThe Mad Catz site does not have any downloads anymore.\n\nA: I have a Mad Catz RAT MMO7 mouse and it works fine without any drivers with OS X 10.11 as a regular mouse.

I've had my MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) for over a year and I've never had any problems with charging until now.

I can use this same port to charge my phone, but when I try to charge my MacBook with it, it just does nothing.

So I will share the solution I've been using for half a year or so.\nI personally use Neat Download Manager. Be sure to install the related extension and look through the settings. This approach completely bypasses the Google Download manager and offers the bonus benefit of accelerated parallel downloads and resumability (if the file host supports it).\nThere are a few situations where downloads will not work with the Neat Download manager, in this case a tip for you, hold the delete key as you click a download button in the browser, and the download will commence via the browser's built-in download manager.\nCons: It's not a beautiful download manager.

In display preferences this is what I see picture. I have attempted to daisy chain both monitors together then doing a single DP connection to the dock but it didn't work. I have also tried pressing the detect monitors button in the display preferences but it has not worked.  \n\nA: What you ask is simply not possible with that hardware.\nDue to the way the signal must be demultiplexed, you will need a Thunderbolt 3 dock instead of a USB-C dock to be able to drive the two external displays with separate content.\nAlternatively you can connect one of the monitors directly to the MacBook Pro using a standard USB-C to DisplayPort cable.\n\nA: Unlike what jksoegaard says, in my experience, running dual screens of a single USB-C works fine depending on the dock. Both the Lenovo USB-C dock and the Dell D6000 both support running dual 1920x1080 displays. The Dell D6000 will even support 1440p monitors.

I recently purchased a 2012 Mac Mini and am attempting to max out my dual monitor setup.\nCurrently, I connect my Mac to a Dell S2417DG's HDMI 1.4 in via this passive mini DP to HDMI 1.4 cable. According to the specifications, 1440p should be possible, yet macOS only offers a 1080p maximum in System Preferences > Displays.\nAfter some exploration, I found and applied this patch, which made a 2560 x 1440 resolution available in Displays. Enabling this resolution, however, doesn't work, and the monitor indicates that there is no longer an input signal. I have also tried setting up 1440p via SwitchResX and verified that all timings are correct according to the monitor manual, but when I apply the custom resolution, the display stays in 1080p mode.\nIs it possible to achieve 1440p via mDP -> HDMI on a 2012 Mac Mini?\nI am running High Sierra (10.13.3).\nI am aware that a working solution would be to use mDP -> DisplayPort, but my gaming PC takes up the DP slot for 1440p@165hz.\n\nA: As I suspected and as Allan suggested in the comments, I needed an active adapter. This cable, which is the active version of the passive cable I originally purchased, did the trick; I now have 1440p via mDP -> HDMI.\n\nA: You don't need to have a special set up. Make sure your monitor is 1440p and with display port input, it will work automatic. I have a Benq GW2765 1440p connect to my 2012 Mac mini through display port. It work perfectly. mDP to HDMI will not work. I have tried one that claim can support 4K which still stay in 1080p only.\n\nA: I just got my Mini Display Port to Display Port cable and my LG monitor is displaying 1440p at 60hz from my Late 2012 Mac Mini. None other combination worked.\nI just use the mac for browsing, email and to watch Netflix (now 4K).\nIt took a while to find this thread and finally make it work.

What I mean by that is the Windows key + Arrow keys functionality for moving windows around, halfing windows on screen, moving across monitors, minimizing, maximizing, just with those two keys. \nI enjoy using macOS on my MacBook on 1 screen with space swiping, but once I use multiple monitors it becomes really cumbersome to use. Tools like BetterTouchTool help but don't offer the ease the native Windows 10 window management offers.\nIs there something inherently different with macOS that we can't get Windows 10-like window management?\n\nA: There is nothing specific in macOS which prevents control of windows through the keyboard, it's just not provided out of the box.\nKeyboard Maestro for instance provides several actions which allow to control windows via the keyboard (or other triggers):\n\nI use this to put windows to the left (or right) half of the screen by pressing CtrlCmdLeft:\n\n", "Q: control fan speed using Applescript (or terminal) I would like to control the fan speed using terminal, if possible without third party app.\nThe idea is to automate and schedule different fan speed.\n\nA: macOS does not support user control of the fan speed.\nsmcFanControl\nThe open source project smcFanControl claims to offer fan speed control.

With Final Cut Pro in its test version come several codecs that might provide a solution. But Final Cut Pro is not any more compatible with Mavericks. \nAny hints how to capture the pre-compressed stream from the camera instead of the raw material?\n\nA: This is a partial answer, but from what I recall the C920 doesn't stream in H264 by default. I think it defaults to MJPEG (which would explain the blurriness), the 3rd option being YUV.\nIf you follow this thread, you'll see that I had to change the streaming mode using v4l2ctl (in Linux) to obtain a H264 stream. Assuming you've got a Linux computer somewhere: \n#this sets the C920 cam to H264 encoding, framerate 30/1:\nv4l2-ctl --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1080,pixelformat=1 \n\nHopefully, the configuration remains after unplugging the webcam, allowing you to use it on OSX...\nIf you're interested in a less \"native\" solution than QuickTime, the rest of the thread describes how to use gstreamer, either by rtp streaming or local capture. I didn't try it on OSX but you can try replacing v4l2src by osxvideosrc:\ngst-launch-1.0 -vvv osxvideosrc \\\n! video/x-h264, width=1920, height=1080, framerate=30/1 \\\n! queue max-size-buffers=1 \\\n! matroskamux \\\n! filesink location=/tmp/video.mkv\n\n... which should give you a Matroska file.\n\nA: In Quicktime on Mac, the \"maximum\" and \"high\" settings refer to the encoding used in the recorded file and don't necessarily correlate with the codec coming out from the camera. I'm not sure if macOS supports UVC 1.5 H.264 at all, so it'd be receiving MJPEG or YUV and converting to H264 or ProRes depending upon your setting.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse 1 and Bluetooth 4.0 I am considering adding a Bluetooth 4.0 dongle to my 2011 Mac (to enable Airdrop). Will my Magic Mouse 1 still work?\n\nA: Yes, the Magic Mouse 1 works with standard Bluetooth 4.0.\nBluetooth is generally backwards compatible so that older devices keep working with new Bluetooth hosts (either built-in to computers or in dongle form), although newer devices generally are not guaranteed to work with older Bluetooth hosts.\nThe Magic Mouse 1 requires your Mac to be running at least Mac OS X 10.5.81, which you would already be running if your mouse is working before adding the dongle. Any 2011 Mac is capable of running 10.5.8 or later, so you will face no problems there.\n", "Q: Require username+password after sleep/lock I want a command to force password input after sleep or manual lock with ControlCommandQ in High Sierra, as opposed to allowing TouchID alone to unlock the laptop. \nHow?\nUse case:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can be forced to supply your biometrics, but you can't be forced to supply your knowledge of a password, until mind-reading is a thing. Hence; when traveling, knowing that other people want to read/copy data contained on travelers' laptops, I want to secure my laptop by forcing authentication with username+password, as opposed to username+fingerprint.\n\n\nLike for iOS 11 but for macOS.\nGoal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable TouchID every time I want to force a password-based unlock, until the next time the laptop has been successfully unlocked.\n\n\nFacts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can lock the laptop and sign in with password if I click the avatar\n\n*I can lock the laptop and unlock it with my fingerprint if I touch the Touch Id sensor.\n\n*I have no way to force password on sign-in. That is what this question is about.\n\n\nDiscourse:\nThere are two concepts in play here. What principal is trying to log in and what credentials versus identification that principal supplies. The principal in the above use-case is always myself, but TouchId does away with the secret part of the credential, and makes it so that authentication is successful by merely supplying a username—the fingerprint. In the triad, \"something you have, something you know, something you are\", it has replaced the \"something you know\" with \"something you are\". In the above threat-model, it has lessened security, because \"what you are\" is never possible for you to withhold.\nFurthermore; because fingerprints are available on your phone, on the surface of your laptop, on your wallet, etc, I don't even \"have to be\", for the laptop to open, because they can be stolen or faked.\nThey are a fairly strongly identifying (one to two in a hundred people could share the same hash of the fingerprint); but they are not strongly authenticating. I want strong authentication using a secret (\"what I know\"), to be possible. That is what I'm asking for.\nI hope this removes any doubts about what this question is asking.\nNotes:\n\nYou can't input commands after your computer is locked.\n\nSure I can; normally cabled ethernet is trusted: https://github.com/lgandx/Responder https://room362.com/post/2016/snagging-creds-from-locked-machines/ or a while back, now fixed: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207423\n\n...if you could it would lessen security...\n\nNot if the command can only strengthen security.\nBesides, this is not what I'm asking about, I'm after a command for \"strong lock machine\", to enforce password-based authentication after sleep/lock/hibernate.\n\nThis is a duplicate post\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nTyping is less secure since it can be observed and replicated\n\nThat is true for other threat modelling scenarios than I have as my use case. However, enabling 2FA (e.g. TouchId + password) for the laptop is a valid solution to this question, if it's possible.\n\nA: *\n\n*After locking your laptop with Command+Control+Q, touch (don't depress) the Touch Id sensor five times with the wrong finger. Now Touch Id is temporarily disabled until you input your password.\n\n*Reboot the machine; now you must input your password.\n\n", "Q: How to switch focus to the app based on its PID from CLI?

I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Taking power lead out for 15 seconds, putting back in, waiting for 5\nseconds, then pressing power (doesn't work)\n\n*Removing all RAM from the system, won't boot\n\n*Tried 3 different sockets in the house \n\n*Tried 2 different power leads\n\n\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: Ended up having the PSU replaced, but the issue still presented itself (wouldn't boot). Fixed in the end by replacing the motherboard.\n", "Q: How to link notes in macOS Notes application? Is it possible to link to another notes in macOS Notes Application?

The problem I am facing is that I can neither partition nor erase the Disk. The disk is empty and there is not partition created. I can also not find a volume. It is also impossible to initialised the disk or perform any action on disk utility.\nAny help is highly appreciated.\n$ diskutil list\n...\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n  #:          TYPE NAME             SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n  0:                               *16.0 GB    disk2\n\n\n\n\nA: Did you try erasing your disk with diskutil? You can do that via this command (assuming your disk is still disk2):\ndiskutil eraseDisk FAT32 NAME MBR disk2\n\nHere is an explanation of the command:\ndiskutil: This is a disk management tool provided by Apple.\neraseDisk: Tells diskutil to erase a disk\nFAT32: The filesystem format you want to use. You can replace it with any other filesystem, such as JHFS+ or FAT16\nNAME: The name of the newly erased disk's new partition\nMBR: Partitioning table to use.

One way to confirm this would be to put the hard drive in an external drive enclosure and then attempt erasing it as an external drive. If it works, then you know the problem is not with the drive but with the cable. \nIf you don't have an enclosure to use the drive as an external drive you may be able to diagnose the issue by reseating the hard drive connection and putting electrical tape between the cable and metal computer parts it is touching. After reading tips suggesting this could solve the problem, I attempted this on a 13\" MacBook Pro Mid 2010 experiencing the same error you described--and it temporarily fixed the problem for me. The symptoms started back up soon after so I still had to replace the cable, but it helped me diagnose the issue. \nNote: Be sure to check warranty conditions before opening and working on a laptop yourself as doing so may void any warranty it is under. \n\nA: I also got the exact same error when using my Samsung Portable SSD T5, I was able to fix with this macOS Monterey 12.4 by unchecking Put hard disks to sleep when possible.\n\nOnce I've unchecked it, I was able to partition my Disk and use it.\n\n", "Q: Unable to convert certain keywords in record to JSON I am using JSON Helper to convert record to JSON.

If I were to use a portable ssd as the bootcamp partition, would I be able to use it on different mac computers?\n\nA: No, that will not work.\n\n\n*\n\n*The windows drivers most likely will not be the same between Macs.\n\n*Windows will know you have changed computers and will not boot.\n\n\nAlso, have you investigated just how must effort is involved in installing Windows on an external drive? You can not use the normal Windows installer. You have to install Windows from the command line.\nI suppose you could manually install all the drivers you would need for all the Macs you wish to boot from. Then you could run SysPrep to generalize before switching Macs, but this was not what Microsoft intended. Also, which Mac do you intent to be connected to when you Active the software? \nWindows does have a feature called Windows to Go, that can be used between computers, but I believe you will not have access to each computers internal drives. I also believe you need special hardware which comes at a premium price.\nIf you are still determined to try, then please report back your results.\nIf you get stuck at some point, please let me know. I might know how to proceed.\nThis is my answer to the question Is it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?. Of course, there are also many other opinions on how to succeed.\nBelow is some information on the Boot Camp Support Software.\nSome the the websites are: Download Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5769, Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5640, Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621 and Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033. Those are for the older Macs. For the newer Macs, you can only download the Boot Camp Support Software by using the Boot Camp Assistant application. If you have to, you can use the Windows 7,  8 or 8.1 drivers to install Windows 10.\nEach Mac is assigned only one unique Boot Camp Support Software package. When installing Windows, only the required drivers are installed. No Boot Camp Support Software package is an replacement or upgrade from any previous package. \nUpdates for the Boot Camp Support Software is delivered by either Windows Update or by Apple Software Update. These updates will download after you have installed Windows.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Late 2011 13\" Dual Monitors I have two external monitors (both are Sanyo TVs). My Macbook Pro has one Thunderbolt. I purchased a Mini DisplayPort to Dual HDMI Adapter. The adapter is connected to the Mini Display port and to a USB. I have two HDMI cables, each connected to their own HDMI port in the adapter.

I have recently had some problems charging my iPhone 7 from my 2013 Macbook Air. For a while, the phone would only charge if I had the lightning cable turned a certain way, otherwise it would do that incredibly annoying connecting/disconnecting thing. It now refuses to charge at all when connected to the laptop. The strange thing is - my laptop charges my portable phone charger fine (suggesting the laptop port isn't the issue) and the phone charger works with my iPhone fine (suggesting the phone isn't the issue either). And I have tested 2 different cables (one new, one is an apple with no signs of wear and tear) and both work with other devices. \nI have, previously (March last year) had some issues with the headphone port requiring the following repair. I am wondering if the two could be correlated, if there is any \"easy\" fix or if I should just take it into Apple.\nThe problem description/diagnosis from last time: \nIssue: Machine fans get loud and no sound from machine\nSteps to Reproduce: observed the issue, Performed visual mechanical inspection, ran Mac Resource Inspector and noted machine had a thermal sensor warning\nProposed Resolution: Replace I/O flex and test. If unsuccessful replace I/O board. Run ASD/EFI & OS as post repair testing and ensure there is sound in users operating issues \n\nA: Could that be that portable phone charger simply takes less power to charge while iPhone requires more? \nBy the way, with iPhone not charging is it all the same for all USB hubs on your MB? And is it recognised at all by the laptop?\n\nA: Needing h/w board replacement doesn't sound good, but it's probably a red herring.  The thing to check is the state of your laptop when you are trying to charge your phone.  Firstly, a laptop USB port is going to supply less power than your wall adapter that came with the phone.  A computer USB port is not really intended to be used as a charger, so my first preference would be to use the wall adapter.\nSecond, the state of your laptop might matter.  If it's asleep, but not plugged in, you might have an energy saver setting on that would reduce or block the power to the USB port.  I would check with Apple support to see if they really expect you to charge your phone from a laptop that's not plugged in itself.\n", "Q: Can't activate iMessage or FaceTime on any device I can't activate iMessage or FaceTime on any Apple device. It keeps saying that it could not be activated and I should try again later. I'm on the latest version of macOS and iOS and the date and time are set automatically on both devices. I have no phone number linked to the Apple ID so it has nothing to do with a carrier, etc.\n\nA: First, make sure iMessage is turned on:  To check if iMessage is turned on for your device, go to Settings > Messages > iMessage.\nThen, are you sure your WIFI or cellular connection is strong enough. It does involve your carrier if you're trying to message without WIFI.  Also, I've had issues if I'm not logged with my Apple ID, although I haven't seen that it's actually required.  \nI see below that you have tried rebooting.  Perhaps we should have asked which device are you trying this on?  I assumed an Apple iPhone, but are you talking about your desktop or laptop computer?  I was also going to suggest totally turning the iPhone off; maybe after also shutting down iCloud and trying to start over from totally off.  My next step would be to do this on both devices you are trying to iMessage between.  Obviously you are not trying to iMessage yourself, but getting it working between your desktop and your smartphone would be a good test environment.\n\nA: With these kind of issues it can help to not only turn it off, but entirely log out of iMessage and FaceTime from the device, reboot and try to log in again from fresh.\n", "Q: Does Microsoft Office 2011 work in High Sierra? Does anyone know if MS Office 2011 works in High Sierra?  I'd like to upgrade, but I'm on a deadline and I can't spend a lot of time upgrading right now.  Plus, I really detest \"subscription\" software which apparently is the way Microsoft is going.\n\nA: I have Microsoft Office 2011 installed on 2011 and 2013 iMacs. Both Macs have been upgraded to High Sierra (macOS 10.13.3). I have not noticed any problems. The update shown in the image below is available from Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 14.7.7 Update. The publish date for this update was 9/7/2017, making this is a fairly current update.\n\n\nA: \"Deadline\" and \"upgrade\" should be mutually exclusive concepts and not procrastinatory temptations.\nMS Office 2011 does not work on macOS 10.13 High Sierra, officially.  Microsoft has already ended all support for this package and wants you to switch.\n\nMicrosoft has announced in a support document that Office for Mac 2011 will not be supported under macOS 10.13 High Sierra. It doesn’t go as far as to say the software will not work, but hints at this.\n\nWord, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Lync have not been tested on macOS 10.13 High Sierra, and no formal support for this configuration will be provided.\n\n\nHowever, there are options, first:\nDoes Office 2011 work on macOS 10.13 High Sierra? Yes\nand of course friendlier alternatives like LibreOffice, complicated constructions including virtual machines and with Windows or macOS etc.\nAll fair game and nice to play with.\nBut then there is this dreadful word again: \"deadline\".\n\nA: I discovered the following two functions in MS Word 2011 disabled after my Mac is upgraded to High Sierra: Mathtype, and Cut-and-Paste.  \n\nA: I find that the fonts corrupt regularly for reasons unknown and I need a reboot to force a font cache update -- any other attempt to update the fonts cache does not work for me.  If we ignore this issue it works.  I am using word 14.7.7 on the latest MacOS 10.13.3\n", "Q: How can I copy RAW photos with metadata from Mac Photos app to an external hard drive? When I travel I want to be able to back up my RAW photos with metadata to an external hard drive, and then later import them on to my iMac. (For whatever reason, photos on my MacBook don't always upload to iCloud, despite being on the same account as the iCloud.). If I export originals, the metadata must go in an XMP sidecar. Mac Photos does not want to import that sidecar.  When I tested it, once the metadata didn't go with it, but once it did.  I may have done something wrong the first time.  When I imported into Lightroom CC, the metadata seemed to go along.  I am not sure it's all going with the photo. Can I rely on being able to access the metadata with the RAW photo?  Thank you.   \n\nA: Use the Disk Utility application to create a sparse bundle on you external drive. You can then mount this as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume for storage of your RAW photos. The metadata will then stay with your RAW photos. If needed, you can even use the Disk Utility application to increase or decrease the size of the sparse bundle image.\nInstructions to create the sparse bundle are as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Disk Utility application.\n\n*From the menu bar, select File->New Image->Blank Image....\n\n*Input your requirements in the window. Below is an example. The size is the maximum size that the sparse bundle can grow to be. Initially, this example sparse bundle only takes 247.1 MB of space on the external MS-DOS (FAT) formatted volume named MYFAT.\n\n*Select the Save button.\n\nNote: A sparse bundle is a folder containing many small files.\n\n\nInstructions to resize the sparse bundle are as follows.\n\nNote: You will need to eject the sparse bundle before resizing.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Disk Utility application.\n\n*From the menu bar, select Images->Resize...\n\n*Select the sparse bundle folder. I my case this would be named My RAW Pics.sparsebundle.\n\n*Enter a new size. In my case, I chose to double the maximum size to 200 GB, as shown below.\n\n*Select the Resize button.\n\n\n\nA final note regarding the use of other image files.\nYou can also create a image as a dmg file. The difference here is that volume size is limited by the maximum file size of the format used by your external drive. Also, dmg file occupies space on your external drive equal to the size of the stored Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume. A sparse bundle grows to occupy space on the external drive as needed.\nYou can also create a sparse image file. Like a dmg file, a sparse image file volume size is limited by the maximum file size of the format used by your external drive. Like a sparse bundle, a sparse image grows to occupy space on the external drive as needed. Again, a sparse file image is a single file, where as a sparse bundle image is a folder containing many small files.\n", "Q: Include backspace key in custom keyboard shortcut I want to make the keyboard shortcut for a Service I made ⌃⌥⌫ (Ctrl+Opt+Backspace); however, System Preferences doesn't let me do this. Is there a way I can include the key manually?\n\nA: This isn't possible as this keyboard short cut is used as part of the operating system to perform backward word delete, this is where it deletes all the characters from the cursor position to the start of the current word, this is a part of macOS so it is likely protected.\n", "Q: How to stop iOS \"update from beta\" notifications? How can I stop receiving notifications telling me to update from the iOS 11 beta? I don’t have enough storage to update and I really don’t want to completely reset my phone either.\n\n\nA: Having been bothered by similar notifications, I found that the best way to suppress these was to simply turn off Automatic Updates - which are typically enabled by default.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Go to iTunes & App Stores\n\n*Toggle Automatic Downloads to Off.\n\n\nBackground\nI would suspect any Beta updates to be no good fit for long-term use as they are often a little buggy and intended for temporary use/evaluation only. Then there is the whole security side of things (which I won't get into now). If you are after a little more reading, try this article which explains how to suppress updates in greater detail - I wouldn't be surprised if beta versions aren't handled a little more forcefully than the regular iOS releases.\nResetting your iOS device may be the best option yet. If it is applicable to your situation, go for it.\nLet me know how you get on, what worked, what didn't? I'd be interested to follow up with you on this.\n\nA: Why don't you just back up to iTunes to have the local back up copy of the iPhone and restore using it. This way you won't have to manually upload your photos or save any application data. With iTunes it's pretty straightforward and safe. \n", "Q: How to revert launchctl PATH to defaults? There are many questions and commentary about using launchctl setenv PATH /path/to/include in order to have GUI apps inherit user-specified paths. I did this about four years ago, and the changes I added have persisted to 10.11.6 (current OS). Unfortunately for me, I have long forgotten these settings until recently...\nNone of the man pages or commentary indicates how to revert these changes to factory defaults. For instance, running launchctl getenv PATH yields:\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/opt/libpcap/bin:/usr/local/opt/e2fsprogs/sbin:/usr/local/opt/e2fsprogs/bin:/usr/local/opt/flex/bin:/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:/usr/local/opt/qt/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/2.1/Programs:/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS\nRunning launchctl setenv PATH [blank] is evidently an error, demanding a non-blank value. I'm also hesitant to experiment with this much because I don't know whether there is a macOS default setting for this key-value pair.\nCan someone please tell me how I can flush the current contents of launchctl getenv PATH or to return its content to what would appear in a fresh install? I would rather not replace what's currently there with the default paths from /etc/profile and the like, unless those are the self-same values that appear when running launchctl getenv PATH on a fresh installation.\nEdit\nRunning launchctl unsetenv PATH did clear out the variable, but it did not persist after reboot - i.e., the same path values returned after a restart.\n\nA: What ended up working to restore to default \"factory presets\" for me was to run:\nsudo launchctl config user path /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nThis is not unlike the advice seen here (Set PATH variable so that it is detected in all applications, even outside terminal. (El Captain)). But some lingering questions remain:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does this procedure restore what was already in the key-value pair of user path, or does it enact a new setting that would otherwise be empty?\n\n*Where, i.e., in what file or database, is this key-value stored?\n\n", "Q: Setting JAVA_HOME not working in Sierra I have following versions of Java:\n$ /usr/libexec/java_home -V\nMatching Java Virtual Machines (4):\n    9.0.1, x86_64:  \"Java SE 9.0.1\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-9.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.8.0_131, x86_64:  \"Java SE 8\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_131.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.8.0_121, x86_64:  \"Java SE 8\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.7.0_80, x86_64:   \"Java SE 7\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home\n\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-9.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home\n\nThen I want to set Java version to 1.7:\n$ JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home\n$ echo $JAVA_HOME\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home\n\nSeems OK, but:\n$ java -version\njava version \"9.0.1\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 9.0.1+11)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 9.0.1+11, mixed mode)\n\nWhy?\n\nA: To set JAVA_HOME, you should use\nexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v \"1.7*\"`\n\nor\nexport JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home\n\ncurrently you  did not use export on the variable.

When playing music on iTunes or similar and then locking the screen (accomplished by hitting the ⌃⌘Q key combination or selecting \"Lock Screen\" from the  menu), how do I prevent the media keys from functioning? \nIn particular, the play, skip, and pause buttons are still functional at this point. This is problematic because I tend to lock my screen in order to prevent my cat from wreaking havoc on my laptop when she steps on the keys -- but she's still able to mess up my music via the above, usually…\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not exactly the answer you were looking for but you can switch the keyboard media keys over so they act as function keys by default.\nHowever this does mean you have to press the fn (function) key to use the media keys in normal use...\nYou can do this in System Preferences...\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Navigate to Keyboard\n\n*Check the option Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys.\nI would be very impressed if the cat managed to press fn + F8 to pause your music simultaneously, but cats will be cats...\n\n\nA: Two solutions:\nSolution 1: the aforementioned one to toggle the Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys and then lock the screen via an AppleScript invoked by a system-wide hotkey:\ndisplay notification \"Toggling fn keys and locking\"\n-- toggl fn keys\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"keyboardTab\" of pane \"com.apple.preference.keyboard\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\n-- lock screen\nactivate application \"SystemUIServer\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"SystemUIServer\" to keystroke \"q\" using {command down, control down}\nend tell\n\nThen, the next steps are saving this as an Application, and creating a service in Automator to launch this, and setting a keyboard shortcut for that service.\nHowever, this was too slow and also had the irritating side effect of me having to write another script to un-toggle the Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys setting after logging back in. \nSolution 2: I ended up using KeyboardCleanTool, which solves the problem more directly by locking all the keys on application startup until one clicks the relevant UI button: \n\nKeyboardCleanTool is a super simple little tool which blocks all\n  Keyboard and TouchBar input.\n\n", "Q: Error occurred while restoring Time Machine backup I was trying configure my Mac to dual boot Ubuntu and macOS.

Then simply put the sound system underneath his pillow and find a volume/tone that's loud enough to wake them but won't wake you.  \nSince the audio only has to travel threw a pillow and will be near his ear already it shouldn't be too difficult to configure. You can take advantage of acoustics as to maximize the perceived loudness at the source like with higher frequencies which attenuate more and loose energy as they travel.

I have macOS High Sierra installed on my MacBook Pro already with the APFS format. \nHowever, I would like to know the steps involved to perform a clean installation of macOS High Sierra with the APFS format?\n\nA: To be clear, if boot from a usb high Sierra installer, and  format your disk with the new apfs format, you cannot install high Sierra, you get an error that’s it not a os extended disk. To make matters worse, you no longer have the option to format the disk and anything but apfs in disk utility.\nThe work around is to do a disk partition in disk utility and make that partion an OSX Extended Partion. This will erase the disk and give you back the option to erase as a Mac OS extended drive in disc utility.\n\nA: This can be done by downloading the High Sierra installer from the App store and use it to create an installation USB media.\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate and install macOS High Sierra in the Mac App Store.\n\n*Plug an empty USB flash drive into your Mac with at least 12 GB of space.\n\n*Run the following command in the terminal:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\nWhere MyVolume is the name of your USB flash drive.\n\n*Leave the USB drive plugged in and reboot your Mac while holding the option key (ALT) down.\n\n*Choose the installer from the boot menu.\n\n*From the installation environment, choose to install High Sierra on your internal disc. The installation should default to APFS.\n\n\nA more detailed explanation can be found on the Apple support page: How to create a bootable installer for macOS\n\nA: Just perform a routine erase install and you are set with apfs on SSD only. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25649\nThere’s no difference in the result whether you use internet recovery, bootable media or a bootable Mac drive with recovery. \n\nA: Had the same problem on old Macbook Air 2011. Erased the MacOS Extended (Journaled) formatted SSD, formatted it in APFS as I thought it was logic to use the format that High Sierra would generate automatically when installing, then same problem: High Sierra on the USB-Drive would not want to install on a APFS formatted drive in Recovery Mode. Changing format would not work, as APFS stays the only option. \nThen tried Internet Recovery (CMD+R). After half an hour of a rotating Earth, the same Recovery screen appeared, with \"Install OSX LION\" instead of MacOS. I then went into Disc Utility where finally I could format in Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nInstall from High-Sierra USB drive working like a charm afterwards.\nGood luck!\n\nA: To Erase everything on your Mac, and setting up as a new one,\nhold down (Command + R) immediately after pressing power button when starting up.\nThis will take you to Recovery mode and will take some time than usual which is normal.\nFrom there you can erase the partition to APFS and install the latest version of macOS.\n", "Q: Disable ssh password authentication on High Sierra I want to disable password auth - ie keys only - on SSH.

If you have any idea of what I installed that could have caused it that would be extremely helpful but mostly I want to correct the valid identifier issue that appears each time I open my terminal.\n\nA: Solution (original in comments): remove eval from the first line. The problem could also have been in either of the scripts that're sourced (in the third and last lines), but that turned out not to be the case.\nExplanation: eval makes the shell parse that command twice. Technically, it goes through all the usual steps when the shell parses a command line -- interpreting and removing quotes and escape characters, expanding variables, etc -- then passes the result to the eval command as arguments. The eval command (which is built into bash, not a separate executable) sticks those arguments back together as though that was a command, runs through all that parsing stuff again, and executes the result.\nThis is almost always a bad idea. Shell parsing is complicated and messy, and doing more of it just makes for more complication and mess. Unfortunately, people sometimes use it as a sort of \"hit it with a bigger hammer\" solution, and it works about as well as you'd expect beating things with a bigger hammer to work.\nIn this particular case, I think what's happening is that before this script runs, PATH is set to something like \"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/Applications/Something Workbooks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/path-bin\" (where \"Something\" is a different word, but I don't know the specific app name). The shell takes this:\neval export PATH=\"/Users/rachelromine/.rbenv/shims:${PATH}\"\n\nRemoves the quotes and expands ${PATH}, passes the result to eval, which executes:\nexport PATH=/Users/rachelromine/.rbenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/Applications/Something Workbooks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/path-bin\n\nSince the quotes got removed in the first parsing pass, that space in the middle of the app name is treated as a separator between arguments (rather than as part of a filename), so the export command sets PATH to \"/Users/rachelromine/.rbenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/Applications/Something\", then in a totally unrelated operation tries to export a variable named \"Workbooks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/path-bin\"... which is not a valid variable name (\"identifier\").\nNow, as for what that eval is doing there in the first place: I don't know. I can't see how it could possibly do any good here (though if it weren't for the space, it wouldn't have done any harm). I assume it was in some instructions you followed (or a prototype .bash_profile) for installing rbenv. What it was doing there, I have no idea.\n", "Q: can I reschedule the kernel tasks ? Two questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can someone tell me who the idiot was who decided that the best time to have a 'kernel task' running (which I'm guessing is SpotLight indexing) was at 6 o'clock in the evening, when so many Mac owners would be getting home from work and settling down to use their Mac?  Because CPU usage at 800% and a thirty-second lag before the system deigns to respond to mouse clicks, is just the best thing ever.\n\n*Is there a way to force the Mac to carry out this task at 2 AM?\nThanks.  \n\nA: Your assumptions are off on multiple points.\nFirst off, kernel_task is not Spotlight indexing.\nSecondly it is not a task that is scheduled to run at a specific time.\nkernel_task is really just an umbrella-process for everything happening with the operating system kernel:\nFor example running programs (called processes) ask the kernel to do stuff for it via so called system calls (i.e. asking for data from a file, sending data over the network, etc.). The time the kernel spends on handling this is attributed to the kernel_task.\nThe kernel_task also has threads doing internal housekeeping for the kernel that is not dependent on system calls from processes. This is for example the scheduling of processes (i.e. which program to run next), paging (swapping, etc), thread reaping, etc.\nLastly the kernel also has special functionality to ensure that CPUs are not doing anything. This could be done to lower CPU temperature, save power or put the system in a state ready for sleep (i.e. when closing the lid on a laptop). Here the kernel_task when viewed from Activity Monitor or similar will look like it is using the CPU fully, but really it is using it fully to say that it shouldn't do anything (i.e. the CPU should be in an idle state, preferably in a lower power level).\nTo sum it up, your request to delay this processing to 2 AM doesn't make sense, unless you want to delay the execution of all your other programs as well.\n", "Q: Transfer FreeOTP secrets to new device using iOS 11 Automatic Setup The FreeOTP application is typically used as a second factor in two-factor authentication.  By design, it does not synchronize the secrets over iCloud or allow exporting them.  The only way to get them out of the device and in again has been using an encrypted iTunes backup. Recently however, when setting up a new iPhone using iOS 11's Automatic Setup, I noticed that the FreeOTP secrets were transferred to the new device.  What in this new iOS 11 Automatic Setup process made this possible?\nIt seems that FreeOTP stores the secrets in the iOS keychain, but marks them only for storage on the device (not to be synced across the network using iCloud).  So does the new iOS 11 Automatic Setup process somehow also transfer such marked-as-this-device-only keychain entries to the new device?\n\nA: This answer can help you if your device is jailbroken (I would rather comment, but I am unable to).\nUsing the Filza app, navigate to the FreeOTP data folder. Copy the .plist file that is in the root of the folder. This contains the (unencrypted) secret and other information necessary to add the secrets to the new device/installation.\nUsing the FreeOTP QR Code Generator website, use the data from the .plist file to generate QR codes and scan the QR codes with the FreeOTP app on the new device/installation.\n", "Q: iTunes wi-fi sync not working So there is a mystery story with synchronization over wi-fi.\nI've been synchronizing over wi-fi my macbook and iPhone for about 3 months.

A business with an iOS App needs to pay its users (the users perform work for the business using the app). Can that business pay its users with Apple Pay? Clearly Apple Pay can be used for peer to peer payments, but my searches are not revealing to me whether or not this is available for Business-to-User payments and whether there is an API for this.\n\nA: Yes. My business has a business credit card that’s activated on Apple Pay and that works for depositing funds into Apple Pay Cash as well as Square Cash.

For computers on its LAN, that works just fine. You can see the disk advertised (via Bonjour?) in the sidebar of Finder, select it via Time Machine, and back up.\nUpstream from the Asus router and its LAN is another Mac, which provides them internet.  The WAN IP for the router is 192.168.2.2 and its parent Mac has the IP 192.168.1.2. On parent mac, I mount afp://router.wan.ip, but can't just mount it without hassle from the Bonjour advertisement.\nI'm having a lot of trouble backing up to the disk from both simultaneously.  It's as if mounting on the one \"steals\" the disk from the other.  They end up telling me they want to do a new backup and they don't have access to delete their .sparsebundle.purgeable and I should probably run first aid on the disk.\nPer @klanomath's request, the network architecture is as follows:\nmodem to internet (internet IP space)\nwired router (192.168.1.1/24)\nmac mini (192.168.1.2)  sharing internet via pf static NAT\nnetwork adapter (en4) (192.168.2.1)\nasus w/ network disk (192.168.2.2, serving 192.168.3.0/24)  \nmacbook (192.168.3.251)\n\n\nA: \nIt would be really nice to properly forward Bonjour or whatever is\nallowing it to be visible in the Finder sidebar (have already tried\nforwarding 1900,5300,5351,5353 to 192.168.2.2.\n\nThis is not how Bonjour/Zeroconf was intended to function.\n\nBonjour only works within a single broadcast domain, which is usually\na small area, without special DNS configuration. macOS, Bonjour for\nWindows and AirPort Base Stations may be configured to use Wide Area\nBonjour which allows for wide area service discovery via an\nappropriately configured DNS server.\n\nEmphasis mine.\nBonjour is a broadcast protocol meaning while on the subnet, it will broadcast out a message to see who responds.  The key here is that it doesn't know the IP addresses of any machine (service) until it responds back.  That's how Finder puts it in the sidebar as you describe.\nYou can't just enable Bonjour on the WAN or the Internet for that matter.  MIT's IT knowledgebase sums it up:\n\n\"While ZEROCONF and Bonjour work well on home or small business\nnetworks, they are not compatible with large enterprise networks which\ncan frequently have thousands of devices in the same wireless address\nspace. ZEROCONF relies on multicast traffic to discover devices on the\nnetwork, which exhibits crippling performance and load issues on large\nenterprise network implementations. Even if it were enabled on the\nnetwork, results would be slow to return and potentially return lists\nof hundreds of devices to choose from, which can be unmanageable on\ndevices such as iPhones or iPads.\"\n\nJust for the sake of argument... if you were able to send out your broadcast packets over the Internet (via WAN), your ISP would most certainly block it because of the massive amount of traffic you would be generating.\nBonjour is basically DNS\nIt not about port forwarding \"Bonjour.\"  It's much more than that. Currently, you don't \"port forward\" DNS ports.  Bonjour is a \"DNS method\".\nYou don't port forward DNS from your ISP to your computers so you can look up a domain.  Your router either assigns the DNS servers during DHCP so you can query hosts/domains directly or acts as a relay to forward them to the actual DNS servers.\nWhat does this mean?\n(Remember the emphasized text at the beginning of this answer?) Technically speaking, you can get Bonjour to search another domain by adding that domain record into DNS (you're telling Bonjour to go search somewhere else).    However, it requires the following:\n\n*\n\n*An Authoritative DNS Server you control\n\n*Manually adding Bonjour to that Server\n\n*Setting up a Bonjour Name Server\nIf this is something you're willing to do, then start with learning BIND.\nConnecting to Time Machine Shares\nTo connect to an internal AFP share so you can \"Time Machine\" across the network, you need to open those ports.  See:  What ports need to be open for netatalk to work as a Time Machine server on my LAN?\nIn my cursory reading of the Asus router manual, (IMO) it's not capable of this level port forwarding.\nPersonally, I would set up a VPN between to the two networks, routing all traffic through the VPN thus making it my subnet.  Bonjour traffic will traverse the VPN \"autodiscovering\" everything. AFP will be immediately accessible as all traffic traverses the VPN without impediment of the firewall; meaning no port forwarding.\nBottom Line\nThis is not an effective nor productive solution.  Time Machine was designed to work on the local network.  Backups to a network connected Time Capsule over Gigabit can take hours.  Significantly longer over WiFi.  Connecting over the Internet at speeds that sometimes don't even reach 1/10 of that speed would take an eternity.\nTo get Bonjour service discovery setup to connect an AFP share to share a Time Capsule will require a ton of expended effort for hardly any results, if at all.\n", "Q: Mac is mirroring my monitors through miniDP So I have two DELL u2415 monitors connected to USC-C to Dual Display Port adapter. The problem is when I go to displays it shows both my u2415 monitors as one under arrangement and they are just mirroring each other. I think it could be because the adapter is plugged into only the 1 usb-c. Could it be that I need two adapters and for them to not share the same adapter?\nSurely there is a way as the adapter was advertised saying it would work.\nAnyone had any experiences with an issue like this?\n\nA: The adapter in question only supports Windows 10 - it won't work on a Mac.\nConnecting two displays via one of the Thunderbolt 3 connectors on the MacBook Pro 15\" with TouchBar is usually done via daisy-chaining through the display. This is only supported by Apple for Thunderbolt displays - not DisplayPort monitors.\nThe cheapest  way to connect your monitors is to use two ports, as you mention. However it is not necessary buying two of those expensive dual-display adapters. Instead you can use a simple USB-C to DisplayPort cable. For example this one:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-DisplayPort-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B01J6DT070/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1484165396&sr=8-1&keywords=usbc%20displayport%204k&linkCode=ll1&tag=radianexuscor-20&linkId=a1ef8c98169f6005d21382dca77d66e4&utm_source=tr.im&utm_medium=no_referer&utm_campaign=tr.im%2FCable_Matters_USBC_DP&utm_content=direct_input\nBuying two of these ($15.99) will allow connecting the two monitors to your Mac. \nHopefully you can return your adapter for a refund.\n", "Q: Missing Disk Image password in Keychain after Time Machine restore I recently restored my HD from Time Machine, and it looks like everything in keychain copied over fine - except for one password for a very important disk image!

Any idea where it went, or where it was stored?\n\nA: Figured out the answer. To anyone wondering: the login.keychain file apparently doesn't have all the passwords in it.

I have gone through the suggested changes from 7 years ago here:  https://superuser.com/questions/172989/virtualbox-running-ubuntu-is-slow-mac-os-x-host\nBut it does not seem to make a difference. Even when I change the resolution to 720p the performance is still quite poor.

Alternative solutions if this a common Virtual Box issue?\n\nA: The problem is Retina itself. If you use other monitor with other resolution (no retina) you'll see much better performance.\nI think it's an issue with OSX and Retina/HiDPI Resolutions.\n\nA: Using the second monitor for VM definitely will improve performance. \nAnother workaround could be using a remote connection to VM.\nI installed XRDP on Ubuntu VM on my MBP and using RDP client for access, no issues with performance.\nPlease check this link. There is another suggestion to use tool for Mac to use an additional range of screen resolution, so your VM instance can run smoothly on retina display\n\nA: I know that this question is very old post, but just in case anyone still wondering how to fix/solve this issue...\nThe problem is on Mac's Retina display, as @Rubén Gómez García stated.\nThe fix(ish) for this problem is:\nFirstly, make scale factor to 100%. This is MUST.\nThen, in the Finder, go to Applications -> VirtualBox.app and choose Show Package Contents from the Finder context menu to see the contents of the app package. Continue to go to Contents -> Resources -> VirtualBoxVM.app.\nOnce you found VirtualBoxVm.app, then open context menu to get to the properties of VirtualBoxVM.app.\nThen, under General, there is a checkbox called \"Open in Low Resolution\", you can disable HiDPI display by checking this. Don't worry, you won't notice the difference between HiDPI vs. Low Res. At least I didn't.\nIn my environment (Macbook Pro 13inch 2020 with 32GB RAM, Core i7 + Big sur 11.5.2), the performance was greatly improved by doing this setting, so I will leave it here as a reminder.\nFeel free to correct/improve my answer.\n", "Q: How can I get the recipient’s Gmail iOS app to show my Google account’s avatar?

I have recently had some trouble with my MacBook Pro 8.1 (Early 2011). After running tests, installing the old 2x2 GB RAM sticks and basically trying else everything to restore it, it turned out that the SATA cable didn't want to work with my SSD anymore, although with an older mechanical drive it was ok. So I swapped my SATA cable for a new one, installed my 2x4 GB RAM sticks again and it works again like new. Today however, out of curiousity, I ran the Apple Hardware Test again just to see if anything comes up, and I had this error:\n\nThen I checked again using REMBER!\n\nSo which is correct?\nShould I do something if there are no symptoms? Am I destroying other parts of my Mac if I just do nothing?\n\nA: *\n\n*Rember only tested less than 1 GB of your 8 GB of RAM, as explained within the screenshot of the Rember application.\n\nMemory allocated for testing: 947 MB\n\n\n*Apple Hardware Test will test all of the RAM in the system, since it runs outside of macOS.\nAs also explained in Rember, to be able to test more RAM with the program:\n\nrun memtest (the core of Rember) in single-user mode\n\n\nA: To answer your questions:\n\nShould I do something if there are no symptoms? \n\nYes.  Absolutely.  Most definitely.\nWhat should you do?  Diagnose the memory.  \nRun the memory tests for each module in each slot individually.  Your goal is to determine if you hare having memory issues or memory slot issues.\nYou have \"known working\" memory (the old modules) that if you can also test with that, theoretically, should generate no errors.  Use that as your benchmark.  You will want to make notes as to what works where as you progress.\nIf you discover you have bad memory, replace it with new modules.  Most reputable memory manufacturers have warranties; they should replace it for you for no charge.\nIf it's your slot, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*leave the slot unused\n\n*replace the logic board\n\n\n\nAm I destroying other parts of my Mac if I just do nothing?\n\nDestroying other parts?  No.  Bad memory cannot break other components.  What it can destroy is unsaved data.  Memory can cause kernel panics and even hard system freezes.  Anything unsaved at that point is lost.\n", "Q: Long press key to reveal special characters does not work after update to High Sierra I have a similar problem as the asker in this question on Apple's forum.\nAfter I updated from Sierra to High Sierra (v10.13.3) on a MBP retina 13\" mid 2014, I noticed the character picker (special character pop-up) that appear when long pressing / holding a character, e.g. to type ë or ñ, does not appear anymore. However, when such a key is held, the character is repeatedly entered. This is not what I want, because I'm used to the character picker. I don't want to use ⌥ key with u for ¨, i for ^, e for ´ etc., which I fail to remember and is slower than simply holding to reveal any character variations. That is much more efficient in my opinions and therefore it is better UX.\nI've tried the linked question's terminal command without success: defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true\nAlso, there's a comment in the discussion suggesting rebooting in safe mode and changing some keyboard settings might do the trick. I cannot boot into safe mode, possibly (?) due to administrative restrictions (company laptop).\nSo, how do I do it? Is the character picker a feature at all, or am I actually experiencing a bug?\n\nA: The problem has 'fixed itself'.\nToday, I found out the character picker works again. I have no clue why it did not want to work. Possibly, it requires multiple reboots before the functionality is back (I already rebooted a few times in the meantime). Maybe it's because I fiddled with some keyboard settings. I've also used an external keyboard in the meantime, which could (in some strange way) influence the keyboard settings.\nI will never know what has definitely solved the problem.\nSo, if you're having this problem too, then try setting your keyboard layout to that of your locale, but in the layout of your choosing (mine is Dutch language with US international layout). Then reboot multiple times, or maybe turn off your computer completely a few times. If that doesn't work, connect an external keyboard and try if that works.\nIf you happen to find a solution or even a cause, report back here in an answer or comment, as it will help others facing the same issue.\n\nA: Just restarted my Mac in Safe Mode and all the accents have come back \n\nA: I have noticed that locking my Mac (Control-Command-Q) and login again solve the problem.

Now, having used CMD to select the two remaining pieces - highlighting them in yellow borders, I go up to the Modify menu to find that the Join Clips option is unavailable (greyed out).\nQuestion\nWhy am I not able to join the clips? They are adjacent to one another, have no speed alteration (e.g. slow motion) and are both highlighted. How do I join them?\n\nA: Note: Join clips option in iMovie cannot be used for joining two different imported video clips. It can only be used to join clips created by splitting an imported clip in iMovie.  \nSo, essentially if you have two clips which are to be combined, click on the Share icon in the Top right corner, then click on the option File and export all the clips as a single video file. You may then re-import it into the project if required after the share is successful. \nFor a quick 2 min demo, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Px_I5fvJbk\n", "Q: Cloning HD in SSD I have an old Mac that I’d like to upgrade by adding an SSD.\nThe problem is that the OS is really old (Snow Leopard, Mac Early 2008), so I’m really not sure if is the backup restore is going to work. \nSo I thought I could carbon copy the current hard disk to a new SSD and boot from the SSD. \nDo you see any problem in this approach?\n\nA: There is no problem cloning your old drive to a new SSD.  Cloning will make an exact copy of the drive, so other than being solid state rather than rotational, there's no difference\nThe one thing that you will want to do after you get your MacBook up and running is enable TRIM support.  TRIM is the ATA command set that will \"recycle\" the deleted space on your SSD.

A question has just crossed my mind\nCan you only use windows from the account you set it up on, or does it work for all users on the mac?\nFor example, if I set up Bootcamp using Bootcamp Assitant on User X's account, can User Y use Bootcamp on the Mac without having to log in to user X's account?\nThanks.\n\nA: The ability to boot into windows is not limited by what user installed it. That said everyone will need either their own Windows logon or have the windows password to the windows user you create.\nThe Windows users are totally unrelated to MacOS users.\n\nA: Unless you set a Firmware Key or a Bitlocker password on Windows, everyone can boot into Windows with option (alt) key, and login with their own account or a guest account. Windows is an OS that is completely seperate from macOS, and macOS has no control over Windows.\n\nA: There is not any connection between your Mac and Windows. you can assume Boot Camp as a whole another PC. To set user privileges, you need to set that on Windows. And any user can boot into your Windows from Mac unless you set up accounts for them in Windows.\n", "Q: Trying to boot El Capitan, High Sierra, and Win7 UPDATE: \nThank you for your responses and helpful ideas! I was able to fix the Mac-related issues by upgrading to Sierra - not High Sierra - which can support both Logic Pro 9 and Logic Pro X 10.4 concurrently. This is not stated at all on Apple's site. \nAt any rate, I was able to now only need a Mac partition and a Windows partition. I have had some other catastrophes to deal with in the meantime, so I have not had the time to fix the Windows side of things yet. I will report back when I do!\nI'm going to try to run down this issue as succinctly as possible, but bear with me; it's convoluted. \nLast year my main 1TB HDD in my mid-2010 Mac Pro showed signs of failure. I proactively bought a new 2TB SSHD, made an image of my El Capitan Mac partition, and did the same with my Boot Camp Windows 7 partition. I formatted and partitioned the new drive appropriately and restored those images onto the new drive. \nMacOS worked great, but the Bootcamp partition refused to boot, no matter what I tried. However, I could still boot into Windows from the old drive just fine, so I left it in the machine. I ended up using a Windows program to repartition that drive into its own Windows drive, using the entire 1TB. \nI left the Bootcamp partition intact on my new drive in case I figured out how to fix it. \nAnother weird quirk of this configuration is that when I am booted into OS X, I can't see my Windows drive at all. It shows up in Disk Utility but is completely unreadable. However, when I am in Windows, I can see all my Mac drives as normal. \nFast forward to yesterday. I am a music producer and game composer, and the project that I'm working on would really benefit from me upgrading to the latest Logic Pro X from my current Logic Pro 9. \nLogic Pro X 10.4 requires High Sierra.\nLogic Pro 9 does not work in High Sierra.\nI need both for backwards compatibility reasons; Logic Pro X ditched the 32-bit bridge, and I still have many projects in progress that use 32-bit plugins. \nI need both. So I just finally ditched that Bootcamp partition that didn't work, cloned my MacOS partition, booted into the cloned partition, upgraded to High Sierra there, got the new Logic working.......\nAnd now I can't boot into Windows. \nIt's on a separate hard drive! I thought this would circumvent the 4 partition limit. \nTo clarify and summarize this issue, my main hard drive now contains two partitions; one for El Capitan, and one for High Sierra. I have a separate HDD that contains Windows 7 which was originally set up via Boot Camp Assistant, but went through the aforementioned changes. \nI need to be able to boot my Mac Pro into any of these three OS'es at any given time. \nWhat in the world can I do? Can I finally have some peace and harmony in my computing life for once? Has anyone encountered anything quite like this? I'm pretty frustrated. \n\nA: Generally, when you move Windows, you have to rebuild the BCD file.\nWindows generally looks at the contents of a partition in order to determine the partition type. The macOS operating system relies on the type information stored in  the respective partition table. So it is possible Windows could boot even though the partition types are wrong. On the other hand, macOS would not not be able to read the same incorrectly typed partitions.\nEach of your drives have two types of partition tables. Windows 7 uses the legacy MBR partition table and macOS uses the Guid Partition Table (GPT). So it is possible for one operating system to see the partitioning differently than the other operating system. \nFast forward to yesterday. High Sierra has a tendency to reset MBR partition tables to what is referred to as a full protective MBR (PMBR). I layman terms, High Sierra may have erased Windows 7. Normally, this is an easily recoverable event, but I this many not be true in your case. To determine the damage, one would first have some detailed information about your current partitioning.\nI am not familiar the Mac Pro model, so I may get some of these commands wrong. None of the commands alter your Mac. The commands just provide information about the partitioning and volume formats. Edit your question and add the output from these commands. If necessary precede a command with sudo.\ndiskutil  list\nsudo  gpt  -r  show  /dev/disk1\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk1\n\nI believe you have to boot to macOS Recovery to execute these next commands.     \ngpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\nfdisk  /dev/disk0\n\n", "Q: Terminal: run source ~/.bash_profile every time start new terminal I installed some command line programs (e.g. rbenv), but every time I open a new Terminal tab, it looks like the environment gets reset.

Eg. while the main user is still in there account I could either go into their account or login with another account without interfering with what they are doing. \nFor example I sometimes need to dip into other people's machines and update settings, but I have to work around when they are not working on their machine, if it could run a second session in the background then I could make changes, update etc. without having to kick them off. \nI don't need to run complex programs or even multiple browser tabs; it's just to login and admin the computer, add printers, make sure updates are applied etc.. so it shouldn't use many resources. \nIs that possible ? \n\nA: Assuming you are talking about using Apple's Remote Desktop app and not just Screen Sharing (which I'm guessing you are, based on your question) then yes, it's perfectly possible, you just have to set it on a system-by-system basis. Oh, and it only works on 10.7+.

I plugged in my phone as well and that didn't do anything either. I have an iPhone 7\n\nA: For iPhone 7 and 8, you need to hold down Lock and Volume Down at the same time to reboot. Older iPhones use Lock and Home button.\nIf you cannot restart the phone this way, you may have to use DFU mode.\n(Note: These links are hosted by Verizon, but will work with any iPhone 7 or 8 on any carrier.)\n", "Q: How did my new iPhone know my WiFi credentials? I just bought a new iPhone SE to replace a destroyed iPhone 5S. It was set up to the point of being able to make calls at the Apple store, but it was not logged into iCloud. At some point after getting home I noticed it was already logged into my router's WiFi. I had not yet manually attempted to log onto my router. I may have logged into iCloud but this device must have a different UDID than my old iPhone 5S. How then was my new iPhone able to automatically log into my router's WiFi?\n\nA: iCloud Keychain shares your WiFi networks, including passwords, to all of your devices. So if your new phone had been logged into iCloud, that’s where it got the network details. \n\nA: In addition to Mike Scott's answer, there is another reason why your WiFi network could have been working when you got home.\nWhen the new phone was set up at the store, if the tech did a backup/restore between phones or otherwise transferred any of your old phone's data over to the new one, then settings would have been transferred as well. In this case, WiFi SSID credentials would typically be part of the transfer process and that would explain why your network was joined when you got home.\n", "Q: Use HomePod as a microphone for a audio recording? I know that you can send a call to a HomePod to use the microphone on the HomePod to talk to the person you're calling to, and use its speaker to listen to the person calling. Since it is possible to call others with the microphone on the HomePod (through the iPhone of course), is there a way to do audio recording with the HomePod's microphone (with some app like Voice Memo)?\n\nA: Unfortunately no. There exist no official way of recording audio from the HomePod into for example Voice Memo or other \"generic\" apps.\nYou could use a call recording service or voice mail system to record audio from the HomePod by dialing into that system.

I am an illustartor and I don't have any WACOM tablets right now, so can I use my iPad as the input tablet and use it just like any other digital pen table and make illustrations in Adobe illustrator?\n\nA: This is possible with some commercial 3rd party apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Duet Display is an iOS / OS X app combo (about $20) that makes it possible to use an iPad as an external monitor connected to your mac. The \"Pro\" version (about $20 per year) provides the requested feature to use the iPad as a graphics tablet. By \"mirroring\" to the external monitor (iPad) in display settings, one gets the same view on the graphics tablet as on the Mac's screen. \n\n*Astropad is another combo (about $30) that focuses more on the graphics tablet idea. You cannot use it as an external monitor, but define an area of your Mac's screen that is mirrored to the tablet.  Apparently, the basic version can already be used as a graphics tablet, but the \"Studio\" version (about $80 per year) provides dedicated Apple pencil support for the iPad Pro, support for custom tool palettes and some additional gizmos.\nDuet also offers a Windows version.

If you want to specify a particular app (maybe you have a different PDF viewer but want to use Preview) use the -a flag and specify the app:\nfor file in /Path_to_Directory/*.pdf; do open -a Preview.app \"${file}\";  done\n\nNote:  Be sure to enclose the variable name in quotes (\") to account for spaces and non-printing characters.  For example, if you have a file named \"My PDF File.pdf\", not including the quotes will cause the command to try and open each string (\"My\", \"PDF\", and \"File\") as separate files.\n\nA: The manpage for open in Sierra still says:\n You can specify one or more file names (or pathnames), which are inter-\n preted relative to the shell or Terminal window's current working direc-\n tory. For example, the following command would open all Word files in the\n current working directory:\n\n open *.doc\n\n Opened applications inherit environment variables just as if you had\n launched the application directly through its full path.  This behavior\n was also present in Tiger.\n\nThat means your initial approach is usually also the correct one. That is \"usually\" as in: this open command is buggy (and Preview is buggy, too). \nIf your PDFs have 'proper' filenames, then all is well and in a directory with 20 PDFs all PDFs will be opened in the manner the manpage promises. \nHowever, if there are 'funny' filenames, legally allowed (or represented differently on the filesystem) on HFS+ but known for being 'difficult' in a shell environment, problems arise.\nThe globbing function for open is broken. If for example a filename starts with - (minus sign) the next character gets interpreted as another option for the open command. Since there are not many options available for the open command this results often in an error. Spaces in filenames, everything that would need escaping in a normal shell command, seems to be troubling for this command. \nOther bugs to observe are that using the option open -a Preview.app does  not work as might be expected. Further, it seems that Preview does not respect your preferences whether newly opened docs should all get their own window. Preview opens multiple PDFs with a simple open *.pdf but all those docs are then 'hidden' in the sidebar of a single shared window. You then have to click the triangles to reveal that there are multiple files open now. \nA number of files with clean names in a single working directory accessed via open *.pdf with Preview.app set as your default PDF-viewer will open them all (well, I didn't check a probable upper limit on this…)\nThat leaves now the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*either ensure you have clean filenames, then use your initial command as it confirms to Apple's documentation and is easier to remember, type and use\n\n*avoid both Preview.app and the option open -a Preview.app\n\n*if both options above fail, only then use the solution from Allan's answer\n", "Q: Window being maximized while holding title bar I often will hold a window's title bar while reading something, and every once in a while the window will become maximized while I'm holding it.\nI can't totally reproduce this, so I'm not sure the exact behavior that's causing it.

Not sure what event caused this to happen.  Macbook Air, El Capitan 10.11.6\n\nWhat is the root cause of the problem and how can this be corrected?\n\nA: It's probably a result of the background image not being the same size as your display. I didn't know why we were supposed to scale the image to match exactly, but that looks like the reason.\nTry scaling (and cropping, if necessary) the image to the exact pixel size of your display.

Before I turn it off completely as suggested, is there any sensitivity setting I can check to confirm how long it waits for a key to be held down?\nIf not, I guess it might indicate a hardware problem with my keyboard then and turning it off completely is the only option.\n\nA: This is the character picker for entering accented characters. This appears when you hold down a key on the keyboard. This can be disabled globally using defaults:\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\n", "Q: Is there any way I can backup a raw partition to disk in multiple parts and update the parts only as needed? I have an external drive for my iMac with a Windows-to-go and Linux system installed on it. It took an awful lot of work to get this set up just the way I needed, and am trying to find a way to back up the drive so that I can restore either system if things go wrong, especially given that Windows-to-go has no recovery environment. My main OS is macOS so I'd like to do the backup in that.\nSo far, I am doing the backups by dumping the contents of each partition to disk, e.g.:\ndd if=/dev/rdisk2s2 of=/Volumes/Backups/external_drive_partition2 bs=1m\n\nThat works great, and I've already used it to restore my Windows partition after accidentally blowing it away. However, it causes real problems if I want this file to be backed up via an online backup service like CrashPlan or Backblaze, or even using Time Machine.\nThe problem, of course, is that these partitions are each 200 GB in size. Every time I update their respective backup, the whole file has been modified, and any of those services will now try to upload 200-400 GB of data, which will take weeks on my internet connection. Furthermore, Time Machine would quickly fill up my entire backup drive with multiple iterative backups of this file.\nWhat I'd like to do is backup the raw partitions in multiple parts, say 50 MB chunks for example. Then each time I update the backup, each part is only overwritten if the data from that part of the partition has changed. That way, any online backup service will only upload the chunks that need to be uploaded.\nIs there any software or method that can do this? I'm aware of a few programs in Windows that can do this sort of thing, but not in macOS.\nI'm also open to alternative methods of backing up these partitions. If there's a better way, I'm all ears!\n\nA: After some time, I eventually decided that the method I outlined was probably the best way to do this. So I wrote a piece of software that allows me to make backups the way I want: multipart-backup.\nPerhaps someone else will eventually find it useful too!\n", "Q: Kernel Error screen I have an older Macbook Pro which I haven't used much lately since purchasing a new Macbook Pro. The older one was near capacity and would get very hot.

Can someone please help me figure out what to do?\nThanks in advance.  \n\nA: launchd looks to be failing which is causing this kernel panic. Sadly, not much of a stack trace to work with.\nBoot to Recovery (hold Cmd + R at boot) and reinstall OS X from there. The latest version your Mac supports is El Capitan (10.11) but your Recovery partition should allow you to re-install whatever is currently on there.\nDon't worry, doing a re-install this way does it in-place so it won't overwrite any of your personal data, just the system files for OS X.\nIf you get a kernel panic booting to Recovery (both the built in one and Internet Recovery) then there could be a hardware fault and you'll have to either perform diagnostics (you should be able to run the Apple Hardware Test that came on one of your Leopard installation discs) or take it in to Apple for them to check out.\n", "Q: How often do apps go on sale in the App Store? Does the App Store regularly run generous discounts similar to Steam or am I just spoiled by random weekly -75% discounts?\nIn particular, are discounts on the App Store common enough to be worth waiting for, or should I just buy apps mostly at full price instead of waiting half a year for a 20% discount?\n\nA: The discounts available from time to time are always determined by the software developer. Apple does not set the price of apps, nor the regularity of discounts offered by developers. (Apple's own apps excluded of course!)\nIn other words, one software publisher may offer a discounted price for a week each month, while another may never offer a discount. And, because of the sheer volume of developers, there's no way to identify any meaningful pattern.\nHowever, there are a number of services that allow you to add apps to a wish list and then notify you when those apps are discounted. I have listed two below purely as examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppShopper\n\n*AppZapp\nThese services also usually give users a historical breakdown of the price charged for an app over its history, so you could use that to get a sense of how often a particular developer is inclined to discount their app(s).\nNow, what Apple does discount is their gift cards - electronic and in stores. People often load up on $100 cards for $79 which is more than 20% off and even Wallet was offering $20 off for people using their devices to add value to their accounts. If you know you will spend over time and don’t mind carrying a balance, you can save that way even when developers don’t run sales. It also means other purchases (e.g. music, movies, subscriptions, etc) are purchased at a discount even though Apple, Netflix and others may not offer such discounts directly.\n", "Q: macOS App Store alternative? The limited functionality of the App Store has me looking for an alternative view on \"Apple-approved\" applications. I appreciate the vetting that occurs as part of inclusion in this catalog, but I'd like to see a set of features that are common in nearly all digital purchasing interfaces: sorting and filtering by price, number of reviews, user rating, whether or not there are in-app purchases, et cetera.\nSites such as appcuity.com and AppsOnSale appear to have died. There was an iTunes-like client called Bodega, but it is now defunct. The iOS version of the store has AppApp.io.\nWhat alternatives to the App Store exist?\n\nA: There is no equivalent to the App Store and some functionality of macOS requires you be on the App Store to use it so there’s no competition really.\nHistorically however MacUpdate has a really good library.\n\nA: Setapp is an App-Store-like subscription service. They charge you 10USD a month and you can use a ton of apps they have contract with. It does contain a lot of useful apps.\nI personally use 9to5mac to check on useful apps and buy them separately on each developer's website. \nThey are not necessarily alternatives to the App Store, but buying apps separately usually gives the app developers higher privilege than buying them on the Mac App Store (in the example of Commander One).\n\nA: Have a look AppShopper.com. Their 'About' statement says,\n“AppShopper is one of the largest iPhone, iPad, and Mac app directories attracting hundreds of thousands of unique visitors per month with millions of page views to the site. Our audience is interested in app discovery.”\nIt’s exclusively iOS and Mac apps. You can register, if desired, but not doing so does not seem to limit searching. The advertising seems minimal and non-intrusive.\nThe Chartbeat sidebar graphic claims 335,291 apps in the Appstore. Their Appstore, I presume, the almost identical spelling with Apple’s App Store is a bit confusing. \nAlso confusing is an alert banner stating that a certain app has been removed from the App Store (I presume this time they mean Apple’s per the spelling.?) The oldest app in the Graphic & Design category is one such app. SketchMee was introduced in Jan 2011. The App Activity sidebar relays this app’s version progress, pricing fluctuation and other expected details. However, clicking the ‘Buy’ button brings up the Mac App Store preview in iTunes followed quickly with the App Store app opening to that app’s page on your Mac. So the app then has not been removed from the App Store. Also, just searching the App Store produced the app's App Store page for purchase. So I do not know why the alert banner says it has been removed or what it is referring to. (?)\nDespite this, it is a nice app-searching alternative to the App Store.\nThis should give you the general flavor it.\n", "Q: Can't resize macOS partition (APFS error code 49187) I'm unable to shrink my APFS macOS partition in Disk Utility or by using diskutil. When I try with either method, I receive error code 49187. There appears to be no reference for these codes and I can't find any information online. I have tried deleting Time Machine snapshots and that made no difference. First Aid on my disk reveals some kind of corruption in the partition map:\n\nI tried what it said and First Aid only lets me scan my macOS partition in Recovery Mode. Using diskutil gives me Error starting file system repair for disk0: Invalid request (-69886).\nIs there any way to fix this? I'm trying to add a FAT32 partition to my disk.\nThis is on macOS 10.13.3.\n\nA: I solved this error for myself by the following steps, (to be sure I included all)\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine snapshot delete fix\n\n*Decrypt harddrive from filevault\n\n\nThis resulted in the persistence of the error. But then I booted in recovery mode (reboot and hold cmd+R) and started the disk utility there. To my surprise the Disk Utility showed me different values for the free space of my partition. I only had 20g free instead of the 50g I tried to allocate each time. \nWhen I did the normal partition steps in the recovery boot Disk Utility everything went fine and I am currently running Ubuntu 18.04.1 alongside Mojave 10.14.1 without problems, be it that I only have 20g.\n\nA: I experienced the same error code, 49187. Below is some background context from my situation and my resolution at the end. \nI had re-imaged a MacBook Air as a dev machine and forgot that I wanted to partition the drive.\nI, too, ensured file encryption and Time Machine were not active (and used tmutil to thin snapshots) but still experienced the same partition error as the OP. I then took the scorched earth approach; I was going to re-format entirely. I first ensured I had a Mojave installer on a USB thumb drive (using DiskMaker X) then rebooted into recovery mode (Cmd-R).\nThere, I started Disk Utility to erase and partition. In fact, it failed there as well. After it failed, it showed used file space of roughly 1gig and 75gig of 'other' (which is actually the size of the partition I attempted to add).\nThe resolution, fortunately, was at hand. I was able to Unmount the APFS drive and actually erase/re-format it with APFS and then create the additional partition.\nI am not exactly sure why this worked. When I looked at my drive initially in Disk Utility, it said that it was shared by 4 volumes although I hadn't partitioned anything myself. Once I unmounted and erased the entire drive in Recovery Mode, it showed as One Volume. I wonder if any recovery volume(s) added during High Sierra or Mojave's install prevented APFS partitioning to take effect.\n\nA: I managed to solve the problem.\nError code 49187 appears to be an internal error in the structure of the APFS that occurred during the file system installation.\nI couldn't find a solution to fix it, so I could only recover the following steps:\n#Step 1:\nI made a Time Machine backup (otherwise I just updated my existing one)\n#Step 2:\nI restarted the computer and selected the installation option from the USB installer\n#Step 3:\nI then run the following command in the terminal to list the disks:\ndiskutil list\n\n(The terminal can be found as a menu item once the installer boots)\n#Step 4:\nI selected the disk on which the macOS is installed (in this case, this was \"disk1\")\n#Step 5:\nThen I ran the following command (To convert an APFS container into a free space, you must first delete the container):\ndiskutil apfs deleteContainer disk1\n\n#Step 6:\nThen restore the system using Time Machine\nAfter restoring the system, I was able to partition without problems.\nIf Boot Camp Assistant fails trying to partition a Mojave OSX volume after a clean install, giving an unhelpful message to run Disk Utility (which finds no problem), it is a \"silent\" 49187 error.  Seems to be triggered by a Bootcamp partition that is much larger than the OSX partition. Confirmation comes by trying to create partitions with the same size in Disk Utility, which reports the 49187 error. This Time Machine backup/wipe/restore procedure cures the silent 49187 error and lets Boot Camp Assistant perform the partition.\n\n\nA: My solution was trying a smaller second partition size. Disk Utility said the space was free but I guess it really isn't.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but as a layman I resorted to the straightforward-most solution:\nI usually have bootable copies from my volumes using CCC (Carbon Copy Cloner) on an USB disk.\nI booted from such a volume and erased everything on my 2-TB-internal SSD using disk utility. Then I established the wanted 2 partitions on that 2-TB-Disk and CCCed my backupped volumes back to that internal SSD.\nDone, worked like a charm.\n\nA: *\n\n*I could not make a partition because of the APFS structure. I thought It had something to do with APFS. Maybe I needed to format it to OS Extended (Journaled). That turns out to be the case.\n\nSo I needed to make a clean install (format internal harddisc), by going into recovery mode. Then I found out I could not erase disk and format it to OS Extended (Journaled) because I could only choose  different APFS structures.   I\nfound a way to fix this. If your in Disk Utility, go to Edit -> delete APFS volume.  Now you can erase disk and format it to OS Extended (Journaled).  Watch this video for instructions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGGWVT39-U  Af\nter doing this my partitioning (step 3 in bootcamp) went without trouble.  I installed windows 7 en continued the proces.\n", "Q: Mac Terminal: Delete a word at time In iTerm2, if I type /one/two/three/four/five and now if I want to delete five and write another string, then how do I delete the word five ?\nIf I use CTRL + W, it deletes the entire command all the way up to the beginning forward slash.\nThis exact same functionality is available on the out-of-the-box Terminal  using option + BACKSPACE by using option key as meta key.

The sound quality is amazing, however, when using Siri through the AirPods, whether invoked on the iPhone or double-tapping the AirPod, Siri's voice quality is very poor.

When I disconnect the AirPods, Siri goes back to speaking in her high quality voice, with the context inflections Apple added not long ago. Is there any way to switch the voice quality for the AirPods? \n\nA: There isn't such things like upgrading the voice quality available right now as far as I know.

I always used firefox before a few days ago, and never had that problem. What you can do though, is taking a portion of the image you want to screenshot; that way it works out without a hitch (just gotta get the dimensions right). Basically, don't take a 'full screen' screen shot, and use alt+4 but make it a bit smaller to bypass their privacy policy. \nMy best bet is that Safari and Netflix have implemented this policy not for screenshots per se, but to prevent recording the video playing and torrenting it. But, because they couldn't address the problem directly, they had to cooperate and do it at the source, i.e. to prevent any and all images (moving or not) from getting recorded.

It's possible when you set up the encryption on the external disk, you saved the password in your Keychain, so in the future macOS reads your keychain for the password to the disk.\nIf you can't remember the password and don't have it elsewhere, then you cannot access the data.\nPut your previous SSD back in your Mac, and either connect the external disk and decrypt it, or inspect the keychain to obtain the password for the disk.\n", "Q: status line in iterm integrated with tmux I was trying to set the iTerm and tmux integration and found that panes could be displayed as iTerm2 window splits, if I run tmux -CC.

So many games would pack the MIDI data and samples into resources in the resource fork of the application. They then interpreted the MIDI data and mixed the samples together at different pitches to make music. There was a developer who released a library that made this all possible. Some games that used this library were:\n\n\n*\n\n*SimCity 2000\n\n*Lemmings\n\n*Wolfenstein 3D\n\n\nSome of the instrument samples were saved as SND resources while others were in a proprietary format (to the library) and were LZW compressed if I recall correctly. 20 years ago, as a hobby, I used to rip the MIDI data out of the resource fork along with the sample data. Then I would put both through a MIDI software sampler and record the resulting music.\nHowever, I can't seem to recall the name of the library the games used or the developer who wrote it. Using this description of the library, can someone recall and tell me the name of it and the developer? For some reason, \"csnd\" rings a bell, but that hasn't turned up anything on Google.\nI'm also pretty sure a shareware version of the library was on the CD in the back of a book entitled Tricks of the Mac Game Programming Gurus. I've since gotten rid of the book. \n\nA: I did some research and reverse-engineering on this recently. The library was called SoundMusicSys, and there's now an open-source version of it called miniBAE (Beatnik Audio Engine) which appears to be mostly based on the original code.\nIt turns out that csnd resources are just normal snd resources that were LZSS compressed and delta-encoded in a few different ways depending on whether they're mono/stereo or 8/16-bit. cmid resources (compressed MIDI) are just LZSS compressed and not delta-encoded. There also appear to be esnd (encrypted snd) and emid (encrypted MIDI) resources, but I couldn't find any examples of these to reverse-engineer. SoundMusicSys used a few other resource types to link the snd/csnd and MIDIs together; the most relevant of these are SONG and INST, which define the instruments and parameters for each tune.\nI wrote a disassembler for classic Mac OS resource forks a while ago, and recently added support for extracting csnd/cmid, INST, and SONG resources in addition to all the normal stuff (snd, MIDI, etc.). Might be useful in playing around with these classic games' content.\n\nA: This isn't a full answer to your question, but...\nMany of the classic Mac OS games used .sad files, but that's probably not the case with the games you've listed as examples.\nCertainly in the case of Lemmings, it actually stored basic sounds as .snd resources. In many cases these .snd resources were part of the MIDI resource you're referring to, and these in turn were used to build the .song resources that produced the music. Users could also use tools like ResEdit to access the data directly. You can still download ResEdit 2.1.3 directly from Apple or from mac.org.\nOther games actually included an Audio CD partition that would be available for the game to play music from, although this certainly isn't the answer to your question.\nI'll do some digging as I still have classic Mac hardware and software. If I come across anything that may shed some light on the library you're looking for I'll be sure to update this.\n", "Q: How to modify text selection in applescript in an automator service I wrote an Automator Service (intended for use on any selected text in any application) that modifies the length of the selection given a number/length that the user specifies.  Here's a snippet of relevant code that excludes all the other features/niceties of the service:\n--Figure out whether the selection must be lengthened or shrunk\nset lengthen to false\nset mod_length to 0\nif character_count is equal to 0 or n is greater than character_count then\n    set lengthen to true\n    set mod_length to n - character_count\nelse\n    set mod_length to character_count - n\n    --This is a trick to make sure arrowing affects the right side of the selection\n    key code 124 using {shift down}\n    key code 123 using {shift down}\nend if\n\nrepeat mod_length times\n    if lengthen is true then\n        --arrow to the right\n        key code 124 using {shift down}\n    else\n        --arrow to the left\n        key code 123 using {shift down}\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nThe service works great in most applications, except Terminal.app (because the arrow keys are used to move the cursor on the command line and not the size of the currently active selection).  Ideally, this would actually work in Terminal, because that's usually where I need to use this service.\nSo is there a way to modify the length of selected text on any line in the history in a Terminal.app window (assuming the first selected character is position 1) using an automator service (and applescript inside that service) in a way that doesn't use the arrow keys?  E.g. I select the output of a command and run the service to adjust the length of the selection to a length I've supplied.\nBackground:\nThe reason I'm doing this is because my work involves DNA manipulation/modification and as a part of the debug process for these scripts, I sometimes need to briefly observe what has happened at a specific position in a DNA string output on the command line - quickly and dirtily - just to confirm an intended change had the intended result.  So this is just a quick way to visually find a coordinate in a long DNA string.  I eventually intend to modify this service in such a way that only certain characters are counted in the determination of the length of the selection (e.g. don't count numbers, spaces, newlines, etc).\n\nA: So as I've learned, there are/were only 3 ways to manipulate the selection in Terminal by entering/using a length value (or via a series of keyboard presses).\n\n\n*\n\n*Accessibility Inspector shows that it should be possible to programmatically manipulate the selection length, because you can edit an existing selection length using the len field in the \"Selected Text Range\" in the \"Advanced\" section by clicking edit and entering a new number, as seen in the screen-cap: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bn2z6ewmdj4mfai/Accessibility_Inspector-selected_text_len.png?dl=0\nThe \"Selected Text Range\" Property/Attribute(?) does not appear to be accessible in AppleScript, though if it was accessible, it would be here: (text area of (scroll area 1 of (splitter group 1 of (front window)))) if you have enabled UI elements in your Applescript.  It might be possible to access these values, as @CJK indicated in the comments via Objective-C.  Applescript however, even if it could access the variable, likely wouldn't have the ability to alter it.\nOne useful feature to see what applescript can manipulate or has access to is to simply return attributes or return properties.  For example:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    if UI elements enabled is false then\n        set UI elements enabled to true\n        if UI elements enabled is false then error \"Can't do it\"\n    end if\n    tell application process \"Terminal\"\n        tell window 1\n            tell splitter group 1\n                tell scroll area 1\n                    --return properties\n                    return attributes\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\n\n*This method, as of OS X 10.8 no longer works, but making a selection in Terminal using the keyboard used to be possible, as described here.  All you had to do was hit Command-Option-Return, navigate to the region you want to select with the arrow keys, hit return, select from the cursor position using the arrow keys, and hit return.  I searched for the ability to re-enable this feature, but came up dry.\n\n*There is a way to select text in the Terminal using the keyboard, but it's very limited.  You can select text between \"marks\" using Command-Shift-A (not including the lines that the marks are on).  Marks are added by default on every command prompt line.  However, you can add marks by right-clicking a selection and typing Command-U.  Marks are only per-line however, not specific to the selection start/stop on a line.  If you right-click any unselected text that is soft-wrapped (i.e. multi-line string) and add a mark, a separate mark is added for every soft-wrapped line.  You cannot select text between multiple marks, nor is it possible to add marks via applescript, thus it's not possible to use this to adjust a selection length programmatically.  More info on marks can be found here.\nI had also explored what the arrow keys are supposed to be able to do, since shift-{left,right}-arrow for me enters the strings \";2C\" and \";2D\" with a beep on the command line for me.  So I removed those entries from the table in Terminal -> Preferences -> Profiles -> Keyboard to prevent that.  I had hoped it would allow me to select text (at least on the current line prompt) using shift-arrow but all it did was move the cursor without selecting.\nHowever, given the goal of this endeavor (to see where a coordinate is in a selected string), you can accomplish this via a dialog box from the Automator service using an Applescript.  All you have to do is present the selection in a dialog box and if the target length is longer than the selection, you have to fill the remaining characters with a dummy character ('N' for DNA).\nYou can do this strategy conditionally, only when Terminal is the frontmost application.  Note, this is not the entire script - just a snippet, but you can see the entire script here, which contains lots of bells & whistles unrelated to this question.\n--Check the length of the selected text passed in\nset character_count to count characters of ((input as string) as string)\n\nset lengthen to false\nset mod_length to character_count - n\n--Figure out whether the selection must be lengthened or shrunk\nif character_count is equal to 0 or n is greater than character_count then\n    set lengthen to true\n    set mod_length to n - character_count\nend if\n\n--See if we're in Terminal\nset isTerminal to ((name of first process where it is frontmost) as string) is equal to \"Terminal\"\n\nif isTerminal is true then\n    if lengthen is true then\n        set substr to (input as string)\n        repeat mod_length times\n            set substr to substr & \"N\"\n        end repeat\n    else\n        set substr to text 1 thru n of (input as string)\n        set substr to substr & (text (n + 1) thru character_count of (input as string))\n    end if\n    ignoring application responses\n        display dialog \"Length \" & n & \" is selected below:\" default answer substr buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"Selected Character Position\"\n    end ignoring\nend if\n\n--Trick to make sure arrow presses affect the right side of the selection instead of the left\nif not (character_count is equal to 0 or n is greater than character_count) then\n    key code 124 using {shift down}\n    key code 123 using {shift down}\n    key code 124 using {shift down}\nend if\n\nrepeat mod_length times\n    if lengthen is true then\n        key code 124 using {shift down}\n    else\n        key code 123 using {shift down}\n    end if\nend repeat\ndelay 1\n\nThat will effectively accomplish the end-goal.  Unfortunately, the position has to be marked with a text marker in a variable-width type face since dialog boxes don't allow formatting or automatic selection of text.\n", "Q: Where are text replacements stored?

Also, there is no Microsoft Reserved partition, but that is not unusual on Macs.\nInstalling Linux Mint without a swap partition seems like a dangerous move.\nI would assume gdisk would display type 8300 and 8200 for linux and swap. You show the legacy value of 0700.\nI assume you using GRUB as your boot manager. I would recommend the Mac built in Startup Manager. This would require multiple EFI partitions. Or a better alternative would be multiple small HFS+ partitions, each with a silent rEFInd installed.\nBefore any major upgrade, I suppose backing up the values in the GPT is a good idea. You could use the gpt command to write the GPT to the EFI partition as a text file. Also, I suppose you could copy the files in the EFI to a dmg file.\nAn upgrade fro 10.11.6 to 10.12.x would probably not present any major problems. Upgrading to 10.13.x can cause issues if your /dev/disk0 is a SSD. It has been reported that the macOS boot partition is converted to APFS when /dev/disk0 is a SSD.\nAlso, keeping a USB Windows 10 installer handy is a good idea.

The choice given is between a fast SSD drive (but smaller) and a larger HD (but 2x the size).

Other common text editor features I can find in either Atom, Sublime Text, or VS Code and I am pretty happy with them.\n\nA: BBEdit is a really great Mac text editor, and can show invisible characters.\nhttp://www.barebones.com\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut switch to space I just found out about the ^1, ^2 etc. keyboard shortcuts for switching to desktops.\n\nThose only do desktops though.\nHow can I set-up keyboard shortcuts to switch to spaces?\nE.g. full-screen safari is space 1, desktop is space 2, safari's fullscreen video that's being played is space 3.\n\n\nA: I'm afraid this is one of those features that was just really badly thought-through from the outset, when the new fullscreen paradigm was added, & hasn't been fixed yet.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can only use key commands to go directly to numbered Spaces.\n\n*Fullscreen Spaces don't have a number.\n\n*Catch 22\n\n\nBest you can do is use the number keys to get to the last numbered Space, then  Ctrl ⌃   →  to get to the fullscreen Space you require.\nYet another reason I never use fullscreen.\nBTW, according to your Shortcuts picture, you only have one Space set up. The  Ctrl ⌃   [num]  shortcuts are added automatically [but not activated by default] as you add each potential Space.\n\nCompared to my 7...\n\nSafari full-screened to the right, as an example. Spaces have numbers, fullscreens have names.\n\n", "Q: Software export compliance for App Store I have developed a game for iOS platform. This game uses Google Analytics.\nI have following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is my game(software) subject to export compliance for App Store submission?\n\n*Do I need to provide any documents related to export compliance for App Store submission?\n\n\nI would appreciate any suggestion and thoughts on this topic. Thank you.\n\nA: Usually Google Analytics contacts Google's servers over SSL. It is an encrypted connection.\nTherefore yes, your app is subject to export compliance for App Store submission.\nUsually you do not have to provide any documents to Apple for App Store submission. You just have to answer a simple questionnaire on the web site, which you're automatically asked.\nYou might also have to file a self-classification report annually to relevant US authorities, but this doesn't have anything to do with Apple. Instructions on doing that can be found here:\nHow to file an Annual Self Classification Report\n", "Q: Second screen is detected by OSX but isn't turned on I have a MacBook Pro 2017, running High Sierra 10.13.3 (17D102) connected to a ThinkPad USB-C Dock, and  two Dell U2412M screens attached to the dock, one by HDMI to Thunderbolt and the other by DisplayPort to DisplayPort.\nOSX successfully detects both screens, as seen in Displays dialog,\n\nBut for some reasons, most of the time, the secondary screen stays turned off. It might, or might not, wake up anytime during my work on the computer. The behavior of it is pretty inconsistent.\nI tried changing the connections to every possible variation, DisplayPorts only, switching ports, literally everything, but the behavior of the second screen keeps being unstable. \nWhat am I missing? Why is the second screen mistreats me like that?\n\nA: Multiple monitors connected as your by DisplayPort (and/or HDMI converted from DisplayPort) served by a USB-C dock won't work on macOS. It will work on Windows, which is what Lenovo advertises.\nFor macOS you'll need a Thunderbolt dock instead to be able to do this.\nA different solution is to plug one monitor into the dock, and the other monitor into the Mac. However you'll need to connect two cables to the computer this way, which is probably what you want to avoid when using a dock.\n", "Q: Is my external USB drive causing erratic sleep/hibernate behaviour? I've been reading up around sleep settings as I keep finding my Late 2012 Mac Mini in a weird hung state each morning that requires a force-reboot (it's like running Windows 10 years ago!)\nI thought the \"deep sleep\" function was to blame but when I ran pmset-g I got this:\nSystem-wide power settings:\nCurrently in use:\n standby              0\n Sleep On Power Button 1\n womp                 1\n autorestart          0\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n powernap             0\n networkoversleep     0\n disksleep            10\n sleep                60\n autopoweroffdelay    14400\n hibernatemode        0\n autopoweroff         1\n ttyskeepawake        1\n displaysleep         10\n standbydelay         4200\n\nHowever Difference between autopoweroff and standby in pmset says:\n\nWith the release of the OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 supplemental update\n  2.0, a new feature was introduced to enter safe sleep after four hours of the computer being connected to AC power. This is an effort to\n  comply with the European Energy Standards (ErP Lot6). This will only\n  occur if there is no wireless or Ethernet activity and no activity\n  from external devices such as USB storage devices.\n\nI have an external USB hard-drive as the 2nd drive on my SSD MacMini as my main data drive. If this is turned off, I recently noticed the system won't boot (folder with a question mark) which seems odd for an ancillary drive. Either way, would the presence of this drive prevent deep-sleep/hibernate/standby?\n\n\n*\n\n*It will sleep a couple of hours fine, it's only overnight it has issues\n\n*It generally still has lights on my connected USB mini-hub when it is frozen\n\n*It typically \"semi-wakes\"; the screen recognises an active input and typically I get a black screen with a responsive mouse cursor\n\n\nI started writing a totally different question but then was thinking whether my USB drive might be a culprit here or I should be looking elsewhere?\nHow can I tell if the Mac is is sleeping Vs standby Vs hibernate Vs deep-sleep to track down which transition or action is causing the problem?\n\nA: To determine the sleep mode it is using, you would have to peruse the system.log in the Console.app (Applications > Utilities).\nThe problem when trying to wake it up sounds like there is an issue with the external USB drive not responding properly.  It could be a compatibility issue with the drive, the \"USB mini-hub\" is getting in the way, or a power-related issue where the USB hub needs power from the Mac to spin up the USB drive but it can't until the Mac responds.\nTry plugging the drive directly into the MacMini instead of using the USB hub and see if the problem continues.\nYou could reconfigure the power management settings to not sleep.  The MacMini uses very few watts of power when idle so the cost is minor compared to the issues here.\nYou could also try using this command to configure the USB drive to not power down when idle.  This might trick the MacMini into thinking it is still being used so it wouldn't go to sleep.  (It has been a long time since I used this command so I'm not sure it still works)\n/usr/bin/touch /Volumes/USB_DRIVE_NAME/.keepDriveAwake\n", "Q: Bluetooth module do not see any discoverable device My MacBookPro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) do not see any Bluetooth device.

I've tried to find out the root cause on many occassions - but I'm pretty sure it's a culmination of many, many different factors (wear and tear, bumps/drops, formatting drives repeatedly, etc.). Just found this though:\n\n§ UHE Button Operation:\n  Your Bluetooth USB adapter may have UHE button, this is applied in the condition\n  when computer system is without BTW driver installed but need to make\n  connection with Bluetooth enabled keyboard or mouse or any HID devices\n\nI also use iTerm2, which is notorious for provisioning issues (can't have a worse problem when it comes to the command line).\nBluetooth gets in the way a lot (for me), so I've messed with the settings quite a bit. I wouldn't be surprised if the same was true for you. Likely through iTerm as well, which worsened the situation.\nThe largest cause seems to be from inconsistent settings, firmware upgrades, and the kernel issues that come with them. Doesn't take long for it to start taking a toll on the battery, power settings, and worsening kernel panics, kind of like this (old but relevant): https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-506162.html\nYou will have to dig deep. But the issue is buried under some random setting, plugin, or other microscopic detail. Find the source, then patch the kernel appropriately.  \n", "Q: My iPad won't turn on I turned my iPad off fully (with the whole \"slide to shut off\" thing) and then turned it back on. After a few minutes the lock screen came up, showing 86% battery, but the finger controls weren't working. now i can't even get it to turn on.

That might fix yor problem.\n", "Q: Can I use Messages on OS X for two different iPhones with two different Apple IDs? I have two iPhones (one personal and one business), each with a separate Apple ID, so I can keep these logically separated. Ideally, I'd like to use Messages on OS X to be able to send and receive iMessages and/or text messages via both phones. As far as I can see, I can only configure one Apple ID against Messages (in Messages preferences, I cannot add another Apple ID). Is there perhaps a way to run another instance of Messages and/or add my other Apple ID?\nI'm on OS X 10.11 and iOS 11, if it matters.\n\nA: Depending on how committed you are, you could install a virtual machine on OSX and from there login to your business iTunes account. Furthermore, it's possible to drag just the iMessages application (from the virtualized OSX instance) to your Dock giving the impression of running two different iMessages accounts simultaneously.\nI've accomplished similar tasks using VMware for Mac, but Virtual Box may be a good free alternative.\n", "Q: Can I use AppleScript to detect if there are any windows on screen? I have a bash script that requires to know if there are any windows on the current screen. I couldn't do it in bash so maybe there is a way. Also, if I could find if there is an active window (if there are windows on the screen) that would be great but it is not that important. Thanks\n\nA: This is one of those tasks that, on the surface of it, is fairly simple to do, but when you experiment a bit more, turns out can be a little tricky, as not every application or application window reports their properties or attributes completely truthfully all of the time.\nThis line of AppleScript is the most conventional and commonly-used way to get a list of open windows from applications running on your system: \n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        get every window of every process whose background only is false\n\nThis will give you a list of even those windows that are currently minimised and sitting under their dock icon.  You can get a list of only those windows that are not minimised, and thus visible on your screen at that moment:\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        get every window of (every process whose visible is true)\n\nHowever, this will occasionally miss detecting some windows of background only applications (some menu bar apps) that don't report as being visible even when their windows are open.  So, to catch those, you can use this:\n    tell application \"System Events\" to get windows of ¬\n        (every process whose class of windows contains window) ¬\n            whose value of attribute \"AXMinimized\" is false\n\nThis has the nice benefit of returning only non-empty nests of lists in AppleScript, is my favourite method to use as being one that catches background only, \"invisible\" windows.\nTo call these commands from bash, you can use this:\n    osascript \\\n        -e 'tell application \"System Events\"' \\\n        -e '    get every window of (every process ¬' \\\n        -e '        whose background only is false  ¬' \\\n        -e '        and visible is true)' \\\n        -e 'end tell'\n\nThis is the combination of the first two examples I gave, which returns a comma-delimited list of windows denoted by their titles, like this:\n,,, window Edit - Ask Different of application process Safari,, \\\n    window ~ — osascript  /Users/CK — ttys000 — ⌘1 of application process Terminal,, \\\n    window Untitled 2 of application process Script Editor, \\\n    window Messages of application process Script Editor, \\\n    window Library of application process Script Editor\n\n(I've split the output over several lines for readability.)  Note the three leading commas, which, in AppleScript, are where you'd get empty nesting lists featuring as a result of processes that are visible and in the foreground, but simply don't have any open windows, thus return {} in AppleScript, which becomes an empty string \"\" in stdout.\nAs you can see, I have this Safari window open; a Terminal window open; and three Script Editor windows open.  However, it missed my Instagram feed window.  Here's the other example run in bash:\n    osascript \\\n        -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to ¬' \\\n        -e '    get every window of (every process ¬' \\\n        -e '        whose class of windows contains window) ¬' \\\n        -e '    whose value of attribute \"AXMinimized\" is false'\n\nwhich returns this for me right now:\n    window Edit - Ask Different of application process Safari, \\\n    window ~ — osascript  /Users/CK — ttys000 — ⌘1 of application process Terminal, \\ \n    window Untitled 2 of application process Script Editor, \\\n    window Messages of application process Script Editor, window Library of application process Script Editor, \\\n    window Main Window of application process Flume\n\n(Flume is my Instagram app.)  However, the cost of using this method is a bit more processing time (a couple of seconds).\nFinally, if all you require is just the actual number of open windows on your screen to determine whether this is non-zero or whatever, then simply swap get every window... with get the number of (windows...) in whichever method you end up choosing to use.\n\nNote: Some of these commands may work differently on older systems.  I tested these on Mac OS 10.13 using AppleScript 2.7.  However, very occasionally, System Events can throw an error.  Please run the command again.  This is not a problem with the script, but an issue with System Events and its occasional temperamental behaviour.\n", "Q: Do different Macs have different quality audio ADCs? I want to digitize a bunch of records from my turntable onto my Mac.  I've got a couple different Macs available with \"audio in\" minijacks: a Mac Pro and a Mac Mini, for example.\nDo they differ in the quality of the audio they can record?  Does the Mac Pro have better ADCs or better shielding, for example?  Played back as lossless audio files to a hi-fi system, will I ever notice the difference?\n\nA: The physical 3.5mm input jacks are likely the same or nearly identical, but the relative quality will be determined by the audio chipset used. I would check System Report on both machines, go to Audio, and see what chipsets are being used. It may not show you enough detail to know exactly which version it is, but hopefully will provide enough detail to research their respective specs online.\nI wouldn't use the 3.5mm jack though. Since you have a Mac Pro you should have an on optical input available. This will be much higher resolution than the mini jack - 24bit/48k vs 16bit/44k (in most cases). Take advantage of that with something inexpensive like a Behringer UCA202 ($25 I believe.) The ADC's on it are designed for digitizing vinyl, and it has an optical out that you can connect to your Mac Pro, for the cleanest possible signal transfer to your recording software. Most people who digitize vinyl do it at 24/48 because of the added headroom it provides.\n(Edit: I should have asked if your turntable's amp provides RCA outs, because that's how you would connect it to the Behringer. If it only has 3.5mm out, and you don't want to purchase a separate preamp, then your only choice would be to plug it in directly to one of your Mac's 3.5mm jacks. Just realize those are very low fidelity inputs without much amperage, so you will need to do major volume boosting in your recording software to compensate, which will introduce noise.)\n", "Q: Can Turbo Booster (3rd Party Application) damage your CPU? I have turbo booster installed on my old macbook pro which I currently use to handle files between my iMac Pro and the macbook. The macbook has a base clock of 1.4 Ghz turbo boost upto 2.3 Ghz. On enabling turbo bosster (Third Party application) the system continues to run at 2.3 Ghz as a result everything is fast enough to run, but on running the CPU at its maximum level results in thermal throttling. Turbo Boosters are normally used to check thermal throtlling and I am using it to boost the clock speed so am I doing something wrong or damaging the CPU and other hardware componenets by running the CPU at its max level? \n\nA: No, using Turbo Boost will not damage your CPU or any other hardware components.\nYou seem to be confused about how Turbo Boost actually works. When you install a third-party application to disable/enable the Turbo Boost feature, you're not actually enabling the boosting of the CPU. Instead you're enabling the feature where the CPU decides by itself when and if to boost.\nSo in essence: You're not really turbo boosting all the time, and the CPU will by itself make sure to only turbo boost when it is safe to do so.\nThe rationale behind the third party applications is mainly to disable Turbo Boost for those that prefer increased battery time over performance.\n", "Q: 5K external screen with 2015 15 inch retina MBP with Intel Iris Pro graphics Has anyone tried whether Intel Iris Pro found in 2015 retina MBP is powerful enough to drive single 5K screen like Dell UltraSharp UP2715K or Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS or Philips 275P4VYKEB or HP Z27q? (basically all the ones that aren't relying on usb c/thunderbolt 3 connector like LG 27MD5KB-B UltraFine)?\nI'm trying to find an external screen for my MBP and unfortunately due to macOS/OSX's focus on retina screens, non retina screens (fonts mainly) look pathetically bad, whereas Windows (even launched within OSX via RDC) looks sweet. So the only option is to either go 4k but that means usable resolution would be 1080p or 5k with usable 1440p. Hence I'm wondering if it can drive 5k screens.\n\nA: No, the mid-2015 15\" Retina MacBook Pro is not powerful enough to drive a 5k-display.\nYou can see the specifications here:\nMid-2015 Retina MacBook Pro Technical Specifications\nYou're limited to driving up to a 3840x2160 pixels external display via the Thunderbolt/mini-DisplayPort port while using the built-in display. \nFor the HDMI video output you can go up to 4096x2160, but only at 24 Hz.

A shut down computer has less surface area to attack.\nWho is the Attacker?\nIf the attacker is a nation state, well funded, or highly motivated, then the difference between a computer that is asleep, logged out, or locked is likely insignificant. For all these states, the computer is booted with the storage accessible to at least one process.\nIf the attacker is one of the above, then physical access will be enough to compromise your computer.\n", "Q: Why could turning off my external data store hang my Mac, and how do I fix it?

I will need an additional 1-2 TBs fast storage, used for Virtual Machines or Video Editing. I don't mind using an external drive, the challenge is I will use on a 2 hr commute each way by train.\nI am wondering if there are any existing products that allow storage to clip on underneath the laptop or screen, etc rather than hange off the side.\n\nA: I would recommend buying a Samsung T5 SSD. They're available in 1 and 2 TB capacities, and they offer fast storage that you can use for video editing and/or virtual machines.\nThe product itself does not offer a clip-on feature - but I don't think such a product exists on the market.\nHowever the product is in itself very light (51 gram) and small (7.4 x 1.05 x 5.73 cm). I would suggest buying a simple adhesive velcro tape and apply that to the T5 drive and your MacBook Pro. This would allow you to clip-on the storage when needed.\n", "Q: Copy contents from one excel file to another using Applescript I am trying to copy contents from a source excel file after editing a few rows and paste that into a new workbook.

Thank you!\nEdit: Running macOS 10.13.3\n\nA: My initial suggestion to the problem was to replace the actions you currently have in your Automator workflow with a Run AppleScript action that uses this command:\n    tell application \"Finder\" to get every item ¬\n        in the (path to documents folder) ¬\n            whose modification date < ((current date) - 30 * days) ¬\n            and label index is not 2\n\nYou would then have either added an action after this to trash those items, or change get every item to delete every item in the script.  However, as @user3439894 pointed out, this won't traverse folder trees, so any items inside a folder that are older than 30 days (and not tagged red) will escape detection.\nThe following script is an example of a method that uses recursion to descend through the directory tree deleting files (or marking them for deletion) as it goes:\n    property D : {}  # The files to delete\n    property R : path to documents folder  # The root of the directory tree structure\n    property age : 30 * days\n    property red : 2\n\n\n    descend into R\n\n    # tell application \"Finder\" to delete D\n    return D\n\n\n    to descend into here\n        local here\n\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n\n            # Mark files which are older than 30 days for deletion\n            # EXCEPT any that are tagged red\n            set end of D to every file in here whose label index is not red ¬\n                and modification date < (current date) - age\n\n            # This checks to see if, following the purge, the \n            # current folder will become empty.  If so, it can \n            # be deleted too.  It adds to processing time, so\n            # remove this code block if you don't need it.\n            count the last item of D\n            if the result is equal to (count the files in here as alias list) ¬\n                and (count the folders in here) is 0 then\n                set the end of D to here\n                return\n            end if\n\n            # This ensures folders tagged red and their contents\n            # are spared from the purge\n            get the folders in here whose label index is not 2\n\n            repeat with F in the result\n                set F to the contents of F  # de-referencing\n\n                descend of me into F\n            end repeat\n\n        end tell\n    end descend\n\nI have tested it briefly on my own fairly complex tree structure, and it appeared to work successfully.  However, I'm writing this and testing it whilst quite tired, but regardless, I would always strongly advise that you test this script yourself on dummy files and folders to ensure it works.  Please report back on how it goes, including—if they arise—any errors, with specific details on how I can reproduce the error myself.\n", "Q: Folder Actions missing in High Sierra? I've been using folder actions for years.  Ever since upgrading to High Sierra, my folder actions still work but the ability to add new ones is missing.

DNS server address and search domain / suffix:\na) DNS Server 10.10.10.10\na) Search domain .intern\nb) DNS Server 172.16.30.1\nb) Search domain .home\nRight now the Ethernet (b) is on top of the list:\n \nIf I now want to connect (ping) to a device in test network (b) it works:\nping ubuntu.work\n\nBut If I try to connect (ping) to a device in the company network (a) it doesn't work:\nping server.intern\n\nI tried to switch the order of the devices (first Wi-Fi, second Ethernet) and then the issue swaps around (now .intern works but .work not anymore). For me it seems that macOS is sticky to the first (main?) network interface. I also tried to set the test network (Ethernet - when on top of the adapter list) to manual IP and to leave the DNS server / search domain empty, but even then the DNS from the second device (Wi-Fi) will not be used.\nDoes anyone have a solution for that?\nCan't be that I am the first one to come over that issue \n\nA: The problem that you are having is that you have two separate networks with their own DNS that don't know about each other - .intern and .home.  \nThe problem comes in when you try to ping a host on a network (whichever is primary; let's assume .home) to another network (.intern).  It will fail because the DNS for .home knows nothing about the .intern domain.  It will assume the request needs to be forwarded to the ISP's DNS; and they don't know about that domain either.\nYou can fix this by enabling Unbound DNS resolver on your Mac so it can query itself. You will need to configure it to perform a split-horizon DNS service.  Then, set your Mac to query only itself for DNS lookups.\nBasically, your Mac becomes a DNS server that's aware of both networks and will respond to its DNS queries accordingly. \n\nA: Take a look at this:\nhttps://verynomagic.com/2015/07/multiple-dns-resolvers-in-os-x.html\nBasically, just create a file named 'intern' in /etc/resolver with the following contents:\ndomain intern\nnameserver NAMESERVER\n\nJust replace NAMESERVER with the ip address of your internal dns server.\nNow your default nameserver will resolve requests as normal (the nameserver that's provided by the interface at the top of your network device list). But any requests to something like 'server.intern' will use the name resolution settings you provided in /etc/resolvers/intern\n", "Q: How to run a root/admin shell in Terminal?

It downloads Windows Support files, but 9 times out of 10 the laptop crashes at the step of “Saving Windows Support files” – but force restarting allows me to alt/option-boot into the Windows installer anyway: great.\nBoot into Windows 10 installer, format Boot Camp partition, select Windows version (have tried both Pro and Home) — it gets through copying, expanding, installing Windows files… but then I get an error every time at \"Installing Updates” – error code 0x80070002, can't find drivers compatible with this hardware — Windows will restart (doesn't restart, just goes to a black backlit screen and stays there until I force restart).\nOk. Delete the partition, download the Windows Support Drivers to a FAT-formatted USB drive, then repeat all the above. Same exact thing. \nOk. Delete, repeat, but once booted into the Windows installer, first click \"Load drivers\" and select the OSXRESERVED partition: shows up all the driver folders, but shows no actual driver files when you navigate to any of the folders. Un-check \"Hide drivers that aren't compatible with this hardware”, and a few drivers show up for each piece of hardware — install them all. Proceed to Windows install – no dice, same error at “Installing updates” stage.\nOk. Delete, repeat, “Load drivers” but check the USB instead of OSXRESERVED — same thing, folders are there but drivers don't show up unless I un-check the ‘Hide non-compatible drivers’ option.\nOk. Try again with Windows 8.1 instead of Windows 10, and older version of the support software (Boot Camp Support 5.1.5722) on the USB. \nThis time Boot Camp Assistant actually completes the “Saving support files” portion of the automatic driver download, and asks for admin password for restart, instead of crashing. Great. Boot into Windows 8.1 installer – it requires a license key instead of having the “I don't have a license key” option, but find one online to get me to the next step. This time it hangs indefinitely at 24% of copying Windows files.\nAnyone have any advice?

Suppose I want to open a specific app which has an icon on the menu bar tray, is it possible to do it using a shell command? \nIn my case, there is an app called \"Quick View Calendar\" (available in Mac App Store) which shows up in the Menu bar, which I would like to open with a Terminal command and to use that code to run an Automator service to \n\nA: Since all that's required is a single click to the menu bar icon in order to open the app, AppleScript can achieve this very easily using GUI scripting, which requires the right accessibility permissions to be granted to whichever program you'll use to execute the AppleScript (e.g. Script Editor, Automator, Terminal, etc..).\nSo, first, grant the appropriate permissions via System Preferences.  This screenshot is from MacOS 10.13:\n\nAfter this is done, open up Script Editor and run this script.  I don't have Quick Calendar View myself, but the principles for most menu bar apps are the same, so this will hopefully obtain a list of application names that have icons sitting in your menu bar:\n    tell application \"System Events\" to get the name of ¬\n        every process whose class of menu bar 2 is menu bar \n\n\"Quick View Calendar\" or something appropriately similar ought to appear in the list that is returned by running that command.  This is the name that I've used in the following snippet, which is what actually does what you need, namely to issue a mouse click to the menu bar icon and open the application.  If the name is something different, you can change that yourself:\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Quick View Calendar\" to ¬\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n\nYou can paste this code into a Run AppleScript action in Automator (again, provided Automator has been granted accessibility permissions), which will then become part of your workflow in creating the service you want to create.\nYour original request was to run a command from Terminal to perform this action, so you can simply open up Terminal (again, accessibility permissions!), and type this:\n    osascript \\\n        -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to ¬' \\\n        -e 'tell process \"Quick View Calendar\" to ¬' \\\n        -e 'click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2'\n\nIf you run into any problems, let me know.\n\nA: Terminal (bash, csh, zsh, et. al.) doesn't \"open\" menu bar commands.  This is what AppleScript is for - it scripts the GUI.\nTo get an application to \"execute\" an option/function on the command line that would normally accessed through the menu bar, you pass command line parameters.  Typically, the command looks like this:\n$ command -x [optional arguments]\n\nThe above command will execute with the option flag x (where x is any flag that the command accepts) and any optional arguments for that flag.\nThe caveat here is that the application must accept command line options.  If it doesn't there will be nothing you can script from the command line to do what you want. \nIf that is the case, look to AppleScript, but be aware, that not all apps are scriptable under AppleScript.\n\nA: You can compile a very simple 14-line Foundation framework app, that will from then on give you the ability to click any point x/y onscreen, \n[ Contents drawn back due to massive anonymous down-voting … ]\n", "Q: Backup of iPhone I have two iPhones, when I back up one of them I have multiple dates of files when this as done. When I back up the other one there is only one file and that is the last date backed up, it appears to write over the same file, how I get back to another backup up file?  \n\nA: By default iTunes doesn't work in the way you're expecting, and with good reason. iOS backups take quite a bit of space and most users would run our of storage space pretty quickly if each iOS backup was being kept (especially with multiple iOS devices).\nWhile you can get around this default behaviour, it's quite a manual process and would require doing it each time you backup your iPhone. \nAs for your statement: \n\nI have two iPhones, when I back up one of them I have multiple dates\n  of files when this as done.\n\nIt's not clear exactly what is happening and how, but your best bet is to make sure you have a backup regime in place. Assuming you're on a Mac, then using Time Machine is a good example of this (but there are many options available - both for Mac and PC).\nOnce you have a backup regime in place, your backups will include your iPhone backups as well (unless you've specifically excluded them). In this way, if/when you need to go back to an older iPhone backup, you can.\n\nA: As mentioned above iTunes maintains only one backup per device. Every time you backup your device, your last backup is overwritten. You can choose to 'Archive' a backup in iTunes’ Preferences - Devices tab, right click a backup and select archive. This won’t overwrite the backups, but still each backup takes up a LOT of space.\nIt does not have to take up a lot of space. I work with the team behind iMazing, and it makes a 'shallow' copy of the current backups, so that the next time you back up, you will still have access to your previous backups, and only the files which have changed will take up disk space. \n", "Q: Script to toggle between fn keys (with Touchbar) I'm trying to write a script to toggle between Fn keys and app controls on the Touchbar using macOS High Sierra.

My wife has a new MacBook Pro from 2016 with USB-C. I was wondering whether I could technically (in the matter of electronic feasability) use her charging cable on my MacBook and vice versa with some sort of adapter / dongle, and, if so, where I would get one?\n\nA: You can buy adapters (dongle) that converts USC-C PD signals to Magsafe1 and 2 (and in fact to any needed voltage to any old laptop). There also the inverse adapters that converts from a Magsafe 1 or 2 chargers to USB-C output to charge a modern computer although less useful.\nThe irrational claims of how a computer or a charger could be fried is just a old wives fable. You cannot over draw current for a USB-C PD charger because it will shut down. The charger cannot provide more than its design capacity nor provide more current than the load needs! \nThe reverse of charger providing \"too much\" of something or another that could fry a computer is also untrue. No computer use the direct charger input for operating the computer or charging the battery. The voltage is regulated by a DC-DC converter to generate the needed voltages. If the provided voltage  too low, it will not charger; if the voltage is too high, the charging circuit will shut down.\n\nA: Electrically, it is possible to go from either direction, it just requires a computer (microprocessor, etc) in between to do the USB-C PD negotiation. As people have noted, there are plenty of MagSafe2 → USB-C PD options.\nThere are only 3 wattages for MagSafe2[1] chargers and they have well known voltage / currents. The MacBook knows what the max wattage for the charger is by getting the id of the charger from the MagSafe2 plug itself. It won't draw more current than the charger will allow because it knows which charger is plugged in. Any USB-C → MagSafe2 dongle would essentially ensure the wattage via USB is available and emulate the correct MagSafe2 charger ID.\nThere does not seem to be a USB-C PD → MagSafe2 option, possibly because it would require a charger that supports enough wattage to both power the MacBook (45W/65W/80W) and the dongle itself. So at a minimum, ~50W to supply 45W (which is only enough for a MBAir and not enough for a Pro).\n[1] http://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardown-and-exploration-of-magsafe.html\n\nA: You don't want to mix those two.\nWhy?\nBecause the USB-C port conforms to the USB 3.1 Power Delivery Specification whereas the Magsafe charger does not.  Part of that specification includes the negotiation of delivered power.  The Magsafe will not negotiate how much power is supplied.  What it's looking for is the presence of the 1 wire charging circuit before it begins charging.  \nThere may be adapters/converters on the market that will convert one interface to the other and vice versa, but (IMO) those cheap adapters are not worth the risk of sending the wrong voltage to your very expensive MacBook Pro.\nBottom line, use the genuine adapters built and designed for your MacBook Pro.\n\nA: As others have said, the standards being different makes this kind of dangerous if you're not careful what you're buying.\nBut if you only want the magnetic connector (so that it doesn't pull the laptop with it when tripped and such, you could try one of these options to convert the USB-C connector to a magnetic one.\n\nA: The ElecJet Anywatt One fills this need, for the purpose of powering a USB-C device from a MagSafe power supply.\nFrom the product page:\n\nAnywatt built-in self-developed LDR6032 smart chip supports the latest USB C Power Delivery & PPS protocol, Automatically recognize the end device needed power and adapt the voltage and current to best suit the end device charging purpose, range from 5V@3A 9V@3A 12V@3A 15V@3A 20V@2.25A and PPS 3-12V@3A MAX.\n\nIt is not licensed by Apple. That said, I own one and have been using it without incident to connect my 2016 MacBook Pro (87W) to my Thunderbolt Display; it can't provide the full 87W, so the battery charges somewhat more slowly than it would if I had the big charger with me, but it's been fully adequate in practice.\n", "Q: Image Capture and CanoScan 8800F I have discovered, through personal experience and checking online forums, that the software for my 10-year old, CanoScan 8800f, film and negative scanner is no longer supported for High Sierra users.

My parents are traveling in Central America, and my mom's iPhone was stolen. She was going to buy another one in Honduras. After their trip wraps up in a month or two, she's going to come back to the US and the vast majority of her future usage will be in the US. \nI'm just wondering if there are any potential problems with this plan. I know that when you setup an iPhone you can choose a particular language, so that isn't a problem. \nOne potential problem is it will probably cost her more, because she'll be buying without the subsidy she'd get from a US carrier. She knows about this and is willing to do it anyway, because she really likes sending photos to us from her trip. \nAre there any other technical or logistical issues? The big one I can think of is maybe the model she'll get will be setup for different cellular bands than the model she'd get in a US. But my information might be dated, perhaps this used to be a bigger problem last decade than now. Plus this is Central America, not Europe or Asia.\nAnyway, this is a pretty wide-ranging question but thanks for any advice you can provide.\nALSO: Since this is a stolen iPhone situation, is there any Apple-specific thing you might recommend? We are already going to 1) Tell Verizon to switch her service to her new iPhone, and 2) Attempt to wipe the phone remotely using Find My iPhone. But I forget if it helps to tell Apple about the theft. This is an older model iPhone (5?) and not on the latest iOS so it might not have some of the latest anti-theft capabilities that I think they put in iOS recently (but forget what they were)\n\nA: There are two issues:\nFirst, while Apple's warranty is international, Apple sometimes limits overseas service to the country where the device was purchased, or requires users to return the item to the US for service. This stackexchange answer has more information.\nSecond, she must be careful to purchase a model which will cover the phone bands she expects to use. iPhones sold in different countries sometimes have different coverage, and often multiple models (band coverage-wise, not \"7\" or \"8\" or \"X\" - wise) are offered. This Apple webpage, for example, lists the models that will provide LTE coverage as well as the bands covered. (I know it's bad form to refer to an external page, but the info is far too large to copy-and-paste into this answer.) \n\nA: People from Brazil usually buy iPhones from USA or Europe, to pay less than we would pay here.\nNever heard of anyone having problems with their phones...\nThose band issues I also think are not a problem anymore.\nI'd say for her to buy it without worries.\nIf anybody knows anything to prove wrong, please, comment here.\n=)\nBest regards.\n", "Q: How do I know if a time machine backup is running? Due to APFS having a mind of its own and filling the hard disk with unwanted snapshots, I made a cron to run tmutil deletelocalsnapshots xxx. Later I found out that running this command while a backup is in progress will stop the backup. How can I know if a time machine backup is in progress to avoid running the command? The man page for tmutil doesn't list any status command.\nRight now I'm doing the following in the script, since now backups mount at /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/:\nls -d /Volumes/Time* 2>/dev/null|grep Machin >/dev/null\n\nif [[ $? != 0 ]]; then\n     # run here tmutil snapshot deletion commands\nfi\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to be very precise. The volume may be mounted some minutes later after a backup has started, and also stopping a backup leaves that mounted volume for a while. Finally, the name of the mounted volume might change in the future, making the check useless.\n\nA: The canonical way to check status of time machine is to use the utility and check status or for newer os check the current phase only:\n tmutil status\n tmutil currentphase\n\nNow, you have to process the text since it reports exit 0 when running and when it's not running since the status returned - not that there's a correct status.\nI would use:\ntmutil status | grep \"Running = 0;\"\n\nThat returns 0 if the system is not currently running and 1 if you are backing up. However, back up on High Sierra implies a non-snapshot event. The snapshots literally are to external drives which literally are not APFS. Only the internal SSD gets APFS treatment and the local snapshots are not something that \"run\" as so much as \"just exist\" and the \"running\" if anything is the thinning process - not the backing up process.\nThe thinning process calls backupd-helper which doesn't have a command line tool to check when done but you can time that running by issuing a blocking call like:\n tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 1000000000\n\nAbove has enough zeros to thin one giga byte - add two zeros to ask for 100 GB back.\n\nI do want to correct (or at least challenge lightly) the concept of too many snapshots. APFS is a copy on write filesystem and the only examples of this being bad seem highly contrived or non-default configurations. The files that are around are already written to disk. The system just is \"lazy\" about cleaning them up and doesn't expend any processing time until it knows the a) system is relatively idle b) storage is relatively idle and not yet running low on free space.\nApple is clearly still in flux with how many snapshots to keep mounted, how to set the cleanup thresholds, how many intervals to keep in situations where the external drive is not connected and the local snapshots exist.\nYou can dig deeper with:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 1\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS\n\nAgain, I've yet to see a place where I needed to thin or delete snapshots out of the automatic process on local volumes. The delete can be handy when you want to purge a large backup from an external drive. The real lever we used to have was to use Time Machine exclusions to omit the backup of large files that had tiny changes. It remains to be seen how APFS reacts to these files - my guess is you may be able to placethose type of files on a different APFS volume and thin aggressively and periodically or continue to watch the backup exclusions to see if that saves you allocated space without slowing down the copy on write performance and storage benefits.\n\nA: Undocumented tmutil status\nThere is an undocumented, and thus subject to change, tmutil status. This call returns the response:\nBackup session status:\n{\n    ClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\n    Running = 0;\n}\n\nYou will need to parse the JSON portion of the response to learn if Time Machine is running.\nLook for backupd\nOn older versions of macOS, if the backupd process is running, then Time Machine is actively backing up.\nSee the StackOverflow question, Check if program is running with bash shell script? for robust methods of checking for a running process.\n\nA: Time Machine itself has a menu bar that you can use. You just need to enable the menu bar item.\nInside the preference pane of Time Machine, there is a checkbox selection for the menu bar item to appear. The menu bar allows you to manually do a backup, if it is doing a backup, and how far along it is.\nEDIT: This however will not allow for you to setup a cron to know when a local snapshot is being taken, you'd have to do it manually.\nEdit 2: down voted or not, those searching for the question titled will find my answer to be helpful.

I tried installing it using a 16gb USB stick  (MSDOS fat32) and no USB since my MacBook can install Windows even without USB flash drive (as mentioned by apple in their website.) Can someone help me with these problems?\n\nA: Cause\nApple allows Windows Installation, by first copying the entire ISO into a temporary storage area.  Most of the time it works, because there is enough space available.\nWhen we use a larger ISO, like the 32-bit + 64-bit Windows ISO, it requires about 6.5 GB just for the storage, let alone uncompressed files usage.  Apple tried to download Windows support software onto that partition.  This is where the issue happens.  The package requires at least 1 GB, and it would not get it because of the ISO.\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the 64-bit ISO (3.5GB) instead of the 32-bit + 64-bit Windows ISO for a x64 MacBook (all current generation ones) \n\n*Use the 32-bit ISO (3.5GB) instead of the 32-bit + 64-bit Windows ISO for a x86 MacBook (2011 etc.)\n", "Q: iPhone Messages app delete confirmation Whenever I attempt to delete a conversation thread in the Messages app on my iPhone, why is it asking me for confirmation?

So far it has been great, does everything I need, no issues with performance. I use it more as a media center than a pc. It's currently hooked up to a 32\" 1080p LED TV through HDMI.\nI'm buying a 4K TV in some time, and just curious I decided to download some 2160p videos, they were very choppy, CPU usage went up to 400% with 20+ threads. It just wasn't working right. RAM usage was around 1.5 GB.\nI've tried using VLC and IINA. Currently running on High Sierra.\nSo my question is if I should try upgrading the HDD to an SSD, as some people suggested me to make it faster? \nShould I be using the Thunderbolt port instead? \nOr is it just time to upgrade my Mac, which I don't really want to right now tbh.\nThank you very much for any suggestions you can give me.\nEdit - Problem seems to only occur when I'm using HEVC/H265 videos in 4K, not H264.\n\nA: The issue is that the the HEVC/H.265 standard is very new, and while there is software support, there hasn't been an update to the Mac mini in a very long time, so there is absolutely no possibility that this has a hardware codec. However H.264 has been around for a long time and there will almost certainly be a hardware codec for this on every device since at least 2010 I would imagine.\nEffectively the only way to decode H.265 videos would be for a software codec to use the CPU, and possibly the very limited GPU power in this machine to process this and that is why your computer will be struggling to playback H.265 and not H.264.\nThere some more details about supported hardware on Apple's website here.\nAlso worth remembering is that 4K support on most older Mac hardware is limited, and while your 2014 machine supports it, there will be no HDR, and only 30Hz / fps screen resolution on this, further details on Apple's website here.\n", "Q: Best way to share all photos with partner I want to create a comprehensive cloud photo archive together with my girlfriend, for all our mobile devices and laptops.\nThis is what we want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Photos should be archived in full resolution\n\n*Photos should be automatically uploaded from iPhones\nI’m a bit desperate because everything I tried so far failed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox: uploads everything into one folder and would mix up the sources of the photos; plus it would require sharing my Dropbox ID\n\n*iCloud: it’s only possible to share albums, so sharing the entire collection is cumbersome.

My Apple hardware report shows nothing out of the ordinary. \nIs there any other reliable way to test my Thunderbolt port without plugging in any hardware or do I have do dig out more money for an adaptor that may or may not work?\n\nA: Just so you know the Thunderbolt ports on your computer have dual purpose, they are also Mini DisplayPort (ports). The cable you are using is actually a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter.\nI've used these a fair bit at home and work, and at least the Apple ones aren't very durable in my experience, it's likely the cable has failed again. Unless you are finding other devices aren't working either, it's likely the cable.\nYou could book a Genius Bar appointment at an Apple Store and see if they can test the port for you with their own known good cables, that way you wouldn't have to buy another cable.\nIn future you could have a look at 3rd party products, StarTech adapters are pretty reliable in my experience but any brand would be worth trying.\n", "Q: After upgrade to HighSierra Finder's Sidebar do not work anymore I have a 13\" early 2014 MacBook Air which had been running El Capitan for some time now.

I did something stupid. I ran (something like) diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 GPT HFS+ newdisk against the wrong disk. It was one of those moments where you realize what you've done, as you're doing it. So it only ran for (literally) about 0.25 seconds, or less, before being terminated (^c), like it was all part of a single motion. But it was long enough to trash the existing partition table.\ntestdisk\nI thought I'd be able to recover the original GUID partition table with testdisk, but apparently not. Maybe because it wasn't just damaged or erased, but already overwritten with a whole new GUID partition table, volume label, etc. I'm not really sure, I didn't write the software or study it comprehensively.\nphotorec\nThe data was largely, (if not completely) untouched, and easily recovered to a separate disk with photorec.

That's what happened to me, I couldn't remember the exact syntax, so I copied it from one of the questions/answers here on Stack Exchange, with the intention of altering it to suit my needs. Problem is, this included the invisible newline/linefeed character at the end of the formatted textbox, causing the command to execute as soon as it's pasted to a shell. Also, diskutil typically doesn't require elevated priveleges. So there's no warning, non prompt, it just happens.\n\nA: Because the GUID Partition Table was erased, there is no way to turn back.

I want to be able to unlock my phone when I’m wearing touch screen compatible gloves. Touch ID doesn’t work with gloves. When I tap the home button to unlock, (sometimes) the phone doesn’t do anything. Just stays on the lock screen. This behavior is inconsistent. \nIf I hold down the home button it activates Siri.\nWhen this is happening, it doesn’t matter how much I mash the home button, I cannot get the phone to give me the option to use my passcode.

Can you post a picture of the disk utility? As I checked mine, all files are encrypted in one drive. You may need to encrypt the separate partition if you opt not to encrypt them before. But if you turn on the Firevault in the beginning then all files should have already been encrypted.\n\n\n\n\nA: Check the article I found on the Apple discussions website regarding FV and APFS.

The message is simply to indicate that your name change must be reviewed at all (so it may not get approved), not to indicate any additional time penalty for review.\n", "Q: MacBook randomly shuts down This is likely the same problem I saw reported countless times. However, mine comes with a twist, so I wonder if anyone can provide extra insight. Briefly, my laptop randomly shuts down (I think it happens only on battery). It's an early 2011 17\" version running the latest macOS.\nA few weeks ago I reinstalled the whole macOS after it wouldn't turn on anymore. I thought it might've been a hardware issue as many people suggest replacing the motherboard, but I was still able to boot it in the safe mode, which would suggest it's a software component issue.\nFast-forward and it's started happening again, although only infrequently and I am able to turn it back on very quickly if I have a charger nearby. Now, here are 2 insights I noticed and wonder if anyone can explain futher.\n1/ Once the laptop \"dies\", I usually need to connect it to the charger to start it again. It feels like giving it some juice to power up. The battery level doesn't seem to play a role here (happens on 90% too). Sometimes if I connect the charger, turn it on, remove charger, it dies instantly. As if I had to keep the charger in for a certain amount of time until it feels confident to run without it. Feels like teaching a child ride a bike.\n2/ Lately, I developed a new theory that it happens only when discharging AND I have to have the laptop on my lap, bed, or other unstable surface. I am paying attention now if it happens again when I work on desk, I couldn't replicate it so far. It's this point that drives me crazy, wondering what it could be.\nAny experience with this issue is welcome. \n[UPDATE]: I removed case from the Macbook, dusted it off a bit and since then it's been running without any issues again. I haven't changed any settings or components. Computers are weird.\n\nA: The symptom of powering off suddenly at various charge states (sometimes 25% left, sometimes 75% left) is almost always a battery that can’t keep up with the designed current. \nSome times it’s physical damage from a drop, sometimes chemical damage from being in a car trunk, sometimes just an out of spec battery. \nAny service technician with Apple diagnostics can diagnose and repair that for you. Be sure your firmware and software is up to date before paying for service, though.  Also, try once a SMC reset. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/297277/5472\n\n*MacBook Pro randomly shutting down\n\n*Fully charged MacBook Air turns off when power cord removed\nDIY repair is possible, especially if you are patient and aware an improper battery swap is a fire hazard and can afford a do over if you damage the battery when it’s out or don’t get the adhesive properly handled. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to replace a whole keyboard on a MacBook?\n\nA: Batteries of that vintage are known to swell and damage the case if not not caught or leak into internals.  Keyboard mis-clicks are an indication of this.\nCoconut Battery is very good product because it tells you the health of the battery ... when 90% charged is really 5% of original capacity.\nApple Stores no longer officially service the hardware of 2011, but may make an exception.  AASP (Apple Authorised Service Providers) do not care about the year of the system, and OtherWorldComputing (macsales.com) sells the proper battery for self-service ... easy to do in my opinion.\nifixit.comhas many DIY guides for operations of all vintages of Macs, from memory swap (usually easy) through screen replacement (if one is so bold!).\n", "Q: How to play .m3u playlist on iOS, given its URL?

This is often because the program has crashed, but it might also be that it is because the program is slowed down by waiting for the disk, memory allocation or similar. If that is the case, the program will be listed in black again, when it does respond.\nIn your case it seems reasonable to think that the Flash Player has indeed crashed, as it is not supposed to be doing a lot, if you haven't got any Flash pages open in your browser.\nYou can click on the Flash Player item in Activity Monitor and press the circled-cross icon in the toolbar, which will force kill the program - releasing the resources for other programs to use.\nIf you haven't updated Flash Player and/or your browser recently, I would suggest updating to the latest version which could potentially fix the problem.\n", "Q: iPhone 6, iOS 11 boot loop/restore bar loop I have a problem with my iPhone 6.

It is by default scaled to 1920 x 1080 @ 60 Hz (copied from System Report). But the display shows \"Resolution: 3840x2160, 60Hz\" (at the bottom of the Menu). It bothers me cause I have some performance issues working with this display. I also have Dell U2715H display (2K) at home which doesn't show any performance problem at all. I assume the problem is in Mac OS scaling but don't see a way do diagnose or fix it.\nMac OS Sierra Version: 10.12.6 (16G1212)\n\nA: What you're describing is macOS' \"Retina\" HiDPI scaling feature. The actual resolution that the GPU renders, the display sees and what is communicated over the display-cable is 3840x2160.\nIn simple terms, the resolution reported to applications is instead 1920x1080. This means that the actual usable resolution you'll find as a user is 1920x1080, but for example text is rendered \"crisper\" by macOS taking advantage of the underlying full resolution. Similarly images and video material can be shown in the underlying full resolution.\nIf you open System Preferences and select Display, then you see the scaling option you have chosen for your monitor. You can hold down the option/alt key while pressing the \"Scaled\" radio button to reveal a longer list of possible screen resolutions. You want to select one marked \"low resolution\" (i.e. not a HiDPI one).\nYou can also use third party utilities such as SwitchResX to get even more options for screen resolutions.\nYou can also disable HiDPI scaling completely from Terminal.app by running the following command:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool NO\n\nYou'll need to reboot afterwards.\nTo reverse and enable HiDPI again, change \"NO\" to \"YES\".\n", "Q: Canon Printer is producing garbage characters I have a Canon MF-4800 printer/scanner.

If I escape only the periods in the key name and nothing else, it works fine.

I would like a script that can be launched from the Dock, since I frequently use the Accessibility Keyboard.\nOne idea is to use AppleScript; another idea is to find the Accessibility Keyboard binary and use a shell script to open it.\nHere is my attempt at an AppleScript:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    reveal (pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\")\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"System Preferences\"\n    tell window \"Accessibility\"\n        click UI element \"Keyboard\" of row 16 of table 1 of scroll area 2\n        click button \"Accessibility Keyboard\"\n        click checkbox \"Enable Accessibility Keyboard\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis script fails with the error: \"System Events got an error: Can’t get button 'Accessibility Keyboard' of window 'Accessibility' of application process 'System Preferences'.\"\nIf I remove the last two click commands, the script does not produce an error, but also does not appear to click the \"Keyboard\" UI element.\nWhat am I doing wrong?  Apologies if this is a stupid question; this is my first AppleScript.\nOr if someone knows the location of the Accessibility Keyboard binary, that would be helpful, too.\n\nA: Update Note: This answer was originally written prior to the release of macOS Mojave and as such to use it in macOS Mojave you'll need to change three lines of code.\nChange:\n\n*\n\n*select table 1 of scroll area 2\n\n*select row 16 of table 1 of scroll area 2\n\n*tell tab group 1\nTo:\n\n*\n\n*select table 1 of scroll area 1\n\n*select row 16 of table 1 of scroll area 1\n\n*tell tab group 1 of group 1\n\nThe following example AppleScript code works for me under macOS High Sierra:\nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    quit application \"System Preferences\"\n    delay 1\nend if\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n            select table 1 of scroll area 2\n            delay 0.1\n            select row 16 of table 1 of scroll area 2\n            delay 0.1\n            tell tab group 1\n                click radio button \"Accessibility Keyboard\"\n                delay 0.1\n                click checkbox \"Enable Accessibility Keyboard\"\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\nIn Script Editor, I saved example AppleScript code as an application, named Accessibility Keyboard.app, in the Applications folder.\nNext, I added the Accessibility Keyboard.app to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\nNow I can bring up the Accessibility Keyboard easily via Spotlight, or the Accessibility Keyboard.app can be dragged and dropped on the Dock so as to be launched for there.\n\nUpdate:\nMy original example AppleScript code was geared at opening the Accessibility Keyboard, not closing it. As such, if it's open and the original script is run again it errors out. The following version of the example AppleScript code accounts for whether or not the Accessibility Keyboard it already shown and if so, closes it.\nNote thought that while this does close the Accessibility Keyboard if it's showing, there is an added bounce to Dock Tile of System Preferences and is not and issue other then a secondary visual distraction.\nExample AppleScript code:\nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    quit application \"System Preferences\"\n    delay 1\nend if\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n            select table 1 of scroll area 2\n            delay 0.1\n            select row 16 of table 1 of scroll area 2\n            delay 0.1\n            tell tab group 1\n                click radio button \"Accessibility Keyboard\"\n                delay 0.1\n                if value of checkbox \"Enable Accessibility Keyboard\" is 0 then\n                    click checkbox \"Enable Accessibility Keyboard\"\n                else\n                    click checkbox \"Enable Accessibility Keyboard\"\n                    delay 1\n                    my clickOK()\n                end if\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\non clickOK()\n    tell application \"System Events\" to click button \"OK\" of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\nend clickOK\n\n\nNote that System Preferences does not need to be visible for this to work and why there is no activate command in the example AppleScript code. Additionally if System Preferences is already open, it is first closed before the rest of the code is processed. This is done for a couple of reasons, the first of which was already stated and secondly seeing the UI Events processed is a visual distraction and can be annoying.\nAlso note that the value of the delay commands may need to be adjusted for your system, and or additional delay commands may or may not be needed. Adjust values of and or add/remove the delay commands as appropriate.\nKeep in mind that once the app is added to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility and modified thereafter, you'll need to uncheck it and recheck it for the new changes to be allowed to be processed.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways accomplish a task.

Is it bad for my macbook pro 2013's battery if I often charge my bluetooth devices via its USB port.\n\nA: Not really. \nThe rating of your MacBook Pro battery is 1000 full charge cycles and you probably get 500 charges of your Bluetooth per one discharge of the Apple battery, so you’re taking 1 / 500000 or the equivalent of diluting alcohol in water at two parts per million. \nIf you do the milliamp hours calculation for your situation, that’s more accurate than my estimate, but if you factor convenience and the eventual cost of a new Apple battery, I can’t imagine anyone not charging some devices unless your Mac battery already has issues unrelated to charging Bluetooth devices. \n", "Q: Is it feasible to transition from external USB to NAS for data drive? I have a basic 1Tb external drive plugged into the back of my 2012 MacMini. It works but is ugly.\nI've been considering for a while getting either a NAS, or just plugging a USB drive into the back of my main router as a network disk - for central store of photos and digital media (music, video) across our household.\nCould I just use that solution to replace the external disk on my Mac and use a network drive on the NAS as a remote volume, without impacting my user experience? I connect my Mac to the outer by ethernet (Powerline/Homeplug 200Mbps) so I wouldn't need to rely on wireless but even so - is this going to be too slow?\n\nA: It all depends on a couple of things, not the least of which what, exactly, you define as \"too slow.\" And that is going to be answerable only by trying it out. One of the other things it depends on is how fast your network is.\nModern networking is at the gigabit level, but it is still common to see routers and switches, especially those provided by your ISP to be 100mb (or 1/10th the speed of gigabit). Needless to say I would recommend you have gigabit networking. And if you are relying on your ISP-provided router for your network, perhaps you will need an inexpensive gigabit switch to connect all your computers with one port left over to then plug into your ISP-provided router.\nAnother consideration is what, exactly, you keep on the external drive. If it is your user profile I would say no. If it is your documents folder, probably.\nAgain it depends on your personal usage patterns and how much data you are pushing across the wire and how fast you need it to be.\nI have a NAS. I use it for backup (Time Machine & Dropbox) and as a centralized location for music, TV & movies (Plex) but don't use it as a location for keeping files I am currently working on (Dropbox is there just as another backup location). But people work with documents (Word, Excel, etc.) across a GB network all the time, so it is completely doable.\nBut it depends heavily on your use case. So find a place with a liberal return policy (Costco?) and give it a try.\n", "Q: How to find IMEI serial number on a WiFi Only Device I have a WiFi only 4th generation iPad and to trade my device in I am being asked for an IMEI serial number that you would dial for on your dialer. However, my iPad does not have a dialer, and I cannot find an IMEI in settings. \nCan you help or is there no possible way to find this information?\n\nA: The settings app has a general section where you can get all the various MEID / IMEI / ICCID and serial numbers. If you are being forced to make up a number, perhaps the listing isnt correct for a WiFi only device or you need to find a seller that can properly classify your hardware as WiFi only. \nIf you did have a cellular capable iPad, and you can’t find the information in the about section, it might need a restore or repair. \n\nA: Only cellular devices have an IMEI (it stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity). Also a dialer is only available on an iPhone (not on a cellular iPad).\nIn your case the only thing you could provide is the serial number, which you can discover in Settings -> General -> About. It can be used on Apple's Check Coverage page to verify purchase date and warranty coverage.\n", "Q: MBA randomly drops internet connection Using 2017 MBA with High Sierra.

I had my driver crash several times, leaving the network stack unresponsive and requiring restart. This happened during a short power surge, leading to the router \"almost\" restarting (it's a Mikrotik router, the radio was down for a second, but not the whole router). Everything else reconnected (several iPhones, iPad and few other devices), but not my MacBook (at the time it was running 10.13 17A405)\nCheck your access point/router logs for a drop reason (if it provides any).\nWhen this happens, you might do a wireless diagnostics report (option click on wifi icon, tap on ) and then search trough the files for some suspicious lines. After you collect several of them, open a bug report.\nAnother lead would be kernel based third party firewall solutions.\n", "Q: Factory Reset MacBook Air makes it better?

Similar questions I have found all seem to ask how to set it up with all the old data. How do I boot the system up (safe boot, recovery etc.)? and what do I need to do once it's booted up?\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nA: This answer is more tailored to your question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the new HDD.\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery. Startup your Mac and immediately hold down the option+⌘+R key combination.\n\n*Release the keys when the Apple logo or a spinning globe appears\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to erase the HDD.

If you didn't know macOS has a well hidden directory called  \"/AppleInternal\" that is pretty secretive. It's not possible to ls or rm it and I've never seen it referenced before with anything other than fs_usage, where it was being listed frequently as /AppleInternal or /AppleInternal>>>>>>>>>>>>>> with usually between 5 and 20 >. \nThought it was some reference to something other than a directory but the / before AppleInternal made me wonder and google has an article about how to enable it, which apparently added some hidden features to Xcode. \nI booted into recovery and used mkdir (you aren't allowed to do it outside of recovery mode) and there is now a folder with that name but its empty. fs_usage no longer makes any reference to /AppleInternal and ls shows the created date as when I used mkdir. Seems like a questionable use if it could just be done away with once discovered as well as be hidden so well and referenced so frequently prior to adding my own. \nSeems like a fairly good place to hide malware really. \nI found a single, vague reference to AppleInternal in all of the man pages. It's in ani (Apple Net Install) which says AppleInternal and AppleInternalAssistant are both dmg image types. \nSo does anyone have any idea how it is able to hide so well or have any additional information on its true purpose? \n\nA: It is not really a \"hidden\" directory or \"secretive\" in any way.\nIt is simply that some Apple employees have use a folder with this specific name when testing/using prototype or in-development software on iOS and macOS. The idea is to store testing tools and other files that are not meant to be in the software meant for customers.\nThe technical concept here is that the contents of that folder is combined with the \"ordinary\" file system (sort of like an overlay). So if you want to add something to /System/Library/ for testing, but don't want to do it in the \"real\" software - you could add it to /AppleInternal/System/Library/ instead - and get the same effect.\nThe folder does not exist unless it is actively created. Therefore the folder is not hidden - it is simply not there on an ordinary installation of macOS.\nWhen you run Xcode, which is meant for developers, it will check if this folder exists - and then for example the iOS simulator will have a few extra options, that are primarily meant for Apple employees. This could be for example features that haven't been tested well enough to be exposed to customers.\nThe AppleInternal folder has been well-known by non-Apple employees for years - so it is not a new discovery.\n", "Q: Hiding email address associated with Apple ID when using iMessage When sending an iMessage to a recipient, they see the email address associated with the sender's Apple ID. As a sender, is it possible to hide the email from the receiver, instead having the parties refer to each other using only a phone number?\n\nA: You can choose which ID (phone number or Apple ID email) to use when starting a new iMessage conversation.\nTo configure, on your iPhone, go to Settings app → Messages → Send & Receive and under Start New Conversations From, select the phone number instead of email addresses associated with your Apple ID.\n\n", "Q: Headphone jack broken for music, yet works perfectly for telephone calls I have a peculiar problem when using headphones on my iPhone SE.\nWhen playing music, podcasts, videos, or doing Facetime calls, sound only comes through the right side.

Any ideas on what to try next?\n\nA: It is likely music, etc is in stereo, while telephone voice audio is in mono. Mono goes to both channels, but in stereo, its separate channels. If this is the case, perhaps one of the channels is broken on your headphone plug (or jack). In other words, L or R is broken.\nOf course, your options are repair, or try a different set of headphones or since this is an SE, you have the option of using the Lightning port as a headphone jack. Simply purchase a Lightning to headphone adapter from Apple, and you should get the audio back.\n", "Q: What is the equivalent of ~/.cache on macOS? I'm writing a tool that needs to cache files that are supposed to be hidden from the uninformed user and persist across reboots. On Linux, I am putting these files in ~/.cache. What's the equivalent of that on the mac?\nCan I just use ~/.cache? I also read about ~/Library/Application Support and ~/Library/Cache, but I'm finding a lot of contradictory information.\n\nA: The right place to store such files is \"Library/Caches\" (either in ~ or in the app sandbox, depending on whether or not your app is sandboxed).\nApple documents this fact here:\nFile System Basics\nEspecially take note of this quote:\n\nUse this directory to write any app-specific support files that your\n  app can re-create easily.

On-screen finder labels might be localised, but on the actual file system the name remains “Downloads”.\n", "Q: How can I tell if a directory has APFS Fast Directory Sizing enabled? Apple's technical documentation in the Apple File System Guide describes that some directories like /tmp are not good candidates for the fast directory sizing feature.\n\nFast directory sizing works by precomputing the size of directory as content is added and removed. Therefore, it is most appropriate for directories that contain many files and have relatively little churn. For example, a user’s Documents folder is a good candidate for fast directory sizing, whereas the /tmp directory would not.\n\nHow can I tell if a given directory has this enabled or disabled so I can choose where to do speed intensive \"churn\" work and where not to do that sort of work?\n\nA: We now know the previous answer is a bit off since Apple has recently released more technical details on APFS.  Fast directory sizing is indeed enabled on a per-directory basis and this can be checked by the user (albeit not easily). It can only be enabled when a directory is empty and must also be turned on for every new subdirectory as well. Details: https://developer.apple.com/support/apple-file-system/Apple-File-System-Reference.pdf\nRelevant quote \n\nYou cannot enable Fast Directory Sizing on directories containing files or other directories directly; you must instead first create a new directory, enable fast directory sizing on it, and then move the contents of the existing directory to the new directory\n\nWe now know that you must set this flag to enable FDS\n\nINODE_MAINTAIN_DIR_STATS: The inode tracks the size of all of its children\n\nThough still unclear to me if macOS is turning this flag on automatically where appropriate or not, but some initial experimentation makes me think it isn't being used yet. I assume it will be used in forthcoming macOS updates.\n\nA: Short Answer\nFDS is a fundamental part of the file system in APFS formatted drives. It is not something users need to enable/disable, and it's not something that can apply to one directory and not another. \nAs it's an 'all in' scenario, there aren't any terminal commands to determine if a directory has FDS enabled. Instead, if a drive is formatted in the APFS format then FDS is enabled. If it's not formatted in the APFS format, then FDS isn't available.\nLong Answer\nUnfortunately, the information you've quoted from Apple's technical documentation is badly worded, hence the reason for your question.\nIf a drive is formatted in the APFS format then Fast Directory Sizing is applied across the board. FDS is not something a user can enable/disable on a per directory basis. \nBecause of this, it's also not something a user can determine the status of on a directory by directory basis. That is, if the drive is formatted as APFS then all directories have FDS enabled.\nWhere the confusion comes from (and understandably so in this case) is the bad choice of words in Apple's documentation and the ambiguity that created. What this information was trying to convey is that a user will benefit most from FDS in those directories that have lots of files but change little (e.g. a user's Documents folder), whereas they will not get much benefit (if any) from FDS in directories like the /tmp folder. \nAs an aside, the documentation you referenced has since been replaced by the About Apple File System page. The only mention of FDS on this page is as follows:\n\nApple File System offers improved file system fundamentals as well as several new features, including cloning, snapshots, space sharing, fast directory sizing, atomic safe-save, and sparse files.\n\nThere is no attempt to further explain what FDS means, beyond the fact it's a fundamental (read underlying) feature. However, if you're interested in some background:\n\nIn complex and deep directory structures in HFS+, we are familiar with the time the ﬁle system could spend on calculating the size of the ﬁle system tree. This is one of the common reasons that the system would hang. Apple, with APFS, introduced Fast Directory Sizing (FDS), where the ﬁle system can quickly compute the space used by a directory hierarchy, in order to remove this problem.\n\nSource: Hansen, K.H., Toolan, F., Decoding the APFS ﬁle system, Digital Investigation (2017)\n", "Q: Need to disable USB Mass Storage devices on macOS Sierra + All the way through El Capitan, the way this used to work, in the Terminal, was:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext\nsudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext ~/backup\nsudo touch /System/Library/Extensions/\nsudo reboot\n\nIn Sierra and High Sierra, it appears that the IOUSBMassStorageClass kernel extension is no longer loaded, and instead, the IOUSBMassStorageDriver is loaded.

Any suggestions are welcomed.\n\nA: Settings have many MDM hooks. You can experiment for free cloud based solution like JAMF now to get started. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://signup.jamfcloud.com\nCarrier settings are much more tricky, most get set by the carrier over the air and depend on whatever sim is sent out and physically installed, so you’ll likely need something other than a MDM for that. \n\nA: If you have setup the iPhone already using the Apple Configurator 2 you can remotely change settings or remotely wipe the device. The idea being you have control of the device because you own it, therefore you are able to control the device from anywhere. Otherwise apple devices don't really allow remote control.\nSee this article for more information on how to remotely configure a device here.\n\nA: Similarly to Apple Configurator 2,  you can use the Profile Manager in macOS Server to use the MDM protocol. This article explains how. Apple will most likely be adding more features for MDM and similar things in the future as inferred from Apple's recent article on changes to macOS Server.\n\nA: Unfortunately you cannot remotely control an iOS device. However, many things can be configured, including SOME Carrier Settings (namely APN settings for data - not selecting specific carriers), using a Mobile Device Management product (options include MobileIron, XenMobile, AirWatch, Apple Profile Manager, Lightspeed, JAMF, etc).

After exhausting all Apple's motherboard replacement options over the years, I use workarounds the user community has discovered to get the system to use the integrated Intel graphics chip instead. These are done in Single User mode, basically whenever I reboot.  Without the workarounds, any usual reboots to the GUI (simple reboot, option reboot, safe mode,...) fail to a gray-screen mid progress bar, with the machine getting hot and fans running. The workarounds I currently use come from this link: \nGPU problem - Boot Hangs on Grey Screen\n\n*These workarounds involve moving the AMD*300*.kexts around so the system does not use the AMD discrete GPU chip for graphics and setting nvram gpu-power-prefs so that it does not even power that chip up, else it runs full power doing nothing except warming up the room. Note that the nvram setting can be done while running from this weird write-locked startup disk. Moving the kexts however, cannot because of the write lock -- and this is the killer for me, leaving the machine unusable.\n\n*The workarounds had worked fine for 6 months or more now, tho tend to get messed up whenever there is a system update (not surprising). I believe there was a minor update a couple of days ago. Later that day a few hours after I closed my laptop, it mysteriously rang it's startup chime.  It has been flakey ever since. \n\n*This problem (weird startup disk in S.U.Mode) had me stuck for a day, trying things. Then everything worked for one S.U.Mode boot -- got to the usual boot drive. Not sure if it is something I did or if it was random. Anyway I ran fsck -fy which showed no problems, and ran my usual nvram gpu-power-prefs script and did a reboot. The GUI then came up fine, using the integrated graphics chip. (I fortunately did a backup during this time.) Next time the machine went to sleep though, it was broken again. I tried a reboot into S.U.Mode, but it used the small limited boot disk.\n(2) I've tried resetting the SMC and NVRAM, to no avail. An extended HW check (boot w D key) shows no problems.  I do not have another machine with firewire ports to access the HD in target disk mode.

I think the solution is to downgrade it to Sierra. I was happily on OS Sierra doing my work, but my bloody itchy finger clicked install, and I had to redo the kernel stuff, but it still didn’t boot.\nI took out my hard disk and booted it from another MAC, and it worked perfectly. So my Guess is the the kernels we’re looking for some hardware that the mac doesn’t have, so instead of figuring that out, i’lol got back to Sierra.\nOh, to access csrutil, I used cmd-R from my other machine, and opened terminal to disable it.\n", "Q: How to configure webproxy settings to bypass hosts and networks in the shell? \nCan I manage this setting in the Terminal?\n\nA: To configure proxy settings in the shell use the command networksetup.\nTo get help enter networksetup -help.\nTo bypass networks, hosts and domains use the command:\nsudo networksetup -setproxybypassdomains <networkservice> <domain1> [domain2] [...]\n\nThe default items in the list are *.local and 169.254/16.\nSo if you want to add a domain (abc.com) and a host (17.12.3.5) but keep current items in the list use (example network service: en1 - to get a list of network services enter: networksetup -listallnetworkservices):\nsudo networksetup -setproxybypassdomains en1 *.local 169.254/16 abc.com 17.12.3.5\n\nTo clear the list use:\nsudo networksetup -setproxybypassdomains en1 Empty\n\n", "Q: Where is the preferences file for the Adobe Application Manager Update Notifier menubar app?

I'm interested in the actual width and height of the screen. \nThanks!\n\nA: To calculate the screen dimension given the diagonal measurement and the resolution:\nThe 13.3\" MacBook has a 1400 x 900 resolution. Assuming square pixel this gives us\n\nwhich we can solve for x\n\nThe resulting value of x needs to be multiplied with 1400 and 900 to give the screen dimensions, in this case 11.2\" x 7.2\".\n\nA: Well, based on the official Apple specs the exterior dimensions of the 13” MacBook Air are 12.8” by 8.94”. But that is of course dimensions for the entire body of the MacBook Air and not just the screen (which is a bit smaller obviously). \nI’ve actually got a 13” MacBook Air and a quick measure with a ruler gives me the dimensions of 11.375” by 7.125”. \n", "Q: Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable vs. adapter - for MBP mid-2012 I've been using a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter to connect to an external monitor for over a year. It stopped working yesterday and I am about to replace it. However, I noticed there are Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cables on Amazon, as well. The cable's length, either 3 or 6 feet, may be useful to me. That said, I have 2 HDMI cables already, so getting another cable may just be a waste of space (pricing is roughly the same, as far as I can tell).\nSo, what difference, if any, is there between the Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter vs. the Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable? Thank you. \n\nA: The only difference is that with the adapter you can use an existing HDMI cable you might have, and thus save some cost and have flexibility in changing the length of the cable later.\n", "Q: Growl style without a fade or animation I would like to use Growl to show feedback of the input from a Griffin PowerMate (I'm doing this with AppleScript). High Sierra's built-in notifications can't keep up with the rate of input of the PowerMate. Growl's notifications can keep up but only by spreading out notifications over the space of the screen, which is hard for the eye to follow. Growl's \"Bezel\" style is an example of a style that stays put, but it has animations that slow it down. Growl styles programed in Cocoa can have their own fades or animations, so it should be possible to use Cocoa to make a style that has no fade at all, or a very short fade. I don't have time to look through hundreds of Growl styles, but perhaps someone already knows of such a style?\nrelevant link - http://growl.info\n\nA: It turns out that Quicksilver has its own notification system which the user can activate by going to Quicksilver > Preferences > Handlers. Quicksilver's notifications can be triggered by AppleScript:\ntell application \"Quicksilver\"\n    show notification \"notification text\"\nend tell\n\nThese notifications can refresh quickly and they stay put, which is what I was looking for.\n", "Q: Used a chemical on my MacBook screen.

I recently noticed that macOS has an icon for every W1 enabled audio device in the Bluetooth preferences, but I'm not exactly sure where the system gets these icons.\nIn the screenshot below, the Beats Solo³ and AirPods were paired to my iPhone, and iCloud paired them to my Mac. It looks like the color of the Beats headphones in the icon do match the color of the real headphones as well! \nI assume that either macOS has the images for every W1 stored somewhere or the system had to contact Apple to get these images. Just in case, I did check the following directory:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources\n\n\n\nA: I was able to find where icons are stored for W1 devices. It appears that this folder already contains assets for every W1 device that exists. You can find icons for W1 devices here:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/IOBluetoothUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources\n\nIf you're using Swift on macOS, you can use the following code to programmatically get a device image:\nIOBluetoothDevice.init(addressString: \"bluetoothDeviceAddress\").value(forKey: \"image\")\n\nor\n   for device in IOBluetoothDevice.pairedDevices() {\n    let deviceName = ((device as!

I haven't been able to find an option to not override my external calendar (Google Calendar) default alert times and scheme.\nI always have one email alert 1 day before and one normal reminder like couple hours before.\niCal and iOS calendar used to respect those default alert times up until iOS 10 / Sierra. But now I keep forgetting about going to places because I need a reminder the day before, like before sleeping so I plan my day correctly (wake up hours, etc).\nThe 1h reminder or time to leave reminders are great, but I really would like to be reminded the day before and like by email, because it's stays stacked in my inbox.\nIt's been such a pain that now I downloaded Google Calendar in my iPhone and I'm not using apple calendar anymore (but I wanted to be using it).\nDoes anyone have a tip on how could I fix that? It worked fine before. Thanks!\n\nA: I had the same problem. I use Calendar all the time for email alerts and this has become very tedious. \nHere's a workaround:\nMake a Calendar entry as a template: \nCreate a generic email alert for one day ahead. Use a title you will remember like \"one day alert,\" or maybe \"1D\" for a short name.\nUse the template for a new Calendar entry:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's not immediately visible, make a same-date copy of the alert (I use option-click-drag). \n\n*Retitle as desired & add any needed details. \n\n*Change the date (the date the template resides in) to the date you want. Doing this last will avoid an additional email alert.\nHope that helps.\nPs. You have to do this for each different lead-time you want for an alert.

I am doing DNS resolution on the router and not forwarding DNS requests through pf.\n\nHowever, certain sites (namely https://google.com) will not load.  Other https sites will.  ping google.com works fine on client and server. It resolves to different ip addresses on each, although both connections are behind the same VPN and use the same DNS servers.\ncurl google.com of course yields a 301.  curl https://google.com works fine on the server, but curl -v https://google.com on the client yields the following if you wait long enough:\n stopped the pause stream!\n* Closing connection 0\ncurl: (35) LibreSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to google.com:443\n\nThe browser just times out.

Now in the main YouTube player window, you have clicked on the Full Screen control placed towards the bottom right (of the player). This takes the YouTube video full screen, and moves it to a separate Space of its own.\nWhen you use Command + Tab to switch to Safari, you land on the Safari window running in full-screen mode. You are shown the current Safari tab, but its full-screen video display is on another Space (generally, the next Space towards right of Safari's Space). This is the default behaviour in the described scenario.\nAfter switching to Safari's Space, you'll have to change to the adjacent Space using any one of the methods to change Space. Since you mentioned you don't want to use trackpad, the easiest way to do so, is to use the keyboard shortcut to switch Space. To view/configure keyboard shortcut to switch Spaces, go to System Preferences app → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Mission Control.\nThe default shortcut assigned by macOS to Move right a Space is Command + →. In my case, I have changed it to Option + Command + →. Command + → is commonly used to move to end of line while editing text, which is a more frequent activity than moving to right Space.\n\n\nA: The answer by Nimesh is correct, but I consider this very annoying default behaviour with no way around it. I would like to use Safari as my default browser, but for videos I use Firefox now, which does allow me to Cmd+Tab between its full-screen window and another application.\nMy use case is similar: watching a lecture in full-screen and quickly switching to my note-taking app with Cmd+Tab. Switching back to safari would pop up the Click to exit full screen, instead of the video, requiring me to constantly execute a second action (move a space).\n", "Q: Failed upgrade from macOS Sierra to High Sierra on late 2010 MacBook Pro 15\" I attempted to upgrade from macOS Sierra to High Sierra on my late 2010 MacBook Pro and it failed part way through the installation.

How do I resolve this issue?\n\nA: I have faced the same issue with the same MacBook. What worked for me was to restart and immediately press Option key. The computer asked me which start up disk to select. Avoid the updater and select your hard disk. Right now I am trying to figure out how to fix the High Sierra damaged installer.

You know R with RStudio, Java with JetBrains, and all the other goodies with Sublime Text.\nBut every time I install an Xcode update, Xcode takes over every code-related extension imaginable, and I have to associate my files manually.\nIs there anyway to prevent Xcode from taking over my file associations?\n\nA: The best workaround I've found is to install the Xcode CLI and NEVER INSTALL the Xcode GUI. As OP says, the GUI/IDE aggressively accrues responsibilities and I never worked out how to stop it.   \nUse xcode-select --install in terminal to get the CLI.  This solves Xcode dependency for (eg.) Homebrew and you can subsequently forget about Xcode.\n\nA: The other answers didn't help me, because I still need the GUI of Xcode. Therefore, here is a different approach:\nYou can use SwiftDefaultApps to override the default apps. You can find it on GitHub: https://github.com/Lord-Kamina/SwiftDefaultApps\nAfter the installation you will find in the system preferences the new item SwiftDefaultApps. In the tab \"Uniform Type Identifiers\" you can change the editor for the type \"public.php-script\". You can even overwrite the viewer for the preview.\n\n\nA: Absolutely there is!\nUnfortunately because Xcode is installed through the Mac App Store, we are unable to control / prevent the change from occurring in the first place. The automated installation takes care of that for us.\nHow to Change the Default Programs\nLuckily there is an easy fix to resolving the issue and reversing the change. The only caveat of which is the fact that this is done on an extension-based level.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to any file whose extension you don't want to open with Xcode (e.g. my file.java).\n\n*Right click on it, select Get Info (or CMD I).\n\n*Under Open With, select your editor for that extension.\n\n*Click Change All to make the change global across all files of this type.\n\n\nI believe some IDEs or even individual Text editors will ask if you would like to associate them with the most common formats for software development - with Xcode that's a little less optional. Anyway, hope that helps, let me know if it did and how you make out.

(OS X 10.11.6) The default way to install an iOS app was through iTunes. Having not used iTunes in several years, I'm trying to put an app on an iPad I have, and can't for the life of me find the iOS store in iTunes.\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: You can browse iOS apps in your favorite web browser at https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8. Unfortunately, you can't make purchases (or see what you've purchased, or download IPAs, or...). But at least you can view screenshots, reviews, etc on a bigger screen.\n\nA: You're not missing anything. Late in 2017 in iTunes 12.7, Apple removed iTunes ability to access the iOS App Store. Using iTunes 12.7, the only way to access the iOS App Store was via the iPhone itself. \nMany users disliked this change, as it's harder to navigate and review apps on iOS than it had been using macOS. A month or so later, Apple retreated and offered a version of iTunes that restores iOS App Store availability. This version of iTunes is 12.6.3, and you can read more about it on this Apple page. iTunes 12.6.3 can be installed even if one has already installed 12.7. The Apple page cited above contains a link to download iTunes 12.6.3.\nI am very happy to have iOS App Store access back on macOS.\n\nA: On MacOS - as suggested in other comment you can:\n\n*\n\n*Search it via webpage at https://www.apple.com/app-store/\n\n\n*The key to easy installation depends on your browser\n\n*\n\n*Safari: use share button in top right corner and pick Airdrop and your iPhone Your iPhone must be setup to handle airdrop - use same iCloud account on both Mac and iPhone, connect to same wifi. You can also long press wi-fi button to enable sharing with contacts.\n\n*Chrome - you need to have it on both macOS and iPhone. Click in the address field and on the right side a small button to open tab on other device will show up - use it to pass the tab to iPhone and then select in mobile chrome in popup \"card was received\": \"Open\"\n\n\n\n\nA: Even though they’re still keeping the build on the website, it does look a lot like a temp workaround. ‘Tech support is only for the latest versions of iTunes’ also is a bit of a red flag. \nSince Apple is clearly dropping this feature, I thought I’d get into the thread and tell you about our solution. We have app pretty great app management features in our iOS management software iMazing, including download of IPAs. This functionality is 100% free, and followed the same paths iTunes did, so it’s also 100% legit (no download if you haven’t bought the app already).

I'm trying to figure out what usb-c charging hubs would be useful to charge my MacBook Pro. The specs for the charger that is included (61W) says: Output: 20.3V - 3A (USB PD) or 9V - 3A (USP PD) or 5.2V - 2.4A.\nHow are these different charging-modes being used? I'm mostly interested in the 20.3V - 3A one.\n\nA: The charging mode used depends on what is being charged. When you plug-in the charger to a device, the charger and the device will communicate with each other and determine the correct charging mode.\nFor non USB PD (Power Delivery) devices, it will default to the old USB standard, which is the ~5 volts.\nFor USB PD (Power Delivery) compatible devices the charger will support either 5, 9 or 20 volts according to what the device wants. The USB PD standard (rev. 3) defines four standard power levels that a charger can support: 5V, 9V, 15V and 20V.\nFurther explanation on Wikipedia:\nUSB Power Delivery\n", "Q: Metadata Rejection; Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed My iOS App received a metadata rejection because I made a mistake in the review information for In App Purchases.

I am leaning toward cable now, but was wondering about the 3ft, 6ft, and 10ft versions. I'd likely go with 6ft. But my question is, will there be any degradation in performance due to the length of the cord(s)? In other words, will the 6 perform better than the 10 and the 3 perform better than the 6? \nYes, I realize we're talking about a grand total of about $10 here, but it's less about that than it is about my desire to avoid having to re-replace something! Thank you! \n\nA: Short answer:\nYes, the cable will be fine.\nLong answer:\nHDMI and Mini DisplayPort are digital signals, so either the signal works or it doesn't.\nAs cable runs get longer the signal is more prone to interference and signal loss that can result in no video, but unlike analog video such as composite video there is no loss in quality, just no video at all, or constant cutting out.\nGiven that you are really only looking at 10ft/3M this isn't very long at all, and as long as you buy from a reputable supplier the cable should state it is rated for 1080p at 60fps and if it was made 3 meters long it should work without question.\nIn my own experience signal issues with HDMI cables only tend to start to manifest at much longer cable runs over 10 meters / 30 ft, and at higher resolutions or frame rates which exceed what the cable was designed for, or when the cable is not from a reputable supplier.\n", "Q: What does Safari iCloud sync entail?

I've realised that I'm able to charge my new USB type-c ported MacBook Pro using an iPad charger (with a 3rd party cable) and also I can use my old Google Nexus 5X fast charger which has USB type-c port too.\nUsing these charges keep my laptops battery on level - no charge, no discharge.\nMy question is, if I keep using them, would they harm the battery?\nUpdate:\n+ 1 question: What's the case when my power supply is just below the amount required by the system? I mean, the slowly gets depleted. Could this extend battery life by reducing cycle count? \n\nA: There are two questions here:\nWill using a non Apple USB-C charger harm the computer/battery?\nNo, as long as the charger is from a reputable supplier there is no reason to expect any physical harm from using other brands of charger, power is power, and the MacBook will only accept the amount of power it needs to fulfil it's need.\nWill keeping my battery topped up at all times, no charing/discharging harm the computer/battery?\nYes and no, this is a particularly complex subject, but sufficed to say your battery like a person needs to remain active to be healthy, but equally overdoing it is going to wear it out prematurely.\nSo your device has a rated number of battery cycles, typically about 1,000 on modern devices. A cycle is one full discharge and recharge in however many little bits that takes, so limiting how much you discharge and recharge the device can prolong the life.\nHowever the battery needs to remain active, and keeping it fully charged all the time can do harm as it's constantly keeping the battery topped up...\nThere is a really good article from Apple which I don't want to reproduce here that you should read:\nhttps://www.apple.com/batteries/\n", "Q: Can't delete Safari history entry on Mac!

I'm not sure what else I can do to get this straightened out.\n\nA: Make sure that the contacts that are on the MacBook Pro are also in iCloud (www.icloud.com/#contacts) by acknowledging the amount of contacts listed. Including the ones that are missing from your iPad and iPhone. If so, then all you need to do is to turn iCloud Contacts off and back on for the iPad and iPhone.\nIf they aren't there then these contacts are saved to the MacBook's hard drive. To migrate them, you'll 1st need to make sure that you are on a supported MacOS version. I believe MacOS Lion 10.7.2 or newer is required:\n\nIf you have already enabled contact syncing:\nOpen contacts, then go to users and groups and choose only your On My Mac Contacts to display.\nEnsure that nothing is typed in the search field. You might want to backup all of your contacts before you begin. Click to select the first contact and shift-click the last to select them all (or Cmd + A to select all. Then go to File and then Export to vcard and then save it to your desktop (Do another Export and save it to Documents for backup). Delete all the contacts from Address Book (using your delete key). Make sure your iCloud account is your default account (contacts -> preferences > general). Select All iCloud contacts from users and groups. Drag the file you previously dragged to your desktop back onto Address Book.\nThat should merge those Mac contacts with your iCloud contacts.\n\n", "Q: How can I pad a file to make it a specific size? Is it possible to modify file size attribute in Terminal? seems my dash cam only recognizes video files with the exact size of 419,430,400 bytes. My video file is much smaller than this, but in order to play it on dashcam I have to make it match this number! \nI have tried this: \nxattr -w kMDItemFSSize \"419430400\" LOCA0122.avi \n\nbut didn't work. \n\nA: An easy way is to open Terminal.app and use the following command:\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=NUMBER >> yourfile\n\nHere \"yourfile\" should be changed to the name of your file, including the full path to the file. \"NUMBER\" should be changed to the number of bytes, you want to add to the file.\nSo if you need the exact size to be 419,430,400 bytes and your file is 110,000,000 bytes, you would replace NUMBER with 309430400.\n", "Q: iMac says that macOS High Sierra is installed but is still running Mavericks Recently I have downloaded and installed macOS High Sierra. Downloading went well, installing went well, no problems during that process. Only when my iMac started back up I saw nothing new. It looked like it didn't install anything at all. So when I checked which OS it was running it said 10.9.5 (Mavericks).\nI thought it might have been an error and I tried to reinstall the new OS. However, when I wanted to download the installer again in the Mac App Store, it said that it the OS had already been installed.\nAnd so began my search on the internet to find a solution. I came across a post on the Apple Support Forum. It said that I should look in my applications folder to see if I still have the installer. Fortunately this was the case. Only when I ran the installer it told me that it had failed to download the necessary information from the installer. In other words: it could not run the installer.\nMaybe something interesting I found online;\nI came across this reply from deontaifromroseville on the forum. Here's the most important part:\n\nListen... I have been at this computer all day and night. Starting at 10:30a on 1/16/2018. If you see the downloaded or installed on Sierra in the App Store WITH A GRAY TAB YOU CAN NOT CLICK. It is because you have DOWNLOADED AND INSTALLED.\nOPEN APPLICATION. CLICK ON LAUNCH PAD. YOUR INSTALL SCREEN OF SIERRA WILL POP UP AFTER.\n\nHowever, the solution he found did not work for me. But it's still interesting because I have successfully gone through the entire installation process. Maybe it is installed but there is something else at play?\nSo, I still have not been able to get the latest macOS. Does anyone know more about this problem? Has anyone else experienced this same issue? Is there a solution? All information is helpful.\n\nA: That is very strange. This may sound extreme but not sure there is another way.\nUse the installer with a program called Diskmaker X and a (minimum) 8GB thumb drive. Once the installer has created the bootable thumb drive, eject it and back up your Mac. If you can make a disk image or clone it to another external drive, all the better.\nOnce that is done insert the thumb drive and reboot the Mac holding down the Option key. Soon you will get to the boot drive selection screen, select the installer and let it boot. It will take a while longer than you think it should.\nWhen you get to the installer screen where you have a menu bar, find disk utility, launch it and select the partition that you tried to upgrade and format it. Once that is done (should only take a minute or less) exit out of disk utility and proceed with the installation.\nYou have just done a clean install of macOS. Once that is done, boot your system and create a user with a different username than the one you used on your backup. Log in and apply any updates that the App Store shows as available.\nOnce that is done run the Migration Utility (/Applications/Utilities) and connect the backup drive and mount the disk image that contains the backup (if that is the way it was done.\nYou can now use the Migration Assistant to move all your files and applications and settings back to your Mac.\nYou can then log out of the account you created and log in with the username and password you used previously. You can delete that account or just leave it there for troubleshooting purposes.\nYeah, this is a pain and it will take a couple (or more) hours to do, but should guarantee you get a solid (upgraded) system and your environment (with apps and files) back.\n\nA: If you don't want to look at your installer logs and see what error happened, you might have better luck installing an older OS (Sierra or something half way between 10.9 and 10.13)\nIf that fails, you may need to make a bootable installer or re-attempt the install and then look over the installer log.\nI also have very good success with making a time machine backup and then an erase install.\n\n*\n\n*How to create a bootable installer for macOS at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\n\n*macOS Sierra: Erase and reinstall macOS at https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25649 via archive.org\n\nA: Do you happen to have another bootable drive attached to your system (e.g. a bootable backup)?  If so, then it may be that you did install the new OS to your regular drive, but when you reboot your system it can't (for whatever reason) boot from it. In which case, the system will attempt to boot from the next bootable drive it can find.  Which would be a drive with your old OS.\nIf the installer can't create a recovery partition on that drive (e.g. not enough space), then it will fail.  Which might explain why the installer is failing on your second attempt to install the new OS.\n\nA: What I learnt today:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clicking Update next to High Sierra in App Store only downloads the installer to Applications (even though it suggests the update was installed)\n\n*If you don't have 8 GB of disk space remaining after the installer (~5.23 GB) is downloaded, it is immediately deleted with no warning.\n\n\nSo you need at least 13.23 GB of free space before you click Update in the App Store, or else you get stuck in this \"updated but not updated\" situation.\n\nA: CLICK ON LAUNCH PAD. Then you should see an application icon to install MacOS High Sierra. Use that to continue your unfinished OS upgrade.\n\nA: If you open terminal app (/Application/Utilities) you can type:\nsw_vers\n\nThat gives a quick check of the build and version. Additionally, What does system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType say? That should show the version your system is currently running from, in case the about screen got screwed up.\n\nA: Look in the Applications folder for the Install macOS Sierra app and then double click to install. (Run a Time Machine backup first.) Perhaps the installer has only been downloaded, but macOS Sierra not actually installed\n\nA: This happened to me because I was trying to install the new OS while encrypting the drive for FileVault was in progress. Afterwards, spotlight search allowed me to fine the \"Install High Sierra\" app and re-run it, which was not possible from Mac App Store due to the button being greyed out.\n\nA: It could be that it is already installed on an external storage device attached via USB. Disconnect and reopen from App Store. \n", "Q: display partial file path on Finder tab title Question\nIs there a way to change the Finder tab title to include the name of the containing folder?\nProblem\nI work on projects that have the same standardized subfolder names (e.g., code), which makes it difficult to switch between projects without going through each tab to identify the containing folder.\nCurrent state: ambiguous Finder tab titles for three different subfolders\n\nGoal\nI'd like to display the containing folder name as part of the Finder tab title.

Go to Settings > Finder and there is a box for showing what you want ;)\n\nA: There's no mod or preference I have seen to make Finder do this. You'll want an alternative app if this is your one and only need for productivity. Check out PathFinder: https://www.cocoatech.io\nI find using a code editor to view folder hierarchy works much better. If you don’t have an IDE I would start with an extensible / feature-full editor like Visual Studio Code.\n\n*\n\n*https://code.visualstudio.com/\nThat or making the jump to shell where you can exert exceptional control over prompts allow more customization than Finder does at present.\n", "Q: sparsebundle reverting to read-only I have a wireless drive [WD My Passport Pro] and of course I want to encrypt it, but of course there's no way to encrypt the actual drive with FDE and still have it recognized by the Passport's firmware, so I've created a sparsebundle within in encrypted with AES-256 with the drive physically attached to my Mac. I've been able to write to it, but as soon as I've accessed the sparsebundle from the underlying drive mounted as a network share, it became read-only, even though the underlying drive is r/w and I am the owner of the sparsebundle file. Re-attaching the drive locally and opening the sparsebundle still results in a read-only FS. I've created a sparseimage and I've been able to write to it ever since, even after several ummounts and remounts, but it seems to be much slower, which is expected. How can I make the sparsebundle writable once again?\nI'm on the latest 10.13.\nSimilar to this.\nThank you\n\nA: As far as I have understood, macOS allows read-only mounting sparsebundles in almost all situations.\nHowever, when you want to read/write mount a sparsebundle, the underlying filesystem (in this case the network protocol you're using for mounting the wireless drive - for example AFP or SMB) must support F_FULLFSYNC. If your system does not support that the risk of data loss is substantial.\nTherefore check if you can use a different protocol, or you can change the settings, mount options or FUSE-driver (if such is used) to allow F_FULLFSYNC.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set multiple passwords for a single account on macOS?

You can format it to HFS+, then Disk Utility will pick up and do the rest for you. Here is a tutorial with detailed, step by step instructions: https://mycyberuniverse.com/web/how-fix-mediakit-reports-not-enough-space-on-device.html\nNote that this will erase your entire disk (in case you have multiple volumes).\nSummary of commands needed, in terminal:\ndiskutil list\ndiskutil unmountDisk force disk2\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1024 count=1024\ndiskutil partitionDisk disk2 GPT JHFS+ \"New Drive Name\" 0g\n\nWhere disk2 is the name of your external drive, listed from diskutil list\n\nA: Whilst nuking the drive (using dd) will work, it is the nuclear option that doesn't address the problem. The issue is that apparently you need an EFI partition of at least 200MB. An EFI partition is just a regular FAT32 partition with the boot flag set, so you might have to use GParted on a Linux recovery disk to arrange it (I'm sure its possible on the Mac, but I have no idea).\n\nA: As noted here, one possible cause for this error is if the drive does not have a large enough EFI partition.\nI did not want to wipe my entire drive, only one partition, but I could afford to backup the contents of the first partition. My process was to backup the first partition (from Windows), delete the first partition (from Windows), reformat the last partition of the drive (from Mac) which created an EFI partition, add back the first partition (from Windows), then restore the first partition from the backup. Any other OS could be used instead of Windows, and you could also use gdisk from Homebrew to delete the first partition from within Mac.\nHope this helps anyone who does not want to erase their entire drive.\n\nA: I had the same problem with media kit reporting ‘not enough space on device’. I used a Windows 10 installation usb stick to boot my MBP. If u follow the installation proces, there is a point where it ask you to create a clean install. Choose the clean install option. After that you can select drives/or partitions to install windows. At this point you can delete al partitions on the drive. That is what I did. I deleted al partitions and did not make a new one. After this I canceld windows installation and reboot MBP with MacOS install usb drive. Then I could format SSD without problems to MacOS extended journaled with GUID.

I'm attempting to write an AppleScript that keeps repeating an action until you press a key or click away from the active window. How would I go about doing that?\nrepeat repeatTimes times\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    keystroke firstText\n    keystroke return\n    delay firstDelay\n\n    keystroke secondText\n    keystroke return\n    delay secondDelay\n\nend tell\nend repeat\n\ni would prefer to modify repeat repeatTimes times to until keypress (any keypress) or until app not active or something. any ideas?\n\nA: After a bit of researching, I came up with a 75% solution to your question.  The script below will repeat the actions inside the loop until one of two assertions are met:\n① The window that has focus now is different to the window that had focus before;\n② A modifier key out of either fn, ⌃, ⌥ and ⌘ is pressed.\nI tried to find a solution that permits testing for any keydown event, but was only able to find a solution involving the modifier keys.  AppleScript alone cannot listen for key events, however AppleScript-ObjC can.  Perhaps another person will be able to provide the full solution that allows for monitoring of any key pressing.\nI've added comments within the script to help guide you through what each part does.  Bear in mind, this is just an example script demonstrating one possible way of implementing these methods to achieve your objective:\n    use sys : application \"System Events\"\n    use framework \"Cocoa\"\n\n\n    set [firstText, secondText] to [\"A\", \"B\"]\n    set [firstDelay, secondDelay] to [0.2, 0.3]\n\n\n    # Open up a new TextEdit document into which\n    # the keystrokes can produce output\n    tell application \"TextEdit\"\n        activate\n\n        set D to make new document\n    end tell\n\n\n    # Get frontmost window of the frontmost application\n    set P to a reference to (the first process whose frontmost is true)\n    set W to the front window of P\n\n\n    # Repeat loop will break if the focussed window changes\n    repeat until the front window of P is not equal to W\n\n        tell sys to keystroke [firstText, return] as text\n        if modifierKeydown() then exit repeat # Exit on keypress\n\n        delay firstDelay\n\n        tell sys to keystroke [secondText, return] as text\n        if modifierKeydown() then exit repeat # Exit on keypress\n\n        delay secondDelay\n\n        if modifierKeydown() then exit repeat # Exit on keypress\n\n    end repeat\n\n\n    close D without saving # Close the TextEdit document\n\n\n    # Returns true if any of\n    # { function, control, option, command }\n    # are depressed; false otherwise\n    on modifierKeydown()\n\n        set __m to current application's ¬\n            NSEvent's modifierFlags() as any\n\n        return (__m > 262143)\n\n    end modifierKeydown\n\nNote that the repeat loop checks for modifier keydown status a number of times within a single iteration.  I experimented with checking once, which necessitated holding down the modifier key for such a time until the loop was able to arrive at the checkpoint; and three times, which shortens the waiting time but at the expense of time that might be otherwise spent processing other actions within the loop (i.e. it will add to the delay times already in place between commands).\nThere's no right or wrong there—you'll have to play around with it and see what feels best for you.\nLikewise, the check performed on window focus is only done once per iteration, which is actually very sufficient.  However, you will notice that clicking away from the window is ever so slightly obstructed by the attention given to performing the actions inside the loop.  It's not a problem at all, it just makes changing windows something done with more intent that normal.\nNone of that is surprising, however, given what this script is doing and how it's doing it.\nLet me know how you get on, and if you have any questions or problems, leave a comment and I'll do my best to assist.\n\nA: You can do something like:\n-- Get current active app\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set activeApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\n\nset repeatValue to false\nrepeat until repeatValue\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set newActiveApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true\n        if newActiveApp is not in activeApp then\n            set repeatValue to true -- stop the loop\n        end if\n\n        log \"Repeating\"\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\nSo You can check the current active app and decide if you want to stop the loop.\n", "Q: Why does my external USB drive power off even when set not to?

I own a PowerBook G4 A1104 with 512 mb of ram and 1.5 ghz and I also own an Ibook G4 1.33 Ghz 512 ram. I have seen videos on youtube of people turning their ibook g4 and imac g4 into  machines running from Yosemite to Sierra.\nHow can I accomplish this?\n\nA: Your Mac uses the PowerPC processor. Yosemite and Sierra require an Intel x64 compatible processor. So a software modification not practically possible. I can not directly answer the question regarding whether a hardware modification can be made. Although, I can say that usually such modifications require reusing the existing logical board, RAM and peripherals. The existing logic board, RAM and peripherals will be to slow for Yosemite and Sierra. Furthermore the video will not support the higher resolutions required by Yosemite and Sierra.\nIf you want to choose a current operating system, try Ubuntu (Lubuntu) or some other linux distro. \n", "Q: Why is My Mac Running So Slowly? It's a Mac Mini, Late 2012, 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM and an internal fusion drive of 1 TB, running macOS High Sierra 10.13.3.\nThe issue is that it's running so slowly that there I can move the mouse and it takes up to sixty seconds (on one memorable occasion, eighteen minutes) for the cursor to move on the screen.  I launch an application and it's two or three minutes before it's available.  I say available, but it's not really available unless I'm prepared to move the mouse and then go for a coffee whilst it acknowledges the action. \nI ran top command: \nLoad Avg: 58.82, 38.48, 36.87\n\nIt's a relatively new installation - about a month old.  There are four USB drives hanging off a powered hub, but disconnecting them does nothing to speed up the system.  I launch ActivityMonitor and watch it for a while.  The CPU usage is about 98.8% idle. Once I start to use the Mac, I see 'kernel process' which can run up to 1600% of CPU. The fan is on constantly and is extremely loud.\nThe applications that I can see running (in the Dock as opposed to in the background or via a terminal) are Safari, Mail.app, WhatsApp, iTerm2 (with eight tabs), Gedit and of course, Activity Monitor.  Quitting them all doesn't eliminate the 'kernal task', although if I don't touch the Mac, that will disappear after about half an hour.  \nHere is the output of top at the moment, when things are relatively calm:\nProcesses: 289 total, 2 running, 287 sleeping, 1053 threads                15:17:07\nLoad Avg: 1.56, 2.67, 4.64  CPU usage: 2.78% user, 2.17% sys, 95.3% idle   SharedLibs: 316M resident, 63M data, 50M linkedit.

All advice gratefully received.\n\nA: In my experience, unusually slow Macs are usually slow due to hard drive failure, or Malware installation (or in the case of MacBook Pros, a bad hard drive cable). Those are the common causes these days.\nStep one: Download SMART Utility and see what it says about your physical drives. If your HDD is failing, it will tell you right away.\n(Note: it can't check the SMART status of most external drives, leave your externals disconnected through this whole process, and until the Mac is running normally again)\nStep two: Download and run MalwareBytes for Mac, and run it. The free version is all you need. Remove anything it finds. \nIf none of these end up being the cause, then you have something much less common going on on your machine. \n", "Q: \"Open with\" configuration gets screwed up unpredictably on El Capitan I've been having a problem on my El Capitan installation for a few months. At unpredictable times, the system \"unlearns\" the programs associated with certain file types.\nFor example, I double click a PDF in Finder, and it tries to open it with Microsoft Word (which of course complains it is unable to open it). To fix, I have to [right-click -> \"Open With\" -> \"Other...\" ] a PDF file, go find Preview (which by the way is not even in the \"Recommended Applications\") and select \"Always Open With\", and then the problem goes away for some time.\nFor a while I thought this problem was limited to PDFs, and was somehow a bug caused by Microsoft Office.\nHowever, just now I had the same problem, but the system defaulted to iTerm for opening hyperlinks! So when I clicked on a link inside an email, it caused an empty iTerm to be opened... To fix I had to create a shortcut to a webpage, then [right-click -> \"Open With\" -> \"Other...\" ] and select Firefox.\nWould be glad for any help to restore sanity, or at least to understand what is going on!\n\nA: I would suggest you rebuild the LaunchServices database, the mechanism which matches files to the apps which open them.\nThere are several sites which explain the process, here and here, for example.\nIn essence, you need to copy and paste the following command in Terminal after making a full backup with Time Machine:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain u -domain s -domain l -v\n\n\nIf you are leery of using Terminal, you can use the free app Onyx to rebuild the index.

I am charging my iPhone from a newer Thunderbolt 3/USB C enabled MacBook (in my case MacBook Pro 2016) with USB C to lightning cable from Apple.\nWhat I know is:\nFor example there is an iPhone 8/8 Plus/X or a newer iPad Pro 13\nwith computer (default(?)) or iPhone charger wall plug: 5W (5V 1A)\nwith iPad charger or 2.4A powerbank USB A to lightning: 12W (5V 2.4A)\nwith MacBook charger wall plug (29W or larger) USB C to lightning: 29W fast charging\n\nAnything I do from a 2016 MacBook Pro 15 it seems I get the default charging speed (5W) through USB C despite the same USB C to lightning cable with the MacBook wall plug can fast charge (29W).\nThe USB C/Thunderbolt 3 standard though supports 100W. Is there a (highly likely unofficial) way to tell my Mac that the iPhone/iPad plugged in via the USB C to lightning cable would like to take a faster charge? \nSo is there a way to charge from a Mac an iPhone/iPad with 12W or 29W instead of the \"default\" 5W?\n\nA: No, a USB-C to lightning cable that is Apple certified will charge iOS devices at the fullest capacity the new MacBook Pro will provide to a USB and lightning connector. \nThat same cable will fast charge from USB-C PD compatible chargers like the Apple ones.  \niOS doesn’t present as thunderbolt so you don’t get that amount of power over lightning connector. \nThe technical details are available to any organization that participates in the MFI program - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFi_Program and the signaling between devices to decide to fast charge is somewhat sophisticated and possibly has an encryption / identity key (I haven't seen the specifications so that part is speculation).\nThere’s nothing hidden. Apple could decide to increase the charge since they control all the drivers and power management and SMC and lightning specifications. They just chose the 5w you are seeing. \n\nA: \nSo is there a way to charge from a Mac an iPhone/iPad with 12W or 29W instead of the \"default\" 5W?\n\nNo, Apple complies with the minimum required power from USB-C out of their computers, which is 5 volts at 3 amps.  The USB-C spec obviously allows more power out of a USB-C port, otherwise Apple could not sell their 96 watt USB-C power supplies.  The USB-C spec also obviously allows more power into a USB-C port, and Apple complies with this for their laptops to charge from their 96 watt USB-C power supplies.\nUsing an Apple computer to charge an Apple phone or tablet will obviously work but so far Apple only specifies a maximum 15 watts from the USB-C ports on their computers.  If you need more power then you will have to use a charger brick, or perhaps non-Apple computer.\nIf you need more power while maintaining a data connection to your computer then you may be able to find a dock that allows this.  Good luck finding one though, I have yet to see such a dock.\nYou should be seeing more than 5 watts charging to your iDevice from a computer USB-C port.  It should be charging at 12 watts.  If you cannot get better than 5 watts then there is likely something wrong with the cable.  I have such a cable, it is a \"charge only\" cable that lacks the data lines to tell the computer that the phone is connected, therefore the phone only draws 5 watts since it doesn't know that the computer can safely provide more power.\n", "Q: How to put an Apple Watch on a wifi network that its iPhone doesn't know? My college has two wifi networks: eduroam, which uses WPA2 Enterprise authentication and is meant for all of our computers/phones/tablets/etc., and open, which has no authentication and is meant for devices that can't handle WPA2 Enterprise, such as smart TVs and Amazon Echoes. WPA2 Enterprise-capable devices literally aren't allowed to use open, they won't be allowed to connect to the Internet from that network.\nMy question is, how can I teach my Apple Watch that open is a usable network, given that I can't put my iPhone on open?\n\nA: I am assuming your iPhone can connect to the open network (but can't get to the internet).\nYour iPhone needs to be paired with Apple Watch when it connects to the network — it doesn't work over iCloud Keychain. \nOnce your iPhone is on open your Apple Watch should follow. You can then Forget the network on your iPhone and it will remain on Apple Watch.\n", "Q: Control + H Deletes text and other weird keyboard shortcuts For some weird reason, when I hold down Control + H it deletes the text as if I was pressing the \"Delete\" button.

I have a workflow in automator that \"receives a selected PDF file in Finder\", then \"Open finder items\", follow by \"Set PDF Metadata\"\nWhen running the workflow, \"Set PDF Metadata\" opens a window that takes some inputs (title, author, and so on), and then requires me to press \"Continue\" to move on the next step of the workflow.\nThe window that \"Set PDF Metadata\" opens is always partially minimized, so I have to manually resize it bigger every time I run the workflow. Is there some way I can specify the size and position that the window should open at?\nTo replicate this behavior a simple workflow that goes as follows should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get specified finder item, and specify a PDF file\n\n*Open finder items (open with default application)\n\n*Set PDF metadata, with the \"Title\" and \"Author\" boxes checked\n\n\nFurther information and screenshots:\nDefault PDF application is Preview\nOS is MacOS Sierra 10.13.3\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to set the position and size of the Set PDF Metadata action's window when run from an Automator Service, however it requires a bit of a creative workaround.\nI have tested the following and it works for me under macOS High Sierra.\nThere are two primary components for this process, one being the Automator Service named Edit PDF Metadata, and the other, an AppleScript application that sets the position and size of the Set PDF Metadata action's window.\nFor the Automator Service, which I saved as Edit PDF Metadata, the image below shows the settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the PDF document does not first have to be opened to set the metadata and why there is no Open Finder Items action. If you were doing it the see information in the document as a reference to be used in the Set PDF Metadata action, you can add it back in.\n\n\nExample code for the Run Shell Script action:\nopen -a \"/Applications/Resize Set PDF Metadata Window.app\"\necho \"$1\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the fully qualified pathname to the app does not necessarily need to be used and the open command could be shortened to open -a \"Resize Set PDF Metadata Window\". Then it doesn't matter where the Resize Set PDF Metadata Window.app is saved, it's found automatically. I've include the fully qualified pathname just so there was no ambiguity.\n\n\n\nNext, the desired position and size of the window for the Set PDF Metadata action needs to be determined:\nIn Script Editor, open a new document with the following AppleScript code, but do not run it yet, just have it ready.\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    get {position, size} of window 1 ¬\n        of process \"com.apple.automator.runner\"\n\nNow in Finder, select a PDF document and right-click selecting Edit PDF Metadata from the Services section of the context menu.\nThen position and resize the Set PDF Metadata action's window on the screen as wanted, leaving it on screen for the time being, then back in Script Editor, run the code you prepped to get the desired position and size of the window for the Set PDF Metadata action.\nOn my system it returned, e.g.: {{870, 280}, {700, 290}}, on my 27\" Thunderbolt Display.\nMake note of the results for use with the code, which is used next, to create the Resize Set PDF Metadata Window.app in Script Editor.\nYou can now click the Cancel button on the Set PDF Metadata action's window, as it has served its purpose to this point.\nNow create the Resize Set PDF Metadata Window.app in Script Editor using the following example AppleScript code:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set i to 0\n    repeat until (exists window 1 of process \"com.apple.automator.runner\")\n        delay 0.1\n        set i to i + 1\n        if i > 30 then return\n    end repeat\n    tell window 1 of process \"com.apple.automator.runner\"\n        set position to {870, 280}\n        set size to {700, 290}\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the value of set position to and set size to as appropriate and save as an application named Resize Set PDF Metadata Window in the /Applications folder.\n\n*Note that on my system 30, in if i > 30 then return, equates to ~5 seconds and is used so repeat until is not an endless loop, if something happens and window 1 of process \"com.apple.automator.runner\" doesn't appear for some reason.\nBefore really using the new Automator Service for the first time, you need to add Resize Set PDF Metadata Window.app to: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\nWith that done, Edit PDF Metadata is ready to used on a PDF document in Finder from the Services section of the context menu. It is also available from the Finder > Services menu as well. Also a keyboard shortcut can be assigned to the service in: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Files and Folders\nAlso note that by default, the metadata added to the selected PDF document is automatically saved upon pressing the Continue button, so there is no need to use the Quit Application action set to Preview with the [√] Ask to save changes check box clicked. That is unless you added the Open Finder Items action, then add back the Quit Application action set to Preview too. (Note that Ask to save changes did not work in my testing.)\n\nNOTE: Use caution with the Rename PDF Documents action, because if the Title check box is checked in the Set PDF Metadata action's window but text box is left blank, it will delete the PDF document upon clicking the Continue button! (This appears to be a bug in this action under macOS High Sierra.) Additionally, if you set the Title to the name of an existing PDF document, while the metadata is changed, nonetheless the target file is not renamed. As always, insure you have proper backups before running automated services upon your files.\n\nThe only drawback to this method that I can think of, is that only one Automator Service can be run at a time, this one, otherwise it will not be able to get window 1 of process \"com.apple.automator.runner\" if there is more than one \"com.apple.automator.runner\" process running. But how often does one really need to have more then one Automator Service run at a time.\n\nIf you do not want to have the Dock Tile for the Resize Set PDF Metadata Window.app show on the Dock, then in Terminal use the following command:\ndefaults write '/Applications/Resize Set PDF Metadata Window.app/Contents/Info.plist' LSUIElement -bool yes\n\nAfterwards, you can use the command with -bool no to have to have the app's Dock Tile show on the Dock.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways accomplish a task. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate error handling as needed/wanted. \n", "Q: Dead battery on two year old purchase - pulled new out of the box MacBook Pro touch bar 13'' I bought a MacBook Pro 13'' with touch bar 2 years ago and only now (for several circumstances) I had the chance to unbox it and connect it (it remained in an unopened box for two years). \nI plugged the computer and started to use it normally but noticed that the battery stays at 0% and the battery status reads: \"Condition: Replace Now\". I just did a reset of the SMC and that did not fix it?\nAre there alternatives to servicing / replacing the battery?\n\nA: Lithium ion batteries should be kept at 50% charge for long term storage and it's possibly your battery had permanent damage if the voltage went too low - or into deep discharge state. Ideally, you would charge the battery up to 50% once every 6 months to avoid this (which isn't helpful news now that it's been 2 years for yours).\nThe good news is Apple warrants batteries for 1 year from purchase and 3 years with AppleCare and occasionally will cover a battery even out of warranty.\nI would seek service, but you might have to pay for the repair if it's outside the time window for Apple to cover the cost. They can check on AppleCare or any other special circumstances and offer you more detailed advice on the cost for your repair if that's needed.\nYou've done all the things I would check:\n\n\n*\n\n*one reset of SMC\n\n*charge for a day, try to run off charge and then charge for a second day\n\n*check the System Profiler / System Information to see the cycle count / full charge capacity and condition details\n\n\nThe next step is official service for a diagnosis and repair quote.\nHere are the relevant parts of Apple's battery page on maximizing perfoance:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Do not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50%. If you store a device when its battery is\n  fully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state,\n  which renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you\n  store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may\n  lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\n  \n*If you plan to store your device for longer than six months, charge it to 50% every six months.\n  \n\n", "Q: Add student status to Apple store app I am a student who also has the iOS Apple Store App on their iPhone. \nIs there a way in viewing and buying products with a student discount through the app or can I only use my student discount on apple.com/uk?\n\nA: It's currently not possible to use the education store on the Apple Store app and you'll need to use the website.\n", "Q: Can automation service to get the parent folder path?

There was not, and I simply continued to search online if there was ANY way they can be changed.\nI came to a website, seeing someone wanting to add a new shortcut, for documents (not as simply as I would want, but...), using Automator.

I'm not guaranteeing that your invisible 13GB of files are definitely hanging around in the iCloud trash, but it's just the most obvious first guess that I could think of.  So, let's find out:\nOpen up Terminal and type in this command:\ncd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs\n\nThat will take you to the local storage folder where iCloud keeps copies of your files on your computer.  Type ls to list the files in the directory if you're curious, but it's much the same as navigating to your iCloud folder in Finder.\nHowever, what you actually want to do is see if the iCloud trash is still full of files that are taking up space:\ndu -d1 .Trash\n\nHopefully, it'll contain about 13GB of files in it.  If this is the case, and you're sure there's nothing in the trash folder you wish to keep, just delete the folder:\nrm -R .Trash\n\nThis is permanent and cannot be undone.  So be sure you're happy to lose those files in the trash.\nThen type exit and quit Terminal.\n\nA: I'm adding another answer, because there's another possible solution to your problem.  I can see from your screenshot that the 13.1 GB of files are categorised under Other Documents.\nI navigated to the same window in System Preferences to get more information on this.  When I click on Other Documents, a description appears in the right-hand pane:\n\nPerhaps this is too obvious an solution to be worth any merit, but have you opened up your iCloud folder in Finder and had a look at the files sitting at the top-level of the folder ?\nIn case you don't know how to open the folder in Finder, go to Finder, and either access it from the menu by selecting Go > iCloud Drive, or press the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘I.\n\nA: I was able to free up space by going to icloud.com, clicking on \"Recently deleted items\" in the lower right hand corner, and deleting what's there.  Note that it seemed to have some trouble with large directories.  It would show them as deleted, but they would still be there after reloading the page.  For some reason, it helped if I left the page open until it didn't warn me about navigating away from the site.  Eventually I got everything purged and my storage space was freed up.\n\nA: It seems that macOS 10.14 Mojave has no permissions settings for the ~/Library/Mobile Documents folder. None of these files appear in the iCloud web interface or under recently deleted/recover file.\nI had no \"Other Documents\" setting in the iCloud Manage Storage Preference Pane and after disabling all apps in iCloud, there were still files in the folder. I had to completely shut off the iCloud service in order to remove the files.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro screen keeps randomly going black after login, weird issues A couple days ago while I was using my 15 inch Macbook Pro 2015 Retina Display laptop (got it brand new 2-3 months ago, running latest version of Sierra), the screen flashed black a few times, and then completely went to sleep on its own while I was in the middle of something. I couldn't get it to wake up, so I had to force restart it. After that, I couldn't get it to turn back on unless it was connected to a power source. As soon as I would turn it back on and login, the screen would go black again. Even just opening finder or safari or sitting on the desktop would make it go black.\nI looked online and attempted resetting the SMC and PRAM several, several, several times. Sometimes, I would login and the screen would be completely distorted and discolored. I attempted logging in via the Guest account, and browsed Safari for 2+ hours just fine, but as soon as I went back to my user account the problem started again. I rebooted and ran the disk utilities and even re-installed Mac OS completely. I still have no luck, and now, sometimes when I turn it on, the \"startup chime\" will play over and over again every 2 seconds like it's trying to start up but can't.\nI'm not sure what to do at this point as I've already tried a fresh install of Mac OS. Next, I was thinking of erasing my drives but before I do that I want to see if there's anything else I can do. I even changed all of my system settings to not dim the screen display and to never go to sleep because the screen was randomly dimming at times.\nAny thoughts?\nP.S. I'm currently typing this on the Macbook after booting it with command+r and clicking on \"safari help\", again it works fine in when logged in as Guest too, it's only after I login to my user account that this happens. Sometimes it's immediate, sometimes it takes a few minutes.\n\nA: I got into the Apple store today to see if someone could take a look at the problem. I waited about an hour and a half and during that time I was able to use my Macbook just fine. I found that if I left the mouse idle for more than about 10 seconds that the display would shut off. However, while playing a graphics intensive game like League of Legends, it was just fine, so that's what I did for an hour and a half.\nWhen I brought it in I was able to reproduce the problem immediately by just leaving it idle for a few seconds. They ran their diagnostic test and found that something failed with the display's backlight sensor I guess. They sent it in and it was covered under warranty.\nSo looks like back to my slow 4gb RAM Acer laptop for 3-5 days while they fix it! I've only had it for around 90 days so I'm not sure if it's just a defect or something I did. I haven't dropped it or spilled anything on it. Who knows.\n", "Q: Best version of DOSBox for macOS (Homebrew version seems abandoned) I've been using DOSBox through Homebrew for years, and now it won't update because of a SHA256 mismatch error. I tried all possible updates and cleanups in Homebrew to no avail. According to Homebrew, this means the brew is abandoned. DOSBox was last updated in 2010. \nWhat is the best version of DOSBox for macOS, preferably available through Homebrew?\n\nA: DOSBox-X is your best bet, it's the only one that is currently being updated.

Rebooting still produces a prohibitory symbol.  I’m still able to boot into recovery mode (command-R at startup), however running disk repair on my MacBook HD does NOT solve the problem.  I have also tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*specifying the startup disk (problem still persists); \n\n*attempting to start in safe mode (problem persists); \n\n*doing the NVRAM reset (problem persists).  \n\n\nIn the past, the only way I was able to get around the problem, is by re-formatting my HD, installing latest version of Mojave OS, and then migrating all my data from my Time Machine backup.  \nThis happened again the other day with the recent Mojave 10.14.2 update.\nMy computer automatically installed the update overnight, and in the morning, my screen was showing circle slash.  This time I did some more research, and discovered that the issue may be caused by unsigned kernel extension (KEXT) files existing on my HD.\nKernel Extensions are pieces of code that extends the capability of the base kernel of an operating system. The kernel typically manages Input / Output (I/O) requests, and in macOS the file ends in .kext.\nStarting with Yosemite, kernel extensions must be code-signed by the developer with Apple authorization or macOS won’t load them. Sometimes these un-signed kernel extensions cause this headache after a macOS update.\nUsing terminal command in Recovery Mode, you should be able to resolve this problem by removing unsigned kext extensions from location:/Volumes/<your system's drive name>/Library/Extensions/ [not to be confused with /System/Library/Extensions/].\nAfter I removed the following KEXT files from the /Volumes/<your system's drive name>/Library/Extensions/ directory, my MacBook booted up properly, and finished installing the Mojave update:\n\n\n*\n\n*BJUSBLoad.kext (Creator: Canon)\n\n*CIJUSBLoad.kext (Creator: Canon)\n\n*ParagonSnapshot.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*ufsd_NTFS.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*VDMounter.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*LittleSnitch.kext (Creator: LittleSnitch)\n\n\nFURTHER DETAILS: \nThis article (MacBook Will Not Start Up After macOS Update, How-To Fix)\nprovides some helpful information regarding: \nIn that article, the section titled “Un-Assigned Kernel Misfiring” explains how to boot into Recovery Mode and launch Terminal utility.  However, one problem with that article is that the kextstat command is not available in Terminal utility running in Recovery Mode.\nAs a work-around, these are the steps I took to solve the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery (with command-R or command-shift-R if you don't have recovery partition)\n\n*First, pick Disk Utility, select your main disk and Mount it; this is required if your disk is encrypted and requires a password to be mounted\n\n*Now select Disk Utility -> Quit; then Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*Begin typing in Terminal following commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /Volumes/\n\n*cd <your system's drive name>\n(Note: If your system drive has any spaces in it’s name, then put the name in single quotes.  For example, my MacBook boot drive is called “MacBook HD”, so the command I would type is: cd ‘MacBook HD’\n\n*cd library\n\n*cd extensions\n\n*cd ls (Note: first letter is a lower case L)\n\n\n\nAfter you type ‘ls’, you should see a list of KEXT extensions like this:\nACS6x.kext                CIJUSBLoad.kext\nATTOCelerityFC8.kext      CalDigitHDProDrv.kext\nATTOExpressSASHBA2.kext   HighPointIOP.kext\nATTOExpressSASRAID2.kext  HighPointRR.kext\nArcMSR.kext               PromiseSTEX.kext\nBJUSBLoad.kext            SoftRAID.kext\n\nThe KEXT extensions listed above are all ones properly signed by Apple.\nThese KEXT extensions can remain, but if you have other KEXT extensions listed, chances are that some or all of those others are causing the issue.\nIf you see any of these extensions (listed below), you should be able to safely delete them in order to fix your problem.  I’d recommend removing each extension, one at a time, then rebooting to see if it worked, and if not, repeat steps above and delete next one.  Based on my limited research, the ones I’d recommend deleting first are:\n\n\n*\n\n*ParagonSnapshot.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*VDMounter.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n*LittleSnitch.kext (Creator: LittleSnitch)\n\n*ufsd_NTFS.kext (Creator: Paragon)\n\n\nWhile in Terminal (in Recovery mode), to delete (or remove) a desired KEXT extension (eg., LittleSnitch.kext) type:\nrm -r <full name of extension>\n\n(eg, rm -r LittleSnitch.kext)\nOnce complete, quit Terminal and restart your Mac.\n\nA: Well took it to the apple store and their super tools didn't help.

My wife and I are getting a ridiculous amount of same-exchange spam calls (same area code and first three digits) and are looking for a solution. One promising solution is outlined in this apple discussion -- create a .vcf file to establish a contact containing all 10,000 numbers (-0000 ... -9999) in that exchange and then block that contact. A nuclear option so to speak.\nI've read that having a contact with several hundred numbers in it can be slow to open, on the order of several seconds to open for one containing 200 contacts. But it isn't clear if \"open\" in that context refers to opening it in the Contacts app to view or loading it into memory to check when a call comes in.\nWe each have an iPhone 6 and just upgraded to iOS 11 via wipe and restore, and we haven't experienced much slowdown so far other than a slight (fractions of a second) degradation in response here and there.\nWhat kinds of performance issues should we expect if we take this route?\nEdit And specifically is there any danger of bricking our phones or otherwise crashing if we use this? There is some discussion in the above link of the contacts app no longer opening.\nAnother option is to create say 20 contacts each with 500 numbers, or 100 contacts each with 100 numbers, or something like that. But I don't know if there is a larger performance hit for breaking it up that way vs having them all in one.\nWhy the nuclear option?  We moved away from that location ten years ago but kept the numbers for convenience, we do not receive any calls from so-called \"neighbors\" out there, and I would prefer not to use a call-blocking app due to privacy concerns, so this seems like a perfect solution. (second only to nuking the spammers from orbit)\nEdit 2 I am currently experimenting with creating the contacts manually with 500 numbers per contact, for a total of 20 contacts. It only took a few minutes to generate and import four contacts with 2,000 numbers total once the spreadsheet was set up, and that included emailing the contacts to my phone and importing them there.\nSolution I'm marking Matt's answer as the solution because he pointed me in the direction of the app WideProtect. I installed it a couple days ago and so far there have been no calls.\nInitially I was avoiding installing an app due to privacy concerns, but after reading the CallKit API I was persuaded to give it a shot. The app does require access to your Contacts if you want to allow numbers from your contacts through the block (which seems opposite from what the CallKit API says...) but I got around that by blocking all ranges except the range my wife's number is in. For example, if my wife's number is 123-555-3859 I would block 123-555-0XXX, 123-555-1XXX, 123-555-2XXX, 123-555-4XXX, etc. Skipping 3XXX. That gives only a 10% chance scammers will pick the range that includes my wife's number, so that is an acceptable tradeoff to me AND it avoids giving WideProtect access to my contacts list. If it becomes unbearable I can block 123-555-30XX..123-555-37XX and 123-555-39XX giving only a 1% chance they randomly pick the range. So that works great for me and preserves privacy.\nMany thanks to Matt for pointing me down that path. This looks like a great solution.\n\nA: There's no impact in performance. TrueCaller uses CallKit, the iOS provided method of blocking spam calls, and behind the scenes they are all loaded into one contact.\nThe only issue would be if you wanted to manage that contact manually rather than using an app that is designed to do it. Swiping to delete hundreds of contacts is a pain!\nAnyway, there's an app called WideProtect that uses the CallKit to do the blocking and will let you set ranges of numbers to block.\n\nA: I can report no impact to performance at a far lower limit - my contact named \"Telemarket Spam\" to which I add callers and block that one contact is around 125 phones deep.\nI would add all the numbers to one contact to simplify your life until you notice an issue or a problem and then back off a bit, and iterate to multiple contacts.\n\nAt some point, if the annoyance of curating this list overcomes my hesitance to subscribe to a service that integrates with the iOS phone app to classify and attempt to block suspect and known bad actors, I'll probably pay for a service to block calls. So far, I can't measure any slowdown or freeze - but I could see potential issues if you do manage to have thousands of numbers in the same contact.\nSorry this isn't super rigorous, but this one might be fairly easy to test empirically by generating a contact with 5,000 numbers and seeing when it breaks when you have time and a backup to restore your iOS device.\nIf I needed to profile this, I could use Instruments to attach to the contacts app and see where the contact is stored on the filesystem (for iOS or macOS) so there's clearly a way to reverse engineer how much space a number takes to store and measure any CPU usage related to editing that file or processing that data. Unless you see memory and CPU spiking, you can probably safely assume that as long as you care to keep adding numbers, the system will respond well if you just look at overall speed of the device while editing that contact.\n", "Q: iCloud warning does not go away Apple keeps asking me to accept the new iCloud terms and conditions on my new iphone x.

I have a dumb playlist containing a subset of these, which I sync to my iPod Nano (it doesn't have room for my entire library(.  Also on the nano are other dumb playlists, each containing specific songs that are subsets of my main dumb playlist, which are tailored to my various workouts.\nRecently, however, I've started listening to audiobooks on my Nano, which means I need to free up more room, so I'd like to replace all the CD-quality songs on my nano with 320 kbps versions (and I'd likewise like to still be able to use my various workout playlists).  I thus had iTunes create 320 kbps versions of all my CD-quality songs. What I'd like to do is create smart playlists containing only songs whose bitrate is 320 kbps, and whose title matches a song found in a specified dumb playlist. This doesn't seem to be possible, but if it is I'd love to find out how!\nYes, I could just leave things as they are and, from within the Nano control window available in iTunes, tell iTunes to convert everything on my Nano to 256 kbps.  But, since I have the space for 320 kbps, why not keep the maximum resolution?  Granted, I might have trouble telling the difference....\n\nA: For a portable device using headphones in a non-analytical environment, I'd just sync them at 128 kbps AAC.\nYou're really unlikely to notice. \nYou can do that in iTunes/[device]/summary in the last section, Options. It does that on the fly at sync [so takes a long time, first time] & keeps your iTunes at full rez, using copies to send to the portable device. You can set this separately for each device you sync, the low-bitrate dupes are kept in your iTunes Library once converted, but iTunes always plays the highest rate available.  \nIt's effectively seamless\n\nAs a more generalised comment, & speaking as a professional sound engineer, I don't think tracks ripped from CD are worth saving at anything higher than 320kbps AAC*. Much as they were vaunted as being the 'perfect solution' for audio... in the 80's... they really don't have all that much data in them to benefit from anything above 320.\n*or FLAC, but as iTunes doesn't handle FLAC, that point is moot.\n", "Q: OS X 10.3.9 Update available?

I use Apple Mail and I have a work account on Exchange/Office 365 that I use through Apple Mail. I do NOT have the Exchange password, I am not the administrator. Is there a way for me to archive or download all the emails (to a .OLM or .PST file?) and then import them to a Gmail account?\nBottom Line: I want my Exchange emails exported to a Gmail account.\nThanks for any suggestions!\n\nA: If you don't own the account login details, you've picked the best solution, this would be to set up a rule forwarding all new emails to your Gmail email.\nAny Mail Client, including Apple Mail, app needs log credentials to establish the connection. So to be able to use Gmail as client app for your Exchange account, you will either have \n\n\n*\n\n*to submit those manually  or \n\n*to have the password in iCloud\nkeychain\nFor the older emails, you can export them in .pst and upload that to Gmail but that's rather desktop operation.

What can I do to fix this? (iOS 11.3) What can I do to fix this? I am using iOS 11.3.\n\nA: If it immediately crashes your system there are a couple of things you could do, starting with just powering the phone off and on again.\nFailing that I would delete the app, reboot and reinstall it.\n", "Q: Firefox problems when remapping Copy to ctrl-c I remapped Copy to ctrl-c via Preference>Keyboard>Shortcuts and it works pretty good. But when I have the find dialog open in Firefox, when I try and Copy I actually end up toggling \"Match Case\". I don't care if I have a shortcut for \"Match Case\", could someone please help me keep my Copy functionality while the Find dialog is open? \n\nA: You can use a tool like BetterTouchTool (or some similar shortcut remapping program for Mac) to remap Control C to Command C. This will prevent Firefox from knowing that you pressed Control C at all, and thus it won't enable the \"Match Case\" option in the find dialog box.\nAlternatively if you are interested you can read up the documentation on Karabiner Element's new complex modifications feature to remap Control C to Command C in Firefox. This is similar to doing it with any other program, although I suspect that it is more reliable. However, it requires a bit more knowledge of how to add modifications to Karabiner Elements, because (as of writing this answer) the feature is quite new to Karabiner Elements, and there is no GUI method of creating complex modifications (apart from importing one from the website, but you might not find the one you are looking for).\n", "Q: How to solve it when the iPhone is going to be locked for 48 years? A mom gave her iPhone to her kid to play with (or possibly watch cartoons on YouTube), and the phone was auto-locked probably due to some time of inactivity.\nThen the kid just randomly entered some passwords and then when the mom saw the phone again, the phone showed it would be locked for 25,114,984 minutes, before the user can try to enter the password again.\nThat's 48 years. How can it be solved, if the mom doesn't want to wait for 48 years?\n\nA: This is very unlikely a security issue. This insane amount of minutes message is usually due to the iPhone clock being reset. You should be able to solve it by rebooting the phone (might need to do it a couple of times) with a working SIM card in that has data. When the phone boots it should sync the time and unlock everything. \n", "Q: iMac does not wake from sleep on Bluetooth action I work on an iMac (Late 2015) with macOS High Sierra (10.13.3). On this computer I use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. \nThe computer should wake from sleep if the peripherals are used. The corresponding option \"Allow BT devices to wake this computer\" is activated.\nFor the past few weeks, unfortunately, the computer does not wake from sleep if the BT mouse or keyboard are used. Specifically, it does not wake in 80% of the cases. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it does not. \nIf it does not wake on BT action, I can wake it up using a slight touch on the power button. The computer awakes up, but there is no connection to the keyboard and the mouse. Also, there is no warning message, which usually pops up if the connection to a BT keyboard is lost.\nThe only thing I can do in this situation is to force restart unsing power button.\nThere are a lot of similar questions on AD but non of them has an accepted answer. Most commenters suggest to try the common things like restart (muhahaha) reset SMC and PRAM and so one. This did not work for me and it did not work for all the other OPs. In some older questions the problem was solved by updates. Currently there are no updates available.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this issue?\n\nA: I noticed that when I connect the charging cable to either the mouse or keyboard and the MAC, that device starts working (because it's functioning as wired instead of BT). So I have my keyboard permanently plugged in to the charging cable and I have a wired mouse to use on standby when the BT mouse fails to wake.\n\nA: Have you tried plugging in a wired mouse? I have the same problem and this works for me. Bluetooth usually starts working shortly after.\n\nA: I have a usb mouse plugged in all the time because I can't depend on b/t to be alive when I try to bring the mac out of sleep with either the keyboard or apple mouse. This gives me operational control, but I still know my computer isn't working right.\n", "Q: Sudo rm -rf or Trashcan: Which is better for SSD health? Users can sudo rm -rf a file or they can move it to the trash and empty the trashcan. I want to know whether one option has benefits over the other with regard to the \"health\" of an internal solid state drive on a Macbook pro laptop.\n\nA: Both options (as well as any other user-level way of deleting files) will have the same result at the end: the directory entry of the file will be removed and any disk blocks used by the file will be marked as free (details depend on file system used). So there is no difference at all on device level.\n\nA: Deleting a file or moving to Trash will modify the directory, which is cached and will have similar impact (probably no net impact) on the underlying storage.\nNeither will actually have any impact on the storage used for the file contents, although in the case of deletion the sectors/blocks will be marked as free. As this is also done in a separate/shared area of the disk the impact will be minimal.\nIf a trashed file is later deleted the impact is similar to a deletion.\nThe net result is that moving to Trash and deletion have similar impact. Moving to Trash first will result in 2 modifications to directory storage, with minimal (if any) impact.\nThis happens independent of storage technology. Provided the disk has a reasonable free space this is not worth worrying about. Actual SSD block erasure is asynchronous, and SSD have a pool of spare blocks and SSD firmware should balance block usage.\n", "Q: Mac and external HD permissions I'm wondering if my HD gets stolen, and my current permissions are set to:\nUser: R&W\nStaff: R&W\nEveryone: R only.\nWould anyone be able to plug it to a mac (it's a HFS+ partition) and just read any file?\n\nA: External drives [in fact any drive other than the current boot volume] have zero protection by permission.\nIt is trivial to Get Info on the volume & set \"Ignore ownership on this volume\"\n\nThe only way to protect data from any potential bad actor in possession of your drive is to encrypt it.\n", "Q: MacOS dictionary look up stopped working I'm suddenly unable to use the dictionary look up feature in MacOS. When I choose \"Look up\" on a word I get a dialog saying that \"Look Up now shows personalized suggestions... etc\" and a button on the bottom that says \"Continue\" (see image). But the button does not respond to clicking it, so I'm stuck with this message. Neither updating the OS nor restarting seems to mend the issue.\n\nUsing MacOS High Sierra 10.13.3\n\nA: Found a quick fix. Just turning of Spotlight suggestions in Look up brought back the dictionary.\n\nNot being able to click the button previously still seems like a bug to me though.\n\nA: Been having similar problems. The dictionary app wouldn't work at all. Updated os, deleted plist file on advice. The app would work but would only give results from Wikipedia. Spent three weeks trying to figure it out. Lots of posts were about proxies blocking certain files causing the dictionaries not to download. \nI usually run a VPN but had not turned it on for a while. Turned it on and opened the dictionary app and the dictionaries downloaded. Problem solved! I should point out that I was using my work machine and there had been an update to our security stuff which I suspect was blocking the app from downloading the dictionaries. Also, I tested the app without the VPN and it worked.\n", "Q: Recover from mistakenly restoring a different iPhone instead of back up I was just trying to copy my photos with my PC, but I accidentally clicked to restore a back up of my husband iPhone. Everything shown on my mobile is from the back up and I don't see my data now. How do I access data from my iPhone?\n\nA: Not much you’re left with, it’s either restoring from iCloud backup or iTunes backup. iTunes may have backed up your phone during a sync. So you may have a backup from your phone, check it in iTunes -> Preferences -> Devices will list backups.\n", "Q: Upgrading an iMac/eMac IDE disk What are my options for upgrading the drive of an iMac G4 or an eMac to eliminate the noise from the original drive? Either an SSD, or a mechanical HDD with a lower noise level than the original.\nThe second hand value of the machine is $100, so the drive must be justifiably cheap, under $30 if possible. Pre-owned and capacity as small as 16-32 GB is fine.\nFor each suggestion, please specify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Required adapters (to connect the drive to the iMac)\n\n*Expected total price (USD, for easy comparison)\n\n*Expected performance (for non-SSD suggestions such as CF/SD)\n\n\nPS! Reading speed from an IDE drive is around 22 MB/s using dd on the eMac.\nPPS! The easiest way to experiment with drive replacement is by using the IDE cable and power to the CD player, which by a lucky shot can be reached from the removable RAM slot. That way you won't have to disassemble the whole eMac until you've done your research. \n\nA: Upgrade to an SSD\nJust get a simple SSD and an IDE to SATA adapter.  You may need a 3.5\" drive adapter if you use a 2.5\" drive, but those are abundant and easily sourced.\n\n*\n\n*StarTech IDE to SATA adapter (Approx $18 USD)\n\n*Kingston SSD A400 120GB (Approx $50 USD)\n\nThis will give you a solid state solution for less than $70 USD.  You can probably find these items for less on the used market, but probably not by much when you factor shipping and handling.\nThat said, your $30 budget is unrealistic as PATA SSD's are notoriously expensive and any small capacity SSDs (16 to 60GB) will run about $20 USD (plus shipping).  In addition, you will still need the IDE to SATA adapter because those cheap drives are all SATA.  You may spend (slightly) less, but it will be a solution based on used (pre-owned) components.\nConvert IDE to SATA\nThe StarTech IDE to SATA adapter will allow you to use newer SATA disks including SSDs.  Whether you choose to go with an SSD or stick with spinning media, this little adapter will be critical in allowing you to use modern drives with your older hardware.\n\nPersonally, I have used this exact adapter in an X-Serve RAID (connected to a XServe G4)  to use 1TB 2.5\" HDDs (the limitation was 750GB PATA drives).  The X-Serve RAID ran cooler and I increased it's storage capacity limitation by 25% (it was also substantially lighter).  There are other manufacturers of this type of adapter, but this brand seemed to be the most reliable and compact.\n\nA: You could purchase a PATA/IDE SSD off Amazon for under $100. You would likely need to purchase a 2.5\" IDE to 3.5\" IDE cable adapter, as well as a 2.5\" to 3.5\" drive bay adapter.

I'm trialling a working process that makes very heavy use of spaces. Heavy enough that any delay when switching spaces is making it essentially unworkable.\nI made a change — turned \"Reduce Motion\" on — which I think sped things up, but nowhere near enough. I need the delay to be as little as it is when, for example, switching windows within the same app+space i.e. instant.\nTo demonstrate the issue, open a few applications across a couple of spaces, then try to cmd-tab between a) apps on different spaces b) apps on the same space.

Failing that, can anyone familiar with macos programming weigh in on whether this is even possible or not, or whether its something imposed by the OS which there is no chance of changing at all (without hacking the os binary!)\nI'm running a MacBook Pro Retina Mid-2014, macOS 10.13.3, with 10 workspaces configured.\nMy preference would be for the animation to be totally eliminated for every switch-spacing mechanism. However, my main method is going to be using Ctrl+[1-0] to switch between 10 workspaces.\n\nA: I recommend the option System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion. \nThis causes the transition to become a simple fade, which is also much quicker than the screen pan especially when using ctrl+1, 2 etc shortcuts.\nI also use this option on iOS for similar reasons.\n\nThere's also TotalSpaces2 which apparently allows complete removal of the transition. I've not used it myself though.\n", "Q: I got my iPhone back from service with a sticker on \"WMI Fail\" or \"VMI Fail\". What is \"WMI\"/\"VMI\"? I just got my iPhone back from service with a sticker on \"WMI Fail\".\nWhat is \"WMI\"?\nGoogling doesn't return any sensible Apple related explanation, neither does asking @AppleSupport on Twitter (they didn't know).\n\nA: By coincidence I met someone who works with this and he told that WMI was an acronym for Warranty Mechanical Inspection. He was \"pretty\" sure about this although but not completely sure (first he misunderstood me and thought I said VMI which he explained as Visual Mechanical Inspection - I guess \"Mechanical Inspection\" for MI is a safe bet at least).\nIf someone could confirm/refute this it would be great.\n\nA: WMI is not a well-known acronym in this business (iPhones). There's no specific part in your iPhone which is known as the \"WMI\".\nFor all we know, WMI could be the initials of the guy repairing it at the service center - or it could be \"WIFI\" written in bad handwriting.\n\nA: I got a second answer now. It might be that I mixed up V and W (the sticker fell off more or less immediately after I got the phone back): VMI = Visual Mechanical Inspection.\n", "Q: How can I change a special app folder into an ordinary folder? Applications in MacOS are special app folders. I assume this is done by setting some special permissions. Its normally not possible to navigate into such special folder from within other applications: the open file dialog of the Finder does not allow it. \nI have one such folder with a very big file. The file is too big to copy outside its containing app folder. So ideally I want to 'transform' the app folder into a normal folder, so that I can access the contents from another (normal, GUI) application.\n\nA: Packages (‘app folders’) are displayed as packages only in Finder.

I recently purchased a pair of Lightning EarPods, and was a bit annoyed by their sound. They pan out the L and R channels a lot, and it sounds like someone has slapped a low and high EQ on the audio so that the mid is most pronounced. \nI'm concerned they are defect, because I feel the 3.5 mm EarPods that I also have sound much better, even when connected to the same phone with a 3.5 mm–to-Lightning adapter.\nAre the Lightning EarPods and the 3.5 mm EarPods supposed to sound identically or very close? If so, then the Lightning EarPods must be defect, because the 3.5 mm sound is what I recognize from having used them the past few years.\n\nA: I don't think they are supposed to be the same, the lightning ear pods are supposed to sound better than the 3.5 mm ones.\n\nA: After checking with a Apple Genius Bar, they found that my pair of Lightning EarPods were faulty and I received a new pair. The replacement pair of Lightning EarPods sounds the same as my 3.5 mm EarPods, or even slightly better.\n", "Q: Can iPhone USB Hotspot be shared through a MacBook Pro? My iPhone wireless hotspot quit working, but I can still use the internet through a USB connection. I’m wondering if I can use internet sharing on a MacBook Pro to share the USB internet connection from my phone. I attempted this and found the shared connection on my Apple TV. It connected but didn’t seem to provide internet to the Apple TV. I have another device I would like to use this shared connection with but I have to buy a WiFi adapter to test it. Prior to buying that, I thought someone here may be able to answer if this is even possible.\n\nA: This is possible using System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing.\nCell Network > iPhone > USB > MacBook Pro > Wi-Fi > other devices\nIn fact, you have to do it this way as the Wi-Fi on your MBP can either join or create a Wi-Fi network, it cannot do both at the same time.\nAlso, you should check usage terms of your mobile data provider to see if they allow sharing of personal hotspot in this way - some do not.\n", "Q: What are the blank files in my Home Folder of macOS? \n\n\nfile names: /build /el_capitan /optional /recommended /yosemite etc\nAll the files are created at the day I opened my mac for the first time (iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015))\n\nA: They look like zero byte files created by an error of some sort. A good culprit is a script that has a path variable that usually points somewhere else and doesn't catch that the parameter or variable is blank - so your home folder (the current working) directory gets spammed.\nI'd be slightly concerned since it's creating these wrong - what else is going wrong in that script? Deleting wrong files, or worse?\nI'd be interested to see what the detailed information is for them. You can get this information using Finder list view, or via Terminal with ls -la. Whilst you're in Terminal, you could also do file \"/mavericks\" and see what that comes back with - it identifies the file type by its contents.\nDid you buy your Mac brand new or previously used?\n\nA: Check the root directory on your hard drive (Go > Computer) to see if you have any more files like that floating around.\nIf those are the only ones, just delete them. They aren't doing anything and appear to be flotsam from the installation process.

I never draw any thing other than graphs, diagrams, etc.. like board works. I am not a painter. I bought an Adobe Ink for my iPad (not iPad pro). Tried to use in one of the Adobe softwares. It looks like that is very good to paint or sketch. But when I try to write some equation, often it jumbles up with subscript notations. It applies its intelligence to turn my x into n. iPad's own notes app works slightly better. Instead Microsoft Onenote works much better. But still even with onenote things don't work to my expectation. I thought I would be able to take notes straight away. But it is nothing close to that smoothness. If I write very slowly ike painting letters on the board then it somewhat works. Should I change my stylus for a better experience ? Are these styluses optimized only for painting ? What budget stylus is good for writing and taking notes ? Or if it is more or less same for all stylus then I would not bother buying another one.\n\nA: If you want something that is significantly better than the Adobe Ink, you'll need to go for an iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil. The combination of higher display refresh rates on the iPad Pro and the higher rate of stylus updates from the pen itself - it's really much, much better.\nI use the Apple Pencil to write mathematics and draw diagrams/graphs, and it works well for me. However YMMV so be sure to go to a local Apple vendor and try it out before buying.\n\nA: Apple Pencil is by far the best, best, best option for writing on a screen. It has extremely fast refresh rates, low lag and the friction between the tip and the glass is carefully engineered.\nIt detects “pressure” and speed and angle of incidence which is much better than almost any other option.\nApple Pencil makes bad apps better and good apps great in my experience. Microsoft, Apple and Astropad / Linea Sketch are the apps I return to time and time again with the pencil. There are dozens of other awesome apps out there, too.\n", "Q: Can I do CAD and rendering work on my Mac by Remote Desktop(ing) to a powerful windows machine? (wired connection) Ok so my monitor is an Ultrafine and doesn't have any sort of input for a PC. Also, it would be nice keeping the PC away from the desk. Also also, it would be nice doing productivity work on one computer (my Mac) and just hopping between MacOS and the Remote Desktop. The PC is a 7700k with a GTX 1080 ti. I am using it exclusively for Rhino 3D and VRay. How would the performance be if I were to headlessly connect to the PC via my Mac with -say- an ethernet connection? \n\nA: The performance of any Remote Desktop connection by the laws of physics and the need to encode the data is always slower than a native display.\nSo, no, the performance can’t be as good with a remote connection adding latency and delay.\nThat being said - practically, you are always going to be more productive than getting up and moving to another computer and you can get prodigious amounts of work done remotely across a continent let alone across the room. With a decent WiFi connection (say 802.11 ac and less than 10 radios connected to the AP and low interference / SNR above 10 dB ) or any 100 megabit wired/switched ethernet you will have a hard time measuring the delay or worrying about performance. Gigabit ethernet is even better.\nI wouldn’t worry about this performance loss in practice, you are likely going to be 100 to 10000x times slower than the CPU in all cases, not the remote connection.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s asking for old Apple ID but nowhere to type code My phone was disabled so I connected it with iTunes.

For most people that don’t have software issues where they max 85% CPU the touch bar models seem to last 30 to 90 minutes less when working casually. For high workload, either will drain the battery in 3-4 hours with the maxed out models getting 30 to 90 minutes less run time.\nThe 2018 hardware changes seem to be about the same as 2017 on paper, but we don’t have good real-world data and usage to tell.\n\nA: MacBook w/o touch bar runs on battery for about 45 min longer\n", "Q: Switching back to mac os from Ubuntu Problems A little while ago I switched my late 2015 Macbook Air to Ubuntu (not dual boot) because I needed a linux computer for work. I overwrote the existing os because it was taking up a massive amount of the storage space and i said \"I can always just use a bootable usb to switch back if i dont like Ubuntu\". This might have been stupid, but it made sense at the time. There have been issues with Ubuntu and I like it less in general, and no longer need it for work, so I am trying to switch back to mac os. I tried booting the computer in Internet Recovery mode by holding Command + R and selected the Reinstall OSX option and went through the steps until I got to the part where you select the disk to install it on. Normally I think there would be an option called Macintosh HD there, but it is currently empty, as you can see in the attached image.\nI also should mention that I have a bootable usb with High Sierra on it that I made with my other computer, and when I plug it in, and boot the computer while holding the option key and follow the necessary steps I get the same problem, where the hard drive is not visible, and only the bootable usb is shown. Is it possible that when I installed Ubuntu I overwrote the Macintosh HD? Is there any hope of getting back to mac os? Any help is appreciated.\n\nNote: My Mac has a single internal SSD.\n\n\n\nA: Yes, when you installed Ubuntu, you overwrote the partition named Macintosh HD. You will need to recreate this partition before installing macOS (OS X).\nYou can use the Disk Utility application to erase your drive. For name, use Macintosh HD. For the format, use either Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted).\nSometimes when the previous operating system was Linux, this can fail.

I liked it but I had to reinstall Chrome since the Safari clipboard is very limited.\nFor example in Google Chrome I can copy and paste easily pictures from Tumblr to Facebook, using shortcuts or looking for the option with the Magic Mouse. In Safari this does not work in any possible way, I tried \"cmd + v\" to paste an image I have copied before which I expect should work, but does not. Yes, in Safari I cannot paste any image!\nI have macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)\nDo I need to reinstall Chrome in order to be able to paste images in Facebook?\n\nA: This bug was fixed in Safari Technology Preview 51—basically early access to the next version of Safari—where you can paste images into Facebook there just like in Chrome. Hopefully that is enough to solve your problem! Video: https://youtu.be/ITyIWMyoyRk\nThough the feature was broken in some later Safari Technology Preview builds, it was fixed for the public release of Safari 11.1 included in macOS 10.13.4 which was released on 29th March 2018.\n—original answer—\nIf I do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right/context click on a Tumblr image \n\n*Choose \"Copy Image Address\"\n\n\nThen both browsers paste the image URL into Facebook. No problems.\nIf I do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right/context click on a Tumblr image \n\n*Choose \"Copy Image\"\n\n\nThen I get slightly different behaviour in browsers when pasting into Facebook. Chrome pastes the URL of the image, Safari posts the URL of the post/page containing the image. That's because Safari is much more thorough with what it copies to the clipboard in this instance, as it includes more alternate representations than Chrome. However both browsers still show an image in Facebook. No problems.\n\nAs an aside, you can inspect what is on the clipboard using Finder > Edit > Show Clipboard, which shows the default format. For a more in-depth look, use Apple's Clipboard Viewer which shows extended information about the different representations stored on the clipboard. \n\nSo I'm thinking that you are doing the Copy to clipboard in a different way?

Is there a way I can turn on my mobile hot-spot to connect my speaker to my phone without actually using data so I don't pay outrageous international data charges?  I currently have an iPhone 7.\n\nA: No. Your iPhone can only join or create a Wi-Fi network at any one time. It can't do both simultaneously.\nBut you can buy a small travel router to do what you want. Both your speaker and iPhone would connect to it. \n\nA: No there is no way.

So, recent versions of macOS no longer offer the option to Empty Trash Securely. From what I am reading here and here it seems the general consensus is that it is now best to encrypt files and then delete them.\nHowever, if I create an encrypted disk image and move the files in there, it is using different blocks on the drive... so it does not zero out the blocks on the drive where the data was stored, and we're back where we started.\nI've read comments from people saying deleted data is difficult to recover from an SSD anyway, so don't worry about it. Well even if that is true, what if you have a Fusion Drive and you don't even know which part of the drive the data in question resides in?\nI'm not finding a clear answer on what the best way is to securely delete at present, which is surprising since it's a pretty common measure when transferring ownership of a computer, etc. Can someone please enlighten me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is encrypting then deleting effectively the same as securely erasing?\n\n*How can existing data be encrypted (rather than copied into an encrypted .dmg)?\n\n\nA: To answer your question 1: You often see encryption mentioned when you speak of securely deleting the contents of a computer.\nThe reasoning behind this is that if you for example fully encrypt the disk drive on your computer (i.e. use the built-in File Vault encryption as an example) - then no one can access the contents of the drive without the password.\nIf you then encrypt the drive with a long, random password and immediately forget that password - then you have effectively deleted the data. If you don't know the password, and it is not written down anywhere - noone can access the data.\nThe caveats are ofcourse if your password is so bad that it can be guessed, or there's a bug in the encryption routines that makes it possible to recover data without the password.\nRemember that:\n(a) You must not store or remember the password anywhere\n(b) You must not add a password hint or anything that makes it possible to guess the password\n(c) You should throw away any recovery keys or similar, and make sure you're not storing a copy of passwords/recovery key on iCloud\n(d) The password should be sufficiently strong (i.e. long and random)\nTo answer your question 2: If you have already stored the data unencrypted, you're out of luck. Just copying them into an encrypted image or anything like that won't replace the data on disk. Instead you'll be making an encrypted copy of your data - there's no guarantee that the disk will really delete the non-encrypted data.\n", "Q: escaping space in shell script path I have tried both methods of escaping the space in the Path in the following script:\n#!/bin/bash -x\nPGHOME=\"/Applications/pgAdmin 4.app/Contents/SharedSupport\"\n$PGHOME/psql --username postgres -c \"drop database $1\"\n\nI've also tried changing line 2 to:\nPGHOME=/Applications/pgAdmin\\ 4.app/Contents/SharedSupport\n\nIn both cases I get the script error:\n\n./pg10-restoreDb.sh: line 3: /Applications/pgAdmin: No such file or directory\n\nFrom the shell, I can execute /Applications/pgAdmin\\ 4.app/Contents/SharedSupport/psql no problem\nWhat could be causing this error?\n\nA: You can either quote or escape the space when you define the variable, but then you must also double-quote it when you use it:\n#!/bin/bash -x\nPGHOME=\"/Applications/pgAdmin 4.app/Contents/SharedSupport\"\n\"$PGHOME/psql\" --username postgres -c \"drop database $1\"\n^            ^\n|            |\n\n", "Q: How to install endnote x8 into Microsoft word 2016/2017 I have installed endnote x8 onto my mac (macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.3).

For one, it seems to be an opaque tool and I have yet to locate any means of adjusting how it behaves or even learn what criteria make files appear there.\nOne thing I am sure of is that files which I have created in the last 24 hours (specifically, screen shots) do not appear there. These are not esoteric files like .plist files, but .jpg files that I have saved within my Google Drive folder. I have no idea why this file is being excluded from \"Recents\" but it does infer why screen videocaps created by Monosnap and saving them to some mysterious location with a mysterious name, which would seem to be a perfect opportunity for \"Recents\" to be useful except that it doesn't seem to work.\nIs there any way to adjust how \"Recents\" works or learn what the criteria are for files to appear there\n\nA: When Recents is active in a Finder window, go to the window's action (gear) pop-up menu, select \"Show Search Criteria\". The first criterion for Recents requires that the \"Last Opened\" metadata entry have a value – this is probably why your screen captures are not showing up (if you were to open them in Preview, then they would show up in Recents).\nYou can edit the search criteria in that window, or perhaps better, copy the search string and create a new smart folder with it, then tweak it until satisfactory.\n\nA: Found a solution on a different thread. Just delete this file and relaunch your finder. \n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nIt worked for me.\n(To find the file in the Finder Use the \"Go\" Menu item with your option key pressed, the go to Library -> Preferences.)\n", "Q: Create a table from other table depending on a value NUMBERS I have a table with a list of items, and I want to create a new table with all the values that contains a certain value.\nIn the first list, are all the profucts that I usually buy and a cell with \"YES or NO\" \nIn the second list I want to put only the items with a \"YES\" on the first table.\nSee image below.\nThanks for your time.\n \n\nA: I don't know how to remove empty rows from the second table, but I can make only the ones with YES show up.\n\nMaking it happen\nFirst, select the first cell of your second table (\"carrot\", the headers don't matter), and type this in it:\n=if(\nYou'll see it transform into a function. Then click the YES/NO column of the same row to add it to the table. Click on the dropdown in the new addition to the formula box, and check \"Preserve Column\".\n\nThis will allow you to copy and paste over the entire row without worrying about the referenced column changing. Add = \"YES\" to the end. You should now have something like this:\nIF(<Table 1::$B2> = \"YES\"\nNext, add a comma, and click the corresponding cell in your first table:\nIF(<Table 1::$B2> = \"YES\",<Table 1::A2>\nDo not preserve the column on this one. You want it to show the corresponding cell in the table. Add ,\"\"), like so:\nIF(<Table 1::$B2> = \"YES\",<Table 1::A2>,\"\")\nHit the big green checkmark, and copy and paste the cell to fill the second table (or just as many items as you want to show), and you're done!\n\nSo what does all this gobbledygook mean?\nThe IF command has three parts:\nIF(condition, if-true, if-false)\nIf the condition is true, it shows the if-true portion, otherwise it shows the if-false portion. So it shows the value of the other cell if the deciding cell is \"YES\", or blank (\"\") if not.\n", "Q: Spotlight Search by Full Path? When performing a Spotlight search, either through the Finder or via terminal commands, is it possible to filter results against the full-path of a file, or at least the name of it's parent folder?\nThe reason I need to be able to filter by the full path is that although I'm searching for actual files, I only want to return files that are found within folders matching a particular pattern.\nFor example, consider I have a bunch of files structured like so:\nJobs\n    Foo Poster\n        Preview.jpg\n        Final.psd\n    Bar Poster\n        Preview.png\n        Final.psd\n    Foo Banner\n        Preview.jpg\n        Final.psd\n\nThis is a bit of a contrived example for simplicity, but consider now that I want to find all the preview images found only within folders with \"Poster\" in the name.\nI could do this with find using something like:\n find /path/to/Jobs -ipath *poster/preview*\n\nHowever, what I'd really like is a way to do this using Spotlight, not only for speed but also for the additional search options available (labels, image sizes etc.).\nIs it possible to do this? I know I can restrict searches to a single folder, but this is no use as what I really need is to find folders matching a pattern, and then search within those for the actual files.\nI found the Document Container option in the Finder's search GUI, but this doesn't appear to work as I would expect; it sounds like it should let me match against a parent folder of a document, but this doesn't appear to be the case.\nAssuming this isn't possible with the Finder's GUI directly (i.e- requires a Spotlight terminal command), I would ideally like to be able to create a smart folder if possible.\n\nA: This is not possible with Spotlight alone. Spotlight does not index the file path as a property of the file. Thus it is not possible to use the path as search criterion.\nYou can use mdfind at the command line to search the Spotlight index. With the -onlyin parameter you can point it at the top of your folder hierarchy. You can the filter the returned results using grep.\nmdfind -onlyin ~/Downloads/ 'kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"public.image\"cd' | grep '.*/test.*/.*'\n\nIf you need help building the query for mdfind, have a look at HoudahSpot. There you can set up your search criteria. Then go to Window > Raw Query to find the Spotlight query string you can use with mdfind.\nWhile in HoudahSpot you can also use its ability to filter search results. Above the search results you will find a search field that allows for filter/exclude by name/path. Here you can use the asterisk as a wildcard.\nFull disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahSpot.\n", "Q: Macbook pro 13\" - 2017 - heating issues when connected to external monitor My question is about chassis temperature and overheating issues. I have a recently bought a Macbook pro 13\" - 2017 with two thunderbolt 3 ports. The notebook is performing fine, but when it is connected to the external Dell monitor (2560x1440 resolution), it gets uncomfortably hot. The same monitor was previously connected to a 2013 Macbook Air (i7) and there were no heating issue whatsoever (it would get hot only when doing extremely intesive CPU work).\nThe temperature on the left speaker is 40C (104F) and the temperature of the USB-C adapter's steel case is 45C (113F). The chassis around touchpad has 37C (99F). Measured with an IR thermometer. The room temperature is 26C (79F). The CPU usage is low (91% idle). The fan is near silent (iStats report that it is at 1950 RPMs.\n\nThe monitor is connected via USB-C - HDMI konverter.\nWhen monitor is connected, the current draw is apx 50% higher than what it is when monitor is not connected (regular browsing). This was not measured scientifically, but through iStat Menus current draw information.\nThe adapter gets uncomfortably hot very quick and so does the chassis of the Macbook pro. It is even worse if the Macbook is charging at the same time (using the other available USB-C port). I previously owned Macbooks and a Macbook Air and none of them exhibited such heating issues.\nI saw possible solutions on how to adjust the Energy Saver not to use the external graphics card, but it seems that this is not the case for this type of Macbooks -- at least, the settings are not present in the Energy Saver.\n\n\nThis is certainly unexpected from my side. Are such heating issues normal? Is there a way to limit GPU power usage or 'something'?\n\nA: I just saw many people had the same issue as my self and first i didn't understand why. Now i do.\nThe reason it gets so hot when hooked up to a monitor, even when you’re just running Word or Safari, is because the display outputs are hardwired to the dedicated GPU - if you’re using an external monitor, the dedicated GPU (graphic card) is in use regardless of how demanding the workload is. This puts more stress on the cooling system, resulting in higher-than-average temperatures ;)\nThats the reason. I tried all my 6 Macbook Pro's and all does the same behavior. Switching to the dedicated graphic card and you can't just use the integrated iris.\n\nA: With reference to Apple discussion:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB-C - HDMI converter I've been using was getting very hot. The heat was also transfering through the USB cable to the MacBook's body.\n\n*In addition to above, the Intel GPU is doing more work, so it is obviously getting warmer/hotter (you can see on the screenshot above, it is at 68 C).\n\n*In addition to that, the system controlled fan speed is too low (~1700 RPM) to allow for cooling when the skin temperature is rising over 40C.\n\n\nI noticed that I can tolerate ~40C just fine, but 42C is not good for prolonged (more than 30 min) use. It gets annoying fast over 41C.\nI replaced the mentioned USB-C to HDMI converter with a HooToo converter and that one is not getting as warm as the previous one. Also, the USB-C connector has much lower temperature than the previous one (so I guess heat transfer is not that much).\nThis didn't quite solve the heating issue, though.\nI used iStat Menus to change the speed of the fan, so it is cooling more. With the fan speed set at ~5000 RPM, the skin temperature is around 39-40C with light use of computer (MS Word, browser -- 90% idle). I was even able to charge the computer, have it connected to the external display and use it with skin temp under 40C with the fan at its maximum speed. \nIMHO, the cooling system of the MacBook Pro is not suited for \"Pro\" use --\n at least not in a comfortable way. I believe this could easily be adjusted with an OS/firmware upgrade, so that he OS would turn the fan speed up when reaching skin temperature of 40C. \nI will also give MacFanControl a try, to see if can automatically adjust the fan speed .\n\nA: Most MacBook Pros have dual-GPUs. The more powerful AMD GPUs are required to be active when an external screen is connected and they produce significant heat. There is no way to use the internal (Intel) GPU for external screens. \nTo reduce heat and fan noise, however, it is possible to deactivate Intel's Turbo Booster feature for the CPU. I use Turbo Boost Switcher, which helps a bit to reduce temperature. Volta is a similar App, but does not seem to work with all MacBooks. Naturally, this comes with an approximate 15% performance hit.\n\nA: i had same heating issue for more than 6 months till i tried this and then everything is just fine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase fan speed to constant 4500 RPM by downloading Mac fan control app\n\n*Use a elevated stand while using mac. Lower metal body should have enough air circulation. \n\n\nNow whether i use external display of dedicated GPU, everything just works fine without heating my Macbook pro.\n", "Q: Reinstalling mac fails So I replaced my broken HDD with a new SSD on my 2011 13\" Macbook Pro with 10.7.5 being the stock OS, and I want to install Mac OS X High Sierra 10.13.3 on it. Please note that direct update from 10.7.x to 10.13.x is not possible.\nFirst I went to recovery mode, installed Lion, downloaded El Capitan 10.11.6 via Mac Store and tried updating it but it failed. The log looks mostly clean, the only error I see is:\nfailed to update bookmark for item (null) [UUID]\n\nThen I tried to boot in recovery mode again and I saw that El Capitan's recovery took over, I erased the disk and went with Reinstall MacOS option, and everything went well, downloaded High Sierra 10.13.3 from Mac Store and decided I should do a clean install so I created a bootable USB with createinstallmedia command but the installation hangs when the progress bar reaches %100.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to see what the OS installation is doing? --I only\nsee an Apple logo with a progress bar below it, some said they see an ETA during installation but I don't see anything else than what was described.\n\n\nAt this point I had to redo all the steps all the way up to installing El Capitan, after I downloaded High Sierra again I opened the .app installation and High Sierra installed fine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why can't my Macbook Pro handle a clean installation of High Sierra?\n\n*It's been too much trial and error for me the past 3 days, and you could make things so much easier for me if you answer this as well, I tried to Restore using Disk Utility with InstallESD.dmg being the source and a USB stick the destination in order to create a bootable Mac OS installer, but the problem is, it's not bootable!

Or forbid it from charging from devices I know to be unreliable?\nSystem: MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) with 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 and 16 GB RAM\n\nA: Has this issue been resolved?  I have a couple ideas on this, perhaps not useful for the original poster but maybe for someone that sees this same behavior.\nFirst thing though is that this is very odd behavior.  Apple documentation shows that the MacBook should take power from the larger power supply regardless of which is plugged in first.  This behavior may show that there is some deeper hardware or software problem.  The need to track this down is subjective.  The need to get back to work is likely a priority and so resolving this is likely the highest concern for anyone in this position.\nThe quickest way to resolve this is to simply remove the power connection from one supply or the other.  This can mean just not connecting the 60 watt power supply and running off the 45 watt supply from the monitor.  The 60 watt supply was chosen for inclusion with the MacBook in order to allow for charging the battery even when under high CPU load.  Normal use is rarely going to need all this power, especially if you are using this MacBook while it sits on a desk for hours at time.  The best part about this solution is it costs nothing to implement.  The bad part is it does nothing to determine if there is a deeper issue causing this behavior, as well as does nothing to resolve it.  If this gets you back to work then that may be all that concerns you, and this may be all that needs to be done until the computer is retired.  Or, the display is retired.  Or, you are retired.\nBreaking the power connection from the monitor can be done with a different cable.  It sounds like the monitor is connected with a common USB-C to USB-C cable.  Presumably the monitor has a DisplayPort and/or mini-DisplayPort input to supply DisplayPort video in addition to the USB-C port.  An adapter cable from USB-C to DisplayPort will keep the DisplayPort video connection but break the power connection.  If there is only USB-C for DisplayPort input then a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter with a DisplayPort to USB-C cable will also break the power connection and keep the video connection.\nAnother option which might be attractive because it can solve other problems along with this odd behavior is to get a USB-C dock.  The dock will connect to the MacBook by a single USB-C port and split out the video, power, and USB.  This means the MacBook will only take power from your power brick, the video will be split out to a DisplayPort port, and then USB for mouse, keyboard, and whatever else.  The connection to the display can then be by a much less expensive DisplayPort cable, assuming it has a DisplayPort port in addition to the USB-C port.  If there is no DisplayPort input then a DisplayPort to USB-C cable should be able to connect the monitor and still break the power supply connection to the MacBook.\nTry running the MacBook on the display power, it costs nothing to try.  If that leaves you with the battery running low too often for your comfort then look into the other two options.  Which of the two works for you at the lowest cost will depend on the ports available on the display and what else needs to be connected to the computer.\nI found this problem interesting, I would like to know how it was resolved.\n", "Q: What does \"Service exited with abnormal code: 1\" mean? I'm looking to see if a LaunchDaemon script is running at its assigned time. Looking at that time in the Console produces this result:\n\"mac-hostname com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.user.delprofiles[48049]): Service exited with abnormal code:1\"\nThe script is meant to remove all user profiles save a select few every night. It appears as if it is working as there are no unwanted profiles on the HDD. Just not sure what \"abnormal code:1\" means.\nThanks\n\nA: When you run a program (such as your script that deletes user profiles) - it will leave behind an exit status code when done executing.\nThe exit status code is 0 when everything has gone according to plan. Anything other than 0 is an \"abnormal code\", usually indicating some kind of error or warning.\nThe exit status code 1 is just a \"generic error\" - it could mean anything. You'll have to look into the script you have to see which exit status codes it uses, and what the causes of them are.\n", "Q: Record screen iPhone during setup assistant Using the screen recording method of connecting my iOS device directly to a MacOS system and recording through quicktime - is it possible to record the setup assistant? Or is recording only capable once the phone is set up and booted into iOS.\n\nA: Looks like it's possible. After launching quicktime, choose File > New Movie Recording (I was thrown off at first because I kept choosing New Screen Recording). \nOnce I correctly chose new movie recording, I was able to capture right from the initial setup screen (where it's scrolling through 'hello' in different languages).\n", "Q: Fixing /etc/sudoers file I'm a systems admin for a company and was thrown into a horribly configured server. In the midst of my refactoring I was adding users to my /etc/sudoers file. I seem to have accidentally removed my server admin account from the sudoers file access.\nI know what I did wrong (i accidentally commented out the %admin line) question being, how can I reinstate my server admin access in the file without having to restart anything. \nHere's how it looks right now:\n##\n## User privilege specification\n##\nroot ALL=(ALL) ALL\n#%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%superuser ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\"user1\" ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\"user2\" ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nAlso note that my users do not have permission for sudo for some reason:\nRealtor-Station-3-27:~ user1$ sudo -i\n\nWARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss\nor the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your\ntyping when using sudo. Type \"man sudo\" for more information.\n\nTo proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort.\n\nPassword:\nuser1 is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\nRealtor-Station-3-27:~ user1$ \n\n\nA: Once you get things working again, you should make sure these lines exists at the bottom of your /etc/sudoers file:\n## Read drop-in files from /private/etc/sudoers.d\n## (the '#' here does not indicate a comment)\n#includedir /private/etc/sudoers.d\n\nThen make sure that you have a /etc/sudoers.d/ directory. This is how mine looks:\n> ls -ld /etc/sudoers.d\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root wheel 96 Jul 31 20:59 /etc/sudoers.d/\n\nNow you can effectively make changes to the sudoers file by adding a new file into the /etc/sudoers.d/ folder. For example, I named mine tjluoma so the file /etc/sudoers.d/tjluoma (note the lack of filename extension, which seems to be a requirement) has my modifications to sudoers but I don’t risk causing global problems to sudo if there is a syntax error.\nYou can verify that your personal sudoers file is being read by using sudo visudo -c which will list all of the files that sudo will use, as shown here:\n> sudo visudo -c\n/etc/sudoers: parsed OK\n/private/etc/sudoers.d/tjluoma: parsed OK\n\n(Note that /private/etc/sudoers.d/ and /etc/sudoers.d/ refer to the same folder.)\nOf course the best way to make changes to /etc/sudoers or your personal sudoers file is with sudo visudo or sudo visudo -f /private/etc/sudoers.d/tjluoma because it will check the syntax as part of the process of editing / saving, but we’ve all probably been guilty of not following that step \n\nA: I was unsuccessful in replacing the /etc/sudoers file with a fresh new file and changing its permission to root:wheel and 0440.\nFinally I had to go to Recovery Mode (restart → ⌘ CommandR)\n\n*\n\n*Mount Macintosh HD through Disk Utility\n\n*Go to Terminal through Utilities\n\n*cd /Macintosh HD/private/etc\n\n*Edit sudoers file to correct the mistakes.\n\n*Save and change permissions if needed. sudoers file needs root:wheel.  If its not, sudo won't be run. chown root:wheel sudoers\n\n*I had also changed the permissions with chmod 0440 sudoers since I initially removed sudoers and created a fresh copy when I was logged in.\n\n\nA: If you have access to finder and a system administrator account, you can fix this without a reboot by leveraging these.\nOpen up your finder and go to /etc. In here, you can view the details of the sudoers file, including permissions - screenshot below. \n\nChange the permissions for \"everyone\" here to Read & Write.\nAt this time, you can edit yourself back into the file with any text editor. You will have to return permissions for \"everyone\" back to No Access before sudo will allow you to perform a sudo.\n", "Q: When adding a partition, should I expect to lose data or not? I'm trying to understand what is meant by the wording of this Disk Utility cautionary message that appears when attempting to add a new partition to a disk.\nPartitioning this device will delete the data stored on some of the partitions, \nand cannot be undone.\n\nThis partition will be added:\n\n\"Secondary\"\n\nThis partition will be erased:\n\n\"Secondary\"\n\nThis partition will be resized:\n\n\"Primary\"\n\nFirst point of confusion: It's going to be added and then erased?\nSecond point of confusion: Disk Utility is supposed to be able to add, resize, and delete partitions without losing data. Sources: 1, 2 So why the ominous message, and who to believe?\nUpdate\nI added a new partition and everything appears to have gone smoothly.\nAn answer to another similar question helped me to understand and decide to move forward with partitioning.\nThis guide, How to Use macOS Sierra Disk Utility to Partition, Erase Drives was also helpful.\n\nA: Data should not be lost.\nJust as Solar Mike said, do a backup if you can.\nIt creates a second partition, but the second will be empty, without any file system, so it will be erased to format it into the file system you choose.\n\nA: No, most of the time it works just fine. Recently I wanted to partition my 2TB fusion drive into 4. But unfortunately \"Disk Utility\" was not responding and I had 500gb usable space and rest were gone! \nHad to format the drive and then made the partitions and re-installed macOS. \nAnything can happen anytime, ALWAYS back up your data first before adding a partition. \n\nA: For me, my first task would be the backup,\nThen I would do the partitioning task - if it goes right no issue you have an up to date backup...\nIf it goes wrong - you have an up to date backup.\nIf you don’t do a backup and it goes wrong - your advantage is you have a lot more free space on your drive...\n", "Q: Cannot access a folder in terminal even though read, write and execute permissions are set for everyone I have created a folder with user 'afayes' called tempfolder in directory '/Users/afayes' and have set permissions to be able to read, write and execute for all users:\ndrwx---rwx    2 afayes  staff          64  6 Mar 15:16 tempfolder\n\nI am trying to access the tempfolder with user called 'testuser'.

At that point the permissions will be drwxrwxrwx and all will be well.  \n", "Q: Is there any disadvantage of buying a refurbished iPhone 6s/7? I found some websites which sell \"Refurbished\" iPhone 6/6s/7 . Refurbished iPhones claim to work like \"new\". Is it really true? \nSome people told me that - the battery in refurbished iPhone is Not new. Is it true?\nMost of the websites give 60/90 days warranty for refurbished iPhones. Why don't they give 1 year warranty? Does it mean that refurbished iPhones don't last long because the phone was already used by someone else (which causes the phone to lose some of it's lifetime) ?\nIf there is NO disadvantage of a Refurbished iPhone (for eg: I will get 1 year warranty with Refurbished iPhone) , then what is the point of buying a Brand new iPhone spending extra money?\n\nA: It depends where you buy the iPhone. Generally it’s wrote when the battery is new.\nOn the Apple’s refurb, the batteries are new.\nFor the warranty, the websites offers 60/90 days because it’s not NEW iPhone, not because they’ll be decreasing shortly.\nAnd the websites would tells you the level of the iPhone, if it gets scratch on the back, missing wire.\n", "Q: Unexplained difference in photo count in iCloud, iPad storage, and Photo.app iCloud says I have just over 600 photos. On the iPad's storage it says there are just under 300.\nHowever when I go into Apple's Photos.app apparently I have 1800.\nI count 900 though. Why are these numbers different and where are the other 900?\n\nA: Check www.icloud.com and make sure that the 1800 amount is in the Photos section. If so then your iPad may have \"optimize storage\" turned on. \nIf the photos arent on there then you need check and see which devices you have and the full amount of photos on them all: Mac, iPhone, iPad & iPod.\nLastly if neither of these situations helped, then contact Apple Support and let them know that there is an inconsistency with whats on your iPad and your Mac vs the iCloud. They may refresh your iCloud account.\n\nA: On iOS - I like to get my count from Albums - All Photos - check for the total photos count and videos count at the bottom of the thumbnail list.\n(I'm at 20,306 Photos and 449 Videos)\nOn the iPad I have the same except I'm at 20,305 Photos.

Any hints?\n\nA: If you want the iTerm2 window to stay open and active for further use, you cannot use command with create window with default profile.\nYou need to use the write command in proper context, e.g.:\ntell application \"iTerm2\"\n    create window with default profile\n    tell current session of window 1 to write text \"echo hello\"\nend tell\n\nThe above example AppleScript code used with osascript:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"iTerm2\"' -e 'create window with default profile' -e 'tell current session of window 1 to write text \"echo hello\"' -e 'end tell'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace \"echo hello\" in the example AppleScript code with your command, e.g.: \"uwm\"\nNote: osascript can execute the example AppleScript code from a file using, e.g.:\nosascript /path/to/filename.applescript\n\n\nFrom the iTerm2 AppleScript Dictionary:\n\nwrite v : Send text as though it was typed.\n     write specifier : The session to send to\n             [contents of file file] : Filename to send the contents of\n             [text text] : Text to send\n             [newline boolean] : If newline should be added to end of text (default: yes)\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways accomplish a task.

Since I've installed Xcode under the previous version (Lion), and now it's broken?\nIt seems odd since I've installed Xcode Sierra version.\nUpdate:\nApparently the error is triggered every time I use some Xcode tool,\nfor instance accepting the license via cli triggers the exact same error.\nI have not already had access to the machine directly, but I'll try to reinstall all Xcode building tools.\n\nA: That is an odd error as the framework request in question is coming from an Apple app.\nIt seems your Xcode has been updated to a newer version and the licence agreement needs to be accepted. You can do this two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Xcode.app and follow the prompts\n\n*In Terminal: sudo xcodebuild -license\n(and with newer versions sudo xcodebuild -license accept to do it in one step)\n\n\nAfterwards confirm xcode-select --print-path returns a valid result.\nYou should then be good to go, assuming your combination of macOS version and Xcode version are compatible.\n\nA: I believe garbage collection is no longer supported.  You'll need to transition your code to use ARC or manual retain/release.\n", "Q: Looking for a way to run a command depending on OS version I'm trying to create a bash script that runs a command based on OS version that way I can deploy it to machines running 10.12 and 10.13 the only problem is depending on the version the command needs to be slightly different.  How can I go about this?\n\nA: You can get the OS version using sw_vers -productVersion.\n$ sw_vers -productVersion\n10.13.2\n\nYou can test on this in a shell script using\nif [[ $(sw_vers -productVersion) == 10.13.2 ]]; then …\n\nTo test any 10.12 or 10.13 version, you can use parse the output such as with this\nif [[ $(sw_vers -productVersion | sed \"s/10\\.\\([0-9][0-9]\\).*/\\1/\") == 13 ]]; then …\n\n", "Q: How do I use a Wacom Intuos 2 on OS X Sierra? I have a Wacom Intuos 2 and a 2009 MacBook running OS X Sierra (not High Sierra). Is there any way I can possibly get the tablet to work with my computer?\n\nA: From here, Is it possible to use old Wacom tablet on 10.11?\nDrivers (look down page): https://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers\nHow worked for me. Sierra 10.12.6 Intuos GD-0608-U. Clean installation driver 6.2.0w4 Go /Library/PreferencePanes, move to desktop WacomTablet.prefpane, open package (I use Pacifist on demo) and extract Info.plist, trash this WacomTablet.prefpane From driver 6.3.15-3, open installer package (Pacifist again) DO NOT INSTALL, open package, copy to desktop WacomTablet.prefpane, open package, change the Info.plist (with the one from 6.2.0w4). Close all. Put this prefpane in /Library/PreferencePanes. I set System Preferences.app to 32bit with info, before open Preferences, is working, close and set off 32bit. Summary: Is a 6.2.0w4 installation with a preferences panel from 6.3.15-3 which has inside an Info.plist from 6.2.0w4. This works so did not try any other version of the driver.\nNOTE: whats different for me, is that all information is about a newest driver with and oldest PrefPane, that did not worked for me. The last driver for Intuos (GD series) is 6.2.0w4 and did not work on osX 10.12.6, so use that oldest driver installation, but with a newest PrefPane from 6.3.15-3 with inside the info.plist from 6.2.0w4. And you get a full functional System Preferences Panel, don't need old preferences file.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra Notification Center auto closing or not opening at all I had a problem before about my icons not displaying correctly, and I followed Orlando Castro's answer in this discussion at Apple Forums.\n\nIn Menu > Go (press option) > Library > Preferences\n  Find and remove \"com.apple.dock.extra.plist\" and \"com.apple.dock.plist\" then restart.\n\nAfter doing so I had no issue at all, but yesterday night I wanted to switch off \"Night mode\" which is located in Notification Center and for my surprise it didn't open at first with the gesture (Swipe left with 2 fingers from the right edge of trackpad), to make things worse I found that clicking on the Notification Center icon at the top right corner didn't make the Notification Center to be shown so I kept clicking on it for many times until it finally popped but it auto closed before I could turn night shift off.\nHere's a video showing the issue: https://youtu.be/rU_Ph57dm8Y\nI restarted my Mac and I'm still having this issue.\nThese are my Mac specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (13\", 2016, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) (With Touch Bar)\n\n*Processor: 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*Memory: 8 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3\n\n*macOS High Sierra 10.13.2\n\n\nFrom the suggested questions while writing this question I found this other question: How do I re-enable Notification Center in Yosemite or El Capitan post-upgrade? which I thought could be the answer, but after running both commands:\n\nlaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist\nkillall NotificationCenter\n\n\nand restarting my Mac, the problem shown in the video above persists.\nAlso, in the suggested questions I found this other question: Can I speed up the auto-dismissal of Notification Center banners? because I thought it could be a problem related to the time it was too low, I switched it to 5 seconds, logged out and in after doing so, restarted my Mac and still no success.\nAs shown in the video, I can't get Notification Center to be shown while using gesture and sometimes I can do it while clicking Notification Center.\nHow to solve this issue?\n\nA: I was working with a chatbot with Dialogflow which wasn't responding correctly. Once I did 2 restarts and correct it, my notification bar is working again as expected.\n", "Q: How can I disable sound for incoming calls but NOT for notifications? I don't know why but a lot of spammers have my phone number and I'm getting called every day. I can't block their phone numbers because they use a new one every day. However, I use my phone with Slack and PagerDuty for work and I want to be able to hear notification sounds from those. How can I disable all sound for incoming calls (ideally, allowing certain known contacts to get through) while allowing certain apps as well?\n\nA: One way would be to get a silent ringtone and set it as the default, then set another ringtone with actual sound for the contacts you want to hear calling. There are plenty of silent ringtones available to buy in the iTunes Tones store, but it would also be a simple one to create yourself.\n", "Q: Mac ssh terminal set echo on after connection I have a custom ssh server implemented. Where I have not handled echo, ie once a user connects and logins successfully using client lets say Putty he will not be able to see the characters he is typing in putty window. \nIn order to see the characters user has to go to change settings Terminal >> turn the local echo force on. Once user does this, he will be able to see what ever he is typing. In putty we can do this at any point after connection.\nNow once I connect through Mac ssh client (Terminal) is it possible to change the settings like we have in putty after connecting to server?\nIts possible when I try to connect, at the very beginning I just have to give a echo command, but can we do it in between like we do in putty?\nAm a first time Mac user, generally work on Windows systems. Might be a very easy way, but have searched and dint find a way.\n\nA: The easiest transition is probably to just install Putty for Mac. This way you'll be using the program you're already used to with the local echo functionality you want.\nYou can install Putty for Mac from Homebrew. First install HomeBrew, then run:\nbrew install putty\n\nto install putty.\n", "Q: Safety of sharing my apple password on screen with apple technician I recently had a problem with my apple id on my ipad. I called apple tech support and was guided through some steps by the technician.She assured me everything was ok but during the process I had to enter my apple id password 5 or 6 times whilst I was screen sharing with her.She said the internet signal kept dropping and she could not see what was going on.So I entered my password which was working correctly and the verification codes 5 or 6 times.\nMy initial problem was to do with changing my apple id password and tech was very helpful. I am sure that I called the correct apple support and I got a follow up email from apple.Question is is this usual apple says very clearly not to share password with anyone.\n\nA: Did you give your password to the tech, or type it into a browser?\nIf you typed it into a browser and the dots appeared, the tech cannot know what the password is.\nIt can't hurt to change your password again if you are concerned about anyone knowing it.\n", "Q: Is there a way to unlock screen programmatically? I want to be able to unlock screen, or login to physical user while I'm connected with ssh connection. I know this might be unsafe etc. However that's ok for me at the moment. What options do I have to do this?\n\nA: The duplicate link I added has some really good Apple Script options.\n$ osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\"\n> keystroke \"verysecurepassword\"\n> key code 36\n> end tell'\n\n\nI might also suggest using LockScreen. It's a hidden application that comes preinstalled and is protected by System Integrity protection.

Our PC IT guy seems to screwed it up. Now I only have 1 TB of usable space. I tried formatting, repartitioning, but nothing works to gain that 1 TB back.\nI don't need the data in it as this is a new iMac.\n\n\n\nA: It seems that you have only one partition of 1 TB.\nWhat you need to do is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Fusion Drive\"\n\n*Click on \"Partition\" button\n\n*Set a partition of 2 TB\n\n\nI don't have my MacBook so I can't make you some screenshots, but setting new partition should show you your all disk.\nBut on your second screenshot, I can see that the Untitled part is 2.12 TB. Did you tried to proceed to the install of macOS and then see if everything is all good ?\n\nA: A similar thing happened to me recently. Follow what Chris said, if it works, that is fine! If not, make sure you have backed up all your necessary files into a separate storage. And try formatting the whole drive, you should be able to re-create the partitions and use full 2 TB and then re-install MacOS. \nThat's what worked for me. It gave me a headache. :/ \n", "Q: How to calculate used memory on Mac OS by command line? Below is a screenshot of Activity Monitor on mac os.

I noticed a difference when compiling a latex document within emacs, but I think this is really a mac question.\nWhen I open emacs via ⌘ - space and then type C-c C-c, instead of compiling with pdflatex, the minibuffer proposes 'Command[\\doc-view]', and if I enter 'pdflatex', the TeX-shell (within emacs) tells me 'pdflatex: command not found'.\nWhen I open emacs from a terminal window and type 'open -a emacs', it works fine.\nWhy is that?\n\nA: The problem you are having is a constant for Emacs. It's due to Emacs relying on a couple of things that are set in a bash shell that aren't available in the GUI.\nThe most notable of these is the PATH variable. That's why pdflatex isn't being found.\nCheck https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsApp for a better explanation and some things you can do to make it easier.\n", "Q: How to quit all Finder tabs I've configured OSX to force all Finder windows to open in tabs - because this really takes care of all the clutter.\nThe thing is, there's a shortcut to close all Finder windows, CMD+OPTION+W - and this will conveniently exit and quit all Finder windows completely.\nBut this does not work for a window with multiple tabs. I've searched Stackexchange and Apple Forums high and dry, and I cannot find a solution. I'd be interested in ANY WAY to achieve this, an AppleScript, a keyboard shortcut...EVEN a third-party app.\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: Command + Option + W will close ALL Tabs on Finder\n", "Q: Two Apple Developer Accounts, One App Backgrounder, we have two (2) Apple Developer Accounts, one account is being used by development team and another is for production deployment and distribution. I know that this is not the best practice, but have to do it (for the meantime) as to comply to internal company policies.\nMy question is can I submit the same app using two (2) different Apple Developer accounts? The first submission objective is to resolve any issues that might arise prior to production distribution.\n\nA: This question will likely only attract opinions; only Apple can answer your question with any authority. You should consider e-mailing or phoning Apple's developer team before embarking too far.\nNo Duplicate Apps Allowed\nNote that Apple will not accept duplicate applications in the store. You may be able to delete the developer app and re-submit to the production account. I suspect a new bundle identifier would still be needed. You would also be exposed to another review.\nTransfer Before Publishing\nKnowing that, have you considered submitting the application to completion using the development account and then transferring the application to your distribution account?\n\nCan I transfer my app to another account?\nYes. Use iTunes Connect to transfer qualifying apps to another account in case of an acquisition, asset purchase, or other similar situation. When you transfer an app, it will remain available on the App Store or Mac App Store, all ratings and reviews will carry over, and users will continue to have access to future updates. To learn more about transferring apps, sign in to iTunes Connect.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The submitted application can remain unpublished until after the transfer.\n\n*Using some iCloud features will prevent the application from transferring.\n\n", "Q: Apple Pay on Apple Online Store How can I use Apple Pay to purchase something online from the Apple Store? I have the normal purchase options with credit card etc. I assume that Apple must support their own payment system?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Yes, Apple does use its own payment system.\nUsing the Apple Store app, find the product you would like to purchase and add it to the shopping bag.\nWhen done tap on the shopping bag tab at the bottom. You'll see a list of the products you have selected. Press the big black button named \"Buy with (apple)Pay\" (the button contains a graphical version of the Apple logo where I wrote (apple)).\nNow you'll get a confirmation dialog and by confirming you can pay with Apple Pay.\n", "Q: Bluetooth dealing iOS I have got a BeoPlay 7 bluetooth headphone.

Setting the search engine from Safari's URL bar overrides whatever's set in Safari > Preferences > Search. My Safari had Google set from the URL bar, and whatever I set in Safari Preferences was immediately reverted to Google.\nTo reset the default search engine in Safari's URL bar, click on the magnifying glass icon, which appears at the left side of the URL bar when no page is displayed. A dropdown appears. Then select which engine you'd choose. Luckily, I was content with DDG, one of the only four choices presented.\n\nA: If you go to Safari > Preferences > Search there is a pop-up that lets you select the search engine from a pre-defined list.\nUnfortunately I have no idea how to change that pre-defined list (if that is what you need), perhaps it is somewhere inside the .app package(?)\n", "Q: Pages: Is it possible to change stylesets? In MS Word it is possible to change style-sets, so I can switch between making different documents.\nIs this option, or something similar, available in Pages?\nAs it is now, I have to start every document with the default style, and change every title, body etc.\n\n\nA: After some extensive searching, the only solution I have found to this problem is that you have to save styles with templates. It is not possible to save stylesets as you do in MS Word.\nThis means that you have to create a new document, set up the different text styles, and then save it as a template. The next time you create a new document in Pages, you will find your template under \"My templates\".\nI have sent a mail to the developers, and hopefully they will change this in the future. Sometimes you want to change styles after you have written the document, and this is not possible in Pages without a lot of copy-pasting.\n\n", "Q: Preventing a specific application from relaunching at startup? When I reboot my mac, I have the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" option checked, and for most applications it works fine. However, there's a few applications I use that behave very badly at startup when this option is used. (They reopen on the wrong desktop, throw tons of windows in wrong places, display error messages, things like that.)\nI'd like to stop those apps from relaunching at startup, but only those apps. I'd prefer to keep using the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" option so that all my other applications reopen in their previous state. Is there any way I can do that?\nedit: A few points of clarification:\n\n\n*\n\n*None of these apps are specified as login items.\n\n*Quitting the apps before rebooting doesn't actually seem to work. It may be the case that apps have to be closed for a sufficient length of time (and I don't know what that duration is) before they will no longer be relaunched at next login. I believe it's the same issue as reported here: How can I prevent applications from re-launching at startup?\n\nA: The best option would be to quit those specific applications before logging out.\nMake sure you are quitting the program completely, and not just closing the windows.\nEdit: As an alternative, you can disable Reopen Windows When Logging Back In and add the programs you would like to open to the Login Items.\n\nA: So you want to stop some certain softwares launching at startup automatically?

Sometimes I will see something that does not really belong in Launchpad—a readme, for instance—and I'd like to see it to move it. Sure, I can close Launchpad, open the Applications folder, and hunt for it there (perhaps in subfolders), but it seems to me that there ought to be an easier way. Is there? I can't seem to find one. Right-clicking, sadly, seems to do nothing.\nI'm not trying to delete items that are in Launchpad from my drive; I just want to see them in the Finder, so that I can move them around or perform other operations on them.\n\nA: The answer to the question is No, there's no way to reveal an item in the Finder from Launchpad.\nHowever, there is a relatively easy way to remove items from the Launchpad, which is what I really wanted to do, and it does not require moving the item out of the Applications folder: Launchpad Manager. It's an inexpensive utility that helps you manage your Launchpad, and, crucially, remove any items you'd like from it.\n\nA: There is an easier way.\nWhile in Launchpad press and hold the Optionkey, then select the \"x\" on the icon to remove it.  The icons will \"shake\" like they do on the iPhone.\n\nThere is a caveat; you can't delete apps that are either required by macOS or didn't come from the App Store.  In that case, you must go through the Applications folder.\nSee Use Launchpad on your Mac on Apple Support for more information.\n", "Q: How can I tell if a Wi-Fi hotspot is WPA or WPA2?

I assume that means \"try WPA2, and if that doesn't work, then try WPA\".  Is there any way to tell if it actually used WPA2?\n\nA: You can find this out by holding Option and clicking on the WiFi icon in the Menu bar.\nIt will open up a \"menu\" with additional options and details including the type of security you're using.\n\nIf you see your network say WPA/WPA2 Personal, it means it supports both. This is what the Access Point supports.  In my case, I disabled WPA (and thusly it doesn't show up).  You can choose either QR code and the client will be connected.\n", "Q: Remove multiple app badge icons with one script?

Additionally if System Preferences is already open, it is first closed before the rest of the code is processed. This is done for a couple of reasons, the first of which was already stated and secondly seeing the UI Events processed is a visual distraction and can be annoying.\nAlso note that the value of the delay commands may need to be adjusted for your system, and or additional delay commands may or may not be needed. Adjust values of and or add/remove the delay commands as appropriate.\n\n\nThis version acts on all applications in Notification Center in System Preferences.\nExample AppleScript code:\nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    quit application \"System Preferences\"\n    delay 1\nend if\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    set the current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.notifications\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell table 1 of scroll area 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n            repeat with i from 2 to (count rows)\n                select row i\n                delay 0.25 --   # Do not set any lower, increase if necessary!\n\n                --  # Use 0 with clickCheckBox() to check the check box.\n                --  # Use 1 with clickCheckBox() to uncheck the check box.\n\n                my clickCheckBox(1)\n\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\non clickCheckBox(i as integer)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell group 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n            --  # if the value of checkbox is 0, it's unchecked.\n            --  # if the value of checkbox is 1, it's checked.  \n            if value of checkbox \"Badge app icon\" is equal to i then\n                click checkbox \"Badge app icon\"\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend clickCheckBox\n\n\nFor a version that acts on just one specific application in Notification Center in System Preferences, see my answer to: Disable badge for specific app with a script\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any other error handling then what's shown and is meant only to show one of many ways accomplish a task. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate error handling as needed/wanted.  \n", "Q: How do I move a deleted App to my old iPhone? So, I got an iPhone 6s and an iPhone 5. I've got an app on my new iPhone which unfortunately got deleted from the App Store and it stopped working recently on my phone. I somehow hope that it is going to work on my old iPhone but I have not found a way to convert a deleted app to another iPhone. Is there any way to do it?\n\nA: Did it stop working on the new iPhone because of the iOS update? Then restoring the app from the backup is not a solution, as it might upgrade iOS as well (do you know for sure what OS it was when you backed up?). \nIf you are using the same Apple ID on your iPhone 5, you still can download and install the old app. Not really good idea sticking to the discontinued app, but still...  iMazing to my knowledge is the only software that can do it (disclaimer: I work for iMazing). Legit App Store downloads, and this functionality is 100% free at the moment. It should work if it was removed from sale by the developer. If it was Apple who removed it, most probably we won’t be able to help. \nAnyway, it’s quite straightforward, but I’ll post the steps just in case: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install iMazing & connect your iPhone with the needed app,   \n\n*Select your device on the menu, and click Manage apps,\n\n*Locate the app in the apps list & click the Download button\n\n*Sign in to your Apple ID to finish the download \n\n*Once the download is finished, exit the wizard, connect your old phone, select it in the sidebar and click Manage Apps again. \n\n*Select the app in question, and click Install - that’s it.\n", "Q: How do I get the calculator button on a Microsoft Sculpt keyboard working? I'm on a MacBook Pro using Microsoft's Ergonomic Sculpt Desktop (i.e. keyboard, mouse, and number pad). The Number Pad looks like this and as you can see has a Calculator button. Unfortunately, on Macos, it seems that Calculator button does nothing. I would have expected it to ideally have opened the Calculator app, but it does nothing.\nIncidentally, I happen to use a separate tool called \"Better Touch Tool\" (similar to Karabiner I think) to remap certain keystrokes, and I thought that perhaps I could use this tool to map whatever button press this Calculator button generates to a custom action that would open the Calculator app. However, BTT doesn't even detect a key press at all when I press the Calculator button. I don't see that Microsoft has made any drivers for Mac for this keyboard available so does that mean I'm stuck? \nDoes that mean this button is just totally unusable on Macs?\n\nA: If macOS isn't \"seeing\" the scan code then there's not much that can be done in mapping it - it's got to see it to map it.\nThere is a utility you can use that can verify if the keyboard is sending the code or not - xev.  You'll need to run it in XQuartz which is an X11 environment.\nUsing the following command, you can get the output of each keypress \nxev | grep -A2 --line-buffered '^KeyRelease' \\\n| sed -n '/keycode /s/^.*keycode \\([0-9]*\\).* (.*, \\(.*\\)).*$/\\1 \\2/p'\n\nBelow is some random keypresses on my wired Unix keyboard attached to my Mac.\n\nI've used this to test and map Sun Microsystems Type 5, 6, and 7 keyboards on my Mac and can verify that it detected the extra keys.  If xev can see it, it means that the scancode is being sent, it's just the HID kexts macOS uses are insufficient.  \nCan it be fixed?\nThat would be a software development question outside my and this site's scope.  \nBottom Line\nIf it's not being detectable at all, it's unusable.  If it is being detected, there's a chance of using it, but you'll need an application to see the keypress to utilize it.\n(You might want to try ControllerMate)\n\nA: I just bought myself a (fantastic) sculpt keyboard, and had the same question. Using Karabiner-Elements I came to the same conclusion as Allan above: the keycode just doesn't get received by the OS.\nHowever, I can launch the calculator by remapping the otherwise-useless 'pause' key on the main keyboard, and the numlock key on the number pad (in both cases these keys are immediately to the left of the calculator key).\nFirst, using Karabiner-Elements, remap the keys you want to use (e.g. 'pause') to an unused function key that your mac can recognise F13-19 (e.g. F19). The screenshot below shows my Karabiner-Elements configuration; the last 2 entries are relevant ones here.\n\nSecondly, launch Automator and configure a 'launch application' service as per the instructions here, and follow the instructions to map the service as a keyboard shortcut (System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts).\n\nIn my case, I duplicated the Automator service (automator -> file -> duplicate) so that I could have two different keyboard shortcuts.\n\nIt works perfectly to launch the calculator.\n\nA: It's been 9 months since Cobberboy posted a solution. It worked nearly perfect for me in 10.14.3 Mojave, but it only worked when the window focus was on Finder. To fix this, add an \"App Shortcut\" in the Keyboard Shortcuts menu (look at cobberboy's last photo on the left hand menu) and add a shortcut for all applications.\n\n\nA: I have a Ducky-brand keyboard with a “calc” button, and I was having the same problem. I found that the shareware app “USB Overdrive” can remap it to launch a calculator or do any other action. It also explains why the other keyboard mappers don’t get the keypress - USB Overdrive registers it as a mouse click event, but apparently whatever mouse click number that is, it’s common enough that the app already knew it was named “calculator”.\n\nA: Building on what @jes5199 discovered I also installed 'USB Overdrive'. It's essentially a rebinder for non-keyboard devices, e.g. mice. Installation requires a reboot, after which it appears as a system preferences panel. Pressing the calculator button revealed the preconfigured setting, and once I closed the panel it worked without any additional setup.  \nI couldn't get Karabiner EventViewer to recognize either a keypress or mouseclick for the calculator button. Tested before and after installing USB Overdrive. Overdrive did manage to remap it to system Calculator without fuss, so I'm happy.\n\nA: This will remap the calculator key to the space character:\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[\n    {\n        \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\": 0xC00000192,\n        \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\": 0x70000002C\n    }\n]}'\n\nCan confirm it works on macOS Big Sur 11.2.2, with calculator keys of both the Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard For Business (5KV-00001) and its separate number pad.\n\nRepurposing “menu” button on Windows keyboards used in OS X\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/398797\nUSB HID to PS/2 Scan Code Translation Table\nhttps://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/1/161ba512-40e2-4cc9-843a-923143f3456c/translate.pdf\n\nA: You can also use Keyboard Maestro with a \"USB Device Key\" trigger (a normal Hot Key trigger is not enough):\n\nIt's paid software, but to me it was worth every penny because it does a lot more than this.\n", "Q: How do I disable \"link preview\" in iOS safari? I reluctantly updated my iPhone and discovered that now when you press and hold on a link in Safari it makes a pop-up window with a preview of the link come up. \nWhat is really awful about this is you only need to tap it for a split second for it to start rendering a preview, so very often (maybe 50% of the time) when I'm simply trying to click a link, I have to try several times to press it FASTER in order to get to the page I'm trying to go to without rendering the preview I never wanted.\nIn addition, this now prevents you from easily copying and pasting links found in your browser, because when you try to select link text, it keeps interrupting with the pop-up.\nRather than negative the way I tap, is there way to disable this feature?\n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > 3D Touch and either turn off 3D Touch (this disables the link previews entirely) or adjust the sensitivity to require a harder press so you don’t unintentionally trigger it.\nThe feature is activated by how hard you press, not how long you press and hold. Even with it turned on, you can still press and hold lightly to select text and get the normal menu with copy and other options.\n\nA: To increase the time it takes to activate a long-press under iOS 14, go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Touch -> Haptic Touch and change it from Fast to Slow.\n\nA: I think the other answer is outdated. Link preview is the default action on long-press now (not just 3d touch), and not just in Safari. \nTo disable it, long-press a link and tap the \"Hide preview\" option.

I can still make a receive a call by pressing the button on the steering wheel but the call is now NOT heard thru the car speaker. I can make it use the car speaker by pressing on the round \"audio\" icon that appears on the iPhone screen and the pressing \"my vehicle\" on the next box that appears. However, having to hit these two buttons on the phone while is too dangerous while driving.\nI have turned bluetooth off and back on. I have re-paired the iphone to the car. I even installed the latest Apple 11.2.6 software upgrade, all to no avail. So for now I can use the steering wheel button to make/receive calls but only hear the call thru the speaker in the iPhone, not the car. For years the bluetooth worked correctly, automatically connecting to the car upon entering the car and all calls came thru the radio speakers. This bluetooth auto-connect stopped working about a week ago. Apple support on the phone twice could not solve the problem. \nHas anyone had this same problem and fixed it. It is driving me nuts as I have tried everything I know of and have read about on google. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Try making a call using the iPhone while in your car and making sure it has the Chevy MyLink selected.\nThis happened to me a while back and it was very annoying (iPhone 6s and 2015 Chevy). Some how my default was changed from using the car speakers to using speaker phone. \n", "Q: iPad repeatedly asks for WiFi password although unchanged Sometimes our Internet service (terrestrial wireless funneled through our router to all devices in our house) temporarily stops working, but comes back up within minutes. During and after the outage our Windows and Android devices never report a problem with the WiFi password, just network issues, and never require the password to be re-entered to re-establish connectivity.\nOn the other hand, our iPad Air 2 (Version 11.2.6 (15D100) Model MH182LL/A) frequently requires the user to re-enter the WiFi password, on some occasions many times. This despite the fact that the Internet interruption has nothing to do with the WiFi password. Once I \"Reset Network Settings\" on the iPad, and naturally I expected to have to enter the WiFi password once more, but as before I must enter it again and again.\nThe router is an ASUS RT-N66R and I have changed little of its defaults other than of course the password, but I changed the password shortly after buying the router and haven't changed it since.\nHow can we avoid having to re-enter the WiFi password on the iPad every time there is some kind of Internet interruption?\n\nA: To those who experience Apple products 'forgetting' (temporarily or indefinitely) a WIFI password, this is AN APPLE FAILURE - not yours.\nEqually failing are the responses you'll get to 'reset network settings' that will delete ALL of your saved WIFI passwords. This is a totally unacceptable response and should be avoided. Same goes for completely restoring an Apple device to resolve some mundane issue that renders your Apple product less than useful and lacks a true 'fix' from Apple.\nNo other product line outside Apple has this chronic problem that has made it through every generation of OS and iOS.\nSince the issue has never been resolved for the end user, one can only surmise Apple has good reason to inconvenience users with this.\nNot amused.\nSolution: other than resetting network settings and losing all logins... one can (usually) find success by turning off WIFI and waiting some time before allowing your device to re-login. Or, one can reset (turn off and on again) all devices (including modem/router/etc) EXCEPT network settings on the Apple device and that should clear the problem. It is an inconvenience, but it should work.\nAnd for the few that will be forced to reset network settings, and lose everything, I'm surprised you haven't sued Apple for the loss of business - if taking a chance using an Apple product for your business.\n\nA: Your iPad may be set to only join your WiFi network manually. You can check on this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to the WiFi network in question.\n\n*Launch the Settings app.\n\n*Tap Wi-Fi.\n\n*Tap the Info button next to the WiFi network name. (It looks like a lower-case 'i' in a circle.)\n\n*Ensure that the Auto-Join switch is on.\n\n*If Auto-Join is off, turn it on. \n\n\nA: Please be careful when re-entering your password. When you see the same SSID (Network name) and your device is asking you to enter a password, it is possibly an \"evil twin attack\"\nApple isn't just dropping the ball here. They are training their users to take a dangerous step just to maintain a wifi connection that has worked for years, password still securely in the iCloud keychain.\nIf you have any tools available to do a \"wifi survey\" (Tomato or other powerful router, iStumbler, etc) My advice would be to use that tool First to make sure someone is not tricking you into joining their wifi attack router they set up in order to steal your wifi password.  You may also use one of the more reliable android or windows or linux devices on the network to check for a duplicate SSID before typing the password.\nThere is another feature apple implemented that can cause problems joining the wifi network: \"Private Address\". This will break your connection on any router that only allows \"known devices\" listed by mac address to join. I noticed Apple turning this on by default. Ironically, this not only breaks connections to those routers, but it breaks their own AppleTV remote feature. When pairing an IOS device to Apple TV, it seems to remember the phone by its current Mac Address. If you find your iphone AppleTV remote stops working and you frequently need to re-pair it, this feature is likely the culprit. To fix that, simply go click on the \"i\" (information) for your remembered home network and uncheck \"private address\". At least for us, this re-enabled the appleTV remote to start working again.\n", "Q: I want to FaceTime, but can only WhatsApp I've installed WhatsApp on my phone, and now I only have the option to make WhatsApp video calls - not FaceTime.\nSadly, they almost never work (for some reason??). When I use my partner's phone, FaceTime always works.\nHow do I make a FaceTime video Call rather than WhatsApp?\n\n\nA: Press and hold the buttons that are currently labeled as WhatsApp and it should give you a choice on which App you call from for this contact.\nIt should remember your choice after selecting.\n\nA: You could have someone make a facetime call to you to be sure your account is set up properly. If it is, you might need to remove WhatsApp and then verify you can make an outbound facetime call to the person in question.\nWhen that’s all sorted, reinstall What’s App and be sure you check the preferences and settings when it asks to be integrated in the calling experience.\nThis likely is a fault in the registration for FaceTime on your or your friend’s contact details since both apps should co-exist and let you long press to choose which to use on any given contact by design.\n\nA: You have to unlink your account for google and just leave the iCloud account open  it work this way for me \n", "Q: Installed Windows on Mac, now want to go back to OS X I tried to revert back to OS X, but I can't boot into recovery, or USB.

Is this a normal behaviour or should it wake up immediately?\n\nA: For the most part this is normal, unless it's happening even when it's only been asleep for a few minutes. There are actually two different sleep modes, basic standby and hibernate. If it's been asleep for a long time, the computer will power down more than usual (it's already written everything in RAM to the disk), and in order to get out of that mode it has to read from disk back into RAM.

The linux \"rc\" system is not present in macOS. \nI've searched and searched for a solution, and this is the only one I've been able to find. It launches at boot with launchd, and both the startup and shutdown functions run when they should:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction startup()\n    {\n    ## commands to create and fill ram disk\n\n    tail -f /dev/null &\n    wait $!\n    }\n\nfunction shutdown()\n    {\n    ## commands to backup contents of ramdisk\n\n    exit 0\n    }\n\ntrap shutdown SIGTERM\n\nstartup;\n\nAs I said, both the startup() and the shutdown() functions run when expected. The problem lies within the commands of the shutdown function. It's a pretty simple script, it just copies the contents of the ram disk to a folder on the hard drive:\nfunction backup_ramdisk()\n    {\n    ## empty ram disk backup folder\n    rm -R -f /webfolder-backup/*\n\n    ## copy contents of the ramdisk to the ramdisk backup\n    cp -R /Volumes/webfolder/ /webfolder-backup/\n\n    ## make me the owner\n    chown -R me /webfolder-backup/\n    chmod -R 777 /webfolder-backup/ \n\n    exit 0\n    }\n\nThe actual script is loaded with extras that log stuff, and I can confirm that the entire script does run. But what happens is the cp line fails. Sometimes it fails completely, and the backup folder is empty. But more often, it gets part of the structure of the RAM disk, and stops copying files right around (but not exactly) the same spot.\nOften times it will throw the error cp: /Volumes/webfolder/: No such file or directory even though it has already copied a hundred items from that folder. It makes me think that the shutdown command is unmounting the RAM disk before my script has time to finish backing it up. Keep in mind, because it's a RAM disk, it only takes a couple of seconds to copy all the files off of it. But it seems that's not enough. If there were a way I could pause the shutdown process while my script is running, then proceed, that would be ideal! Or maybe a better approach to this entirely? \n\nA: Regarding your comparison with Linux: Mac OS X did indeed have the \"rc\" system, you know from Linux (it is really called a SysV init system). Back in 2005 this system was abandoned with OS X Lion, and the more modern launchd system was introduced instead - leading to, amongst other things, much faster boots.\nOn Linux the same change has happened, however later than on macOS. Nowadays Linux distributions commonly use systemd, upstart or similar \"modern\" take on an init system.\nRegarding your solution - it is really a hack, and it not done the right way. This is why you're having issues. You're trapping both SIGTERM and SIGKILL - this is against recommendations, and it is the cause of the \"No such file or directory\" error message.\nBasically what happens on shutdown (this is completely similar to Linux) is that each process is sent SIGTERM to let it know that it should terminate. The process then only has a very short time to close (i.e. within few seconds) - otherwise the system sends the SIGKILL signal to really kill off the process if it is not responding.\nIn your case when the copying takes a bit too long, you'll trap both signals and you will run your shutdown() function twice.\nYou haven't included your launchd configuration (i.e. probably a daemon plist), but you need to be careful to have dependencies and orders configured here in order for your hack to work. Otherwise you risk the RAM disk being unmounted before shutdown is called (which is probably what happens when you run shutdown the second time due to the SIGKILL signal.\nAs far as I remember the /etc/rc.shutdown.local file is still a valid method to run programs at shutdown. This is by far the easiest way of doing it.\nSimply create the /etc/rc.shutdown.local file and make it executable. It should start with a shebang like your current script, but only needs to contain the commands you use to copy over the files to your backup.\nIf you want to do it properly with launchd you could either modify your hack to handle signals properly, and then use the xpc_transaction_begin/end functions to let the system know that your program is doing useful work, and shutdown should be delayed until finished -- or alternatively use the event trigger functionality in launchd.\nI would recommend you to try /etc/rc.shutdown.local first. It is deprecated, but as far as I remember still working.\nA small warning is probably also a good idea for you. Remember that you are never guaranteed that your shutdown program will run. It is therefore not a good idea to keep stuff you don't want to loose in a RAM-disk like that. A single power outage and your data is lost. Instead use frequent data synchronisations or similar to ensure that data is periodically backed up to permanent storage.\nRegarding your request whether a better approach exists - then the answer is \"most likely, yes\". The idea of copying a web folder to RAM disks seems a bit historic and dated. We have not information about what you're doing with that web folder, but if you're just serving web sites and want it to be fast by using a RAM-disk - that is the wrong approach. It is much better to use the built-in vfs caching functionality of macOS (similar to any other modern operating system, such as Linux).\n", "Q: Cursor size adjustment I have a mid 2010 Mac Pro and I would like to have a larger Pointer on my cursor so that I can find it easier.

(Except for a documented feature of sound control access from keyboard not working.)\nBut for some reason the wifi is being VERY spotty. I've had the monitor for 2 weeks now and I can't find an obvious pattern, except that it looses connection with the wifi on an irregular basis, while at the same time I have an older MacMini 2014 (El Capitain) on the same wifi, that does NOT drop the connection. Sometimes when rebooting it picks up the wifi, sometimes not even after reboot. Unplugging the monitor seem to make the wifi came back every time though.\nWhy would an external monitor interject with wifi?\nThis seem like a hardware problem, so I'm more or less forced to accept the situation, but hoping that there might be a checkbox somewhere I need to set to fix it?\n\nA: External monitors can emit signals that interfere with WiFi signals. This is commonly due to insufficient shielding within the monitor. I would complain to ViewSonic - they might know about a design deficiency for this particular monitor, and have a solution or rebate at hand.\nIn order to try and fix this yourself, the most common way to solve this is simply to move your WiFi to a different set of frequencies, and hope that the monitor is not producing interference with that set of frequencies. It is usually hard for home users to shield the monitor properly without it being an ugly hack.\nIn essence you would need to access the settings on your WiFi access point and move it to a different channel. For example if you're using channel 11 now, try using channel 6 instead. You might need a few tries to find a sweet spot.\nYou can also switch from 2.4 Ghz WiFi to 5 Ghz WiFi if you have that available.\n", "Q: How long do iTunes credit refunds take?

Any info needed, I'll be happy to provide.\nBelow is the results of disktil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n    #:                       TYPE NAME           SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                500.3 GB   disk0\n    1:                        EFI EFI            314.6 MB   disk0s1   \n    2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1  423.0 GB   disk0s2\n    3:                  Apple_HFS XPlatform      15.9 GB    disk0s3\n    4:                 Apple_Boot                134.2 MB   disk0s4\n    5:       Apple_KernelCoreDump                655.4 MB   disk0s5\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n    #:                       TYPE NAME       SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:      APFS Container Scheme -         +423.0 GB   disk1                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n    1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD  319.3 GB   disk1s1\n    2:                APFS Volume Preboot    22.4 MB    disk1s2\n    3:               APFS Volume Recovery    509.8 MB   disk1s3\n    4:          APFS Volume VM               1.1 GB     disk1s4\n\n /dev/disk2 (disk image):\n    #:                       TYPE NAME        SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:                CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US... +4.7 GB     disk2\n\nAs you can see, I'm missing about 60 gb, which is the amount of space I was attempting to free up.\nEDIT:\nResults for the fdisk /dev/disk0 command:\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 7602/255/63 [122138133 sectors]\nSector size: 4096 bytes       \nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  122138132] <Unknown ID>\n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused\n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused\n\nResults for the gpt -r show /dev/disk0 command:\n    start       size  index  contents\n        0          1         PMBR\n        1          1         Pri GPT header\n        2          4         Pri GPT table\n        6      76800      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n    76806  103270257      2  GPT part - 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n103347063    3873482      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n107220545      32768      4  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n107253313    2441407 \n109694720     160000      5  GPT part - 5361644D-6163-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC \n109854720   12283408           \n122138128          4         Sec GPT table\n122138132          1         Sec GPT header\n\nEDIT 2: Ran the commands from macOS Recovery and the results were a bit different, so I thought I'd share that as well.\n-bash-3.2# csrutil disable\nSuccessfully disabled System Integrity Protection.

Am now looking to have one drive with the full 500gb available and then go from there to establishing a bootcamp partition and then an additional exFat partition that can be shared between the two OS! \nEDIT 7: All issues have been resolved!\n\nA: The folks at Apple seem to be operating under a paradigm where no drive space is ever unallocated. Therefore, when System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled, the macOS operating system prevents execution of any utilities or commands which could report the location of lost space on system drives. Your Mac uses a single \nphysical system drive named /dev/disk0.\nSystem drives generally contains two types of partition tables. The first is the Master Boot Record (MBR) table and the second is the GUID Partition Table (GPT). The command fdisk dumps the contents of the MBR table, while the command gpt partially dumps the contents of the GPT. To used these command on a system drive, you need to either disable SIP or execute the commands while booted to macOS Recovery. The commands you need to enter are given below\nfdisk  /dev/disk0\ngpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\n\nThe gpt commands prints a table of the space occupied by each partition. The table also prints unallocated space.  Generally, you need to know which partitions are located before the lost (unallocated) space you wish to recover. Usually, the diskutil command can then used to recovery this space. Although, other commands such as fdisk, gpt and gdisk can also be used.\n\nNote: Generally the identifier produced by disktuil output contains the index for a given partition. This is not alway true. You may need to consider other output from both the diskutil and gpt commands before matching a partition index with an identifier.\n\nIf you could post the output from the above commands, then someone (or I) could help with the correct commands to repair your Mac.\nUpdate 1\nYou can erase the Apple_KernelCoreDump` partition by executing the command given below. The result will a block of free space the the end of your drive. The size of this block will be about 61 GB.\nsudo  diskutil  erasevolume  free  n  disk0s5\n\nBeyond this change, I am not sure what to post. I need to know how you want the drive partitioned. So far, you have mentioned partitions for ExFat and Windows. Currently you have Apple_HFS and Apple_Boot partitions. You can not merge the free space back to the APFS container until these partitions are erased. Also, if you are going to reinstall Windows, you probably should state the model/year of your Mac and the version of Windows.\nUpdate 2\nThe following command will return all free space back to the APFS partition.\nsudo  diskutil  erasevolume  free  n  disk0s3\nsudo  diskutil  apfs  resizecontainer  disk0s2  0\n\nIf the above commands work, are you then going to attempt to install Windows 10 through the use of the Boot Camp Assistant? Other users have reported problems using the Boot Camp Assistant when the internal physical drive has an APFS partition.\n", "Q: How do I type piecewise functions in pages?

I have 2TB of iCloud storage, with Family Shared Storage turned on and several accounts in use by various family members. I would like to maintain a local copy of this 2TB, and I have a spare Mac to use for the job. \nMy issue is that, as far as I understand, macOS will only sync iCloud (files and Photo Library etc) for the currently logged-on user.  \nHow do I set it up to automatically log into and sync files & photos from all of our iCloud accounts (e.g. every night)?  I don’t want to have to manually rotate through changing users every time.\nFYI I am comfortable with using Terminal, but not an expert Terminal user.\n\nA: You could try enabling Fast User Switching, then logging in to all of your family’s accounts. Fast-switching between users keeps the previous user logged in, so processes running on that account should keep running in the background (albeit with a lower priority).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Options.\n\n\n*Click the Padlock to unlock Administrator-only options.\n\n*Finally enable Show fast user switching menu as (Icon or Name doesn’t matter).\n\n\n*Now click the new option that should have appeared on the right side of your macOS menu bar, and login to another user account.\n\n\n*This should be sufficient since cloudd and photolibraryd will start automatically to sync your files and photos.

This issue didn't appear until after iOS 11, but has been going on ever since then despite several updates since then.\nThis issue first appeared on my iPhone 7 after the iOS 11 updates.  Now I've just upgraded to an iPhone 8 Plus and it is having the same issues straight out of the box.\nThis is a problem across the phone itself, but for some reason is more noticeable in some situations than others.\nFor example; this issue occurs with Apple's \"Music\" app, but the volume change isn't as drastic as with the \"Amazon Music\" app.\nWhen plugged in with a pair of lightning headphones this issue doesn't happen, but when using bluetooth or carplay  (even using usb/lightning adapter) it constantly drops in and out.\n\nA: Are you receiving texts, notification, etc when the volume drops? Most bluetooth interfaces will dim the volume when a notification arrives, even if the notification sound is set very low. Check your notification setting on the bluetooth device by adjusting the volume without any music playing. \nTry using your phone in silent mode and see if the problem goes away.\n\nA: My 7+ has the same issue, and what I have tried is to turn off all notification sounds, so the banner will still pop up, but with no sound to interfere with the Bluetooth volume. I believe this issue came about because later phone versions allow different sound volume settings for different functions, and the nannies at Apple don't want you to accidentally blowout your ear drum from the headset going full blast when you get a text or something, because you could sue them for that. \n", "Q: Xcode adds comment characters in the first column?

But this was not helpful.\nCan anyone tell me where to get the hash?\nI am working with OS X High Sierra 10.13.3 and the drive is a WD Elements external drive.\nthanks in advance \nSebastian\n\nA: The disk encryption employed by Disk Utility does not store your password as a hash. Thus is there no hash to get, and John the Ripper is not the right program for brute forcing this type of encryption.\nFor File Vault encrypted disks, you could look at a program such as VileFault to try brute forcing the passphrase.\n\nA: I realize that this was four years ago but I am working on a project that would help if you still need it, or just to share what I've found. I have a drive that I forgot the password to but remembered generally what it was, so I could make a file with a few thousand possibilities using a python script. After that you can use bash and the built in disk manager, disk utility, on in terminal diskutil and write a script that tries all the passcodes from your file.

I wanted to do it in conditional formatting to not to add more columns to the table. Is it possible in Apple Numbers?\n\nA: After research and trial & error sessions, I understood that using formulation in conditional formatting rules is impossible in Numbers. One can only use simple comparisons for formatting. Preparation of values for comparison is needed to be done on the table.\n\nA: I had the same issue with Numbers 5.0. I wanted to highlight a cell if it wasn't a consecutive number based on the cell above, eg. to highlight a gap. I found that I had to add a column with the formula eg $B1 = $A1 + 1, then highlight column A and add the condition rule for $A2 not equal $B1 then highlight. \nThis then set the rule for all cells in col A, and adjusted the target of the comparison.

I am using macOS Server to host files on a website. I often need to download large files to the server to host them myself.  Because I do not usually have physical access to the server, I use the default Screen Sharing app In macOS from a different mac into the server (VNC). From there I open Safari (on the server) enter the url and start the download. The files range from 400MB to 2GB. They are downloaded to an external drive that is constantly plugged into the Mac.  Once the download starts it can take a while to complete so I often disconnect through the screen sharing. Unfortunately, a minute or two after I disconnect the download stops. When I check what happened by clicking on the download arrow in Safari it says that the download timed out. If I try to continue the download, it continues only to be stopped again when I quit the screen sharing.

I don’t think it’s a charger problem since I plugged into my iPhone SE and there’s no problem. When I plugged into my iPad, it keeps switching between charging and not charging rapidly.\nVideo: https://imgur.com/a/Z6Nnv\nSimilar to this situation: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6300997\n\nA: iPad Air 2 and iPhone SE have different power adapter (head charger unit). iPad Air 2 needs 10W adapter, while iPhone SE needs 5W adapter.\nIn my experience, I can use 10W adapter for charging my iPhone 6 (which using same adapter with iPhone SE and some users said it will boost the speed). But iPad Air 2 can not be charged with 5W adapter, because it will need more power.\nIf you have used the correct adapter, make sure there is no problem with the USB cable and your iPad USB port. Because sometime, dust and dirt can disrupt the charging process.\nCheck this page to identify your adapter: https://www.apple.com/power-adapters/\n\nA: Based on the video, and the fact that your iPhone charges fine off of the same cable, it looks like there could be debris in the iPad's Lightning port that's preventing the cable from seating fully.\nWhen the cable is plugged into the iPad, see if you can wiggle it slightly from left to right (and if doing so causes it to charge – or not charge – continually, instead of flipping back and forth). If the port is clear, the cable should fit snugly and not wiggle.\nI've had this happen with both the Lightning port and the headphone jack on various devices. You can use something like a toothpick or a paperclip to try to clean the debris out of the port and that will probably do the trick (just be careful to not damage anything).

This includes transferring my database from Outlook 2016 Mac to Apple Mail. \nQuestion\nAs I am completely unaware of this process, I am looking for some help in terms of what I need to do to migrate to Apple Mail. A simple and faster approach will be more preferable.\n\nA: TLDR;\nI will be honest upfront, without paid software this will be next to impossible to achieve, I therefore recommend that you stay with Outlook 2016 for Mac and save yourself the trouble and expense. Last time I checked, Outlook 2016 for Mac meets all \"Official Guidelines\" in he industry, hence is compliant with them. But since you ask, let's move forward.\nBackground\nYou are fortunate in that you already have all your mail on the same mac and do not need to deal with a device-to-device data transfer. If your Outlook 2016 would have been on a Windows machine, transferring to Apple Mail would have been a challenge in itself, but lets not worry about that as this involves a few steps too, due to incompatible and proprietary mail databases/formats.\nAssumption: I am assuming that you run the latest and greatest macOS High Sierra.  \nVerify your export options \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Outlook 2016 for Mac\n\n*Go to: File > Export...\n\n*In High Sierra an export selection (i.e. Mail, Calendar etc.) windows pops up, look at the title and check if it contains Export to Archive File (.olm)\nIt means that the final format you get out of Outlook 2016 for Mac will be a .olm file.\n\n\nCheck your import options \n\n\n*Open Apple Mail\n\n*Go to: File > Import Mailboxes...\n\n*You should see two options, either Apple Mail (used when you transfer from another Apple Mail - i.e. from another computer or account etc.) and Files in mbox format. This is the option you will have to use to import into Apple Mail.\n\n\nSo far, what we know is the format is at each end. We use Outlook 2016 for Mac to export a .olm file, which we somehow have to turn into a .mbox format to be imported into Apple Mail.\nWhat do we use?\nI recommend you check out OLM Exporter (ca. $9.40USD) to do the conversion from .olm to .mbox efficiently. Simply feed it the Outlook export (.olm file) and let it create the .mbox which you can import into Apple Mail.\nRemember\nThe .olm files contains all the options you selected upon exporting from Outlook (i.e. Mail, Calendar etc.) however, an .mbox file is (as the name may suggest) a message box so it contains emails only. When using the OLM Exporter, seperate files will be created for any non-mail items you selected upon export (such as .ics for Calander entries or .vcf for contacts. These can easily be imported into their respective mac components. Should they already exist (since the data came from the same mac), you will need to verify the obvious things like contact duplicates.\nConclusion\nBeing in the IT sector, I deal with this task on a regular basis and hope my answer added something valuable instead of the typical \"google is your friend\" response. I know this can be difficult to get your head around at first, but it is relatively easy once you have the process down. Let me know how you get on with the mail migration as I would be interested in following up with you about this.\n\nA: There is no easy way to do that.\nTo import Outlook data in Mail though, most of the time, the easiest is to go through an IMAP or Exchange account configured in both apps.\nCopy all the messages you need from Outlook to that account, and it should sync back to Mail.\nThe other option is already mentioned above to use third-party applications. One application that I felt had some interesting features is OLM Converter Pro.\nIts Ultimate version can migrate your Outlook 2016 Mac emails directly to Apple Mail. \nChoose your pick wisely.\nThanks. \n\nA: Launch Outlook, select a mailbox that you’d like to move to Mail, and drag it to the desktop. Doing this creates an mbox file (a file format that Mail can import). Repeat this process for all the mailboxes that you wish to import and then place the mbox files into a single folder.\nWhen you’re finished, launch Mail and choose File > Import Mailboxes. A window appears that asks you to choose a source to import data from. Select Files in mbox format and click Continue. A sheet will appear. Use it to navigate to the folder you created for your mbox files and click Choose.\n\nIn Mail, choose to import the mbox files you dragged from Outlook.\nIn the resulting window you’ll see all the mbox files it contains, each with a checkmark next to it. If you don’t wish to import messages from a particular mbox, just uncheck it. Click Continue and the messages within the checked mbox files will be imported into Mail. As Mail will tell you, you’ll find the messages inside an Import folder within its list of mailboxes.\n", "Q: AppleScript: Open URL in specific tab (Google Chrome) I can no longer open a URL in a specific tab using AppleScript.\nI tried the following code without success:\nset URL of tab 1 to \"https://\"\n\nand \nset myLink to \"https://\"\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\n    tell front window to make new tab 1 with properties {URL:myLink}\nend tell\n\nneither of which perform the desired action.  \nQuestion\nWhat do I need to change in the code in order to be able to accomplish this task?\n\nA: This works for me on the latest version of macOS Sierra\nset myLink to \"https://google.com/\"\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    tell its window 1\n        set theTabs to count of tabs -- how mmany open tabs\n        set URL of tab 1 to myLink -- insert desired tab\n        --set URL of (make new tab) to myLink\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Using a single user account between two mac OS installations on same machine I've recently set up two different macOS/OS X versions on my Mac in order to support running some legacy software. Each system is on a separate drive partition and my user account is on a third partition. I've mapped the my user account for each OS installation to the third partition so that documents and settings are available when booting in either system and I don't have reconfigure all of my settings.\nOn the surface that has worked. However, I've noticed a few peculiarities with settings that have changed. My guess is that going back to the older OS which might have different configuration format the default settings were generated and saved. And then when booting in the newer OS they were 'migrated' overwriting the settings in the newer OS. This seems to correlate with increased CPU activity when I boot into the newer OS after using the older one. But this is just a theory.\nAre there any particular things that I should do or avoid specifically with this kind of set up? Or are there reasons that this is not a good idea and I should use separate user accounts for each OS installation?\n\nA: I accidentally set this is up and it runs perfectly. I have mountain lion to run old things I still need and Sierra on a separate partition. They both have full administrator access to each other under my user ID. \nThe way it happened was I installed Sierra and then copied the data from my mountain lion installation. From the new Sierra I had full access to the mountain lion partition including system folders and vice versa. I can even run some apps like VLC and Office from the other OS’s apps folder. \nNow I want to reinstall Sierra but when I copy the data from the old Sierra partition it no longer recognises the two user IDs as the same me and I can’t access the other OS from either. \nI would love to know the logic governing what makes two IDs recognisable as the same user so as to find a way to reinstall Sierra with its current state AND retain access between the two OSs. \n", "Q: Can I allow Mac using Internet Sharing via Thunderbolt to talk to other devices on network?

But then I couldn't find the space that I deleted in diskutil list.The result was something like this:\n/dev/disk0 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         1.0  TB    disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            750   GB   disk0s2\n   3:       Apple_KernelCoreDump                         9.31 GB    disk0s3\n\nAs seen above around 233 GB space that belonged to Bootcamp was missing. Since I want KernelCoreDump and also wanted to reinstall Mac OS since long time ago, instead of delete KernelCoreDump and resizing the container, I decided to reinstall OSX. When I formatted Macintosh HD through \"Disk Utility\" in recovery mode, I still couldn't find the missing space. Therefore, with Macintosh HD selected, I clicked on the \"Delete Volume\" button. When I ran diskutil list command, the deleted Macintosh HD showed up as \"Container disk2\" but that 233 GB space was still missing. Like this:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         750  GB    disk0s2\n   3:       Apple_KernelCoreDump                         9.31  GB   disk0s3\n\nI'm guessing it's because Kernel dump container is preventing the whole free spaces to merge. Now I am in internet recovery mode and want to make the \"Macintosh HD\" partition again but also need to get back the 233 GB space from the deleted container that is still missing as well as keeping KernelCoreDump container. How can I do this? Can I delete KernelCoreDump, merge the free spaces and create it again or should I do something else?\n\nA: Use a different OS like Linux, and see if it detects the drive. Or alternatively you can install OS X on an external drive from Internet Recovery (if its large enough) and then try working with the drive. Usually reading a drive as an external drive has less problems when partitioned on Mac, as I learned when installing Ubuntu and Windows on my MBP. Work with the drive from there and find a way to reformat it as either exFAT or macOS journaled (extended). \n", "Q: Problems connecting to ethernet with El Capitan I have a late 2013 MacBook Pro running El Capitan 10.11.6.

When I logged in to icloud for the first time on my windows pc, my iphone made a loud notification sound and a message saying that another device has just attempted to log in to my icloud account popped up.  I selected \"allow\" on my iphone and the verification number was then displayed.  From my pc, I entered the given code and was taken to the icloud launchpad, where I received a prompt asking me if I wanted this browser to be remembered as trusted (so I dont have to go thru that process again, I assume).  I selected yes and I logged out soon after.  Later, I went back to icloud with a different browser and immediately another warning was displayed on my iphone.  Going back to tbe browser I originally signed in on didnt ring any alarm...although it;s the same device that wants to access my account.  My question is what info is exchanged in the verification process to ensure that I dont have to repeat the two factor step with a trusted device?  Also, is there any data from this exchange stored on my pc?  \n\nA: This is ensured by storing a cryptographic proof in cookies on your local computer. In authentication schemes like this, it is often named a \"token\".\nThis allows Apple's server to later confirm that the browser is indeed trusted because the contens of the cookies are sent automatically to their server when you browse for example www.icloud.com.\nThe cookies are prefixed X-APPLE (for example X-APPLE-WEBAUTH-HSA-LOGIN. 2FA is HSA version 2). You'll be able to see these cookies for yourself by opening the developer tools while on for example www.icloud.com, and then access the Resources tabs and select Cookies.\n", "Q: Restored from iCloud - asking for old friends account constantly I just got a new phone, and I restored from my previous phone's iCloud backup, which worked great EXCEPT I apparently had one or two songs in my music that were authorized by an old friend of mine.

This may not be fast enough to charge the laptop while you are using it, depending on how much energy it needs.\nTry leaving the laptop plugged in while you aren't using it. You can also access the Activity Monitor and go to the Energy tab to get an estimate on how long it will take to charge from the AC.\nIt is also possible the USB A to C converter you have only supports data transfer and not charging.\n", "Q: How to merge APFS volumes because of low perfomance Recently I bought a used MacBook Pro 15' with a i7 2,3 GHz processor, 16 GB RAM and 512 SSD total. But the machine runs very horribly. It's performance is nothing like you'd expect with this setup. I can't have Chrome opened with Sketch since it all gets very laggy and horrible. Normal interactions run very slowly, like opening launchpad, option+tab to a full size screen, and so on. \nThe machine came with a Boot Camp volume. I didn't erase it with native Boot Camp Assistant, but went to Disk Utility and erased it in it, after restoring the notebook to factory settings. But, I couldn't manage to merge the three volumes it had. \n\n\n*\n\n*Macintosh HD\n\n*Home\n\n*Container disk1\n\n\nThe Macintosh Volume is the one I use, where I install and keep all my stuff. The \"Home\" one is APFS and filled with 130 GB of I don't know what. The other one, Container disk1, APFS as well, has the same amount of storage as the other two but it's empty. \nI've been searching ways to merge them all wondering it will improve my notebook perfomance a whole bunch. I have no idea whats lowering my perfomance and what is filling the other volume. I do not have another user too. \nI am attaching some screen shots here, if it helps a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: The partitions should have nothing to do with performance issues, I have the same computer and three partitions on the disk as well. I would run the hardware test that is mentioned above and you can also try resetting the NVRAM (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063) and you can try resetting the SMC as well (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295). Apple recommends resetting the NVRAM/PRAM first and then resetting the SMC. I normally find resetting the SMC to do the trick though. Also, don’t worry, neither of these will hurt your computer if they do not work.\n", "Q: How to start slideshow I used the answers - how to start slideshow in Mac, but it does not work. I have iMac and may be somebody can help me. I open my pictures in the finder and then use one to start the slide show using the View and then  Slideshow.\nNothing work\n\nA: To be clearer - if you actually open all the relevant images in the Preview app, the slideshow option inside the Preview app will work.\nIf instead you highlight the files in Mac OS Finder, and then click Option+Spacebar, you will Quick Look these inside Finder, which will include a slideshow option as well - this is the far faster approach in most cases.\nHere are two screengrabs of the Quick Look function in Finder: one showing per-image-view, the other a grid view. \nNotice that in both cases I have all the files highlighted in Mac OS Finder, and then click the Quick View keyboard shortcut:\n\n\nAs you can see in the screengrab, if I want to, I then have the option to open any one of these images in the Preview app, should I want to adjust colour curves, print, annotate or other such tasks. \n\nA: You can use Option+Spacebar to open a Quick Look slideshow.\nAlternatively you can open the image in Preview and use the slideshow function from there.\n", "Q: Windows 7 only boots to Windows boot manager with Continue Recovery not going anywhere Windows 7 Boot Camp doesn't boot on MacBook Air 2011.

I wanted to boot Windows in Safe Mode to try repairing it there. However, there is no reaction on either F8 or fn+F8: whatever I press I'm being brought back to Windows Boot Manager.\n\nA: A normal Boot Camp assisted install of Windows 7 on your model Mac places the System Reserved and Windows Recovery Environment (WRE) files on the same partition as Windows 7. So, if your Windows 7 partition has been compromised, then  you may not be able to correctly access the boot manager or the recovery files.

Is it OK to get rid of it? If so, how?\n\nA: That is what is normally referred to as macOS, or \"The Operating System\". If it increased in size it may be the virtual memory (or \"page file\"). Note that I said \"may.\"\nI would look for a utility like Omni Disk Sweeper, Daisy Disk or Disk Inventory X and run it on your HD. Those utilities allow you to see a graphic representation of your drive sorted by file size.

I sit for maybe a minute, and BOOM, This operation has freed approximately 7.2GB of disk space. WOH! After doing some quick research, I didn't exactly find why this removed 7.2GB from my computer. Brew's FAQ said:\n\nBy default, Homebrew does not uninstall old versions of a formula, so over time you will accumulate old versions.\n\nMost kegs were around 20-80MB when deleted.

(5,583 files, 999.5MB)\n\nNote: The above kegs were picked out, most sit around 20-80MB, as said above.\nWhat does brew store that is cleaned by brew cleanup that is so big?\n\nA: I believe it works well since there is a system to version and track every single install and the script can do math to determine the space that it frees up. This is clearly needed if the versions get bumped several times a month and you have dozens of packages installed that get updated regularly. Basically, you're keeping multiple copies of the entire program and everything needed to link to / run / compile the package in many cases.\n\nWhy it uses that space is also up to what packages you install and how often they change and what percentage of changes you download / cache / install.\n\nIt's an elegant solution so that you can cache the download for machines that have network constraints and when you uninstall the binary or libraries - the cached download remains until you call the brew cleanup only when they need space back urgently - others that have fast network and need space can clean up after every single install if they choose.\n", "Q: Mail app on my Mac closes unexpectedly The Mail app on my Mac OSx High Sierra closes unexpectedly.

Add them back in one by one until you determine which account has content that causes mail to crash.\nYou can also look into the crash logs to see if they are the same or pay attention to see if you can make Mail crash (especially when you are not connected to the internet). That would point to a specific action or specific piece of mail that triggers a bug.\nUpdating Mail and sending the crash reports to Apple is also a good way to get bug fixes and be sure your bug is looked at by Apple engineering.\n\nA: I seems similar problem with my case. \nThe crash report was:\nException Type:        EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)\nException Codes:       0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000\nException Note:        EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY \n\nIf your crash type is same to me, Then deleting all your accounts and re-adding them will solve your problem. \n", "Q: Delete all Bookmarks / Favorites from Safari I use Chrome as my primary browser (Work and Home) but have to fall-back to Safari for side-businesses during work, such as music streaming sites.\nFor consistency, I like to keep my browsers in sync.

You simply then had to reference this newly created row when setting the values of cell 1, cell 2, and cell 3, which were otherwise being referenced as belonging to the selectedTable instead of a specific row in the selectedTable:\n    set dataToAdd to {¬\n        myDateFromPlist, ¬\n        myTimeFromPlist, ¬\n        theIDFromPlist}\n\n    tell application \"Numbers\" to tell ¬\n        the front document to tell ¬\n        the active sheet to tell ¬\n        table 1\n        \n        set R to add row below last row\n        \n        tell R to ¬\n            repeat with i from 1 to count dataToAdd\n                \n                set value of cell i to ¬\n                    item i in dataToAdd\n                \n            end repeat\n    end tell\n\nI decided to wrap the setting of cell values inside a repeat loop, because—in theory—you could have 50 cells to assign values to, and this saves a bit of typing, plus make the code a bit easier to read.\nNote, however, that cell i inside the repeat loop is, itself, part of a tell R statement, where R is the reference to the new row just created.  This tells the script that it's cell i of this new row that should be assigned the values stored in dataToAdd, and not simply cell i of table 1 (I'm assuming your sheet only has one table, in which case there's no need to bother with the lengthy first table whose class of selection range is range.  If, however, I've assumed wrongly, then it's still better to give your tables names, which you can then reference specifically from your script, rather than by way of a very tenuous hope that the selected table is always going to be the correct table).\n\nSome Points About Your Question Content and Code Snippet\nAt the moment, this is the most assistance I can give.\nIf I might advise you, in posting a question, whilst it's great that you posted your code snippet, it's far more helpful to a) post a code snippet that compiles (yours does not; Script Editor reports an unexpected end of file when attempting to compile it, because your code snippet is incomplete); b) include enough of the code out of the greater whole such that it can be run on someone else's system, which means that variables and such should be defined within the code snippet—currently, I have no idea what the variables myDateFromPlist, myTimeFromPlist, and theIDFromPlist are or contain, so can't, for instance, help you with regards to why your RAM usage escalated.\nI suspect there's a bunch of code that precedes this Numbers block, in which you've accessed your plist file to retrieve its data.  It might be something in the way you've done this that has your memory being consumed.\nAs a final critique, whilst error-handling is a good idea, I would leave it out until your script is being finalised, because its current entrapment blocks include too many lines of code where different errors could be caught: for instance, if you receive an error code of 1001, it could be because there is no active sheet; or there is no selection range; or that something went wrong with assigning values to a cell, which could be cell 1, cell 2, or cell 3, but may have been a result of a problem with row 2 or one of the variables.  Also, you have two try blocks nested inside one another, which is pretty cavalier.\n\nShould You Want More Help...\nIf you're happy with the solution this answer provides to your issue of row allocation and data insertion, then I'm happy it was an easy fix.  If you have any other queries about this, leave a comment and I'll get back to you.  If you want to provide more information regarding your script, variables, and what not, we can try and suss out where this memory consumption is coming from.  As you said in your comment \"with this method though is my RAM is jumping out of the window\", it would be helpful to know what was different between your first method and the one that generated the memory consumption, which may, of course, require you to post two scripts.\nWhat you can do for the purposes of this is use an online paste bin.  Pastery doesn't require usernames or passwords, and has AppleScript syntax highlighting, but it's one amongst many.  Paste Bin doesn't require any login whatsoever.  It's useful to use on Stack Exchange websites when you want/need to supply additional code that is requested specifically, but isn't actually needed for the main focus of the question itself where a code block was already supplied and supplying more would risk drowning the question in a sea of grey.\n\nA: Probably not the best way but seems to work \n    tell application \"Numbers\"\n        activate\n        try\n            if not (exists document 1) then error number 1000\n            tell document 1\n                try\n                    tell active sheet\n                        set the selectedTable to ¬\n                            (the first table whose class of selection range is range)\ntell the selectedTable to set value of cell 1 of row 2 to myDateFromPlist\n\n                    tell the selectedTable to set value of cell 2 of row 2 to myTimeFromPlist\n\n                    tell the selectedTable to set value of cell 3 of row 2 to theIDFromPlist\n\n                    end tell\n                on error\n                    error number 1001\n                end try\n                tell selectedTable\n                    -- editing statements go here\n                end tell\n            end tell\n\n", "Q: Fusion drive only shows the SSD partition Ok, I am at my wit's end.  Last week after 10.13.3 failed to install twice, my late 2014 5K Retina iMac became painfully slow.  Eventually it just bricked.

I additionally have a MacMini, MacBook and G4 in my LAN, they all go way faster. For measuring I used a 220GB file to copy from one machine to another. While between the MacMini and MacBook this estimates to take about an hour, when copying to my iMac this measures at about 15 hours.\nI then unplugged the cable from the iMac and plugged it into the MacBook to check if it might be a cable, and the speed was fine. So the cables seem to be fine.\nI then connected the MacBook directly to my iMac bypassing the router and the speed was fine too, so the iMac port seems to be fine.\nSo, I’m thinking it’s something in the settings.

I have about 1100 songs in my library from CDs in itunes which are matched in Apple music/iCloud music library. Some of them are loved in terms of Apple Music and others not.\nHere comes the challenge: I want to create a smart playlist with still not loved songs(love is none rule) limited to 25 and it should live update every week.\nWhat I’ve done is to set the following rules:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plays < 15\n\n*Love is none\n\n*live updating\n\n*Limit 25 songs\n\n\nBut this will make songs never return back to the playlist. Do you have a better idea?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: First off, live updating is immediate rather than \"timed\".  Other than that though, there are a couple things you can do to get close to what I think you are trying to do but it can't be exact.  It will require multiple smart playlists for set up and a \"playing\" playlist that references the others, and it won't be perfect.   \nBecause the updating is immediate, the \"playing\" playlist will change after a song is played.  This isn't as bad as it sounds, what you want to accomplish is getting the song to come up again until you \"love\" it - and let it hang around for a little while.\n(All playlists below should live update.)\nPlaylist1: love = none songs.\nPlaylist2: Playlist1 AND not played in the last week AND plays < 15 AND limit to 4, random\nPlaylist3: 21 most recently played\nNote that Playlist3 looks mutually exclusive from Playlist2 because if you played a song in the last week it can't be in Playlist2.  You could put most of the Playlist2 criteria in Playlist1, but the main thing is that Playlist2 should be a subset of Playlist1.  \nPlaylistA: (any songs from) Playlist3 + Playlist2, limit to 24 least recently played.  This is the playlist you actually play - play it in sequence of arrival rather than any other sequence.  I chose the sizes of Playlist2 and Playlist3 for the sake of repetition which I will explain later.\nPlaylist3 + Playlist2 = 25 songs, but you are limiting it to 24.  Because it is 24 least recently played, as soon as SongA is finished playing it will drop off PlaylistA - if it was a song from Playlist2 it will jump into Playlist3, the least recently played song from Playlist3 will vanish from the list, and Song$ will be added to Playlist2 AND SongZ will be added to the end of PlaylistA.  After SongB on PlaylistA finishes playing, it will drop off PlaylistA - if it was on Playlist3 already it will move to the end of it and either SongA or Song$ will be added to the end of PlaylistA, depending on the randomization engine.\nOnce a song drops off Playlist3, it can only return to Playlist2 in a week or more IF you didn't \"love\" it AND it hasn't played 15 times.  The songs dropping off Playlist2 and Playlist3 happen immediately, not every week. You might want to experiment to see how long it takes for a song to fall off Playlist3 - the randomization engine may make some songs stick around for a a long time before it gets victimized while a song from Playlist2 may only rotate through Playlist3 a couple times before it falls off Playlist3.  I guessed that a proportion of 4:21 would keep a song rotating for about a week - at an average of 4 minutes per song you will get a \"new\" unloved song every 20 minutes or so until you've exhausted Playlist1 or Playlist2.  So you'll \"lose\" a song from Playlist3 every 90 minutes or so - if my math is right (and it probably isn't) a song may rotate about 10 times through before it falls off Playlist3. If you \"love\" a song that is in Playlist2, it will drop immediately and NOT go to playlist3 since you didn't let it finish playing so you might need to be cognizant of what you are \"loving\".\n", "Q: iMac Safari web browser Just updated iMac 2011 model to High Sierra, when I search website it automatically goes into reading.

I recommend you try mounting any partitions first. If there is data on the drive but your Mac device cannot read it even after attempting to manually mount the drive partitions, then I recommend plugging the drive into a computer with support for the file system being used on those partitions.

This extension is primarily for changing the color(s) on an html page.\nHowever, since many browsers today support opening pdf documents, this extension works really well. There are different color schemes you can use to change the colors in the pdf document and you have a lot of customizations.\nHowever, a downside to it, is that the page scrolling/ zooming is really slow.\nNote : Although this extension is available also on firefox, this ability to invert colors on local files is currently (as of writing of this answer) is only restricted to chrome.\n\n2nd Solution : (Mac based solution)\nCreate a dark version of your pdf to view with preview. You can use imagemagick to invert the colors in your pdf document.\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*If not already installed with Homebrew, run brew install imagemagick\n\n*Change to the directory of the files\n\n*Execute the following command:\n\n\nconvert -density 150 -channel RGB -negate \"source-file.pdf\" \"output-file.pdf\"\n\nThe density is your dpi, so you can adjust it according to your need.\nThis method saves you invert colors for the whole OS, which is just absurd. However, it does have a small disadvantage. During this conversion, the pdf pages are converted to images or scans. Thus, you lose the ability to copy/ select text. If you want to annotate your text, you can annotate with a line tool instead of a marker.\n\nA: While there is not an inverted color scheme for Preview, you can invert the screen colors for the entire system by pressing\nCommand-Option-Control-8\nPress the sequence again to restore the default color scheme.\n\n\nA: You can use the system preferences sections: Accessibility to invert your display colours. That's not focussed on preview, but does the trick.\n\nA: You can try zathura. The documentation gives the MacPorts port as the method of installation for macOS, but this Homebrew tap actually works for Big Sur. Once you've followed the installation steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open the pdf with zathura, by typing zathura in the terminal.\n\n*A window should appear, in it press o for \"open\" and then enter the /full/path/to/file.pdf.\n\n*Then you can hit control + r to revert the color.\n\n\nA: I use Adobe PDF Reader to read PDF books. In Preferences > Accessibility > Document Colors Options I set \"Replace Document Colors\" and \"Custom Color\". Page Background: black and Document Text: a ordinary dark grey.\nSo my default PDF reader is Preview with regular color, but I open PDF books with customized Adobe Reader.\n\nA: I had the same problem so I wrote simple and free app for Mac to read PDFs in negative. App offers two negative modes (colour inversion and colour inversion with sepia).\nIt is called  Negative and it is free on the Mac App Store\n\nA: PDF Expert (Free | $80)\n\nThis is by far the best solution I've come across for reading PDF files in dark mode. It has a sepia mode as well, which is a nice plus. It works on images by making them grayscale and then inverting them.\n\n*\n\n*I tried Negative, and it was horrible in terms of performance. PDF Expert is so smooth, it feels like a native macOS app.\n\n*I also have Acrobat, but using it for night mode feels kind of \"hacky.\" Its performance is not great, and its price is quite hefty. PDF Expert on the there hand has a dedicated night mode, which works and looks better than Acrobat's night mode. PDF Expert has a hefty price, but you get the night mode with the free version.\n\n*Using the invert mode on macOS disables Night Shift and True Tone. Those are the last things that I want to disable at nighttime (which is usually when I want to read PDFs in dark mode). It also inverts color images, which looks pretty bad in my opinion. PDF Expert does it much better.\n\nDisclaimer: I have no affiliation with Readdle or PDF Expert. I just think it works much better than any of the other options mentioned here.\n", "Q: Shared menu missing from finder sidebar Since upgrading to High Sierra the 'Shared' menu (back to my mac, connected servers, bonjour computers) has disappeared from my Finder sidebar. Selecting/de-selecting in preferences makes no difference. Favorites, Devices and Tags all work as expected.\nThanks.\nosx 10.13.3 (17D47)\n\nA: After upgrading to High Sierra, I had the same issue, coupled with SMB hanging without connecting to remote servers.\nThe SMB issue was solved by changing the SMB version to v2 in the /etc/nsmb.conf configuration file and rebooting the Mac as recommended in this post on SMB share deadlock.

There are Public Folder, Drop Boxes and Shared Folder. What confuses me is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which one of the above to use when sharing folders between multiple users on the same Mac?\n\n*Is sharing folders using any of the above makes it available to whoever on the same network?\n\n*How to share folders and files between users and not network?\n\nA: There's an Apple support page that explains these three folders. These folders are for sharing files with users of the same Mac, and by default are not used for transferring files through the network.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Shared folder is located in /Users.\n\n*Your Public folder is in your home folder. Each user has one by default.\n\n*Your Drop Box folder is in your Public folder.\n\n\nThe Shared and Public folders can be read by anyone, regardless of administrator access. However, only the owner of a file (i.e. the user who put it there) can modify or remove it.\nThe Drop Box folder is used to share items with another user, and not every user on the Mac. Anyone can put items in the folder by dragging and dropping it into the user's Drop Box. However, only the user that owns the folder can open and read what's inside the folder.\nIf you want to allow any user on the Mac to have access to these files, use the Shared folder or your Public folder. If you want to share a file with a limited amount of user(s), put the file in their Drop Box folder(s) located in their Public folder(s).\n\nA: The shared folder is for users on the same computer.  For example if you install an application that all users can access.  Depending on the computer you might not have permission to do this, for example if it is a work or public computer the administrator might restrict a user's ability to make global changes on the system.\nThe public folder is a folder within your user account that you can access to share documents with others on the same computer.  This is associated with your login and doesn't require administrator privileges. \nDrop Box is a third party application that allows remote access of files, either by yourself or others if you give them permission.  Therefore files in a Drop Box folder are those that are sync'd to your Drop Box in the cloud.\nThe page below has step-by-step instructions and has more information on how to edit permissions:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH25605?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Macbook finder copy changes permissions to 777 I recently got my first mac (macbook pro) and I use it primarily for coding C++ and python in the terminal.  I noticed if I use finder to copy a directory (with my code in it) onto a USB drive, then the permissions on all the files get changed to 777.  Is there any way I can use finder to copy files onto a USB and have it preserve the existing permissions?\n\nA: After some experimentation, I figured out that the USB drive was formatted FAT, and when Finder copies to a disk formatted FAT, the permissions get changed to 777.  When I reformatted the USB drive to MAC OS, then finder copied the files with permissions correctly preserved.\nSide Note: Someone suggested the permissions don't really change to 777, but rather FAT simply does not support unix permissions.  HOWEVER, I would point out that I first noticed this not when I initially copied my files to the usb drive, but when I copied them back to my macbook from the usb drive, and then I saw that on my macbook the permissions were now 777.  So, in effect, FAT's non-support of unix permissions actually did change the permissions to 777.\n", "Q: Can't transfer ringtone to iPhone or remove existing from library I'm using iTunes 12.7 and iOS 11.3.

Thanks in advance \n\nA: Assuming that there is no firewall running (you can do this by issuing the command sudo pfctl -d at the command line), there are two possibilities that would be causing this:\n\n*\n\n*A faulty Apple USB Ethernet Adapter\n\n*Network security measures preventing you from obtaining network access\n\nFaulty USB Adapter\nThis is fairly easy to diagnose; try another one.  If another adapter gives you the same results, it's highly likely the issue isn't the adapter.  Additionally, to be 100% certain, take the suspect adapter to a different network (or just connect it directly to another computer).  If it works there, the adapter isn't faulty.\nNetwork Security Measures\nGetting a self assigned IP address means you didn't get a DHCP offer (and accept it).  Manually assigning a known good IP  and still not being able to browse means your computer is blocked from accessing the network.  This could be due to many factors:\n\n*\n\n*The port is disabled on a switch.  This is done to eliminate the possibility of a rogue actor gaining access to the network by simply plugging in a device.  This is not the case here as your Win10 machine works when plugged into it\n\n\n*The switch could be using Mac Address filtering.  The Ethernet adapters (the USB adapter and one in your Win10 machine) have unique MAC Addresses (Media Access Control, not \"Macintosh\") and the switch could be configured to only allow certain MACs access.  This is easy to test/bypass by spoofing the USB Adapter's MAC with the Win10 machine's MAC.  If it works, you've got your answer.\n\n\n*The company (I suspect this because this is very uncommon in home networks) has employed some sort of authentication mechanism like RADIUS that will prevent you from gaining access on an unknown/un-trusted device.  Spoofing a MAC address will not bypass this and you'll need to contact your IT admin for assistance.\n\nA: I had this issue after switching the Ethernet cable from my Windows computer to my Mac. Apparently the router (which has no Wireless capability) was running as a modem only, and not as a router. When this is the case it only issues an IP address to the first device that connects. Resetting the router and connecting to the Mac first solved the issue.\n\nA: I had this issue when unplugging my router and trying to hardwire my computer. I called my ISP and found out each time I unplug and go from using a router to not using a router, I had to reboot my modem. I had my Ethernet cable plugged into my computer and modem and once the ISP reboot my modem it said “Connected” and the internet worked.

Once signed in, you should be able to update the app in question.\nNote that other apps not installed under this Apple ID will now not be updatable until you sign out again and log back in with the original Apple ID and password.\nThe only way around this is to delete your apps and re-download them using the other Apple ID. However, it's likely that if you have multiple apps installed using each of these Apple IDs that you may face similar issues to the one you're now facing with the music app, so you may be better off just signing in and out of your various Apple IDs if and when you need to.\n", "Q: Images sent over iMessages are low quality I capture images via iphone camera and attach to iMessages.

It shows an error that I can't change target devices range for already released bundleID. But if I change bundleID in XCode it will be another application. I want to provide an update only for ARKit enablers, how can I do it?\n\nA: You can't have separate builds with the same BundleID shipped to the AppStore. If you really want to have \"Something special\" for devices that are ARKit capable - Use some kind of checks during the app launch. Here's the quote from Apple\n\nImportant\n  All ARKit configurations require an iOS device with an A9 or later processor. If your app otherwise supports other devices and offers augmented reality as a secondary feature, use this property to determine whether to offer AR-based features to the user.\n  If your app requires ARKit for its core functionality, use the arkit key in the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities section of your app's Info.plist to make your app available only on devices that support ARKit.\n\nSo you can use ARConfiguration.isSupported to check the device capabilities in the runtime. If It's not supported fallback to the \"Old\" implementation.\nIn order to compile the code for targets < 11 you can mark methods or even classes with @available(iOS 11.0, *) like so:\n@available(iOS 11.0, *)\nfunc doSomeARStuff() {\n    if ARConfiguration.isSupported { print(\"Supported\") }\n}\n\nIn order to call those methods using your existing code do it like:\nif #available(iOS 11.0, *) {\n    doSomeARStuff()\n} else {\n    // Fallback on earlier versions\n}\n\n", "Q: How can I tell the address of the remote server an app communicates to?

(a hostname, or an IP address)?\n\nA: This only applies to macOS and not to iOS:\nYou could use Wireshark or lsof which is already included in macOS.\nWith lsof you can type lsof -i | grep -E \"(LISTEN|ESTABLISHED)\" into your terminal and it will show you all connections that are actively communicating.\nEdit: You could use a custom DNS like pihole to see which domains are requested by the app.\n", "Q: How to connect wireless keyboard on login screen My keyboard has discnnected from iMac when I used it on linux system and iPad.\nI cannot find a way to connect it because there is no Bluetooth option on login screen and I cannot login because I cannot enter the password.

The system sees that there are no input devices and searches for them. Then asks you to type a passcode and hit return.\nIf you have the Apple Keyboard 2 which has the Lightning port on the back of the keyboard, all you need to do is connect the USB -> Lightning cord to the computer and it will just like a normal wired keyboard.\n\nA: Found the solution by pure luck.\nWhen you are unable to login he lets you restart into a limited recovery mode where you can use forgot password or reset password. I've also had disk encryption and he didn't let me use terminal or anything fancy.\nWhen you get into that mode without anything connected to the mac he asks you to turn on the keyboard and mouse before continuing. I disconnected everything as the entire internet suggests but he wouldn't connect to keyboard.\nI use a non-apple mouse and when I give up and connect the mouse it lets me \"next\" wireless mouse has been detected which closed the dialog.\nThe catch: Use Apple mouse instead of your regular mouse!\nIf you use Apple mouse the \"next\" button no longer close the menu but move you into keyboard pairing where he offers you to enter the 6-digit code and connect the keyboard!\nIf you do not have Apple mouse - good luck.\nEdit: A moderator tried to change my response to imply that the solution does work without Apple mouse if you wait longer. It does not. I waited for almost an hour. If you disagree, write a comment. Don't try to put words in my mouth.\n", "Q: Why does Pages force me to waste the last line in the page?

Such an alternative program could just be to use cat or dd to copy bytes from /dev/urandom or /dev/null over the file.\n\nA: You can't have rm do something that it doesn't have the capability of doing.  On the other hand srm was designed expressly for this purpose. So, how do you get rm to do something that srm does out of the box?\nMake an Alias\nIf you want to \"use\" (the command; not the actual program) rm to do a single pass, use an alias.  To do this, you will need to have srm installed on your system (available in MacPorts).\n$ alias rm=\"srm -s\"\n\nNow, anytime you issue the command rm it will actually be calling srm with the -s flag for \"single pass overwrite\".  \nUsage example:  Suppose you have a directory called foo with a number of files that you want to delete.  Issue the command \n$ rm -rf foo\n\nand what will actually be executed is:\n$ srm -s -rf foo\n\nMake the Alias permanant\nEdit your ~/.bash_profile and add the alias entry.  Restart your bash session and the \"one pass rm command\" will now be available.\n\nA: As mentioned in this answer file overwriting is no longer a suitable way to ensure file are securely deleted on machines with SSD drives as the way the way files are stored/deleted on them is different due to underlying systems that provide for wear-leveling, efficiency, etc. Also journaling filesystems can complicate things.\nThe best approach is to use Apple's FileVault so any deleted files only potentially persist as encrypted fragments.\nIf you are using some other/older types of drives overwriting can help to ensure files are properly deleted. In which case there's GNU's gshred which can be installed as part of the GNU coreutils package e.g. using brew:\nbrew install coreutils\n\nThe gshred tool allows for control over the number of overwrites using the -n arg and also allows for control over how the deletion occurs using the --remove arg. So to only overwrite once and unlink the file use:\ngshred -n 1 --remove=unlink file_to_overwrite_and_delete\n\n", "Q: Understanding Disk Utility: external drive returns I/O error but Disk Utility says it's OK Having recently purchased Backblaze, I'm currently backing up to the cloud my 4TB WD external drive (7 months old). The backup process can run without problems for a few hours (ranging between 4 and 10 or so), but will inevitably stall on I/O errors with the external drive. Running First Aid using Disk Utility returns that everything is fine. I've tried a different USB port and a different USB cable, all to no avail. \nObviously the process of backing up the entire drive is accessing sectors that I might otherwise not have accessed for a long time, and which might be corrupt. But why does Disk Utility say the drive is OK? Does it only scan the headers etc.? Might the problem actually be with Backblaze? Is the best solution here to exchange the external HD under warranty?\n\nA: FWIW: As suggested by @Tetsujin, running a more 'aggressive' tool over the drive (in my case TechTool Pro) uncovered a number of bad blocks.\n", "Q: My SMS are not displayed in macOS Messages app anymore I use to have my SMS displayed in the macOS Messages app but it doesn't work anymore.\nI check this Apple support document and my configuration is well set up: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use Messages with your Mac.\n\n\nAny idea how to restore it?\nMy configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS version: 11.2.6\n\n*macOS version: Sierra 10.12.6\n\n\nA: For SMS to appear in Messages app in macOS, you need to have Text Message Forwarding turned on in your iPhone. It can be enabled by going to Settings apps → Messages → Text Message Forwarding on your iPhone and turning on the switch which appears against your macOS device in the list.\nThe iMessage app on iPhone can send both an iMessage message as well as a SMS. iMessage appear in a blue bubble, while regular SMS appear in a green bubble.\nAssuming you are signed into both your iPhone 6 and iPad 2nd generation, you can receive and reply to regular SMS (green bubble) from your iPad (as well as other Mac and iOS devices signed in using the same Apple ID), by using a feature called Text Message Forwarding. The option can be found by going to Settings apps → Messages → Text Message Forwarding and turning on the switch which appears against your iPad device in the list.\nFor step by step instructions, you can go through the Apple knowledge base articles, Use Continuity to connect your Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Watch and How to forward SMS/MMS texts on your iPhone.\n", "Q: Separating Apple ID My child and I have been using the same Apple ID. I want to create a new Apple ID for him. How do I remove him from mine and set up his own. Also, when removing from mine will he loose anything on his iPhone? \n\nA: Welcome to Ask Different.  You can create a new Apple ID for your child the same way you created one, here's a good walkthru you can follow.\nWhen your son signs in under the new ID, they will not see (and thus they will lose) any content or game progress they made under your ID.\nYou should also decide if you want to do Family Sharing.  Here's some info about that.  This will allow you to use Apple's parental controls for your son.  If this interests you, I would recommend reading this article before you setup your son's new ID.\n\nA: If your son signs out of the AppleID on his phone, there are options to keep most settings on the phone. This works for Contacts, Calendar etc, but there are a few exceptions such as Notes.\nApplications should remain, but will not be able to be updated, unless signing in to the AppleID used to purchase them. You can enable Family Sharing on your AppleID which will let the phone be setup for app purchases. Family Sharing does have some privacy aspects which your son may find unacceptable.\nHe would then have to create a new AppleID (or sign into the new AppleID you created) on his phone.\nI have just been through the process of changing from one AppleID to another, and it can be a difficult process. The most time consuming task was updating apps - if these were purchased under the old AppleID (even if \"free\") they need to be deleted and reinstalled under the new. This should not be necessary if the old AppleID is now used for Family Sharing.\n", "Q: Compatibility of oldish iPhones, Apple's policy, future perspective I'm shopping for a used iPhone. I would not use it as a personal phone, just as a device to explore Apple's apps, for professional reasons. \nI wonder what older models are still compatible with recently launched apps developed for new devices.\nIs there some official road map about support from Apple and back compatibility policy?  How far back in iPhone version can I safely go to buy a cheap device that will last at least one year?\n\nA: Here's the list of iPhones that currently support iOS 11:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5S\n\n*6\n\n*6 Plus\n\n*6S\n\n*6S Plus\n\n*SE\n\n*7\n\n*7 Plus\n\n*8\n\n*8 Plus\n\n*iPhone X\n\n\nWith the exception of the last 3, you can find reasonably inexpensive (probably not 'cheap') used iPhones that should last for another 1-3 years.

I want to create one for my MBP (for which I have deleted the recovery drive as well) and I have a working Macbook Air.\nSo if I use my Air to create the drive for MBP, will it work?\n\nA: You can create a bootable USB from any machine capable of running a version of macOS that has access to the App Store.\nIf you use a MacBook Air running Yosemite, you can download the installer for High Sierra and use it to create the USB installer and then procede to use it on a MacBook Pro (and every other Mac that supports that version of macOS).\nThere's no specific installer for Mac hardware types.\n(Personally, I keep a USB installer of every major version of macOS - Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, and High Sierra)\n", "Q: Preview is Not Remembering Window Sizes and Positions on Startup (after Update to High Sierra) Since I updated to High Sierra the Preview app no longer remembers the sizes and positions of its open windows. Instead it just opens all windows on the same desktop with standardised size and position when the computer starts up.\nHow do I fix this?\n(Side note: After updating the Preview app also didn't remember the last viewed page of PDF-files, but I was able to fix this by deleting the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview folder. However, the window size and position issue persists.)\n\nA: Preview does remember the position of windows containing images (JPG, PNG, etc) but for some reason does not restore the position of PDF windows. I suspect this is a bug.\nThe saved state for Preview is located at: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState\nMeanwhile, you can use an app like Stay to remember and automatically reset the position of any window. It’s a bit heavy handed for this use case but it would let you carry on until the bug is fixed.\nYou might also look at window managers such as Tiles or Rectangle that allow easy manipulation of windows.\n", "Q: MacBook Air (mid 2013, 13\", i5) - Geekbench scores on MacOS and Ubuntu Today I decided to do a clean install on MacBook Air - did an online recovery, erased the disk and installed MacOS High Sierra. Even clean it didn't behave really good so I decided to try Geekbench - with the Mac restarted and only the Geekbench app running - I got pretty low score -  1251 on single core and 2457 on multiple cores. \n\nBy a chance I had a Kali Linux (Debian) Live USB nearby so I decided to boot it and try Geekbench again. Got about three times better scores on both. \nGot really suspicious and decided to wipe the Mac again and installed Ubuntu 17.10 to try the test again and it got an even better score -  - 3294 on single core and 5773 on multiple cores. \n\nIt just feels much better - runs smoother, everything feels faster... \nWhy could that be? I'm super confused. Can anyone shed some light on my case?\n\nA: Why would that be?\nAny number of reasons; however I would point towards testing methodology.  Looking at the Geekbench Score for a MacBook Air 11\" Mid 2013, it got double your posted score and fairly in line with Ubuntu.\nIt's important to note that the score on the following chart are the \"average\" scores - meaning many higher and lower.\n\nTo make sure the results accurately reflect the average performance of\n  each Mac, the chart only includes Macs with at least five unique\n  results in the Geekbench Browser.\n\n\nWhy the large variance?\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS High Sierra, you didn't specify if you were using the latest updated version. \n\n*One test was done with a live CD\n\n*The Ubuntu score is referenced directly (unlike the others).  What \"tuning\" was done, if any is not noted.\n\n*macOS will limit the amount of CPU available to manage temperature.  Ubuntu does not.\nThose are just some of the possible reasons for the large variance and is by no means an exhaustive list.  \n\nA: After reading a bit more I found out there is a diagnostics tool on boot. It said my battery needs repair, but it's okay to use it without harm. Since it was changed a while back I decided to try and swap it with the older one and test again. After swapping them Geekbench showed double the performance - so I guess it's time for a new one.\n", "Q: iDrive backup for Mac failing I got a message from my Mac IDrive app that there has been no backup for four days.

I have both a 9,1 and a 9,2 Mid-2012 13\" MacBook Pros which have both failed. Having finally gotten both computers back from my daughter, the only thing that I can find wrong with either one is that it appears that one of the two memory slots has failed in each computer. (Mr Google has led me to places that have the story that Apple put a little too much torque on the screws holding the ports to the motherboard. And also the news that the only way to fix this is to replace the motherboard. \nI bought a refurbished  9,1 last summer which came with a single 8GB SODIMM in one slot rather than the advertised 2x2GB. I sent it back when I realized that it had a failed RAM slot. So apparently this is not an uncommon failure.)\nThese machines were long-ago upgraded to 16gb by replacing the original memory with a kit of 2 8GB SODIMMs, and so taking one out leaves me at 8GB, which is a sad place to be. When I go to Amazon and look at the product for 2gb, 4gb & 8gb Crucial chips, there is also an option for a single 16gb chip or a 2x16GB 32GB kit that's on the same form factor.\nSo now I'm wondering if I can get one of those 16GB chips for each computer, put it in the working slot, and have 16GB. According to this Macrumors thread, the answer is \"no\" \n\nThe important point is that while Ivy Bridge does support 32 GB, it only supports 8 GB per module. You'd need four slots for 32 GB to work, and the MacBook Pro (like every other laptop pretty much) only has two.\n\nBut I can't figure out if this is really true -- this post here gives me some hope  although it shows a screen shot of Crucial saying \"no\".\nDoes anyone know anyone who has tried this and know one way or another? \n\nA: From Intel's website: 7th Gen (U/Y) and 8th Gen (U Quad-Core) Intel® Processor Families Datasheet for the i7 mobile processor.\nUnlike the desktop counterpart that has support for 8 channels it (mobile chip) only has 2 channels with a maximum of 2 DIMMs per channel\nFurther in the datasheet, Intel specifically notes the maximumm amount of memory that can be addressed:\n\n16GB is your max.  \n\nA: I realised that this is not a direct answer to your question but since you're looking to get back the 16GB RAM. Getting the \"bad\" slot to work may be your answer.\nSome of those methods are discussed in iFixit thread recommended by Miles Wolbe.\nThere is also a youtube video https://youtu.be/1Zf_ADyjS9k\nthat removed the logic board to insert the plastic card.\nThere are also other roundabout ways to insert the card without removing the logic board one of which was what I did.\n\n*\n\n*Loosen or take off the 4 screws that hold the RAM slots\n\n*Insert a cut unused plastic card (can be the same shape as the RAM but slightly smaller or just big enough to insert underneath the  bottom RAM slot)\n\nI just got my bad bottom RAM slot to work but there is one open issue left which is how the card will affect the RAM temperature. Nonetheless, it could be a positive sign given that the above youtube video was posted almost 1 year ago with no complaint of RAM failure.\n", "Q: Is 5-6 hour of battery life normal for 4-year old mid-2013 13\" Macbook Air? My MBA mid-2013 usually lasts for about 6 hours; it's been used for almost 4 years now. I use Chrome for internet browsing, mostly Facebook, Reddit and go over to other websites from these two websites. No other streaming or song playing or any other app runs that continuously syncs over the Internet.\nI do use a number of extensions on Chrome - adblocker, lastpass, Evernote, hover zoom+.\nMy questions is, is 5-6 hours a normal battery life for 4-year old mid-2013 MBA with these settings or is is it time for me change the battery? \n\nA: A 17% drop in capacity over 4 years is not an issue.  Batteries have a useful life of 3 to 5 years depending on cycle count; if you get 1000 cycles, you've gotten the full life out of it.  \nThe key here is the number of cycles.  It's important to note that it's not what you do, but how many times you charge the battery.  It doesn't care that you're reading reddit, browsing with Chrome, or rendering video.  What matters is how often your battery is drained and recharged.\nNote:  A cycle is one complete drain and recharge.  If you drain only 5% and then recharge, it's only a 5% of one cycle; you have to do that 20 more times to to equal one whole charge cycle.\nSee:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully charged MacBook Air turns off when power cord removed\n\n*How to preserve MacbookPro battery from degradation?\n\n*Why does a 12 inch Macbook refuse to turn on with a lot of battery remaining unless it is plugged in?\n", "Q: 13\" MacBook Pro (Mid-2012) failing to fully boot I have a 13\" MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) that is failing to fully boot.\nWhat happens once I press the power button:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen turns on, and the typical boot-up loading screen with the Apple logo appears\n\n*Once the loading progress bar reaches about halfway, the screen goes black\n\n*About 10 seconds later, the login screen appears\n\n*I click on my account, type my password, and press enter\n\n\nNow this is when the funky stuff begins....\n\n\n*\n\n*The computer does not transition from showing the password box to the loading bar\n\n*Sections of the screen are now gray & green and slightly jittery\n\n\nAfter roughly 2 minutes of spazzing out with along with the odd colors showing up....\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen goes black\n\n*Fan is still fanning\n\n*Repeated beeping noise\n\n\nAnnnddd thats when I hold the power button and come to you fellas for some help\nI'm looking to diagnose the problem in order to hopefully fix it,\nany help/recommendation/advice would be much appreciated.\nThanks\n\nThe work-around:\nThinking the graphics card might be the problem, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstalled macOS\n\n*Installed Debian without GUI (command-line only)\n\n\nAt the end:\n\n\n*\n\n*Laptop does not freeze anymore\n\n*Laptop does not beep anymore\n\n*No more black/green/gray pixels\n\n\nA: You can run Apple's built it hardware test, Turn on your Mac, then immediately press and hold the D key on your keyboard.

I'm quite tempted by some 4K HDR external monitors that are slated to come to the market soon. Question is - can a Late 2016 MacBook Pro drive 4K HDR monitor at 60Hz? 4K monitors are supported as per Apple doc, but it doesn’t mention HDR at all.\n\nA: In general yes. It depends on the monitor, because every monitor has a different definition of \"HDR\". I'm not sure but I don't believe macOS can output in the HDR10 codec at all. Unless you really need 4k HDR 60Hz then I wouldn't worry about bandwidth, because the typical user will rarely have content that can use all three features at once. For example when you're gaming just switch the monitor to 1080p to get an HDR update every 16.7ms, but when you are photo editing or video streaming switch to 30Hz for a detailed image. But that's on the off chance that it doesn't work all at once. Any other problems you may have won't likely be because of your computers driver if you get a compatible display.\n\nA: No.  It doesn't support HDR.\nFrom Apple's Tech Specs for the MacBook Pro it supports \"Wide Color P3\"\nHDR (Rec 2020 or BT 2020) is a color space \"outside\" P3 (as in more color).

Thus not having to worry about the path in the future.\nAnother quick way to find the path is to drag the folder into a terminal window which will populate it with the mounted path.\n", "Q: How do I put an HTML page to be displayed when opening a website from hosts file? Hosts file is blocking access to some websites. How do i put custom HTML instead of default message \"This site can’t be reached\"?\n\nA: One has nothing to do with the other.\nA hosts file is just a \"directory\" of host names and their IP addresses.  It's not limited to websites.  You can think of it as a \"flat file DNS lookup.\"\n# Sample hosts file\n#\n\n123.456.789.001      foo.bar\n\nWith this address, you can...\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to a website - http://foo.bar\n\n*SMB share :  smb://foo.bar\n\n*SSH connection:  ssh user@foo.bar\n\n*Copy files securely from one host to another - scp stuff.ext user@foo.bar:/path/stuff\n\n*and much more\n\n\nIn order for your browser to display a web page, it must be \"served\" that page.  Since, by default, your clients aren't running a web server, there's nothing to serve.\nI'm assuming that you want to display this \"web page\" when someone goes to a site you \"blocked\" by using a custom hosts file.\nYou need to do this at the (your) network level where the DNS lookup redirects (or firewall intercepts/redirects) to a server hosting your error page.  \n", "Q: Remove duplicate pdf pages in Preview?

I am trying to launch a Google Chrome extension in AppleScript or Terminal. By \"launch,\" I mean replicate the act of clicking on the extension icon found in Chrome's toolbar.\nThe Chrome extension in question is Google Hangouts. Clicking on the extension icon creates a new pseudo-window in Chrome that houses the Hangouts dialer.\n\nHere is what I've considered:\n\n\n*\n\n*I uncovered the physical location of this extension on my hard drive: \n\n\n*\n\n*/Users/Me/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/ nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd/2018.123.418.2_0\n\n*However, I didn't find anything of significance.\n\n\n*I entered chrome-extension://nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd/ in Chrome's address bar, which led to a \"Your file was not found\" message.\n\n*I do not know of a way to associate a keyboard-shortcut with the Hangouts extension. The Options item in the context menu of the Hangouts extension is not selectable (i.e., it is greyed out).\n\n*The Hangouts extension has a second shortcut, found in the systemwide, top menu bar.

However, any phone number that is given to the web interface is dialed by the extension (not by the web interface itself). So, interacting with the extension directly is more ideal.\n\nIs the dreaded mouse-click simulation the only way to accomplish what I want?\n\n\nA: This works for me in macOS High Sierra:\nif running of application \"Google Chrome\" then\n    tell application \"System Events\" to click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of application process \"Chrome\"\nelse\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        activate\n        tell active tab of front window\n            repeat while (loading)\n                delay 0.2\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    tell application \"System Events\" to click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of application process \"Chrome\"\nend if\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways accomplish a task.

I am currently developing an app that allows users to search for a youtube video and then allows them to download the video offline for viewing when there is no wifi/cellular coverage..\nI noticed that the AppStore lacks this category of apps, or to put it in other words: apps like these appear for a short while before being removed, or updated to stop downloading videos.\nSo, there must be some guidelines on what apps are allowed to exist in the appstore and clearly youtbue downloaders are not. Where can I read those guidelines?\n\nA: Here's the official Apple guide \n\n5.2.3 Audio/Video Downloading: Apps should not facilitate illegal file sharing or include the ability to save, convert, or download media from third party sources (e.g. Apple Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, etc.) without explicit authorization from those sources.

Purely from empirical comparison, I have the impression that it has gradually become slower. At this point it is sometimes irritatingly slow, even for trivial -open-google's-maps-app- actions.\nAre there any reports that this is connected to the recent old-iPhone-slowdown issues? Are there any reports of how I can regain the use of this iPad as simply a web browser and simple apps platform?\n\nA: If I understand, you have a third generation iPad, which has an A5X processor. This is a fairly old CPU, as it was released in early 2012, but it should still provide a decent experience for web browsing.\nNote that the A5X is 32-bit, meaning it cannot run a lot of new apps or iOS releases that are deigned for 64-bit devices. The latest version of iOS you can run is iOS 9.3.5, so I would first suggest you update to that version to get the most secure and stable experience possible on that device.\nTo address the iPhone throttling, iMore says that this does not affect iPads.\nAccording to iMore, Apple only stated that a handful of iPhone models (devices from the iPhone 6 to iPhone 7 Plus) will be throttled at all. iMore also points out that the larger batteries in iPads makes this less of an issue.\nIf your iPad seems to be slow, I would suggest you connect it to a Mac or Windows PC and use iTunes to backup and restore the device. This will ensure a clean and up to date installation of iOS. While this may help, your iPad is a bit old, and it may just not perform well on recent versions of iOS. If you're willing to upgrade, the 9.7\" iPad is a great option for its price and performance.\n", "Q: Terminal script to create folders and copy files based on part of filename I have a folder with thousands of files in this format\n\n\n*\n\n*filenameA - 1.ext  \n\n*filenameA - 2.ext  \n\n*filenameB - 1.ext  \n\n\nand sometimes\n\n\n*\n\n*filenameB - 02.ext  \n\n\nI need a script that will read the files and create a single folder with each distinct filename before the \" - #.ext\" and then add all files with that same name into the folder.\nFrom the example above I would have two folders 1) filenameA 2) filenameB -\n each with two files in them.

In other words, the Ubuntu 18 installer will automatically create files in the proper locations for Ubuntu to appear in the Startup Manager.\n\nYou can still employ step 7, if you want an Ubuntu icon to appear in the Startup Manager.\n\nNote: These instructions are for Mac models with 64 bit EFI firmware. In other words, if your Mac has Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) or a newer version OS X (macOS) installed, then you can use these instructions. \n\nInstead of using rEFInd, you can use the Startup Manager to boot most Linux distributions. The Startup Manager is contained in the the firmware that is already installed in your Mac. After installing a Linux distribution, you will need to move a few files around in order for the Startup Manager to recognize and boot the Linux distribution.\nMost Linux distributions install grub and other files in the first EFI System partition on a Mac computer. Normally, this is the first partition on a Mac computer. The process of making a Linux distribution appear on the Startup Manager is a fairly trivial. The steps are given below for the Ubuntu Linux distribution.

I did not knowingly update my software beforehand, I do not have any conflicts in the keyboard shortcuts (no yellow triangle), and I only have one input source.\nI have done a pretty thorough search for solutions; here are some pages I have read: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6). Below are the common solutions that have not worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarted the machine. No change.\n\n*Restored the defaults on all keyboard shortcuts. No Change.\n\n*Changed the desktop resolution. No change.\n\n*Changed the shortcut. Spotlight works with essentially any other shortcut, but I am used to cmd-space.\n\n*Reset the spotlight index (sudo mdutil -E / or killall Dock). This temporarily enables the shortcut but the problem surfaces after either closing the laptop's lid or changing the application window.\n\n*Remove the HIToolbox.plist and restart (rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist). This enables the shortcut for a couple seconds immediately after startup but then the problem resumes.\n\n*Closing applications with potentially conflicting shortcuts. I can't say with 100% certainty that I have covered everything but I have combed through my app shortcuts and closed out of anything that might be the problem. To reiterate, this was working fine until yesterday.\n\n*First aid on the disk. No change. I assume this would fix permissions issues if there were any.\n\n\nOne last piece of odd behavior: I can change the shortcut from cmd+space to cmd+option+space (and everything works), but I cannot change it back to cmd+space without hitting \"restore defaults\". The shortcut window remains empty until I close it or hit another shortcut. \nAt my wits end here! Has anyone solved this before?\n\nA: Have you checked the system preferences -> Keyboards -> Shortcuts -> Spotlight and made sure it was checked?\nDoes it work in safemode?\nWhat about other user accounts?\nIf not then you may need to reinstall MacOS from recovery mode.\n\nA: In my case, a display problem caused the spotlight input window to pop up off screen.  Clicking and holding the spotlight icon in the system bar resets the location of the spotlight window and fixed my trouble.\n\nA: The issue may be caused by the SystemUIServer process hanging.\nYou can restart it by launching the command\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\n\nA: Once in a long while, this happens to me with my external on. I think the shortcut is working, but it's showing up off-screen somewhere. Unplugging the external monitor gets it working again.\n\nA: I found out that BetterTouchTool was running in the background and somehow had cmd-space assigned as a shortcut with no action (I definitely do not remember doing this). For others with this issue, I would advise carefully considering apps running in the background when checking for conflicts.\n\nA: I have been in the mac field for several years now and have found the following command has not let me down so far.\nInformation\nThis involves disabling the System Integrity Protection briefly for the purpose of writing to an otherwise \"locked\" (during normal boot) directory. Disabling the System Integrity Protection is not recommended for long periods of time as it is possible to \"damage\" files that macOS typically prevents you from changing. However, this is the only solution I have found to work reliably.\nSteps \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery mode on your mac by restarting, holding CMD + R upon restart.\n\n*From the menu bar of Recovery mode, choose Utilities, then Terminal.\n\n*Type: csrutil disable to disable System Integrity Protection. You can use csrutil status to check its current state.\n\n*Reboot the mac as advised (into normal mode, not recovery).\n\n*Open Terminal (found in the Utilities folder under Applications)\n\n*Type: sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist (all in one line), hit Return/Enter key.\n\n*Relaunch the Mac\n\n*Give Spotlight a try using the key combination(s).\n\n*Repeat steps 1, 2, 3, 4; changing the command in step 3 to csrutil enable to re-enable the System Integrity Protection. Again, you may use csrutil status to check its current state.\n\n\nWhat this does is actually does is re-initiate Spotlight's launch daemon (using the launchctl command). Anyway, what's important is that it works, although I am not sure what effect the key combination change had on the way it functions - this may have to be set back to its defaults.\nGive it a go and report back on how you make out. I'd be happy to follow up with you on this.\n\nA: Tried some answers, only to find out I actually deactivated the shortcut by mistake somehow.\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Spotlight, select Show Spotlight search ⌘+Space\nDon't forget to check the basics!\n\n\nA: Just wanted to chime in and say that BetterTouchTool ended up being the culprit for me. Never would have checked there as I never intentionally set a command+space shortcut in the app.\nMany thanks to @noland-conway above for the tip!\n\nA: Chris had the right answer for me!  My system is struggling with the spontaneous rebooting graphics card problem.\n\nA: This happens when you have manually moved the Spotlight results box. By doing that, Macbook seems to assign a kind of fixed position to the Spotlight box.\nWhich is fine so long as you don't change your screen setup. The problem only occurs when you work with different screen setups (like connecting to a second screen, but also working in laptop-only mode).\nThen, apparently, the fixed position can end up putting the Spotlight box outside the screen, or right at the edge (I could see the shadow of the Spotlight box in my righthand margin). Or Mac can't make sense of the fixed position that it remembers.\nSolution for me was to disconnect the secondary screen, manually move the Spotlight box (which was indeed off-center) to the middle of the laptop screen. It doesn't have to be perfect center.\nOnce you reconnect the second screen and make it the Main screen, you should see the Spotlight box in the approximate center.\nOf course if the box got remembered in a way-out position, you might not be able to \"find it back\" in laptop-only mode. I don't know how to fix that.\nMaybe another workaround in that case would be to press Cmd-Space, then enter a search term which you know would make the search box get really large. That would trigger the results box to be extra large, so it might come into your screen from the edge.\n", "Q: How to stop folders being modified when you look in them? When I open a folder, the \"date modified\" date changes. This is annoying if nothing in the folder has changed. I like to search for things by reverse \"date modified\" order, i.e. listing things that I have changed recently at the top. \nIs there a way of changing this behavior so that the folder's \"date modified\" reflects the last time something changed in the folder?\nETA. To modify the question a bit, is it possible to change the \"date modified\" of the folder back to the newest \"date modified\" of it's contents?\n\nA: Simply looking in a folder doesn't change the date modified. This only happens if Finder makes a change in the folder, for example to create a missing .DS_Store file.

The option can be found by going to Settings apps → Messages → Text Message Forwarding and turning on the switch which appears against your iPad device in the list.\nFor step by step instructions, you can go through the Apple Support articles, Use Continuity to connect your Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Watch and How to forward SMS/MMS texts on your iPhone.\nThe messages in the cloud feature also might be worth enabling if you care to have your messages sync status by checking in with iCloud as opposed to relying on every device being online all the time.\n", "Q: How to rescue my lost APFS partitions My Disk is 500 GB, and APFS Physical Storage and AppleAPFSMedia are 300GB, can't run First Aid on both. \nCurrently I can login to macOS High Serria(199GB partition) on which I post this.\nThere was a system(macOS high serria) and a lot data on that 300GB partition, I can't just erase it, How can I rescue that partition ?\ndetails as below:\n. \n. \n. \n. \n\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                     SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                      209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2          301.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1          199.0 GB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                     SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                       +199.0 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s3\n   1:                APFS Volume High Sierra              51.8 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                  42.1 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                 1.0 GB     disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                       4.3 GB     disk1s4\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                     SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                       +ERROR      disk2\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n\nThanks !\n\nA: *\n\n*Run Disk Utility from Recovery Mode\n\n*On Reboot, press Cmd-R\n\n*Open Disk Utility.\n\n*Select your partition one by one and hit repair a couple of times.\n\n\nIf you have another Mac, you can mount your MacBook partition using Target Disk Mode.

Battery health on the trackpad and keyboard does not seem related to the disconnects.\nSince all three of the devices disconnect, the culprit would seem to be the Mini, particularly the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapter. But I don't want to jump to conclusions.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I best diagnose the situation to understand what is wrong?\n\n*Is it likely that replacing the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth adapter would resolve the problem?\n\n\nA: \nIs it likely that replacing the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth adapter would resolve\n  the problem?\n\nYes.\nIt's highly likely that the issue is the Airport card because it is a combo Bluetooth and Wi-Fi adapter.  Given that you are having issues with both functions, it points to the adapter being at fault.\nYou've already done a significant amount of diagnostics and ruled out other machines don't exhibit the symptoms connecting to the same network.  You can further verify that your Bluetooth peripherals are not the issue by connecting them (keyboard and trackpad) to the MacBook Air.  You could also run AHT - Apple Hardware Test.  It may detect a problem with the Airport card.\n", "Q: Set Find my Friends so it shows my laptop location instead of my iPhone location? Find my Friends currently shows my iPhone location. I would like to change it so it shows my Mac location instead. I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.6.\nIs this supported directly by Apple or a 3rd party tool or app?\n\nA: Sure - if Find My Mac (FMM) is enabled and your iCloud accounts match, then open the iPhone Find My Friends (FMF) app and then do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap your icon / row that's pinned at the bottom of the screen\n\n*Select your Mac from the list below\n\n*If the Mac isn't showing on the Mac in System Preferences\n\n\n*\n\n*In sharing preference item, give your Mac a name that's different than any of the other names in iOS FMF\n\n*In the Security preference item, be sure Location Services is enabled and that System Services is enabled for Find My Mac (FMM)\n\n*In iCloud preference item, ensure you're signed in with the identical AppleID as on the iPhone\n\n*Turn on Find My Mac (FMM) - look for any network errors or server errors that show up within 5 minutes or so of registering\n\n\n\nAt this point the Mac should be able to select itself or your other iOS devices should be able to select the Mac to report your location. Be sure you leave WiFi on and Bluetooth on for the Mac to have the best chance to get a correct location.

In the case of a BIOS boot (on models the can BIOS boot), the firmware always executes software on the Master Boot Record (MBR) provided the drive has a valid hybrid partitioning scheme.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*A security update for macOS Sierra was installed. The default startup disk was changed to the volume where macOS resides.\n\n*The diskutil command failed to merge all or part of the space occupied by Linux back to the partition where macOS is installed.\n\n*On startup, the Mac was unable to boot to the default startup disk (the macOS volume). This caused the firmware to search for any software that may be bootable. This resulted in a boot of rEFInd.\n\n*The Mac was rebooted to macOS Recovery over the Internet. The diskutil command, given below, was used to erase the entire internal drive. An attempt to install macOS on an external drive lead to failure.\ndiskutil  eraseDisk  JHFS+  MacOsX  GPT  disk0\n\nThere are may ways the default startup disk can be changed from rEFInd.

I would like to be able to click an arbitrary item in an arbitrary submenu of an arbitrary menu in any application. Here's where I've gotten:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set activeApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process activeApp\n    tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n        click\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe problem I'm getting is when I add that second \"of menu bar item 1\". It worked just fine up until I got to that point and now I don't know what to do? I'm pretty new to UI scripting and applescript.\n\nA: The hierarchy of the menu bar object goes like this:\nmenu bar > menu bar item > menu > menu item [ > menu > menu item [...] ]\n\nwhere the square brackets indicate possible sub-menus, should they exist.\nTherefore, if you change this line:\n    tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n\nto this:\n    tell menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n\nit will work.\nThis, of course, will always click the Apple () menu, which is menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 for all applications in which the menu bar exists and is visible (although it belongs to whichever application is frontmost, so attempting to ask another application process to click this item will throw an error).\nIf you wish to click an arbitrary menu item in the menu bar to reveal its menu, you need to replace the index number 1 of the menu bar item with a random value, but one that does not exceed the number of available menu bar items.\nTo get the number of menu bar items, use the count command:\n    set N to count menu bar items of menu bar 1 of activeApp\n\n(You can omit of activeApp if the command is placed inside a tell process activeApp block.)\nTo get a random number between 1 and N, use the random number command:\n    set i to random number from 1 to N\n\nPutting that all together, your new command will look something like this:\n    tell menu bar item i of menu bar 1 to click\n\nNow each time you run the script, a random menu bar item will be clicked causing its menu to appear.\nTo go even further, and get your script to click a random menu item, you can apply exactly the same principles as above, bearing in mind the hierarchy I laid out at the top.\nSo, after retrieving a random menu bar item, next determine the maximum number of menu items and generate a random number less than or equal to this maximum:\n    set M to count menu items of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n    set j to random number from 1 to M\n\nThen you can click it:\n    click menu item j of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n\nApplying the same principles to any sub-menus that exist for that particular menu item, you'll end up with this:\n    set L to count menu items of menu 1 of menu item j of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n    set k to random number from 1 to L\n    click menu item k of menu 1 of menu item j of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n\nHowever, you'll find that this—more often than not—will throw an error when trying to set L.  This is because not all menu items will have sub-menus, and in the instances where no sub-menu exists, asking AppleScript to count the number of menu items [in a non-existent sub-menu] is not a sensible command.\nThere are two ways to handle this.  Either wrap those lines in a try...end try error-catching block, like this:\n    try\n        set L to count menu items of menu 1 of menu item j of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n        set k to random number from 1 to L\n        click menu item k of menu 1 of menu item j of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n    end try\n\nor count the number of (sub-)menus of menu item j, and only proceed if this number is greater than 0:\n    count menus of menu item j of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n\n    if the result > 0 then\n        set L to count menu items of menu 1 of menu item j of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n        set k to random number from 1 to L\n        click menu item k of menu 1 of menu item j of menu 1 of menu bar item i of menu bar 1\n    end if\n\nAnd so on, and so on...\nFinally...\nIt's unlikely you will know precisely how many levels deep a particular menu tree goes: how many sub-menus within sub-menus exist for a particular menu item ?  The answer is at least 0, but with no given maximum unless you check in advance yourself.\nLuckily, we can AppleScript to do the checking for us.  After picking a random menu bar item, every child that spawns from this (looking at the hierarchy I showed you at the top) is a menu followed by a menu item.  The menu object, as you'll have noticed, only comes in singular count, so will always be referenced as menu 1.  The menu items come in plural, and these are the items that need counting.\nSo, quite simply, having chosen a random menu bar item, we get AppleScript to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*count the number of menu items it contains;\n\n*If this value is 0, then there are no sub-menus, so we can just click the item we have;\n\n*If the value is greater than 0, then choose a random one;\n\n*count the number of menu items this one contains;\n\n*If this value is 0, just click it;\n\n*If the value is greater than 0, then choose a random one;\n\n*etc..\n\nThis process is a loop that can keep going for as many sub-menus that it finds.  And that's what this code does:\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        tell (the first application process ¬\n            whose frontmost is true)\n            \n            set m to it\n            set _m to the menu bar items of menu bar 1\n            \n            repeat\n                if not (exists _m) then exit repeat\n                \n                set i to random number from 1 to (count _m)\n                \n                set m to item i of _m\n                set _m to a reference to menu items of menu 1 of m\n            end repeat\n            \n            click m\n            \n        end tell\n\nCaveat: The horizontal lines that separate sections of a menu are also classed as menu items, as are any menu items that are disabled.  These, when clicked, don't do anything.\n\nBE CAREFUL: Clicking a menu item randomly before you know what it does can result in some undesirable outcomes.  For instance, you may accidentally quit the front application; you may delete a file or eject a disk if the script runs whilst Finder is at the front; or you may log out or shut down your computer.\n", "Q: How to recover .cpp files emptied from Trash? About 4 days earlier I deleted my important c++ files along with other files on the desktop by mistake without even realizing and figured it out later.

It's urgent.\n\n\n*\n\n*Device : Macbook Air 2015 \n\n*OS : High Sierra 10.13 \n\n*Backups : none\n\n\nA: Your data is gone\nThe way the SSD deletes data is an immediate and permanent thing. This is why your recovery software won't succeed here.  It's so efficient and so secure, Apple removed srm from macOS\n\nBackups : none\n\nOuch.  Unfortunately, your solution would have been to restore from said backup.\nPersonally, I save all my documents, scripts (bash and AppleScript) to my Cloud drive (iCloud, OneDrive, etc.)  It's also backed up to a NAS and to Time Machine. With the low cost and availability of USB drives (flash, spinning and SSD) as well as the many options for cloud storage (both on prem and SaaS), a backup strategy should not be something that gets put on the back-burner because it's too complicated.\n\nA: Easy when you have TimeMachine: in Finder open the folder where you had these files before you deleted them. Then Enter TimeMachine and go back to just before you deleted them, then select and restore them.\nAs Alan explained, no chance with an SSD without having backups.\n\nA: When you delete files from the trash remnants will still exist in the free space on the drive. Unfortunately the longer you go without performing a data recovery the likelier your files become unrecoverable. The OS writes new data over old data in free space. If a deep scan didn’t find anything it is likely that your data no longer exists. \nIt is likely that the files are irretrievable at this point. I’d recommend frequent backups in the future: Time Machine is an excellent solution provided by Apple.

When you consider all the different browsers that exist multiplied by the the different versions of each browser, you begin to wonder how any web page can be written that works correctly in all cases.\nGenerally a good web designer uses tools where a page is designed using one version of a browser, then the page is submitted to software that modifies the page to work with each type of browser and each types older versions. When the web page is viewed conditionals can then be evaluated to correct for differences in browser types and versions.\nAlso, there are services that allow a web designer the opportunity to view a web page using one type of browser, but see how the page would appear using a different type of browser. Thus eliminating the need to have all the different types of browsers and versions, operating systems, computers, tables and phones available to test a web page.\nIn your case, either a mistake was made while testing this web page or instagram does not full test their web pages. In other words, this web page could be rewritten to use a differ positioning compatible with all browsers or have conditionals that would accommodate Safari.\n", "Q: How to save changes in a CSV file using Mac Numbers?

Sometimes apps stop responding to user events probably due to bugs or unexpected edge cases. But it's different from a crash because an app may stop responding for some time and then \"start responding\" again, for example Photoshop may get stuck when opening huge images because processing might take some time, but eventually it loads the image and continues working fine.\n\nAnd I am wondering, on the technical level, how the operating system detects such cases to offer the user an option to force quit the app.\n\nA: GUI programs on macOS (and most other graphical operating systems) work by having a main loop that empties a so called \"message queue\". Some times this is called a \"message pump\".\nMessages are put in the message queue by the operating system's windowing subsystem to tell the application about things that happened - for example \"the mouse was clicked at (x,y)\" or \"the window was resized to size (width,height)\". \nThe application then pulls these messages from the queue, processes them, and then waits for new messsages.\nIf the application for some reason isn't pulling these messages from the queue for a period of time, macOS will say that the application is not responding. This is all it is.\nMany GUI application split their execution in multiple \"threads\" - which can be thought of as a program streams executing at the same time. The main thread is responsible for the main message loop, whilst other threads can be responsible for network communication, disk I/O, background calculations, etc. However any changes to the graphical user interfaces that is managed by the operating system must go through the main thread.\nIf for some reason the main thread is busy doing something else than GUI work, then it could be marked as non-responding. This could be because the program is stuck in an infinite loop, or is in a deadlock waiting for some resource or similar. The program will never recover from this state, but the operating system can't know this.\nAnother reason for the main thread to be busy could be that it is saving a large file, waiting for communication on the network, or doing a large calculation. After that is done, the program will start pulling messages from the queue again, and will be responding again. Usually programmers do a lot of work to ensure that nothing like that happens on the main thread to ensure that the program is responsive at all times.\n", "Q: Where to set AT commands for modem?

Verify for your machine.\nUsing Minicom\nMinicom is a small, free communications program that's been around for decades and is quite solid.  I personally prefer it over screen.\n\n*\n\n*Homebrew:  brew install minicom\n\n*MacPorts:  port install minicom\nThis assumes you've already installed the Homebrew or MacPorts software.\nIt's a simple ANSI graphic interface that will allow you to set your serial device, flow control, port speed etc.\n\nOnce you have it set, you will be connected to the device on your serial port you can then send your AT commands to your modem by typing AT+CBST=71,0,1\n\nUsing Screen\nYou can use the built in screen to issue the commands (though admittedly, I am not very familiar with the utility as I favor Minicom)\nYou can connect to your device by issuing the command (assuming your modem/serial port is configured to 115200bps, 8 data bits, no parity bit and 1 stop bit or more commonly known \"115200 8N1\"):\nscreen /dev/ttySX 115200,cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl\n\nWhere /dev/ttySX is the serial device connected to your modem as before.  This example sets the comport to 15200 8N1.\nAnd just like in the Minicom example, once connected, just send your AT commands to the modem.\n\nA: An easy method using the graphical user interface instead of a Terminal-based program such as minicom, is to use the program \"Serial\"1 from the Mac App Store. You can try it for free, which is probably enough for you to a one time initialization like you indicate.\nThe program makes it easy for you by having a graphical user interface, where you are presented with a list of serial devices, so that you do not have to figure out which /dev/ device node your USB device is attached to.\nAnother option is CuteCom2 which is also graphical, but much more bare bones. However it is also free.\n", "Q: Macbook Air - old battery charges, replacement battery does not Apologies if this is a duplicate, but I have searched and not found anyone with the specific problem I'm experiencing.\nMy MacBook Air (A1466, Mid 2012) has a third party battery that is nearing the end of its life. It has about 250 cycles, but can only power the computer for about 30 minutes.\nI have bought 2 second hand official Apple batteries from different eBay sellers.

Surely I can't have bought 2 separate dud batteries? Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated.\n\nA: The comments are correct: despite buying 2 different batteries from eBay sellers with good reputations, both were faulty. I bought a new battery from iFixit, which works fine. \nLesson learned: don't buy batteries on eBay.\n", "Q: formatting external drive multiplatform compatible filesystem from macOS High Sierra I have a 160GB external hard drive connected via USB I pulled it from a windows pc to MacBook running MacOS High Sierra, I want to format the hard drive to a file system that should work with Windows, MacOS and Linux operating system.\nThe hard drive is currently NTFS formatted, into 3 partition which I want to get rid of and just keep single partition.\nI am just going to backup my media , doc, zips and tars \nAny Help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Are there any data on the 160GB external?

I like to use my MacBook with a USB mouse most of the time, and keep \"Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present\" option checked to avoid accidentally moving the cursor while typing. However, occasionally it's useful to switch it back on for certain tasks, and I'd like to be able to do this with a keyboard shortcut.\nI've tried recording the process of switching it on/off with Automator, but when I copy the resulting script and run it, it gets as far as the Accessibility settings and then gives me a syntax error saying 'Can not click checkbox 3 of window \"Accessibility\" of application process \"System Preferences\"'.\nI've also tried setting \"USBMouseStopsTrackpad\" in defaults to 0 and 1 in the terminal, but it doesn't seem to do anything. I can see this changing to 0 or 1 when I check/uncheck the box, so I'm fairly certain I've got the right option, but nothing happens when I change it.\nApologies if this is really obvious and I'm just not seeing it! I'm still not too familiar with this machine. I'm aware of this question:\nIs it possible to switch off the trackpad in OS X with a keyboard shortcut\nbut I don't think it's a duplicate as I'm trying to do something slightly different.\n\nA: This can be done natively with no third-party anything needed, simply and easily using AppleScript and UI Scripting.\nThe example AppleScript code can be implemented in a number of different ways, as a script, an AppleScript application, or as an Automator service , the latter of which can have a keyboard shortcut assigned to it.\nSpecifically how to implement as an Automator service has been covered more then enough times that a Google search should provide an answer on how to do that. I know I written directions for it more times than I can remember.\nThe following example AppleScript code works for me and toggles the \"Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present:\" check box:\nif running of application \"System Preferences\" then\n    try\n        tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit\n    on error\n        do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\"\n    end try\nend if\nrepeat while running of application \"System Preferences\" is true\n    delay 0.1\nend repeat\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"Mouse\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n    delay 1\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        click checkbox 1 of group 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the value of the delay commands may need to be adjusted for your system, and or additional delay commands may or may not be needed. Adjust values of and or add/remove the delay commands as appropriate. \n\n*This was tested and works under macOS High Sierra; however, note that depending on the version of OS X/macOS you're running, the click checkbox ... line of code may need to be adjusted depending on the version of the OS.\nFor example, with macOS Catalina you'd need to use: \nclick checkbox 2 of tab group 1 of group 1 of window 1 of application process \"System Preferences\"\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n\nA: Macroing this is a bit janky, but it's totally doable.\nI'd recommend using Keyboard Maestro for this. It's sort of like Automator.... Not free, but it does have a trial and it's definitely worth it. You could do this same thing in Automator or Applescript too, but it's way simpler in KBM.\nKBM has some great Actions when it comes to navigating gui:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pause Until\n\n\n*\n\n*The Pause Until action pauses until criteria for conditions are met.\n\n\n*Press a Button\n\n\n*\n\n*The Press a Button action presses a named button in the front window.\n\n\n*Select or Show a Menu Item\n\n\n*\n\n*The Select or Show a Menu Item action selects a menu item OR shows (opens) a menu in the main menubar.\n\n\n*Insert Text by Typing\n\n\n*\n\n*The Insert Text by Typing action converts plain (simple) text into keystrokes and then types each of them individually. It only works with characters that can be typed on the keyboard with one or two keystrokes (eg Option-e e usually types é, and Keyboard Maestro can duplicate that typing).\n\n\n*Type a Keystroke\n\n\n*\n\n*The Type Keystroke action lets you type a single keystroke, pretty much any kind of keystroke you can type on the keyboard.\n\n\n*Move or Click Mouse\n\n\n*\n\n*The Move or Click Mouse action allows you to move, click or move and click the mouse using any mouse button, and optionally dragging.\n\n*This is a relatively small thing, but I think it's great that it can restore the mouse location after the action is completed. That option is a bit hidden though.\n\n\n\nThe steps to produce the action along with light explanations:\nPicture of the macro steps (Link)\nNot the fastest macro ever (~3seconds), but sure beats diving into the menus manually.\nAs you are making this macro, make sure to run the unfinished macro after every step to make sure everything is exactly as they should be.\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Action name: Activate a Specific Application\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate: System Preferences\n\n*\nOpens up System Preferences\n\n\n\n*Action name: Pause Until\n\n\n*\n\n*New Condition: Menu Condition\n\n*A menu item: with this name Accessibility is enabled\n\n*\nThis more or less makes sure the window is active and Accessibility is a menu item you can navigate to.\n\n\n\n*Action name: Move a Window\n\n\n*\n\n*Move to: →0 ↓ 0\n\n*\nThis makes sure that the preferences window is in your main screen. It's only important because if at any point you manually drag the window to your secondary screen, all the actions that rely on coordinates would fail without this and the next 'Move a Window action'. \n\n\n\n*Action name: Select or Show a Menu Item\n\n\n*\n\n*Select menu in: System Preferences\n\n*Menu Title: View\n\n*Menu Item Accessibility\n\n*\nYou can also just click Menu ▾ on the top left of this action to choose the menu item from there, as long as System Preferences is open. That makes it super easy to simulate clicking any menu item.\n\n\n\n*Action Name: Pause\n\n\n*\n\n*Pause for : 1 seconds.\n\n*\nThis is a bit of a mystery. I wanted to use pause until window title is 'Accessibility', which works if you go to the Accessibility page in System Preferences and check the action. KBM says the value is true when you're there. However, it kept failing when I actually ran the macro. I also tried the 'Pause Until Pixel Condition’ and that failed as well I guess the condition became true before any interaction was possible… The point of using the 'Pause Until' action is to make sure that whatever we want to do next actually triggers at the right moment. When you use a static pause or no pause at all, there is a chance that it occasionally takes longer than usual and the simulated keypress just goes into the ether and the macro gets stuck or worst case scenario: it actually does something totally different, like sends a missile warning alert to all Hawaiians or something. The few spots where I used a static pause should be fine since they are all in the same page of the same window so there shouldn't be any weird issues brought on by those, but if it doesn't do what it's supposed to do: increase the static delay. You may also want to add 'Pause' between some of the other actions that are not separated by a delay, if it doesn't seem to work. Slower machines typically require bigger delay.\n\n\n\n*Action Name: Type a Keystroke\n\n\n*\n\n*Simulate keystroke: Cmd+F\n\n*Click the Simulate keystroke input and press the shortcut keys.\n\n*\nIf this window is already active, this sort of defaults the position to the search so the next keystroke goes to the right place\n\n\n\n*Action name: Move a Window\n\n\n*\n\n*Change Move to to Center\n\n*\nThis makes sure all the actions using coordinates hit the right spots.\n\n\n\n*Action Name: Type a Keystroke\n\n\n*\n\n*Simulate keystroke: Tab\n\n*You can select it from the dropdown list or type it in.\n\n*\nActivates the list on the left side of System Preferences > Accessibility window.\n\n\n\n*Action Name: Pause Until\n\n\n*\n\n*New Condition: Pixel Condition\n\n*Click the Get \n\n\n*\n\n*It'll give you 5 seconds to position your mouse on top of the color. \n\n*Make the window active and hover your mouse anywhere on top of the blue edge to get that color\n\n*\n\n\n*\nThis just makes sure the next action is triggered at the right time.\n\n\n\n*Action Name: Type a Keystroke\n\n\n*\n\n*Simulate keystroke: End\n\n*You can select it from the dropdown list or type it in.\n\n*\nActivates the list on the left side of System Preferences > Accessibility window.\n\n\n\n*Action Name: Type a Keystroke\n\n\n*\n\n*Simulate keystroke: Alt+Down Arrow\n\n*Click the Simulate keystroke input and press the shortcut keys.\n\n*This menu on the left can retain the last visited item next time you open it, so we do this just to make sure the first item is selected or else the next pause until could fail occasionally.\n\n\n*Action Name: Pause Until\n\n\n*\n\n*New Condition: Pixel Condition\n\n*Again the same thing as with the last Pause Until → Pixel Condition.

In my testing however, it seems that when an Always-On VPN is loaded onto the iPhone, all of the other VPNs disappear from Settings and cannot be enabled.

It is the same programs - and not a special \"Apple made\" version of Apache/PHP.\nHowever if you want to customize the setup a lot by installing new modules, you will find that this is much easier with homebrew, as some of the files often necessary to build new modules have been removed with the High Sierra release.\nAlso if you want to be able to choose a specific Apache/PHP version rather than the default, then homebrew will allow you that.\n", "Q: Does an Apple TV stream 4K movies if the Internet connection is somewhat less than the recommended 25Mbps? This is to decide whether to buy an AppleTV 4K or not:\nFor example, some areas may have an 18 to 22Mbps Internet connection, and is just about 10% to 20% lower than the official recommended 25Mbps.\nAnd since the 4K movie cannot be downloaded but can only be streamed, and will be \"downgraded\" to the next lower resolution (from 4K to 1080p), will a connection of 18 to 22Mbps be able to stream a 4K movie?\nSome factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it is not an action movie, it may not require 25Mbps.\n\n*If it is 22Mbps, it is about 10% less than the recommended 25Mbps, so if Apple TV can buffer up 10% of the movie: 9 minutes of it out of a 90 minute movie, then mathematically, the whole movie will play till the end smoothly if the user is willing to wait for 9 minutes of start time, or even a 4.5 minute initial wait plus a middle intermission restroom break of another 4.5 minutes, instead of not being able to see it in 4K at all.\n\n\nA: Yes, you can stream 4k movies on the Apple TV 4k with a somewhat less than the recommended 25 Mbps internet connection.\nIn practice the available bandwidth for streaming the movie should not drop 15 Mbps to ensure 4k streaming. So real life experience depends a lot on what else you're using your 22 Mbps internet connection for at the same time.\nHow exactly the streaming quality is determined depends on the app you're using to view the movie. For example Netflix allows you to lock the quality setting to High, but you might experience lots of waits for rebuffering during the movie, if your internet connection is too slow.\nIf the movie is streamed from the iTunes Movies and TV Shows app, you can adjust the quality in the general AppleTV settings in the menu Settings > Apps > iTunes Movies and TV Shows.\nFrom this menu you can disable \"QuickStart\". This means that you'll have a wait before the movie starts playing, but it will display in the best available quality even on a slow internet connection.\n", "Q: How do I change the location of the Music folder on macOS?

A non-technical user has no chance of understanding what to do with the SQLite file even if they do manage to find a tool that will open the file.\nYour best bet is to restore the folder specified above from the regular backups you make of your computer either via Time Machine or another backup program, as per the article at the link above.\nIf you don't have a backup you have just learned a valuable lesson, \"Backups are a pain and require me to buy a backup drive.\" But the moment you lose data and do not have a backup you realize you should have shelled out the bucks and dedicated the time to doing regular backups, IMHO.\nIf the Outlook database is corrupt the chances of getting anything usable out of it is slim.\n\nA: OLK15message files are a separate backup scheme that Outlook mac used to store its database. As far as your recovery query is concerned, I don't think that it's possible to recover OLK15message files without a third party tool. \nHowever, you can rebuild your identity folder, which will give you all your email database back in your mailbox.\n", "Q: How is the UUID for a user used by macOS? In the Advanced Options for a user under the Users & Groups System Preference, there is field for UUID and a button for Create New next to it. How is the UUID used by macOS and what are the implications of changing it?\n\nA: The UUID (aka GeneratedUID, so Google that one instead) is used by Open Directory Services on macOS X. You can see this and more using the macOS app Directory Utility. Read more the book Apple Training Series: Mac OS X Directory Services.\nOwnership and Permissions problems would result from a change of UUID. Not just regarding files and folders, but other data such as that in Calendar.\nPS: I no longer see the Create New button in High Sierra. \n\nA: Sounds like main consequence of changing UUID is messing up Open Directory. As Matt noted it's not changeable in High Sierra and later.\nIf you want to see more interesting aspects of Open Directory management, start up \"Directory Utility\" on macOS and browse Name-Value pairs for your macOS account. You'll set the GeneratedUID there and you can copy/paste it.I think you can even edit it in Directory Utility even under Mojave, but I have no intention of testing that.\n", "Q: Dock-less monitor solutions I would like to construct a desktop-like solution for someone who is not terribly computer-savvy by allowing her 2011 MBAir to connect to an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse. I've looked at various docking stations, but none of them appear to power the computer itself (at least I haven't found one), which means it would separately have to be connected to external power (note: this is a Thunderbolt 2 computer). So I've been thinking about just doing this without a docking station, since it isn't obvious that a docking station would make for less work.\nThe idea would be to just buy a monitor, bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse. Is it the case that once all of these are configured, my wife could just walk up to the desk, plug in the monitor (and computer power if desired), and start to use the external devices for input? If so, can the laptop be closed during that time?\n\nA: It's called clamshell mode and it's supported by the macOS. \nHere's the Apple website about it\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure that your Mac notebook is plugged in to an outlet using the AC power adapter.\n  \n*Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to your Mac.\n  \n*With your Mac turned on and the display open, connect the Mac to the appropriate port on the external display or projector and turn the display or projector on. Use an appropriate Apple video adapter if necessary.\n  \n*After your Mac notebook's Desktop appears on the external display, close the computer's lid.\n  When you close the lid: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In OS X Lion 10.7 and later, the external display changes to a blue screen, then shows your Desktop.\n  \n*In OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard and earlier, you can wake your Mac by clicking the mouse button or pressing a key on the external keyboard.\n  \n  \n*You can now use your Mac notebook as you normally would with a USB keyboard and mouse.\n  \n\n\nA: I do this, using a OWC Thunderbolt 2 Dock and external, wired Apple keyboard, wireless Magic Mouse and old Apple Cinema Display (using an MDP or HDMI to DVI adapter). It doesn’t power the computer, but it provides extra Thunderbolt, USB3 and HDMI, Ethernet ports that I can leave drives/peripherals connected to. The laptop is closed in clamshell mode and tapping any of the keyboard, monitor power switch, or Magic Mouse will wake the computer up.\nThis method requires only the power and one thunderbolt cable be connected to the laptop. Everything is connected to the OWC Dock. When I want to undock, I put the laptop to sleep and pull Power and Thunderbolt cables from it. The way I have things set up means that external drives are automatically unmounted. If you do not have any external drives that simplifies things a fair bit.\nThere are other brands of docks, and there’s also the (discontinued) Apple Thunderbolt Display that is a neater, all-in-one solution but is quite a bit more expensive.\n\nPreviously, I tried a Henge Dock but that was overly fiddly and\n  basically required an extra, expensive PSU to be connected to it\n  permanently.\n\n", "Q: /usr/bin/open executable disappeared I am on macOS High Sierra (Version 10.13.3) all recent updates are installed.\nThe open executable is not in the /usr/bin folder anymore.\nIs there anyway to repair the system so that I can get it again?\nI have no clue how this happened in the first place, maybe after the last macOS update. Did I miss something in their release notes? \nTo clarify, this is not a path issue, the executable just is not there anymore.\n\nA: Since SIP was disabled there is a high chance this was a user error on my side like the comments suggested. I did not want to do a complete reinstall due to all the hassle that would ensue.\nThis problem ended up getting fixed by itself when the next macOS update was released. After installing the update the open executable was back at its original place.\nHope this helps people encountering a similar issue.\n", "Q: Why does touch bar sometimes ignore first touch? Every once in awhile the touch bar registers, reacts by highlighting the virtual button pressed, but ignores the actual button press on my touch bar. This is most noticeable on the lock screen button I’ve added. \nTouching it a second time always works fine, as if the touch bar has now gotten focus. \nHas anyone else experienced this, fixed it, or been able to reproduce it consistently enough to file a bug report?\n\nA: This has been an issue since precisely macOS High Sierra beta 3. In the release notes for this pre-release update1, ‘heuristics’ were updated with regard to preventing accidental Touch Bar inputs.\nSince that update, pressing the Touch Bar too soon after another keyboard input too close to the Touch Bar will invalidate the Touch Bar press. The key will illuminate but only very briefly and the input will not pass. It is then necessary to press the key again for it to go through. Notice the difference between q-esc and 1-esc.\n\nAccording to event viewer I observed while recording that video,\n\n\n*\n\n*4 of the 5 q-esc presses passed through the esc\n(the last press I slightly missed the activation area of esc, which was something else mentioned in the release notes: the activation areas were reduced in from the edges), and\n\n*0 out of 5 1-esc presses passed through the esc.\n\n\nI installed macOS updates on my external disk first and I could instantly replicate this issue when using beta 3 and had no problem with beta 2.\nI filed a radar per the instructions given in the release notes for anyone who had feedback for this change, with my view of the problem this change made for people who are more accurate with their Touch Bar key presses. Unfortunately, this radar was closed as won't be fixed.\nIt is my impression this delay is a feature: part of the remedy for people who provide spurious inputs to the Touch Bar, which was something complained about constantly on virtually all the reviews I read and watched, yet not something I've ever experienced myself.\n1 Even though High Sierra is released, I am unsure as to whether the release notes for pre-release versions of macOS can be reproduced here for those who are not part of the developer programme.\n", "Q: How do I mirror/copy/save a harddrive from an old macbook that has an account in a logged-in state? I have an old macbook that I wish to keep all the data from the drive as it currently exists - in the state that it is presently, exactly. Why does this matter? Because the laptop, when suspended and the battery drains, will retain that state upon restoration of power ... and the account is super old - and I don't know the password. I'd like to upgrade the laptop to newer RAM and maybe an SSD, but I have to keep the old hard drive with state and everything intact (to save session, login, etc.).\nI'm concerned that if I pull the hard drive, something will result in the drive getting corrupted, or the login state getting corrupted, and I'll lose everything. Ideally, I could clone the drive to an external hard drive, including power-state, and boot using target-disk mode. Copying the data will be an option eventually, but I have software on that computer that only runs on that computer. (If I were to upgrade, I'd have to re-buy licensing, etc.)\nAgain, this is important because I don't know the password - the laptop is from 2008 (I think), and I've lost data from old macs before (mini and iMac) when I did the 'change the password for this user' trick, which resulted in losing the keychain access (login keychain saved with different password), and loss of data access.\nI'm not opposed to using John (the Ripper) to recover the password. (It's my laptop, after all, and I can let the recover run for days or even weeks without being concerned about it ... it would actually be quite nice, since then I could just change my password to something recent I'll actually remember!) But I've only ever heard of that program in passing, and I don't know how to prepare a mac for its use.\nUPDATE:\nAfter extracting the hard drive and attempting to boot with it as an externally-attached drive, I received a hardware-level error that I \"must reboot the computer\". This does not bode well. I'm hoping that by hard-powering-down the computer I haven't corrupted the hard drive image of the logged-in session. I'm now attempting to copy the disk info to another external disk using the Restore function in Disk Utility, as suggested by in a referred answer...\n\nA: The real problem here is macOS isn’t designed to save run state to the hard drive in a persistent state. Hibernate mode doesn’t expect to be relocated on a different memory and does expect to power down completely and add RAM when the os is not suspended or hibernating. \nWhat you ask is trivially possible if you were running in a hypervisor such as VMWare fusion and could suspend and change the hardware from under the os due to a layer of abstraction. You’ll need an admin password to move forward, so that’s well documented. \nMake a new admin or follow the password reset procedure. Deal with lost keychain and make sure FileVault isn’t enabled before you decide to reset the password and move on is my advice. The OS isn’t designed to support what you contemplate. \n", "Q: Prevent turning off the display when MacBook is physically dropped I own a 2015 MacBook Pro.\nIf you accidentally drop your MacBook, or it slips from your lap, the screen automatically turns off, and the device is locked. I could not find documentation on this feature online.\nRecently, after some recent software update, I notice that this feature has been triggered a lot more frequently. In fact, it tends to be triggered when I am just normally holding my MacBook on my lap, and the device isn't falling at all. Sometimes, it is even triggered on a table if I place the laptop on top of the carrying sleeve (which isn't completely flat).\nWhen it is triggered, I have significant difficulty getting it to turn back on. Usually, I have to raise it completely, and then unlock it. Sometimes, it just goes straight back to the black screen as I am typing my password in.\nI am not sure if this is a feature or a bug at this point. Are there are ways to disable the turning off display feature on dropping completely?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I think you are referring to\n\nDisable the Sudden Motion Sensor to avoid the harddrive heads parking them due to loud noise in a club.\nTo check if Sudden Motion Sensor is activated, use the following\ncommand and look for the sms setting (1 = enabled) :\n# sudo pmset -g\nTo disable Sudden Motion Sensor, use the following command :\n# sudo pmset -a sms 0\nTo enable Sudden Motion Sensor, use the following command :\n# sudo pmset -a sms 1\nFrom http://rc.vc/files/traktor/optimizing_macbook_for_traktor.txt\n\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/547298/macbook-screen-switch-off-when-moved\nor possibly\nScreen turns off when I move my MacBook when it is on the sleeve\n", "Q: WiFi keeps searching and icon issue I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) with MacOS Sierra.\nMy issue is that the WiFi keeps searching indefinitely, even when I'm stably connected to my home network. My house is quite isolated so my hotspot is the only one in range.\nIn addition the icons don't reflect the actual signal strength (when choosing the network), and the one in the top bar is constantly animated as if during the connection phase.\nI have no idea how to solve this. What can I do?\nEDIT: this is specific to this device, all the other devices I own have no issues connecting. Also I want to specify that connection is not the issue, meaning that I can browse internet just fine and even use ssh as if nothing was wrong.\nWiFi Diagnostic tool highlights no issues with the connection (as expected as I'm not seeing any).\nI performed all the operations listed in the Apple support page, which frankly seem supremely useless, and nothing changed.\n\nA: If it's just the icon giving you issues, not the connection, then try removing the icon from the menu bar, restarting your machine, and then putting it back. \nTo remove the \"Wifi Status\" menu bar icon, drag it out of the menu bar while holding the command key.\nRestart your machine. To put the icon back, go to System Preferences > Network > Show Wifi Status in Menu Bar.\n\nIf this doesn't work, then reset your Network interface, which will erase your previous configuration and set it back to default. \n", "Q: How to know the macOS version used for most recent clean install? Is there a way to know which macOS or OS X version was initially \"clean-installed\" on a particular Mac computer? (Assuming major or minor OS updates may have been installed later.)\nPlease note that I don't want to know which OS version originally shipped with the Mac (in brand new condition), as MacTracker has already that info. I'd just like to know which OS version was used the last time someone made a clean install, reformatted the drive, etc.\n\nA: I've Looked for clues in /Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist\nOn a few computers I checked, they typically start with a \"com.apple.pkg.OSInstall\" package. It doesn't mention OS version, but scrolling down to most recently applied OS updates, and it may become clear what the OS version was by the updates.\nBTW, all bets are off if the drive was cloned from another computer.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 2013 that struggles to power a third USB 3.0 self-powered hard drive We have a Mac Pro 2013 that struggles to power a third USB 3.0 self-powered hard drive, that is: you can connect two self-powered USB 3.0 drives, but won’t detect a third one (it won’t appear in Finder or disk utility).  I doesn’t matter in which order you connect the drives, whichever you connect the third, won’t be detected.\nApple has already replaced the logic board and the I/O board (that is, the panel that includes all the ports) but the issue is still there.  Isn’t the Mac Pro supposed to power up to 4 USB 3.0 drives?\n\nA: \nIsn’t the Mac Pro supposed to power up to 4 USB 3.0 drives?\n\nIt depends.\nThe specification for USB 3.0 is 5V and 900mA per bus.   A spinning hard disk has a power requirement of about 1.8W (5V at approx. 350mA)*.   That's just for the drive not counting the enclosure power requirements.  4 drives would mean  1400mA or 1.4A which is well above the available power supplied.\nIf you want to drive 4 USB drives, you want to get a USB hub with a power supply capable of supplying enough power (i.e. a USB hub with a 3A power supply)\n\n* Specifications for a WD Black 2.5\" 1TB HDD internal drive; USB drive wasn't used due to lack of power requirements noted. \n\nA: Thanks for your answer. \nWe still need to clarify why this is happening.\nAny USB controller shares its bandwidth among its ports, but should provide the full power of the USB specification to each port.\nThis isn’t mentioned in the Wikipedia article for USB, but Scott Mueller mentions it in Upgrading and Repairing PCs:\nRoot hubs and self-powered hubs (hubs connected to an AC adapter) provide a full 500mA of power to each USB port.  Root hubs are the USB hubs on motherboards.\nI guess this applies to USB 3.0 too, which should provide 5v/900mA to each port.\nI checked this by connecting a SATA 3 SSD, an iPhone and a Keyboard and mouse to the USB ports on my Mac Mini: then checked the system profiler > Hardware > USB section and I could see that 900mA are available for the SSD, 500mA to the Keyboard, 500mA to the iPhone…\nConnecting several USB drives to any computer can potentially bottleneck the ports (data-wise) if the USB ports are connected to a single USB controller.  That is why some motherboards feature more than 1 USB controller, so that its USB ports may provide the fullest possible USB bandwidth.\nUnfortunately, this is not the case with the Mac Pro 2013, which has a single USB controller for its 4 USB 3.0 ports.  Any attached devices should get the full 900mA/5volt power but share the data bandwidth.\nThis is dealt with in this article:\nhttps://macperformanceguide.com/MacPro2013-USB3-performance-limitations.html\n\nMac Pro 2013 diagram\nAccording to this article, attaching 3 drives may slow them down, but should not prevent them from being detected.\n", "Q: AppleScript to Resize Finder Columns Weary of the Finder's sloppy, semi-legible sizing of list view columns, I'm attempting to code an AppleScript solution. Omissions and bugs in the Finder's dictionary make this (to indulge in understatement) challenging.  The goal is to have any window display a minimalist list view with a single keystroke, with all columns set to the minimum width that avoids truncation and the window itself sized to its content.  Something along these lines…\n\nThe primary difficulties I've encountered so far are in the column class of list view options of Finder window.\n\n\n*\n\n*visible doesn't accurately reflect the columns' actual state\n\n*setting visible has no effect\n\n*width can be read but setting it has no effect\n\n\nNor does it help that the Finder's zoom button hasn't done anything sane or useful since cell phones were the size of a shoebox.\nHas anyone attempted a similar project or one that overcame any of the difficulties noted above?

It works (for me) in macOS 10.11.6 and 10.12.6.\nThe key is recognize that you don't \"set the width of the name column of window 1.\" Rather, you \"set the width of the name column of the list view options of window 1.\" That's pseudo-code but it tells the story. See the script for details.\n", "Q: AppleScript: How to add m4a meta-data using Sound Studio? I'd like to automate the adding of metadata to various .m4a files using Sound Studio.  I have a Python script that will run thru all the files I care about and pass along useful data to an AppleScript that can actually manipulate the metadata.  But I'm not sure what the best way is to actually do the metadata manipulation in AppleScript.\nI can get all the metadata into the AppleScript script by passing the items into the script via arguments, but I don't know how to open the file and set the metadata items I want to set.  Seems like it should be easy but all the attempts I've made so far have failed.  I'm sure I'm not understanding the correct way to approach the problem.

The AppleScript dictionary was all that was required.  With the exception of the open command, all other information needed to compose the script came from the documentation within Script Editor.\nThe absence of an entry for the open command is a bit mysterious and I have emailed them about it.  I also did notice a \"bug\"(?) in the software in the manner in which it responds to open, although it technically can't be classified as a bug given that it's not documented as being a command that's supported.  However, the only other command that would be used for opening files and creating new documents would be the make command, but, having played around with that, I'm fairly confident that open is the correct command to use, and they just failed to document it properly, whilst also overlooking its occasionally erratic behaviour.\nAnyway, here's the script, with my test file data taking the place of what will be sent through to the script from your Python script:\n    # Script:   Add Metadata To Sound Studio File.applescript\n    # Author:   CJK\n    # Date:     2018-03-20\n    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # @arguments:\n    #       %argv%      an indexed list containing 7 items:\n    #  \n    #           1) full path to the file to open\n    #           2) name of artist\n    #           3) name of the album\n    #           4) just the name of the track\n    #           5) which disc (1, 2 ...)\n    #           6) which track on the disc\n    #           7) the year when the track was released\n    #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    set argv to [¬\n        \"/Users/CK/Music/Nelly Furtado/Folklore/04 Try.m4a\", ¬\n        \"Nelly Furtado\", ¬\n        \"Folklore\", ¬\n        \"Try\", ¬\n        \"1\", ¬\n        \"4\", ¬\n        \"2003\"] -- remove this variable declaration\n\n    # on run argv -- uncomment this handler\n\n        if (count argv) is not 7 then return display dialog ¬\n            \"Wrong number of arguments!\" with title ¬\n            \"Add Metadata To Sound Studio File\" buttons ¬\n            {\"Bummer\"} giving up after 1\n\n\n        tell application \"Sound Studio\"\n            activate\n\n            set music_file_path to the first item of argv\n\n            set D to open (music_file_path as POSIX file)\n\n            tell the metadata of D to set [¬\n                artist, ¬\n                album, ¬\n                title, ¬\n                disc number, ¬\n                track number, ¬\n                year] to the rest of argv\n\n            save D\n            close D\n\n            --quit\n        end tell\n\n    # end run -- uncomment this line\n    #----------------------------------------------------------------------------END\n\nThere's not a huge amount to say about the script: it opens Sound Studio, opens an audio file, assigns some values to the metadata properties, saves the file, then closes the file.  Optionally, you can quit the application at this point as well.\nRegarding the opening of the audio file, Sound Studio seems content to be given a POSIX file reference rather than having to coerce it into alias class.  However, I did notice a couple of oddities:\n❶・When I tried to define the variable music_file_path outside of the tell block, it behaved as you mentioned and simply didn't open the file, but also didn't return an error.  The script stalled until it timed out.\n❷・It also didn't like me expressing the file reference as POSIX file music_file_path, so I had to write it as music_file_path as POSIX file.  Again, it would stall the script, rather than complaining that the file reference was wrong.\n❸・If I corrected both of these issues and tried to run the script straight after a previous run had stalled it, the script would stall once again.  So I had to kill the Sound Studio process from Terminal by issuing a killall \"Sound Studio\".  Then when I ran the script, it worked quite happily, and continued to work happily with each successive run after run.  When I went to screw with the script again to purposely cause a stall, it wasn't surprising that I once again had to go back into Terminal to do a killall.\nSo I think it's fairly safe to say that this is an issue with Sound Studio and not with the script.  I've emailed them about it, but I think you wouldn't be wrong to email them as well: the more reports they receive from disgruntled customers who want AppleScripting technology to be properly implemented and supported, the more incentive they'll have to do so.\nI did consider putting a clause in the AppleScript for it to issue its own shell command when it detects that the application had stalled trying to open a file.  The AppleScript could do a killall, but that didn't sit very well with me for some reason.  The Sound Studio application itself didn't stall, and continued to be operational during testing.\nIf you do want me to put some sort of block in the script to handle any instances where it might stall, let me know and I can add an edit.

It doesn't matter if I connect it via DisplayPort to a dock or into a TB2 port on an external device, it still prevents 4K@60Hz.

There may be a timing issue with the display discovery and this 4K display where the computer doesn't always think it has 60Hz available, but then, during the commotion, since the TV is already listening, the timing is better. But that's just a guess.\n\nA: If you check \"Show low resolution modes\" that is what exposed the 60hz setting for me on my macbook pro touchbar.  \nMy remaining issue is that only 1080 or 4k native would run 60hz, so I can't find a happy medium with scaling because it drops back to 30hz. I suppose it's a Mac + HDMI issue, and likely why you have to pay up for an actual \"monitor\" to get DisplayPort inputs.\nGood luck!\nWes\n\nA: RDM is a nice menu bar item which allows you to control these properties.\nhttps://github.com/avibrazil/RDM\n", "Q: How to type in Chinese pinyin tones on Dvorak keyboard on macOS?

I can successfully pair the two devices, at which point the on-screen virtual keyboard disappears from text entry scenarios, so clearly the phone is expecting input from the keyboard.  However, when I type, no keystrokes are received by the phone.\nIf I turn off the phone and turn on again the keyboard works as expected.  Can anyone suggest a more elegant way of establishing the connection or maybe settings that might be interfering with the bluetooth functionality?  Wifi maybe?  This only seems to happen when I'm connected to a public (relatively slow) wifi.\n\nA: Given that your iPhone and keyboard connect and work just fine when the iPhone is connected to non-public WiFi networks, most likely the public WiFi networks are using frequencies that interfere with the Bluetooth in the keyboard. I would guess that by powering cycling your iPhone, it renegotiates the Bluetooth frequencies with the keyboard which do not interfere. Other factors at work may be microwave ovens, wireless speakers, Dish satellite systems, power sources, badly shielded cables & wires, and a host of other causes. Apple has a great rundown of things that can cause interference. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT20154\nWe live in a world saturated with radio and microwave radiation.

I often find macOS's endlessly repeating \"I want your attention\" dock bounce animation irritating, so I disabled it with the command defaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE , followed by killall Dock.\nI'd still like a visual cue when an app needs my attention, just a subtler one. Can the bouncing animation be replaced with a repeating toggle between the normal and translucent appearances of an dock icon, or some other low-distraction animation?\nNOTE: The translucent dock icon appearance applies when an app is hidden. It can be enabled with defaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool TRUE. To be clear, if I can replace the animation as suggested above, I don't want apps to be repeatedly hidden and shown while the animation is playing. That is what I assume would happen if, as would seem logical, the translucency adjustment controlled by com.apple.Dock showhidden can't be set independently of the actual hidden/visible status of the corresponding application.\n\nA: With regard to the ‘endlessly repeating’, you don't need to activate the app or otherwise deal with the issue being notified to you with the bounce.\nInstead, move your mouse over the bouncing icon in the Dock.

No matter how much I delete, my storage registers as completely full I have an iPhone 5C.\nThis is a complicated problem, ish, so I'll use bullet points:\n-My iPhone says that it has a hard storage limit of 5 gigs, roughly. It's actually like 4.98 and it says I have zero KB left available for whatever reason, but that's a small discrepancy. When I plug my iPhone into my desktop and boot up iTunes, for whatever reason, iTunes also says 4.84 whatever, but my phone is tagged elsewhere consistently as being an 8 gig phone. I have no idea which it actually is, because of this. But let's benefit of the doubt for now. 5 gigs.\n-So at one point, I had almost 2,000 photos, and my phone wouldn't let me take photos anymore because of this. \"Your storage is full.\" I was surprised, because I don't have a lot of other apps on my phone. I have maybe three third party apps that I use consistently, being GroupMe, Snapchat, and a tuner. I'd repeat this process, getting to 2,000, deleting some, going back. Etc. So if 2,000 is the limit, and a picture is 3MB roughly...that's 6000MB. SIX gigs. As I only have a five gigabyte phone, I have no idea how that even works. I had to rework the math in my head just now because that obviously is impossible if I only have a five gig phone.\n-So then I said \"I wonder if I can just take a photo with snapchat instead, and save it to my camera roll from there?\" I did just that. For 2,000 more photos. Sue me, it worked, and my phone clearly wasn't at actual capacity, because it was letting me do it. To bolster that argument, there were a few times that SC actually wouldn't let me save photos anymore because IT said my storage was full, at which point I deleted. So I don't think I was somehow pushing the phone past capacity, which shouldn't even be possible.\n-So now with 4,000 photos and a phone that continually tells me my storage is full at any opportunity, I decided, hey, I want to actually put songs on my phone again. So I painstakingly (because Apple apparently does not include a way to \"select all\" from the \"All Photos\" album) deleted every single photo I had. Zero photos. None. I was like, cool, great. I backed them all up to a folder on my laptop, so no sweat.\n-Except then, I wait a bit to put music on. I screenshot some stuff, download some stuff, and I have 28 photos. And my phone says it's full again. My phone. Says. It is full. That my storage is full. When I literally just deleted every single photo I had. And I know for a fact that TWENTY-EIGHT is not the storage limit for photos.\n-THE CURRENT PROBLEM is that I've gone on iTunes to put songs on multiple times, where it says: I need 1MB more of storage to even SYNC my phone to iTunes. This is coming from the same computer that says I have about 500MB free space. I'm sorry, you need 501MB to SYNC my phone? My phone synced FINE when I had thousands of photos! It says that to put a song on my phone, I need 6.1MB more storage. But then it registers that I put (1) song on, which I tried to, in half the locations I can check it. It says it when I go to the sync page/phone storage page, but not when I go to the music tab, where it says I have 0 songs.\nI cannot download any app updates for my phone (an apparent solution I found on here) because it says I don't have enough space. Even after deleting 4,000 photos, it thinks my storage is full. When I check the storage on my phone, it STILL SAYS I HAVE 600MB of photos. 28 photos does not take up 600MB.\nOn iTunes, it used to say that a good chunk of my storage was my photos, and some of it was my Documents and Data, and then a gig or so was Other. \nAfter deleting all my photos, Documents and Data is about the size that it and Photos COMBINED were, and Other has DOUBLED in size. Granted, it does say that I have 500MBish free, like I said, but that...doesn't excuse anything else, really. If anything, it's another sign that nothing is working properly.\n\"Recently deleted\" is clean. I permanently deleted those photos. How has my storage space gotten WORSE by deleting so much data.\nI'm at a loss for words with how backwards this problem is. I understand it exactly 0% and I've decided I'm getting an android.\nBut until I do, is there ANY way to fix this? How do I make my iPhone work. And iTunes for that matter. No matter what I do, it seems like, my storage is continually full. It's like it's ADAPTING to show me full storage every time I try deleting something. \nI would prefer not to do a factory reset, but if that's the only option, I guess it's worth a shot.\nAlso, I'm installing iOS 11.something right now. It let me do that. That requires space.\nI continue to not understand literally anything.\nThanks for helping.\n\nA: Restart your phone and then leave it for a while. It takes a while for the system to see space that has been freed up.\nPart of 8GB is taken by iOS leaving roughly 5GB remaining. You really can't do much with an 8GB phone. A larger capacity phone would make your life so much easier. \nPhotos does have a way to pick multiple items. It's the Select button. \nEach app has the ability to set aside storage, which is why you could take photos using other apps. \nBecause of this \"full\" isn't really full, it's more of a \"safe amount of free\" to prevent problems like you're seeing. Since you used the loophole of taking photos inside apps you were actually way above \"full\".\n", "Q: Metadata to ensure audio CD has tracks in the correct order when burned from iTunes I have a public domain audiobook from librivox.org which I want to put on CD for a blind friend.  I want to add a table of contents to the beginning of each CD.  The total length will take six CDs without a lot to spare, so I am planning on seven after I add the TOC files.\nThe files already have track numbers matching the 27 chapter numbers, i.e., 1 0f 27, 2 of 27, …, 27 of 27.  Since I only have ten blank CDs, and they are CD-R (write only once), I am reluctant to answer this by experimenting.\nDo I need to renumber all the files, including my additions, so that each CD starts with track 1 of N?

Or scrambled, or even just create an error message?\nWhen I imported an unrelated two-disc album, the CDDB made it two separate albums, so I can't judge by that.\nWould it work better to take them out of iTunes and burn the CDs some other way?\n\nA: The track numbers in iTunes are mainly for human consumption.

I'm aware it's been around for quite a while, since Sierra, and don't think it's been fixed as yet. \nTry The Time Machine Mechanic (T2M2) which should give more information about the error. It also includes a help file with advice and resolutions. \n", "Q: Delete broken unrecognised external partition So the situation is as follows, I have a 2TB external USB drive partitioned into 2 halves, 1TB each. The first half was used for Time Machine, and the 2nd half a generic ext. USB HD.\nMidway through a Time Machine backup the drive ejected itself and I got the \"Disk was not ejected correctly\" message. This seems to have broken the TM partition as it doesn't appear in Disk Utility, or System Info, or the Desktop.\nThe 2nd half however does appear on the desktop, and I can check the info and see I have used 250GB etc, but it can't be opened, and won't appear in Disk Utility, or under the USB section of sys info.\nIt seems then that the 2nd partition is fine (of sorts), however the first half is broken, and stopping the 2nd being read/written etc. I don't mind loosing the Time Machine backups as I have taken a spare on another drive, but I do need the data from the 2nd half.\nDoes anyone know how I might go about deleting just the broken partition, not using Disk Utility (as its not visible)?\nEDIT\nThis is the results of diskutil list, and its disk1s2 that I think is causing the issue.\nTimothys-Mini-2:~ timothywilkinson$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE      IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            428.6 GB   disk0s2\n3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n4:                  Apple_HFS Recovery HD             70.5 GB    disk0s4\n\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk1\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS                         1.0 TB     disk1s2\n3:                  Apple_HFS External HD             999.9 GB   disk1s3\n\n\nA: I know this sounds insultingly simple, but have you completely unplugged and powered down the external drive and plugged it back in?\nAt the office, TM would periodically decide that the time machine disk was damaged and could not be written to. Restarting didn't fix it, even though it was mountable. Removing power to the device and plugging it back in fixed it and allowed it to be written to again.

Like many hundreds of minutes of contiguous, non-stop workout.\nI've rebooted both the watch and phone, and recalibrated my fitness data in the Watch app on the phone.  I've also deleted the two offending days' worth of data from the Health app, but the Activity app still shows the achievements for those \"record\" days.  So two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is this happening/How can I prevent this from happening?\n\n*How can I remove the achievements so that I have a chance to actually earn them again in the future?\n\n\nA: Turns out that this was being caused by a timer app I had installed, called \"Intervals\".  I'm not using it as a fitness timer, but it defaults to recording every use of the timer as exercise.  According to the developers of the app, there are individual settings within each timer to turn this off, but apparently those aren't quite enough. There is also a \"low power\" setting within the timer, that needs to be enabled to completely prevent fitness tracking within the app.\n", "Q: OS X partition doesn't show up after dropping iMac, Windows still works I physically dropped an iMac tonight, shattering the protective screen. The computer was sleeping when it got dropped. The drop was from a couple feet high, and booting up looked promising until I realized that I am no longer able to boot into the OS X partition, only the side-by-side bootcamp Windows partition. On holding down alt during boot, only my Windows option is displayed for system to boot into.\nThis seems like a strange way for things to break due to physical damage given that the Windows partition is working perfectly and there is a single physical drive.\nWhere can I go from here? What information can I provide to help in diagnosis?\nAdditional info:\nAll data is backed up to a local Time Capsule.\nThis is an old (2007?) iMac running I believe ~10.6.5, though I'm not totally sure on exact version.\nThe bootable partition is Windows 7.\n\nA: If you are running 10.6.5, try booting from the original installation disk, then open disk utility. \nRun a \"Repair Disk\" both on the whole HDD to see if there is an issue with the partition table and on the boot volume that isn't working to see if there is an issue with the file system. If this disk is not repairable, you may have damaged the HDD with the drop, in which case not much can be done in terms of troubleshooting. You have a local backup, so your data is at least safe. \nAlternatively, if you have another Mac running OS X, you can attempt to mount the disk using Target Disk Mode. This will essentially treat the internal drive on the iMac as an external drive on the other machine. Then you can run the troubleshooting steps above in a similar manner.\n", "Q: 100 GB Missing after failing to install Windows 10 After I tried to install Windows 10 on my MacbookPro 2017 (High Sierra 10.13.3) my mac was frozen on step when bootcamp assistant was creating partitions (I had to reboot).

Hardware or Software, dunno, it could be elsewhere but we need to find where.\nWhat you need is something else as a verification that it is not some strange interaction with your iPad and Mac. So if you have another Mac, iPad or iPhone, Heck even a Windows/Linux laptop with known good wifi that you can test against the Mac. Find a friend with a phone or laptop with wifi and offer them beer.\nWhat you are trying to discover is where the fault lies. Is it the iPad, or the Mac? \nYou need to determine where the fault lies.

We have four phones on the same plan, including those our children use (who are adults).  We're running low on iCloud storage.  Apple messages said we could get 50MB each for $.99 a month or 200MB that could be shared.  But now it appears that the sharing would also entail agreeing to pay for iTunes and a number of other things.  How can we share just iCloud storage, as Apple seemed to tell us we could do?\n\nA: No. Family sharing in spring 2018 and back to when it started implies one payment card for all purchases. \nThe only exception of course is store credit or gift card balance can be applied to any or all parts of a family so that most purchases pull from that prepaid balance. So if you manage it or push out “allowances”, most of the time, only recurring payments and IAP hit the shared card. \n", "Q: error message from apple diagnostics after fan replacement This is a late 2012 mac mini. I recently replaced the fan, which was making a lot of noise. The replacement is not from apple. Everything works fine, and the system is quiet. But I ran an Apple diagnostics which gives me the following error: 4MOT/1/40000002-Exhaust-0. Is this because the fan has not been installed properly or it is Daignostics not liking a non-Apple product? Many thanks for your advice\n\nA: The \"MOT\" in the error code indicates, as you may have guessed, trouble with a motor of some kind.\nIt would be logical to assume it points to the fan you replaced.\nI wouldn't expect it to be caught during a hardware test, although these fans are controlled by a chip that precisely modulates power, and could detect when the motor isn't acting as expected according to the input, which I guess could be described as \"diagnostics not liking a non-Apple product.\"\nRegardless, it does mean at the very least that the replacement part you used isn't identical to the factory part. Is the fan spinning at all? You say the system is fine, but also quiet. Could this be because it was installed incorrectly and isn't even functioning? I can't imagine how you could install the fan incorrectly, but if you don't hear it spinning at all, maybe you should take another look to see if everything is connected, and you didn't destroy the fan connector, which is too easy to do.\nWhere did you buy the part, and was it listed as compatible with the model you have? Even if it is a third-party part, I find it hard to believe that AHT would detect it as malfunctioning if it had the right specs and was actually connected to the board.\n", "Q: Accidentally formatted an exFAT partition to OS X journaled and lost data I accidentally formatted an exFAT partition to OS X journaled on MacBook Pro and lost data, how to recover?\n\nA: If you haven't done anything else to the disk besides reformatting it, if you haven't copied any other data to the drive, then you will likely be able to get most if not all of the data back using a data recovery tool.\nHowever, because the drive's original format was a PC format, you'll want to use a PC data recovery tool, not a Mac one. Something that can recover deleted files. You may get a messy jumble of pervious versions of saved files too, that's just the nature of recovering deleted files. \nOn the Mac, something like DataRescue works very well.

To start, I'm trying to back up my iPhone 5 to my Windows 7 computer running iTunes. It connects, starts the backup, but about 15 minutes into it I get a message saying there's not enough space on the computer to do the backup.\nI have 582GB free on that drive (It's backing up to the C: drive). \nSo, needless to say, I'm confused. I've found a few articles that talk about issues with iCloud and wireless backing up, but this is connected direction to my PC so I don't think that's the issue. \nThe official Apple documentation says to \"free up space\" which isn't the issue, or contact support. So, no real help there, either. \n\nA: So after much swearing and several hours of fiddling, I finally discovered what the issue was.\nWindows appears to have a limit on how many files can exist in a directory tree. iOS backups consist of tens of thousands of individual files. And if you have several backups in your backup folder, we're talking a whole lot of files.\nThe solution ended up being fairly simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*find your backup folder on your hard drive\n\n*move most (or all) of the backups that are in that folder to a separate folder and/or drive.\n\n\nThen try backing up again. For me, that solved it and I was able to get the backup to run. \n\nA: You've addressed this, but I want to make sure I double-check: Did you make any windows junctions in the past to map your user account data folder (or the iTunes backup folder) to another drive other than that primary c: drive?\nAssuming not, here is what I would try first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go in and rename or delete the folder for the previous backup for this device (the one named with the device UDID)\n\n*If that doesn't help, then rename the Backup folder inside of MobileSync, and then make an entirely new Backup folder.\nThere's instructions for each of these on an old blog post of mine (under \"iPhone Disconnected Error During a Backup\") https://deciphertools.com/blog/2014_12_09_iphone_could_not_restore_disconnected/\n", "Q: Make table which exceeds document body but moves with text in Pages I would like to make a wide table in Pages which exceeds the document body and cuts into the margins of the document.

I have TestDisk for PowerPC, but I don't know if it does sector testing. I can't find it anywhere in the menus, at least.\n\nA: There are no utilities on the install disk that can help you. The \"SMART Status\" that is shown in apple's Disk Utility is completely useless. VERY rarely have I had a failing drive actually indicate it is failing in Disk Utility. \nThe best app for this is a utility called SMART Utility. It's not free but does have a free demo. They have an older version available that runs in 10.5.8 on PPC. You can get it here:\nhttps://www.volitans-software.com/apps/smart-utility/\nThat will tell you if you have any reallocated bad blocks without needing to scan the disk. But you will have to have 10.5 installed on some volume and working in order to run that. Which means another internal drive or maybe a Firewire drive, or possibly a USB drive but that might not work. \nAs a mac repair professional, it is my primary tool for diagnosing failing hard drives. \nIf you want a utility that does actually scan the entire drive, I've found the best utility for that, believe it or not, it SoftRAID. Even though RAIDs in OS X these days are a whole big bundle of problems, that utility has a couple of different full-disk scanning and verifying tools that work very well. Although like I said, I almost never run them because SMART Utility is sufficient. Also SoftRAID is not free either although it also appears to have a free trial. \n", "Q: How to change number of threads used in Homebrew builds?

Saying \"Hey Siri, play Overcast\" opens the app, but doesn't start playing the audio.\n\nA: As of Overcast 5 (released in 2018), Siri commands are now supported. To enable, go to Overcast.app ➡️ Settings ➡️ Siri Shortcuts. Then, for example, you'll be able to say Hey Siri, Overcast play to play the currently selected podcast.

I have specified two DNS servers in my network settings. One is an internal DNS server, and the other is 8.8.8.8. When I try to resolve local hostnames that the internal DNS knows, it resolves properly. But when I try to resolve something like google.com it fails. \nI see that it tries to use the internal DNS server first, and since it doesn't know the hostname, I thought it would try to use 8.8.8.8 to resolve the hostname, but it never tries the other DNS server. \nWhen I try this from my other laptop, it works properly i see\n$>nslookup google.com\n;; Got SERVFAIL reply from <internal dns>, trying next server\nServer:     8.8.8.8\nAddress:    8.8.8.8#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   google.com\nAddress: 172.217.5.110\n\nBut from the one where it doesn't I see\n$>nslookup google.com\nServer:        <internal dns>\nAddress:    <internal dns>#53\n\n** server can’t find google.com: SERVFAIL\n\nThere is no attempt to try the 8.8.8.8 DNS server. Why is that happening? How can I get it to try the other DNS server if it fails with one.\n\nA: First: nslookup does not use the system DNS resolver, and does not behave the same way that the system resolver does. Neither do dig or host, so none of these tools are useful for checking how macOS resolves names. If you want to use the system resolver, use dscacheutil -q host -a name google.com, but note that it uses the entire resolution system -- it looks in the local cache, /etc/hosts, mDNS (for .local names), and then DNS. Oh, and the man page for dscacheutil claims it can flush the DNS cache, but it doesn't work; use sudo killall mDNSResponder instead.\nSecond: the system resolver does not do a good (or even adequate) job of failing over between DNS servers. If you list multiple servers, it'll fire off queries to all of them in a sort of randomized-round-robin fashion. If it doesn't get a response, it'll eventually time out and try the other one. If it gets a \"that doesn't exist\" response, it assumes that's correct and doesn't try any other server. As a result, you really need a single server that can answer all queries, both internal and external.\nOk, there's one possible workaround: you can point your system at a public DNS server, then create /etc/resolver/ and put files in it to redirect queries for certain domains to your internal server. Provided you know what domains to redirect, that is. See Apple.SE: \"Do /etc/resolver/ files work in Mountain Lion for DNS resolution?\".\n", "Q: Macbook Pro SSD Upgrade I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) (11,3) and I'm looking to change it's drive.\nI've found 2 models that I think fits my model.\n\n\n*\n\n*OWC 480GB Aura Pro X SSD For Mac Pro (Late 2013) with Envoy Pro Enclosure \n\n*Transcend 480GB JetDrive 820 PCIe Gen3 x2 Solid State Drive \nDoes anyone know if these 2 would work with my computer?

To isolate this, I deleted my AddressBook folder in it's entirety and restarted. Now, with a fresh (empty) AddressBook, I still am having the same problems: the app hangs and I can't add/search/edit/delete etc... Nothing. Unfortunately, I am unable to decode the .hang file - I don't have a ton experience in this area.

The calls go through and can be answered but neither side can be heard. If I try and use voice memos, I can’t even begin recording. Any app that makes calls such as FaceTime or Facebook messenger fails if I try and call or answer a call. If I try and restart my phone, it gets stuck on the Apple that comes up when turning on for hours at a time. I’ve tried resetting, and updating and neither option has fixed the issue, just led to more hours stuck on the “Apple screen”. Apart from the audio and reboot issue, all other functions of the phone are working. \n\nA: If you've tried restarting, updating, and factory resetting and have had no luck fixing the issues, you may need to send your phone in to Apple for repair. Getting stuck on the Apple screen for hours, even after reset, leads me to believe it's a logic board issue.

In fact, recently, Apple has taken to removing the sockets for RAM and storage (SSDs) meaning that you are stuck with the configuration as bought.\nI have absolutely no doubt that someone with experience working with surface mounted parts could get the CPU/GPU off the PCBs. But then how are you going to mount the removed parts to another board?\nYou might be able to extract the system board from the case and then set it up to do as you would like, but removing parts from the PCB?

Reading through I found a way to fix it, that is reinstalling in Recovery Mode. So I went and did just that and after about two hours it was saying 1minute remaining and ka-boom! My wi-fi connection was lost and it hanged there forever. Even after restoring a working Wi-Fi it is still saying the same: one minute remaining.\nI have checked the log and it seems like it retried two times and it failed (I noticed connection issue after less than 30min I guess). I cannot waste more of bandwidth, having faced same issue multiple times and I cannot see Apple providing a retry button, only cancel.\nSince my download was almost done, is there a way to force installer to pick up where it failed when downloading?\nUpdate:\nAm using Re-Install Option from Recovery boot (Power On then hold Command+R).\n \n\nA: No - the installer for the reinstall uses apple's Content Delivery Network (CDN) to download the install image file in parts. There are usually about 500 chunks that get downloaded and then fused into the installer.\n(I suppose someone could reverse engineer this process, but it's not documented and signed cryptographically to prevent man in the middle tampering with the downloads - so that might be costly).\nWhat you can do is run a local caching server (on High Sierra - turn on content caching on the Sharing preference pane and on Sierra and lower - install server.app and turn on content caching).\nThat way whenever any device on your local network downloads these 500 items - they get cached locally and your next download only needs to get pieces that are not already cached. The first time you do recovery for the image needed - you of course download all bits from outside your local network, but until the image changes - you are set.\nIf you can't afford another download or set up caching server - you can go to the Mac App Store on another Mac and download the OS installer and then create a bootable USB installer - now you have no download and something bootable for the Mac you hoped to use Internet Recovery on.\n\nA: After long searching, it seems there is nothing that can be done once in recovery mode. So I ended up Re-downloading (cancel and click reinstall again)\nFor those with access to account @bmike have posted great answer.\nThanks everybody for help!\n", "Q: How to restore apps on iPod?

At the very least, the answers there do not answer my question.\nFrom the accepted answer:\n\nThe short answer is no. The phone thinks you are a thief trying to steal the data and won't cooperate with attempts to initiate a second backup. \n\nIt makes sense that you would need a password to restore a password-protected phone.  I am not trying to do that.  I am trying to backup a phone that I have access to as if it were fresh.

This would be somewhat of a security flaw in my opinion.\nSo to say it short, you need to erase your iPhone to disable the encrypted backup setting, if you do not know the password.\n\nA: As of iOS 11, resetting settings will purge the current backup password (this is relatively new) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205220#help\nObligatory note: Be sure to do Reset All Settings, and NOT Reset All Contents and Settings, which wipes your device :)\nI'm glad you already deleted the old backups, because there may be some bugs in doing this and then running an incremental backup.\n", "Q: Strange watermark on a iPhone photo taken in Target My friend recently took a photo with iPhone 5 in Target's changing room and a watermark automatically applied over it saying \"You look goooood. #UniversalThread #TargetStyle\". \nIt wasn't written on the mirror, it's clearly watermarked on the photo after the capture.\nHow did Target even do that?

I found zero info about it online.\n\n\nA: I would be willing to bet that Target is using hidden watermarks that are only visible when taking a photo (similar to the watermark that is used by banks to protect checks).  What I hypothesize they are using is a fluorescent dyes that only shows up under certain lighting conditions (like the high intensity led of a smartphone camera flash)\nSee:  Invisible glass watermarks will ensure your new watch or smartphone is genuine\nOut of sheer curiosity, I would do a simple test: take a compact mirror into the restroom with you.  With your phone in Airplane Mode, take a picture of the bathroom mirror and of the mirror you brought in.  If the image is in both places, it's \"tech\" related.  If not, it's in the mirror.\n\nA: Pretty sure this is probably embedded in the mirror and only shows up in pics. Couldn't find anything on the web.\n", "Q: When moving a file to another volume, where does the original go? Today I moved (CMD-Drag) a folder from my laptop to my desktop across my LAN.  The resulting file (an Ableton Live project file) opened on the desktop but is missing things that were present when it was on my laptop.\nI can't figure out how this could have happened, and it got me thinking... where does the \"original\" actually go when you move as opposed to copy something?  It doesn't just go in the trash so, is it just flagged for overwriting and made invisible?  Wondering if I can somehow get the original back.  I checked my Time Machine backups and somehow the folder in question is not there either (or actually, it's there but also missing things once restored).\n\nA: The file is deleted on the spot. Which means technically it's still on the disk as a deleted file until the system overrides it. But with a running operating system, it's very unlikely you'd be able to get it back with a data recovery tool. Data Rescue does deleted file recovery, but the data you seek is most likely already overwritten.\nIt's also clear that the \"missing\" data was lost long before you moved it. Time Machine is your solution here. Keep going back until you can find a copy that is not missing the data.\n", "Q: Enrollment process Enrolled in Apple developer program as a company but didn't receive mail titled \"Request for enrollment documents\".

He opened it and apparently there was some porn related things inside. Obviously, I didn't send this email, and it doesn't appear in my sent message.\nWhat also surprised me is that apparently, another of my contacts was also in CC, even though these 2 persons know each other and probably have each other's email in their contact list.\nSadly I don't know more about the email itself, if it was my real address that was used or simply something like \"John Doe <spam@email.com>\"\nMy email (@icloud.com) is only setup in the Mail app of my Mac and iPhone. When reading my mails from a browser, I have 2-step authentication activated, so I can't have been hacked.\nI'm not familiar with this kind of spam, so I have a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Could it be sent from my Mac? I had the (perhaps wrong) idea that Mac were less prone to this kind of annoyance than Windows computer.\n\n*If not my Mac, then could it possibly be my iPhone?\n\n*Is there an efficient way to protect yourself against this kind of spam? I already have an antivirus installed on my Mac, and I make sure never to install anything from untrusted source. \n\n\nA: It is unlikely either your Mac or iPhone was used to send the e-mail. Regrettably it is difficult to protect yourself from this problem.\nSee Receiving spam from myself for a related question and answers about this subject. For a more technical overview, start with this spoof email search of the StackExchange network.\nSpoofed E-mails\nHow Spammers Spoof Your Email Address (and How to Protect Yourself) – article from LifeHacks in 2014 helps explain the sitation:\n\nMost of us know spam when we see it, but seeing a strange email from a friend—or worse, from ourselves—in our inbox is pretty disconcerting. If you've seen an email that looks like it's from a friend, it doesn't mean they've been hacked. Spammers spoof those addresses all the time, and it's not hard to do. Here's how they do it, and how you can protect yourself.\nSpammers have been spoofing email addresses for a long time. Years ago, they used to get contact lists from malware-infected PCs. Today's data thieves choose their targets carefully, and phish them with messages that look like they came from friends, trustworthy sources, or even their own account.\n\n\nA: If your email address is visible anywhere on the internet then this will happen. Search on google to verify if that it's out there. Email addresses are harvested for the purposes of spam.\nThat said, given that you are taking good security precautions — especially 2STEP — it is most likely that one your contacts address books were compromised in some way and this is the result. If your address was in their address book, then it's now available to be used as a \"from\" address in spam.\nAnnoying as it is, it's best not to worry about it.\n", "Q: 50GB of disk space missing On a 120GB SSD hard drive in a MacBook only 70GB are available. The missing 50GB are not even shown as free space.\nHere is what the output of Disk Utility looks like:\n\n\n\nAs you can see on the first screenshot the disk has 120GB. However, the partition chart on the same screenshot only shows 70GB. Also the other two screenshots show that only 70GB out of 120GB seem to be available.\nThe command diskutil list shows that the physical disk0 is 120GB big, but the synthesized disk1 only 70GB:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         70.0 GB    disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +70.0 GB    disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            60.2 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 21.7 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                509.9 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      2.1 GB     disk1s4\n\n\nA: You previously installed Windows (or another OS) and deleted it afterwards - except an orphaned Apple_BOOT or 2nd EFI partition (disk0s3 - 134.2 MB).\nThe 50 GB are simply unallocated disk space.\nTo expand your APFS container you have to remove the third partition and resize the container:\nFirst convert the third partition to free space:\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume \"Free Space\" %noformat% /dev/disk0s3\n\nThen expand your APFS container to the max (0 is a magic size here):\ndiskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\n\nA: The solution\nThe amazing klanomath, who posted the first reply guided me through the debugging process and we were able to solve the problem. At this point I would like to thank him for all the time he took to help me.\nThe problem seemed to be that in the past I installed a different OS using Bootcamp, and after I deleted it Bootcamp failed to return the space that was allocated for it, so that 50GB of space got orphaned.\nOne hint to this is is the volume disk0s3 that one can see on the first screenshot. This was probably the bootloader for the other OS.\nHere are the steps that led to the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Probably it is a good idea to make a Time Machine backup before messing with the hard drive.\n\n*Delete disk0s3 by running\nsudo diskutil eraseVolume \"Free Space\" %noformat% /dev/disk0s3\n\n\n*Boot into the Internet Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding Alt+Cmd+R while booting. Then open the Terminal via Menu Bar → Utilities\n\n*The architecture of the hard drive is the following: disk0 is the physical storage, on top of it is the container disk0s2. This container accommodates the synthesized disk1, which, in turn, contains the volume disk1s1. For some reason, when I booted into the Recovery mode my disk1 became disk2 and disk1s1 became disk2s1. Make sure you insert the correct labels. The commands diskutil list and diskutil ap list are helpful to single out the right ones.\n\n*Unlock disk1s1 by running diskutil ap list and copy its UUID, in our case it's 9AFD4588-AA1A-3413-9335-6C8DA8EA3973. Then run\ndiskutil ap unlockVolume 9AFD4588-AA1A-3413-9335-6C8DA8EA3973\n\nand enter your password. You don't need to lock it afterwards.\n\n*Run some checks on the disks, containers, and volumes that we are going to modify:\ndiskutil verifyDisk disk0\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s2\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk1s1\n\nand make sure there are no errors.\n\n*Grow the disk0s2 container:\ndiskutil ap resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nThe zero at the end is a magic number that makes sure the container is grown to the maximum.\n\n*Verify the result with diskutil list and diskutil ap list.\nHere is my end result:\n\n\n\ndiskutil list:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         121.1 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +121.1 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            60.1 GB    disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 22.4 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                509.9 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      1.1 GB     disk1s4\n\ndiskutil ap list:\nAPFS Container (1 found)\n|\n+-- Container disk1 E18387BD-AC00-4EC1-9446-C865C525F706\n    ====================================================\n    APFS Container Reference:     disk1\n    Capacity Ceiling (Size):      121123069952 B (121.1 GB)\n    Capacity In Use By Volumes:   61859213312 B (61.9 GB) (51.1% used)\n    Capacity Available:           59263856640 B (59.3 GB) (48.9% free)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Store disk0s2 727CB82C-B58F-4B11-BB65-7177A5951E29\n    |   -----------------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Physical Store Disk:   disk0s2\n    |   Size:                       121123069952 B (121.1 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s1 9AFD4588-AA1A-3413-9335-6C8DA8EA3973\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s1 (No specific role)\n    |   Name:                      Macintosh HD (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               /\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         60126756864 B (60.1 GB)\n    |   FileVault:                 Yes (Unlocked)\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s2 6F75B394-3A04-419B-A2AF-62270D0DB902\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s2 (Preboot)\n    |   Name:                      Preboot (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         22441984 B (22.4 MB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s3 AACD802A-DC54-4D3E-8556-BE56B7D229B7\n    |   ---------------------------------------------------\n    |   APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s3 (Recovery)\n    |   Name:                      Recovery (Case-insensitive)\n    |   Mount Point:               Not Mounted\n    |   Capacity Consumed:         509853696 B (509.9 MB)\n    |   FileVault:                 No\n    |\n    +-> Volume disk1s4 13865AE2-BA44-4DD2-8A37-80169D319CC4\n        ---------------------------------------------------\n        APFS Volume Disk (Role):   disk1s4 (VM)\n        Name:                      VM (Case-insensitive)\n        Mount Point:               /private/var/vm\n        Capacity Consumed:         1073786880 B (1.1 GB)\n        FileVault:                 No\n\nP.S.: At first I tried to grow the container from the operating system, and not from the recovery mode, and run diskutil ap resizeContainer disk0s2 0 in the terminal without any unlocking.

Make sure that the LDAP server is added in the Search Policy list under Contacts. The Contacts server in the Server app need not be enabled. \nAfter you have successfully added the LDAP server, open your Contacts app on the client. There should be a new entry Directory Services on the left sidebar. Click on it, then, in the Search field, enter the name of a user in your LDAP directory. The directory entry should then be displayed, and left of the email address, you should see a small certificate symbol  similar to the symbol in Mail app that is displayed for signed emails.

I am trying to find out my public IP address for my MacBook Air  It is on Comcast/Xfinity Wifi (my parents had some tech dudes set it up). When I check http://ipecho.net or any other I get 73.170.168.215, but this is the same as on my iPhone 8.\nOn the contrary, the two devices have different local ip addresses with all the numbers the same except the last one 192.168.40.XXX. Is the public IP address the same thing as the router?\n\nA: The IP you're seeing (73.170.168.215) is the address your router is exposing to the outside world.  The router is masking you're real address to keep you safe.  \nAny device that uses that router to connect to the outside world will be 'seen' as having that same IP.  This is why your Mac and your iPhone appear to have the identical IP's when viewed from outside your network.  The public IP  is the address of that router (I'm trying to keep this simple because networking can get really complicated fast).\nYour router is responsible for taking the individual device traffic and routing them to the correct device within your \"private\" network.    \nTo use BlockheadsServer correctly with your Mac, it's best if you contact their support to determine the best way to configure it.  You don't want to misconfigure a router because you might accidentally open-up your network to malicious activity.\n\nA: Some routers allow for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) which will allow the application that you are running on your mac to request port forwarding to \"expose\" the application to the internet. This will allow the router to be the proxy on the edge of your network and then route the require ports through to your mac on your home network. This is a great way (if your application and router supports this function) as you do not need to spend ages in the router config setting up all the ports and forwarding.\n\nA: It says here that you may need to setup port forwarding to allow incoming connections from port 15151 to your Mac. If your dad lets you, you may be able to try this in the router settings.\n", "Q: Lost all my contacts on iMac when I upgraded software All the contacts are on my iPhone but when I go the iMac all it says is no cards.  Preferences has the contacts checked and view groups show all the names but no data for the card?\n\nA: It sounds like your iCloud is not configured on your Mac. Go into system prefs and make sure you are signed in to your iCloud account, and make sure it's the same iCloud account that your phone is signed in to.\n", "Q: I'm using OSX 10.11 what should I be aware of when installing 10.12 I'm a developer, and I'd rather not mess up anything on my system. So I guess, the general. Take a backup advice applies. \nBut is there anything else in particular that I should be aware of? Something that have gone wrong for users in the past? \nThe wonkyness of apple software has been quite a lot in the news as of late... so that's why I'm asking. \n\nA: Going from one major revision to the next, there could be a lot of things if you are a developer (which I am not).\nThe smart thing to do is to make a full bootable backup of your boot drive (CCC and Super Duper to name a couple I am familiar with). Then TEST the backup by booting from it. Then unplug it from the Mac and put the backup drive in another room.\nDo your upgrade and then check your environment, your builds, your tools and make sure everything is working as expected.\nNow if things get messed up all you have to do is boot from your backup drive, wipe the internal (boot) drive. Remembering to save any changes to files you made in the interim to your backup drive. And clone the backup back to your original boot drive.\nWith any luck you'll only kill a half day or so...\n\nA: Check all of your third party apps to see if they support 10.12. There's not much difference between 10.12 and 10.11, so I don't think you'll run into much trouble, aside from apps not supporting 10.12 if they are older, and of course 10.12 not supporting many older (and some not so old) Macs. \n", "Q: Send all notifications all the time I just realised someone sent me an email 6 hours ago. This was an important mail.\nI think I was watching a full-screen video in Safari at the time.\nDoes macOS block notifications when you are watching films? I've noticed this problem before, maybe I'm off the mark but missing notifications has become a problem as of late.\nHow can I make sure I'm getting all notifications (specifically Discord and Mail.app)\n\nA: If you go to Notifications in System Preferences you can access the notification settings. Each individual app can have the style of notification changed, as well as some other settings. You can also set the Do Not Disturb hours and settings, which will prevent notifications from displaying.\n", "Q: Load SMS messages in vmsg format to new iphone on linux I have a backup of SMSs from an old phone in vmsg format.\nWhat would be necessary in order to lead them on the iPhone? I am new to apple products. Can I not make a backup  of the phone and download it to my linux computer? How? If so, it would be a matter of converting the messages to other format. I take it sqlite from a bit of googling around. I am a computer programmer, this is not a problem for me. What's confusing me is the whole backup and restore policies.\nOr ideally, is there a way to restore only the sms.db?\nOr any other way of leading SMSs in any other format? Writing a script to convert them would not be a problem.\n\nA: You really have multiple questions in one, but I'll assume the question marked in bold is your primary question:\nYes, you can make a backup of your phone and download it to your Linux computer. \nFrom your wording it is hard to know whether you by \"download\" mean that the Linux computer is seperate from the computer that makes the backup, or not. In both cases this is possible:\nScenario A:\nUse iTunes on your Mac to create a local backup of your iPhone.\n  Afterwards use any file copying program to copy ~/Bibliotek/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ to your Linux PC.\nYou can copy over the network, via a USB disk, or any other ordinary way of copying files.\nScenario B:\nInstall libimobiledevice on your Linux PC. Depending on Linux distribution, this is normally available in your package manager.\n  Use the idevicebackup tool to create a backup.\nIf libimobiledevice is not available in your package manager, you can download it from:\nhttp://www.libimobiledevice.org\nWhen you do have the backup, your SMS messages are stored in a file originally named \"sms.db\", which is really a SQLite3 database containing the messages.\nThere's no built-in support for the vmsg format in libimobiledevice. However, you could create your own tool, as you describe, to convert from vmsg into SQL statements, that you could execute to add the messages to the SQLite database. Then you can restore the backup again to transfer the messages back to the phone.\n", "Q: Dark theme for Thunderbird on macOS? Does there exist a theme plug-in or add-on that can make the Thunderbird on macOS looks mostly dark or black?\n\nA: It's part of the default theme package in current beta versions (running b64).\nIn Mojave, it switches to the dark theme automatically if you change the OS to dark. However, whereas the dark theme in Firefox is pretty much complete, the theme in Thunderbird is haphazardly applied. I'm not running dark mode Mojave specifically because Thunderbird theme is off. See bugzilla entry here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1486205\n\nA: Search their themes on their website.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/themes/\n", "Q: Best TimeMachine solution for macOS Sierra given current hardware? I have an iMac running El Capitan (can't upgrade further) that has been hosting my TimeMachine backup for years. New MacBook Pro can't see the Time Machine volume - doesn't even see the drive connected to the iMac as an option.\nI have a blank 4 TB 5.25\" drive I can use for an alternate TimeMachine backup. What setup should I use for optimal outcome? Can I connect it to the iMac in a way that will make it available? Enclosure connected directly to the MBP seems far less convenient than the old method, where TimeMachine would just run whenever I was on my home network...\n\nA: If you buy the \"Server\" app from the App Store ($20 I think), it will let you once again use your iMac as a network based backup destination for Macs running Time Machine on the network. You can just turn on the Backup feature in Server.app and ignore all the rest. \nYou can most likely do this without the server app using some command line tricks, but I don't know how off the top of my head. \nThe only other solution is physically plugging in the drive to each Mac, one by one. But like you said, that's not ideal. \n", "Q: how do you cancel a pending purchase in iTunes I have a pending purchase from the app store.  I have not downloaded the purchase and I would like to now cancel the purchase.\n\nA: Technically, the purchase is not pending, as soon as the payment gets cleared from your bank account the purchase is deemed complete and final. Nevertheless, you can always contact iTunes support through Report a Problem and get refund for your purchase. Some developers bar refunds if the app has been downloaded at least once, since you haven't done so you need not worry about this caveat.\nThe portal shows purchases you made in the last 90 days, for older purchases you'll need to contact iTunes Support directly.\nFollow these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple's Report a Problem portal and sign in using the Apple ID used for purchase.\n\n*You should see a list of your recent purchases (last 90 days). Find the app in question and tap on report.\n\n*Describe your problem and click submit.\nApple Support will write to you with 3-5 business days. All the best.\nReference: Apple Support\n\nA: Call Apple Support once it goes through and ask to speak to iTunes/billing, they can refund it as accidental. Or you can call the bank to decline that transaction all together.\n", "Q: Why is Contacts.app's \"General\" tab different on two Macs with the same software? I have two macs, a 2010 MBP and a 2013 MBA. They run identical software: both use macOS 10.12.6, and Contacts.app 10.0, build 1756.20.\nThe \"General\" pane of Contacts.app's Preferences displays differently on the two machines. The MBP shows this:\n\nwhile the MBA shows this:\n\nWhy are the panes different?\n\nA: One Mac only has one account set up, so there is no \"Default Account\" option. The other Mac has multiple accounts set up, or one account and local data, thus it gives you the option of choosing a default account. What else is listed in the \"Default Account\" menu?\n", "Q: How do I fix disabled diacritical/accent marks? I'm running macOS High Sierra v10.13.3.\nHolding a key — typically a vowel — down, by default, will enable a pop-up of diacritics to appear. A while back, I had apparently disabled this function, thereby enabling key repeat.\nI had wanted to reenable this default, and therefore disable key repeat. The most obvious method that I had found via numerous forums and blog posts was entering the following into Terminal:\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true\n\nI've performed this operation, and then restarted my computer, about a dozen times, and I still cannot disable key repeat and enable the accent mark pop-up to appear. As an additional remedy, I disabled key repeat in System Preferences — but to no avail.\nFunny thing is: the feature works exclusively on TextEdit and no other application. \n\nA: If you look at the answer to a very similar question (but NOT a duplicate) you will see that the terminal work they suggest as an answer specifically targets the preferences for the given app - in that answer's case Terminal:\nAccent popup in Terminal.app?\nAs a result, I'd start by suggesting you target the specific plist for the app you most frequently want this function in, and if it succeeds there, consider making that a system-wide pref.\n", "Q: Chromium in Launchpad but not in Applications I recently installed uTorrent on High Sierra but wasn't thinking and installed the Yahoo thing. The uTorrent installer says \"Opera\", but I ended up with a Chromium icon in my Launchpad. The problem is it isn't in my Applications folder.\nI rebooted the laptop and Chromium started up on its own and when I opened Chrome I was notified that another application installed an extension. I removed it.\nHow do I get rid of this Chromium installation now? I have enabled the jiggle but no X appears.\n\nA: I know I just asked, but I figured it out and want to post the answer for others when they search for this same problem. Run the following in Terminal:\ncd ~/Applications\nrm -rf APP_NAME.app\n\nNote: If the app name contains a space, place a \\ character before the space so it looks like this /My\\ Space\nI verified that I was removing the correct app first by renaming it then checking LaunchPad to confirm the change. Once I saw that I was actually changing it in LaunchPad I went ahead and deleted it with the rm command.\nYou can additionally write rm -rf (with a space after the -rf) and then drag n’ drop the application from the Finder window into the terminal window. This will paste the path to the application correctly (auto fix spaces, etc.). Then press enter. This will ensure you have the correct path and are deleting the correct application. \nWarning: Do not press enter without a path after rm -rf\n", "Q: Mac mini server A1347 can't use Wi-Fi during setup My ex-collegue just passed on a Mac mini Server to me and said it needed an OS. So I start it with Command-R, and then it asks me for Wi-Fi connection. \nI am on my University network, so I can connect with my staff account or eduroam. However, none of those are in the list of detected networks. They have fine range though and all my other Mac/Unix machines in my office have no problem.  \nSo I tried adding a new network: I type eid and I have a box for password, however, not for username. All the networks here require both username and password. \nIs there any way around this?\n--update--\nI can connect to my iPhone as a hotspot, but I can't possibly share as much data as needed for the setup as my bill would be too high. \nSo I figure, I'd share my MacBook connection through USB with my iPhone, but it says: Your Internet connection cannot be shared because it is protected by 802.1X.\nMaybe this reveals some info about the Wi-Fi connection here and why the setup is not detecting it. \n\nA: There is no (reasonable) way around this. Basically, what's going on is that the firmware's network stack isn't smart enough to do 802.1X authentication (which is what's used for \"enterprise\" Wi-Fi authentication with both username and password). It can only do \"personal\" Wi-Fi authentication (network password, no username) an open networks (no captive portals either -- they require a browser). And ethernet, of course.\nAs for resharing the network (e.g. from your Mac) there's no technical reason this can't be done, but there's an extremely good practical one: 802.1X authentication implies a relatively high-security network, and particularly one where the network admins want to be able to tell who's connected where and when. Resharing such a network connection would open a hole in the network security, as well as potentially allowing untraceable and probably unauthorized people to connect to the network. From a security policy perspective, this would be very very bad. So macOS doesn't allow it.\nPossible solutions: Can you get access to the campus network over ethernet? If so, you could use that (unless it also requires 802.1X authentication, but that's rare). If not, you're going to have to take the Mac Mini somewhere else to get an Internet connection it can use.\nAnother possible solution is to download the macOS installer app to your MacBook (in the App Store), then use DiskMaker X to make a bootable installer disk (you need an erasable USB flash drive at least 8GB), then boot the Mini from that. This might need a network connection, but as long as the installer is for the latest version of macOS, it should only need to check for & download the latest firmware for the Mini -- your iPhone hotspot should be able to handle that.\n\nA: The simple solution is to plug into Ethernet. \nAnother solution is to install through another Mac, if you have one handy that also has Firewire? (or Thunderbolt if the mini has Thunderbolt) Boot the Mac mini holding the \"T\" button, to put it into Target Disk Mode. Plug it into the other Mac.\nDownload macOS on the laptop, through the App store. Run the installer and install it on the mini's hard drive. Once it's done and gives you the setup screen, Command-Q to quit out of that and shutdown. Then disconnect everything and reboot normally. The mini will be good to go. \n", "Q: Borderless PDF saving from website I'm trying to save a website as a PDF file using the File -> Print.... The PDF preview has a white border all around, as does the final final PDF product. I've followed the steps suggested on this website, but that doesn't work. Other websites suggest using File -> Page Setup, but that option no longer exists in later versions of macOS.\nI'm using Safari 11.0.3 on macOS 10.13.3.\nHow can I force the PDF file not to have any white borders?\n\nA: It sounds like the border is a part of the PDF document itself, in which case it's not an issue with printing preferences. The easiest solution is to crop the PDF in Preview, then print it.\nInstead of File > Print, perform File > Export as PDF (or Save as).\nOpen the PDF in Preview and crop it.\nFrom the above Apple support article:\n\nIf the Markup toolbar isn’t showing, click the Show Markup Toolbar\nbutton , then click the Rectangular Selection button .\nSelect the portion of the page you want to keep.\nClick the Crop button in the Markup toolbar (or use the Touch Bar).\n\nOnce you select the portion, you can alternatively the shortcut command + K to crop it as well.\nOnce you are finished, save the PDF if you wish and print it.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work on certain macOS or configuration you're using. But on my setup I get a borderless PDF with these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Create a borderless paper size as described in the website you've mentioned.\n\n*Have the borderless paper size set as the default one in System Preferences > Printers & Scanners > Default paper size.\n\n*Now that when I print a web page from Safari, it will use the margin setup from the paper.\n\n", "Q: How do I re-add \"free space\" partition back into a single drive? I created a 75gb partition to run Bootcamp but don't use it. I removed the partition through directions that said it would go back to a single disk. It did not.

I have fibre 100/100 Mbps WAN via my ISP, which has provided me a router of the brand \"Technicolor\". The router can create a Wi-Fi network, the 2GHz band uses 802.11/b/g/n and the 5GHz band uses 802.11a/n/ac.\nI also have an older Apple TimeCapsule 2011 model with 802.11a/b/g/n on both bands.\nI'm not proficient at networks, so I have for the past few years had the ISP router on the network at 192.168.1.1 where it does NAT and DHCP — and downstream I've had my TimeCapsule at 192.168.0.1 also performing NAT and DHCP to which I've had all my other network devices connected.\nThis configuration is Double NAT, which I have understood is bad or sub-optimal for P2P applications like BitTorrent, gaming, etc.\nMy reasoning has been that I don't trust the ISP/router manufacturer completely and that I would be safer with my devices behind the Apple router. But to be honest, this has been a loose assumption and I didn't have any facts to back up that a double NAT/DHCP configuration would be any safer than connecting all the devices to the first router.\n\nPrimary question:\nIs there any benefit to having my devices connected to the second router; the Apple TimeCapsule? My primary concern would be security and any Apple \"convenience\" aspects such as Back to My Mac support, etc.\nOne disadvantage is of course that the TimeCapsule's Wi-Fi speeds are dated, and I have devices that can use ac speeds.\n\nSecondary question:\nIf there in fact are advantages to having an Apple router behind the ISP router, how should I configure the network to avoid Double NAT? It seems that the ISP router can't be set in Bridge mode, and I think the ISP wouldn't like it bridged as they sometimes access it for diagnostics and pushing firmware updates.\n\nA: \nMy reasoning has been that I don't really trust the ISP/router\nmanufacturer completely and that I would be safer with my devices\nbehind the Apple Router.\n\nIf you don't trust the ISP router (I agree with this), use your own router.  Also, your Time Capsule is dated as you guessed so I would recommend replacing it with something newer and more modern.\nWhat you will need is the following:\n\n*\n\n*Put your Technicolor Router in Bridge Mode\n\n*New router/wireless access point(s)\n\nBridge Mode\nThis mode \"bridges\" two networks together, in this case, your network (which you will create with your router) and the ISP's network.  This will require you to have your own router because it turns of router/firewall functionality of the Technicolor (including NAT).\n\nIt seems the ISP router can't be set in Bridge mode, and I think the\nISP doesn't prefer that as they sometimes access it for diagnostics,\netc.\n\nIt can, it's just a feature they would rather you not use (you take them out of the loop for your internal networking).  As for diagnostics, they don't need it in firewall mode to service your modem - they work with it by addressing the MAC address, not the IP.\nNew Router\nYou could use the Time Capsule, but (IMO) you should get a new router with newer features, security capabilities and Wi-Fi protocols.  The Time Capsule doesn't give you any benefit other than having an all in one solution for your router and Time Machine backups.  You can still turn off the router/firewall function and just use it for network based backups if you like.\nWhich router?  Pretty much any router you buy off-the-shelf will work fine.\nMy recommendation\nI would use a pfSense router (open source and free) that's installed on a cheap PC.  There's an excellent YouTube video on this very build which you can follow.   Then for Wi-Fi, I went with a Ubiquiti access point.\nIs this overkill for a home? Yes.\nThis is a more \"enterprise\" grade setup than a consumer grade setup you would get with a router purchased from your local electronics retailer.  What I have found is that this is much more stable and reliable.  The off-the-shelf stuff (like Netgear, Linksys, Asus etc.) would die within 18 months.  I've been running my pfSense for 3 years now with no issues.  Updates are about as easy as updating your Mac.\n\nA: For the sake of simplicity, I would simply use your ISP router as your router. On the Time Capsule, turn off Wi-Fi, put it in bridge mode, connect it to the ISP router with Ethernet, and let it be just your backup device.\nIf the Time Capsule were newer, I'd probably suggest turning off Wi-Fi in the ISP modem, leaving Wi-Fi on, on the Time Capsule, and putting the Time Capsule into bridge mode. That way the ISP router would still be the router, but the Time Capsule would be the Wi-Fi and backup. \nBut given the Time Capsule's age, I think you're better off going with my first suggestion. Fully functional ISP router, Time Capsule in bridge mode/no Wi-Fi, connected via Ethernet. \nThe only advantages to connecting your devices to the Time Capsule over the ISP router, would be a more direct path to the backup drive, and potentially slightly faster backups. But this would most likely never be noticeable, it would only be an advantage under specific high network loads. It's essentially a non-issue. \nI highly recommend not running your own router built out of a PC. Unless your personal time and your electricity have no value to you. \n", "Q: Some Apps Appear in Mission Control but Not in the Application Switcher I was wondering why there is a discrepancy between the apps and windows that appear in Mission Control, versus those that show up in the application switcher (CMD+TAB). Mission Control always seem to show more apps and windows than the switcher, and offers the \"complete\" overlook on what's really running.\nHere is an example of two windows that are \"caught\" by Mission Control, but not the application switcher.\nFor example, the macoS Fonts window:\n\nOr the menu of Google's Backup & Sync Finder \"Share\" extension:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any logic and/or reasoning behind this discrepancy?\n\n*Is there any way to configure what will appear, and where?\n\n*Ideally, I would like all apps and windows (at the very least, those caught by Mission Control) to appear in the application switcher as well. How can I achieve this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Only applications that are present in the Dock are shown in the Switcher (⌘ cmd+⇥ tab). More specifically the apps that do not have the LSUIElement key in their Info.plist.\nTheoretically you can remove that key from the apps, that you want to see in the Switcher, but this can break the Code Signing.\nThe examples you've shown are not even the apps, but Panels (NSPanel). They are part of the app that is in focus (when you click on them, the current app in the menu does not change).\n3rd party app switchers are discussed there on AskDifferent.\nIf you want to check if a window is a Panel, you can use Accessibility Inspector app like so:\n\n", "Q: How do I get rid of \"phantom user\" after migration? I got a new Macbook so I used Migration Assistant to move all my content from the old Mac... my only used on the old mac was called 'user' and that is the only user I wanted to move to my new Mac.\nHalfway through the migration, however, the connection ended, so I just decided I would start it over again. However the 2nd time I did not have the option to overwrite the half-baked 'user' account. Hmm. So I just asked it to bring over 'user' as 'user2' on the new machine... then I figured when it finished, I would delete the original 'user' folder and account, rename user2 to user and be done.\nSo it is done. But now on my new Mac, I have 2 users in Users & Groups:\nuser\nuser2\nBUT only one user folder, /user, which appears to have all the content from the /user folder on the old Mac (i.e. it seems to have brought over everything okay there). No sign of a /user2 folder at all. Odd.\nI guess it sort of figured out that the first user was already set up and just used it, which is fine. I want to delete user2 from Users & Groups but the Mac freezes whenever I try to do that.\nHow can I delete the \"phantom\" user user2? I want to keep just 'user' and the main /user folder.\n\nA: It may seem like a bit of overkill, but I'd erase the new Mac, reinstall it's OS from scratch, then re-import the user again, properly, without interruption. \n", "Q: Slow initial app window opening, but only in certain situations?

System Report>Camera>No video capture devices were found\n\nUSB>Device Tree> No FaceTime HD Camera (inbuilt)listed \n\nWhat can be the cause for \"camera hardware failure\"? Could faulty iSight cam wifi antenna cable linkage between logic board and camera board (in display)result in Camera hardware not \"found\"?\n\nA: It could be the cable or the connector on the logic board.\n\nIn my experience, the most likely place the damage will occur is where the cable that combines Wi-Fi and the camera come together into a single connector or it will be the connector on the logic board itself.  It's highly unlikely that the cable/connector at the iSight camera will become damaged unless repairs were done there previously.\nNow, it's also entirely possible that your camera has failed (especially if Wi-Fi is still working.) \nThere are a few ways to diagnose this, but this involves using another cable and/or iSight camera.  If you don't have these items handy or you're not willing to purchase them (or perform this type of task), it's probably best that you take it in for service.\n\nA: Yes, a bad connection to the logic board or a shorted wire could result in hardware not being found. You should have this taken in to an Apple store to have it diagnosed.\n", "Q: Mail Preferences Dialog broken since TimeMachine re-installation I recently installed a SSD hard drive into my friends computer.

Quit out of all running apps and run the installer. It will take a while (depending on available disk space & speed) and then ask you to reboot.\nIf your install is still glitchy you may want to try one of the free OS cleaner programs out there.

I have a HTTPS website which is protected by basic authentication. When I use Safari on macOS to access this website, it will store my credentials (in the Keychain). However, Safari on iOS (11.2.6) refuses to do so. I can click on the key icon on the top right of the keyboard, but it will show only credentials from  form-based websites (the same list as in macOS Safari -> Preferences -> Passwords). Is there any way I can force Safari on iOS to remember these basic authentication credentials?\n\nA: Safari does not support saving the credentials for basic authentication. That's why you're not asked to store it.\nThere are basically three work-arounds you can use:\nThe first is simply to create a bookmark that contains your credentials. Note that this should only be done if the credentials aren't \"important\" - like for example if this is one of those commercial web sites that allow anyone in that knows that this year's password is \"2019\" or something like that. Then you can create a bookmark for the URL like this:\nhttp://user:pass@website.com/\n\nWhen you open that bookmark, you'll not be asked for credentials, but will be logged in automatically.\nIf you require an ordinary amount of security regarding the saved credentials, you can instead use a different work around. On your device, access Settings and then Passwords & Accounts and then App & Website Passwords. At the top is a + icon that you can click to add your web site and the username and password.\nContrary to form based password authentication, the information you enter there will not be automatically filled out. However when you get the username/password popup, you have the option of clicking the little \"key\" icon to select the stored credentials.\nThe third possible work-around is to use a Mac logged in to the same iCloud account with Keychain enabled. Access the web site using Safari on the Mac, and you'll be able to store the credentials.\nOn the iOS device the credentials will not be automatically filled out, but you will be able to press the \"lock\" icon in the popup to allow choosing the credentials you've stored on the Mac.\n\nA: In iOS 15, Settings > Passwords allows adding new entries by hand. You can fill in the website URL and the credentials here. The next time the basic auth dialog shows up, it will not, unfortunately, be pre-filled, but you will be presented with the Passwords button in your on-screen keyboards once you focus either of the username / password fields and from there you can pick the credentials. It's not completely straight-forward, but it is the best option I found, especially because some websites do not support reading the username and password from the URL, only from the HTTP header, so the trick with the bookmark with the credentials in it doesn't work everywhere.\n\nA: From this Apple Support article:\n\nIf Safari won't save the password for one of the websites that you're using\nSome websites request that passwords not be saved. Safari won't save\n  or autofill account names and passwords on those sites.\n\nThis is most likely the case here.\nAlso when you sign-in you for the first time you might have clicked \"don't remember password\"\n\nA: In Safari and Firefox it's not possible. Using the Brave browser it's possible to save the password. But it's sometimes buggy and keeps asking. Still better than Safari.\n", "Q: Why does my Asus PB277Q screen keep waking up while the Mac it is connected to is sleeping? Whenever I put my Macbook Pro running High Sierra to sleep my Asus PB277Q keeps waking up displaying a blue screen saying 'HDMI no signal' every few seconds, forever. Some other times it sleeps normally, and I can't tell what is causing the behavior. \nFrom what I can tell the Mac itself is asleep. It makes no sound, Bluetooth is off, Wake for network access is off, sharing (internet for example) is off, removing USB devices changes nothing. The screen is connected to a Displayport to HDMI/DVI/VGA adapter, which in turn is connected to the screen over an HDMI cable. \nAny ideas what else I can try?\n\nA: This is because this monitor is for 75 hz but in high sierra or later I think this feature not work good now, I have this monitor and I have this problem, but you can use this monitor with your make, you go to display settings, select this monitor and change HZ 75 to 60 and it's works good. \n", "Q: How can I stop the Photos app showing the \"What's New Photos\" screen every time I launch it?

I have to click the \"Get Started\" button to access my library, which works every time, but is a bit of a nuisance.\n\nThis seems like a bug in the app, but perhaps there's some sort of work-around. Does anyone have any tips?\n\nA: This problem eventually disappeared in some minor version upgrade of macOS Mojave I believe (possibly even the upgrade to Mojave itself). I then had the problem that occasionally Photos.app would \"forget\" that I had set my system photo library to one on an external drive, which was less bad, but still not ideal.

Today, I reset the NVRAM/PRAM by pressing Command + Option + R + P and it's been an hour and the computer is working just fine. Is it likely that the logic board is the real problem and is it work investigating/replacing myself? I am about to gift this laptop to kid who needs it for school and I don't want to give him a broken laptop. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: \nI went to Apple Care and they quoted me $700 to fix the issue, which I think they said was the logic board...Is it likely that the logic board is the real problem?\n\nIf apple ran in house diagnostics on the machine and told you that you had a faulty logic board, then the logic board needs to be replaced. The issue could specifically be the with the integrated graphics component of your CPU, but it's a moot point since it still requires that the logic board needs replacement. \nThis is a hardware issue for which no troubleshooting can ameliorate the problem or make it disappear. This problem will only get worse; inevitably (and without warning) the logic board will completely die and the computer will not boot. \n\nIs it worth investigating/replacing myself?\n\nThat's subjective. According to iFixit, the OEM part costs either $400 or $600 dollars depending on which processor you have. In addition, factor in the cost of necessary tools and difficulty of fixing it. Draw your decision based on the cost/benefit of doing it yourself vs. taking it to Apple. \nBest of luck. \n", "Q: Finder displays Refresh and X symbols instead of Eject for external storage device?

After replugging the device, the unusual symbols did not reappear.\nCan someone link me to documentation regarding the meaning of this (preferably on Apple's Support site)?\n\nA: I can't find a support document that directly addresses your question, but I'm pretty sure that those icons represent a disk that is in use and can't be ejected.\n\nA: Agreeing with previous answer from @calion, adding link to Apple's published System Icon standards:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/icons-and-images/system-icons/\nThis means Finder will not simply let you \"eject\" that removable media as it is currently in use - if you were to look in your Time Machine preference pane in sysprefs, you'd most likely see a backup in mid-progress.\nGiven that you are uncertain of this, I strongly recommend that you change your Time Machine prefs: select the checkbox for \"Show Time Machine in menu bar\" so that you have an ever-present telltale there for when Time Machine is actively backing up.\n", "Q: How to download photos from iMac desktop to external drive (WD 1 TB My Passport ) Bought a new iMac desktop and want to download loads of photos to an external drive I just bought (WD 1 TB My Passport.  I clicked initialize but still can't figure out how to download the photos to it.\n\nA: It's likely that the problem you are having is that the drive as shipped is formatted as NTFS, which works fine on a Windows computer but is a read-only format on a Mac.\nRun Disk Utility, which is found in the \"Utilities\" folder in \"Applications\" and you can erase the drive and turn it into a Mac formatted drive. Select \"GUID Partition Map\" for the Scheme and \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" as the format. If you want to use the drive under both Mac and Windows then select \"ExFAT\" as the format.\n(If you are running High Sierra then you will need to select \"Show All Devices\" under the \"View\" pop up at the left of the window to see the physical drive.)\n\n", "Q: Do iPhones use active scanning to find Wi-Fi networks when Ask to Join Networks is off? I'm looking into security holes in my daily life, and I ran across an article that says that most devices broadcast their MAC address continuously. I'm wondering if that applies to iPhones (and other iDevices) as well. I would expect them to use active scanning when Ask to Join Networks is on, or if you are actually in the Wi-Fi Settings (though I don't know that that is the case), but what about normally? Is my iPhone broadcasting its identity everywhere it goes as long as the Wi-Fi is on? \n\nA: Since iOS8 the MAC is randomised while scanning for wi-fi networks. I believe that has since been adopted by most devices.\nThe REAL MAC is only used after connection to a network.\n", "Q: Apps No Longer Download When I click an app to download it, It’ll start spinning and stay like that for a while.

In this case, I've chosen to monitor for all of it, but you can choose smaller elements instead.

However if the browser is not maximized, then the new window opens as a dialog. I need it to be a dialog (not new tab) always.\nThis behavior is same in all browsers tried - Safari, Chrome, Firefox. So it seems to be a setting of the OS itself.\nFound one setting Apple menu > System Preferences > Dock > Prefer tabs when opening documents with options Always | In Full Screen Only | Manually, but changing these does not change the described behaviour.\nIs there any setting affecting this?\n(On Windows OS both Chrome and Firefox works as expected - they open dialog windows regardless of the browser being maximized or not.)\n\nA: I have figured out a fix to this using Firefox 58.0.2. Firefox 59 slightly breaks this functionality - it opens as a new window in a new macOS space instead of a floating popup.\nI don't have fixes for Chrome and Safari or Firefox 59, but I am certain they are possible.\n(If you require Firefox 58.0.2, you can find it on Mozilla's FTP here. You will likely want to disable Firefox auto-updates, but this will compromise your security in the long run.)\nIn the address bar, type in about:config and hit enter.\nOn the warning page, click \"I accept the risk\". As long as you don't mess with other settings, your browser should remain safe.\nIn the search field, type link. - this will help us narrow down to the two settings we want to change.\nDouble click on browser.link.open_newwindow.disabled_in_fullscreen to set the boolean to false.\nDouble click on browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction and set 1 as the value and click OK.\nThis should force Firefox to open popups like the one you have as a new window that floats on top of the fullscreen window. Again, if you use Firefox 59, the popup will make a new window, but it will go to a new space instead of floating.\n\n", "Q: Macbook pro (2011) failing to start I have a 'slight' issue with my macbook and was wondering if anyone could help me please. \nModel: A1278 (EMC 2419*)\nMacBook Pro \"Core i5\" 2.3 13\" Early 2011\nOS: Yosemite\nThe machine one day abruptly switched off while in use.

I'm thinking about testing my apps using Appetize.io, but to do that I would still need a MAC machine to be able to build the app and upload to appetize. Is there any workaround for that?\n\nA: You need Xcode to build, sign and upload your app; it also is advisable to test it on real hardware (aka an iPhone) before releasing it.

Equality between disk images containing the same contents is not a practical requirement of the format.\nUUID within the 0x6B6F6C79 / koly Block\nWithin the dmg file format is the koly structure. This structure includes a SegmentID of type uuid_t. This is a 128 bit Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). The SegmentID identifier alone will ensure that every dmg file differs by more than one bit.\nUsing HFSleuth on the iTunes 11.0 disk image shows the embedded UUID:\nHFSleuth> ver\nVerbose output is on\nHFSleuth> fs iTunes11.dmg\nKOLY header found at 200363895:\n    UDIF version 4, Header Size: 512\n    Flags:1\n    Rsrc fork: None\n    Data fork: from 0, spanning 200307220 bytes\n    XML plist: from 200307220, spanning 56675 bytes (to 200363895)\n    Segment #: 1, Count: 1\n    Segment UUID: 626f726e-7743259b-6086eb93-4b42fb65\n    Running Data fork offset 0\n    Sectors: 1022244\n\nIn the example above, the line Segment UUID: 626f726e-7743259b-6086eb93-4b42fb65 is a universally unique identifier embedded in the disk image.\nOne Bit Differences and Hash Functions\nA difference in one bit should result in a 50% or more change in a cryptographic hash function output, such as SHA-2.\nThe use of a UUID within the structure is not to ensure every disk image is unique but to ease segment identification within the disk image. That a UUID provides uniqueness properties beyond the scope of the disk image is a by-product of the UUID's use.\n", "Q: Redial Last Incoming Call without Unlocking Phone I left my iPhone X running iOS 11 at a casino.

The process happens in the background while your Mac is awake and plugged in.\nFileVault encryption or decryption can take hours or days to complete, depending on your disk size and type. You simply have to be patient and let it finish. Portable Macs are required to be plugged in to decrypt or encrypt, so keep it plugged in and on if you want it to complete in a timely manner.\nYour encryption or decryption will pause when asleep, shut down, or unplugged, and it will resume when awake and plugged in.\nSee the following for more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Support: Use FileVault to encrypt the startup disk on your Mac\n\n*University of California: Use FileVault to encrypt your Mac\n\n*Backblaze: All about FileVault: Encryption for your Mac\n\n*University of Victoria: Encrypt a disk using FileVault 2: Mac\nThe question about your mouse and keyboard issue is, at the time of writing, very unclear and may be better suited for another separate question. It's highly unlikely that FileVault will have an impact on your built-in keyboard or trackpad.\n", "Q: How to install a virtual environment of Python in macOS First steps with Python, I am trying to run Python in a virtual environment in macOS.\nI Googled \"install virtual environment python mac\" and got a link for this.\nWhen I typed in Terminal:\n$ pip install virtualenv\n\nI got a \"command not found\".\nIs there a simple, well-explained (meaning for dumb, GUI-raised people like me) way to install a virtual environment for Python on macOS somewhere online? I would love if I didn't feel helpless every step of the way (long-distance goal: being able to run this).\n\nA: I would install another python as this will allow you to put new packages in  consistent places. Apple's python as you note is missing pip. (and does not put packages where your linked page says) (Although the web site you show does have a page telling you how to install pip)\nI would also use python3 unless you have a good reason not to. Which again means install another python. \nYou can either install plain python from https://www.python.org/ This python includes pip but that needs to be upgraded as per pip's website This installation will have to be done under sudo.\nOtherwise you can use a packaged solution e.g. Macports or Homebrew - which I would use if you want a lot of C libraries or like Anaconda which is just a python packager.\n(I  would normally say that Anaconda is the best for new users as it includes more ) However CUDA is low level code and the USEAGE for the FastPhotoStyle does say that it has only been tested under OS: Ubuntu 16.04 So I would not expect it to run under MacOS.\n", "Q: Blinking yellow light on my Apple Time Capsule What does a blinking yellow light on my 2TB Time Capsule indicate?

Synching contacts and Keychain and Find My Mac continue to work correctly.\nYesterday, bookmark order and organization became random. \nI tried to flush the Bookmarks data in iCloud by manually erasing the bookmarks on both computers, until both Bookmark lists were empty, then re-adding them (with a Bookmarks.plist file from my Time Machine backup) to one computer.

The tech said he saw nothing awry in iCloud's status. We traipsed over the same ground I described in my original post, and the bookmarks continued to spontaneously randomize. Finally, he suggested disconnecting both Macs and the iPhone from iCloud, clearing all bookmarks, and importing the backup Bookmarks.plist file into Safari yet again. After then seeing the Bookmarks in correct order in Safari on the MacBook Pro, we exported the Bookmarks (File > Export Bookmarks) as an .html file.\nWith both Macs and the iPhone cleared of all the bookmarks, and still disconnected from iCloud, the .html file Bookmarks were then imported back into Safari on the MacBook Pro. The bookmarks appeared in Safari, in proper order (although one level down within an \"Imported 3-23-18\" folder - that was going to be easy to fix). iCloud synching of Safari was then re-enabled, and the Bookmarks propagated, remaining in correct order.\nPerhaps the Bookmarks.plist file, backed up from one computer, had some oddity that tripped iCloud, or the other computer. In any event, adding the export/import in .html step apparently made the difference. The Bookmarks are now in correct order, and remain so.\n\nA: Give iCloudKit time.

What's the window drawer?\n\n*\"Move focus to status menus\". What are the status menus?\n\n\nThank you!\n\nA: \n\"Move focus to active or next window\". If I have multiple windows running, what's the \"active\" or \"next\" one?\n\nThis will put the focus on the topmost window of the currently active application ( which itself can be toggled by super+tab / Command+Tab ). This allows you to input keyboard commands to that window even if it somehow lost focus.\nIf the topmost window already has focus, it will rotate to the next-topmost window, regardless of which application it belongs to. This might cycle through a mixed set of Finder windows and Chrome windows based on this 'z-index'. This is the order they visually appear in, such as which was most recently clicked or opened.\n\n\"Move focus to the window toolbar\". What's the window toolbar?\n\nThis is a kind of control that some OS X native applications use. In Finder you can see it is used to select the kind of file view to display (icons/list/etc). Not many applications seem to have bothered with this.\n\n\"Move focus to the floating window\". What is the floating window?\n\nThis is a kind of special window that some OS X native applications use. It remains on top. Not many applications seem to have bothered with this.\n\n\"Move focus to next window\". What's the next window? And how does this shortcut differs from the first one in this list?\n\nThis will move the focus to the next window of the currently active application. Switching between multiple Chrome windows, for instance. It will not, unlike the \"Move focus to active or next window\" function, select windows belonging to a different application.\n\n\"Move focus to the window drawer\". What's the window drawer?\n\nThis is a kind of control that certain OS X native applications have in their interface. Not many applications seem to have bothered with this.\n\n\"Move focus to status menus\". What are the status menus?\n\nThe status menus are the items in the top right corner on default settings. This include the clock and your username (the logout/shutdown menu),  as well as any icons added by applications.\n\nThey really could have been named better, or have tooltips, but a lot of the descriptions would likely be oxymoronic as they aren't easy to explain in a vacuum. Some of the issues appear to be the legacy features in OS X that were intended for use by app developers that didn't become very well known or popular.\nCorrections or additional examples are are welcomed in the comments.\n\nA: The easiest way to see the behavior is to try the shortcuts. For example, the window toolbar is the top part of the Windows (where the find field is, and possibly other buttons). The floating window might or might not be there, but the help window is a floating window, among others.\nOpen a few windows and test. Most of them will start to make sense.\n\nA: I was wondering the same thing until I came across this link:\nhttps://flylib.com/books/en/2.963.1.226/1/\n", "Q: Restore from Time Machine backup from within macOS I want to restore a remote Time Machine backup on a fresh install of macOS.\nFrom what I've read, you need to do this from the Recovery Mode (Command+R).

I own an Apple watch series 2 and I've recorded my heart rate during sleep for a week now. Twice during this period my heart rate during sleep shot up to around 110 for 1.5 to 2 hours and that seems very suspicious to me.\nSince I don't have any sleep problems (that i know of) I was wondering whether this was an inaccuracy of the heart rate sensor.\nSo I wanted to know whether there is some consistent way to trick the sensor into recording double the actual heart rate (e.g. by pressing the watch against the wrist or something).\n\nA: If you are concerned, you need to see a doctor.\nThat being said, dreaming and nightmares during normal REM sleep increase your blood pressure and heart rate. REM sleep lasts, on average, for about 20% of your total sleep time.\nTo calibrate your watch, you could always purchase a relatively inexpensive heart rate monitor to see if both devices sense the increase, and how accurate they are in comparison.\n\nA: I have not heard of cases where the Apple Watch consistently records the double actual hearts for hours on end. If I were you, I would use a different type of device to measure your heart rate to ensure that you are actually seeing bad readings and not some kind of health problem.\nApple has a support page with tips on how to get the most accurate heart rate measurements:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207941\nIn my own experience the most important is ensuring a good fit on the wrist. If you can easily get the watch too \"loose\" when moving around in bed, consider using a different kind of strap.\n", "Q: AppleScript move tab Is there a way to move tab using the tab number in Google Chrome ?\nsomething like this :\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    set activeIndex to get active tab index of window 1\n    tell window 1\n        set TheTab to move tab 3 after third tab \n    end tell\n    set active tab index of window 1 to activeIndex\nend tell\n\nobviously the code is not valid \n\nA: I do not believe this is possible using the Chromium suite.\n\n\n*\n\n*Window provides the property ‘active tab index’ as get/set, however setting this only changes which tab the window has active, rather than setting the index of the tab itself (i.e. it changes the active tab to an entirely different tab).\n\n*One can get the ‘active tab’ from the window, but tab itself does not provide any relevant commands.\n\n*A new tab without focusing can only be created at the end of the list of tabs of a particular window.\n\n", "Q: Changing file metadata from CLI that will show in Finder Finder has columns you can sort files by: Name, Size, Kind, Date, Comment, etc. These are shown as headers when Finder is in \"List\" mode, with respective file properties shown below.\n\n\n*\n\n*If I Cmd+I a file, and change Comments to FOO, mdls shows FOO and Finder shows FOO.\n\n*If I set Comments to BAR from Terminal, mdls shows \"BAR\", but Finder still shows \"FOO\"!\n\n\nHow can I change the \"Comment\" field from Terminal so the change propagates to Finder?\n$ xattr -w com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment \"BAR\" test.txt\n$ mdls test.txt\nkMDItemFinderComment = \"BAR\"\n\nUpdate: I noticed that when using Finder / AppleScript, Comment is set to a Binary Property List containing the value.

Often, it's better--at least in my mind—to try and use an element's id, which provides a unique attribute by which to select an element:\ndocument.getElementById('idnamehere').click();\n\nTo run this code from Google Chrome by way of AppleScript, the general form looks like this:\n    set js to \"document.getElementsByClassName('classnamehere')[0].click();\"\n\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to tell ¬\n        the front window to tell ¬\n        the active tab to ¬\n        set jsResult to execute javascript js\n\nThe important feature about execute javascript is that it must be directed to a specific tab in Google Chrome.  You can't send the command to a window or the application object.  So:\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to ¬\n        execute javascript js\n\nwill throw an error (even on the assumption that you had defined js).\nThe syntax can also take this form:\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to tell front window to ¬\n        set jsResult to execute of tab 1 javascript js\n\nor this form:\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to tell front window to ¬\n        (execute javascript js) in front tab\n\nIn each of these commands, the javascript is being told to execute in a specific tab.\nYou haven't yet specified what \"detailed\" refers to, and when you do, I can update this answer accordingly.  Working on the assumption that it's either a class name or an id of an HTML element, you can use one of the expressions at the top and plug it straight into the code examples I gave you.  So, you might use the JavaScript method getElementsByClassName, which would take this form:\ndocument.getElementsByClassName('detailed')[0].click();\n\nwhere [0] could end up being changed to [1], [2], etc. depending how many other elements have this class name.  What I would then do is define my AppleScript variable js to hold the JavaScript command for me:\n    set js to \"document.getElementsByClassName('detailed')[0].click();\"\n\nthen tell the active tab in Chrome to execute it:\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        tell active tab of window 1 to ¬\n            execute javascript js\n    end tell\n\nThe execute command will always return a value, even if it's just an empty string.  Therefore, if you wish, you can assign that value to a variable in AppleScript to use later in your script:\n    set jsResult to the result\n\nOr, more directly:\n    set jsResult to execute javascript js\n\n", "Q: localhost refused to connect after upgrading to High Sierra After upgrading Mac to High Sierra and some other upgrades there is a problem connecting to localhost.\nActually, upgrading to High Sierra was OK but according to the Mac update history the last update was to MacOS High Sierra 10.13.3 Supplemental Update.

Googling these errors doesn't seem to turn up anything but the original source files so I'm pretty sure I'm barking up the wrong tree.\nLooking in /Volumes/dotty (my install partition) showed a pretty sparse file system, with one main directory (macOS install data or similar). Using bless and trying to specify the apfs.efi file that is buried in the install files is of no avail; I get similar errors to those above that I won't type out here.\nIt looks like the install may have frozen for some reason. What else can I try?\n\nA: It seems to work now after one more tweak; I posted the question because I hope it's of use to some other lost soul.\nI tried erasing the SSD once more with Disk Utility. This time I did two things differently: 1) I used the default name 'Untitled' for the disk, and 2) I used the default 'Mac OS Extended' option for the file system instead of APFS when erasing the disk. This time the OS install proceeded successfully past the first reboot.\nThing #2 is probably what matters, but it's unclear why. It is also possible that some of the dinking around with bless had something to do with the success this time, but I doubt it.\n", "Q: Completely disable a keyboard shortcut for one application When using Microsoft Remote Desktop, I frequently find myself accidentally trying to close browser tabs with ⌘W (which is mapped to \"Close Connection\" by default).  I was at least able to stop it from closing the connection every time by mapping it to one of the help menu options, but it's still annoying to have a window pop up every time I do it.\nWhat I really want is for it to do nothing, but all I can find is how to assign a different key combination to the command (which doesn't work in this case for some reason, it just adds it as a second shortcut in addition to ⌘W) or how to assign the key combination to a different command. Is there any way to disable the shortcut entirely instead?\nUpdate: this seems to specifically be a problem with Microsoft Remote Desktop version 8.\n\nA: This works on MS RDC v10 but not the old v8.\nReplacing Close  Cmd ⌘   W  with a 'garbage' command effectively removes the hot key from the interface - though it doesn't make it work as Close Tab in Windows, it seems to just ignore it.\n Ctrl ⌃   W  does close tabs [as expected].\n\n", "Q: Cannot empty iCloud trash folder I've had this infuriating problem for quite some time now, where I can't empty my Trash. More specifically, every time I empty it, there's a folder called temp(1) that keeps reappearing in there after a while. I managed to determine this folder comes from iCloud (specifically the .trash folder under the iCloud library folder). I have no idea how all that information got in there (I had no idea iCloud has its own trash folder), but it's been there for a while apparently.\n\n\nI've tried everything I could think of to remedy this:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the .trash folder from the console\n\n*rename it\n\n*move it to other iCloud tracked folder (like Desktop)\n\n*delete it using the iCloud web interface\n\n*delete it from my iPhone\n\n\nNo matter what I do, it keeps reappearing. It's driving me insane. My guess is that there's some server side error and the iCloud storage server can't remove this folder, so that's why it keeps getting resurrected. Any idea what I can do in this case?\n\nA: I found out why this was happening. I have a Windows box which I completely forgot I installed iCloud on. For some reason, that temp folder would not get deleted on the Windows machine, and it was re-uploaded to iCloud every night. That's why it was re-appearing on the other devices.\nAfter deleting the folder from the Windows machine, the issue stopped happening. Case closed.\n\nA: For me it was the hidden .Trash folder on the PC in the iCloud Drive folder in my Windows User Profile folder, for some reason neither deleting within iCloud nor Emptying the trash on my Mac sync'd as such on Windows thus they stayed in .trash hidden folder in Windows. I  guess when iCloud on the PC sync'd it put them back in iCloud.\n", "Q: How to set Inbox by Gmail as the default email client in Safari (macOS) I use Safari as my main browser on macOS.\nI would like Inbox by Gmail to be my default email client so that it opens mailto: links.\nIs that possible?\n\nA: It's not straightforward, but doable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Safari, install the mailto: extension, then go to Safari > Preferences > Extensions > mailto: > Options > Custom URL and add the following template:\nhttps://inbox.google.com/?to={to}&cc={cc}&bcc={bcc}&subject={subject}&body={body}\n\n\n*Restart Safari\n\n*Open Mail, then go to Mail > Preferences > General > Default email reader > Select > Safari\nAnd you are done!

My main goal is to get it working. Currently I'm trying to install El Capitan which is somehow not possible (details below).\nIt came with firmware password so I cleared it with NVRAM hack. Unfortunately it enabled SIP, so USB is not working after OS boot. It's getting voltage but not operating.\nThen I started to deal with boot options (order as on apple support page):\n\n\n*\n\n*Safe mode - SIP still enabled -> USB not working\n\n*Startup manager - I've created (with transmac, i will try on another mac with createinstallmedia) bootable OS X El Capitan USB (with ignore ownership unchecked) -> prohibited. \n\n\nI've also switched HDD, it turned out it has WinXP installed -> USB not operating\n\n\n*AHT / Diagnostics not working -> OS booting, no power on USB. Internet AHT -> prohibited.\n\n*NetBoot - don't have one -> skipped\n\n*Recovery. None of the options working, all result in prohibited sign.\n\n*NVRAM / PRAM reset. Yup, I've tried, didn't change anything.\n\n*Single-user mode - Freezes on right after [PCI configuration begin]\n\n*Target disk mode - not needed now, skipped\n\n*Verbose mode - USB not operating, gets to login screen though.\n\n\nIs anything left I haven't try? Or I would choose having expensive paperweight or letting apple service manage to run this.\n\nA: Your Mac is too old to support Internet Recovery. So it seems like you have three options:\nA) You can dig the InstallESD.dmg out of the El Capitan installer app (see below), and burn that to a DVD, then boot off that DVD to wipe the hard drive and reinstall the OS.\nor\nB) Get another older Mac that is running 10.7 thru 10.11. Boot yours with the T button held down, into Target Disk mode. Plug it in to the other Mac via Firewire. You can erase the drive from the other Mac, and then install El Capitan from there. Run the installer on the other Mac, and when you get to the screen where you choose the disk, just choose the disk of your Mac mini. Only Macs running 10.11 or older will let you run the 10.11 installer. \nor\nC) If you can'd do either of these, you could do a bit of a hybrid of the two. If you have access to another Mac that is newer, and you have a Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter, you can still boot the mini into Target Disk mode. Then from the newer Mac, erase the hard drive. Then partition the drive into one small 10 GB partition, and one bigger partition. Get the El Capitan installer, extract the InstallerESD.dmg image out of it, and 'Restore' it using Disk Utility, to the 10 GB partition. You can then reboot the mini off of that partition, and install the OS on the bigger partition. Once that is done and you're running off the new OS, you can go into Disk Utility and delete the smaller partition. \nOption 3 is a bit more complicated but it should work.\nIf you don't have access to ANY other Macs, or any install DVDs, then you might be out of luck until you can get access.\nTo get the InstallerESD.dmg disk image out of the El Capitan installer:\n- Right click on the Install OS X El Capitan.app and choose \"Show Package Contents\"\n- From there, navigate to Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg\n- Just drag that disk image to your desktop and work with it from there.\n", "Q: Change default app for file extension I just set up default app for certain file extension by mistake.

I'm considering to get a new external HD for my Mac setup. While I have an old MBP 2013, I'm planning to buy a new Mac this year (possibly iMac).\nWhich is more future proof? USB-C or Thunderbolt 3?\n\nA: USB-C it's the physical interface. A USB-C connector can hold either USB (up to 3.1) or Thunderbolt interface.\nUSB 3.1 has a data signaling rate of up to 10 gigabits per second, whilst Thunderbolt has a data signaling rate of up to 40 gigabits per second.\nThe faster Thunderbolt connection will ensure a more future proof hard drive.\n", "Q: How to turn off notifications sounds when OS X is in Do Not Disturb mode?

return as a string but not otherwise)\nset myDate to date string of (current date)\n\nQuestion 2: can I create a script to tell me if the difference between date 2 and date 3 are within 60 days or outside 60 days?\n\nA: Question 1: Rather than going through the trouble of obtaining the current date only to convert it to another format, you can obtain it in the right format straight away with a bash command:\n    do shell script \"date +'%m/%d/%Y'\"\n        --> 03/24/2018\n\nQuestion 2: First, reformat the date into that which your system can recognise.  In your case (and mine), it's dd/mm/yyyy:\n    set [M, ordinal, Y] to the words of \"June 2nd, 2012\"\n\n    set the text item delimiters to {\"st\", \"nd\", \"rd\", \"th\"}\n    set cardinal to (first text item of ordinal) --> \"2\"\n    set cardinal to text -1 thru -2 of (\"0\" & cardinal) --> \"02\"\n\n    set the text item delimiters to space\n    set date_string to {M, cardinal, Y} as text\n\n    -- date -j -f '%B %d %Y' 'June 02 2012' +'%d/%m/%Y'\n    set command to {¬\n        \"date -j -f '%B %d %Y'\", ¬\n        quoted form of the date_string, ¬\n        \"+'%d/%m/%Y'\"}\n\n    do shell script (command as text) --> \"02/06/2012\"\n\nThen subtract one date from the current date, and divide by days to get the number of days between the two dates:\n    ((current date) - (date result)) / days\n        --> 2121.627\n\nPS.  You can use that same shell command to convert the date into your first format, mm/dd/yyyy, simply by switching %d and %m at the end of the command string.\n\nADDENDUM:\nI thought I'd also show you how to convert the third date string into your desired format using pure AppleScript.  It can be done rather quite elegantly, actually:\n    set today to \"Saturday 24 March 2018\"\n\n    set [_day, _month, _year] to [day, month, year] of date today\n        --> {24, March, 2018}\n\n    set _month to _month * 1 --> 3\n    set _month to text -1 thru -2 of (\"0\" & _month) --> \"03\"\n\n    set the text item delimiters to \"/\"\n    return {_month, _day, _year} as string\n        --> \"03/24/2018\"\n\nNote to other users: The code in this addendum may or may not work for you, depending on your system settings.  AppleScript is notoriously fussy about what it will and will not recognise as a date string.  The OP and I appear to have similar or identical Language & Region date settings, which allows the variable today to be interpreted correctly as a date by AppleScript, whilst the same code running on a different system would throw an error.\nTo adapt the code here for use on your own system, first run the command get date string of (current date) to get a preview of the date format used by your system, then change the variable declaration for today to match.  Alternatively, set the variable today to the date string of (current date).\n\nA: Coerce your date into an AppleScript date object, then you can perform calculation such as set myNewDate to myDate + (2 * days). For more date calculations, see Date-/Time-Calculations using AppleScript and AppleScript Language Guide - Date.\nBelow is an alternative approach to parsing the third, more verbose, date format. This approach uses sub-routines to split and trim the input. It is not complete but hopefully useful:\nset myDate to \"March 1st, 2018\"\nset myComponents to my split(myDate, \" \")\n\nset myDay to second item of myComponents\nset myDay to trim(\",rdsth\", myDay) as integer\n\nset myMonth to first item of myComponents\nset myYear to last item of myComponents as integer\n\n-- ...myDay, myMonth, and myYear are usable\n\n-- http://erikslab.com/2007/08/31/applescript-how-to-split-a-string/\non split(theString, theDelimiter)\n    -- save delimiters to restore old settings\n    set oldDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    -- set delimiters to delimiter to be used\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to theDelimiter\n    -- create the array\n    set theArray to every text item of theString\n    -- restore the old setting\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelimiters\n    -- return the result\n    return theArray\nend split\n\n-- https://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=18519\non trim(theseCharacters, someText)\n    -- Lazy default (AppleScript doesn't support default values)\n    if theseCharacters is true then set theseCharacters to ¬\n        {\" \", tab, ASCII character 10, return, ASCII character 0}\n\n    repeat until first character of someText is not in theseCharacters\n        set someText to text 2 thru -1 of someText\n    end repeat\n\n    repeat until last character of someText is not in theseCharacters\n        set someText to text 1 thru -2 of someText\n    end repeat\n\n    return someText\nend trim\n\n", "Q: How to make the \"Don't save\" or \"delete\" options the default? I often start up an app to do something quickly, e.g. quicktime, record some audio, check it out, then I'll ⌘Q out of it.\nI don't know about other people but generally for me ⌘Q means \"be gone as fast as possible\"\nI always get prompted with these though:\n\n\nCan I make the \"Delete\" or \"Don't save\"-type options the default?\nSo I can just hit enter when the dialogue appears and quit the app without saving any changes to that document?\n\nA: Command Backspace (⌘⌫)\nThis works in all the apps I've tried (Preview, QuickTime, ScriptEditor):\n\n*\n\n*⌘Q to ask to quit, then\n\n*⌘⌫ to quit without saving.\n\nIt seems ⌘⌫ selects the Don't Save equivalent in all these dialogues.\n\nA: The options you want to make the default, are the options that are the most likely to cause data loss, and so they are not the default for a reason. However, you mentioned quitting using the ⌘Q key, so you’re not afraid to use keyboard shortcuts.\nI mention this because the Mac OS usually allows you to select a button in a dialog by hitting ⌘ and the first letter of the button’s text. In the ‘Delete’ or ‘Don’t save’ case, this would mean you can dismiss the dialog and not save by hitting ⌘D. For ‘Revert’, hit ⌘R.\nIt’s not as convenient as ⌘Q and Enter, but it’s still two keystrokes.

What exactly does Activity Monitor's Memory column mean?\nHow come in the example situation below (from a macOS High Sierra system) the Real Mem column is greater than the Memory column? \nAccording to a previous question How is the \"Memory\" column calculated in Activity Monitor?, one might expect that Real Mem should always be less than or equal to Memory, which apparently is not always true.\n\nEdit:\nThis behavior is not only applicable for the kernel task but also to other processes. For example, in the screenshot below we see a couple Google Chrome Helpers experiencing the same behavior, where Real Mem > Memory. The same can be seen with Dock, Notes, Spotlight, Facetime.\n\n\nA: The kernel is special - it's the micro system that actually allocates memory and runs the virtual memory. You can just assume 3.60 GB is what your kernel has claimed and that 1.86 GB of that corresponds to what the task itself needs and the rest is the overhead / allocations to support all the demands made on the Mach kernel.\nEvery other line in Activity monitor behaves as one might expect, adding up fairly clearly once you ignore the kernel numbers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Total virtual memory allocation is always the largest. Most of that is unallocated / not mapped physically and not in any category listed.\n\n*Real Mem is the non-shared and non-compressed allocation to that task.\n\n*Compressed Memory is the part of the total memory that has been compressed before being actively stored.\n\n*Private and Shared are both real memory usage but indicate if other processes might also need or be responsible for that allocation against the total.\n\n\nFor a larger discussion of the kernel_task, this question has some great links and discussion of how kernel_task is so very different than the rest of the processes you see on macOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*What exactly does kernel_task do?\n", "Q: Some iTunes URL generate 404 response from python but still work when you browse them from a web browser I am using python requests to get itunes URL responses. \nfor some links it works and for others it doesn't, for example:\nworking - https://itunes.apple.com/SA/app/id944846798?ls=1&mt=8\nnot working - https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1029783189?mt=8 \n(getting a 404 error)\nI noticed that the difference between the 2 links is that if i paste the working one in the browser, it opens it correctly, and if i paste the non-working one, it tries to open itunes and get stuck.\nI tried few user-agents, for example:\n\n\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101\n  Firefox/57.0\"\n\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36\n  (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3188.0 Safari/537.36\"\n\nSince spoofing a user agent isn't enough for my python tool to appear like a web browser, Is there something else I can try? \n\nA: I found a way to bypass it. \nIt seems that itunes is sending back a 404 response for some applications, especially (from what i've seen) if they have restricted content such as gambling.\nthe way get around it is instead of sending a request to the main apple store like here \n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/id1029783189?mt=8\n\none should send the request to the local appstore.\nIn this example case, the Australian one:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/au/app/id1029783189\n\nThanks for everyone who tried to help.\n", "Q: How do I enable syntax highlighting in vim on Mac? How do I enable syntax highlighting in vim on Mac?\n\nA: 2022 Edit\nAs of right now, the previous info is slightly obsolete. Below is a rewrite of the above information that I know to work on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later.\nMethod 1\nThe easiest method is to place syntax on into your .vimrc. Though I've found that only having this in the vim resource file might overwrite a vast majority of the default configurations, so I'd recommend also including source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim at the top of the file. You can execute the following command to easily set your .vimrc:\necho \"\\\" Sets the default vim settings. \nsource \\$VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim\n\n\\\" Enable syntax highlighting.\nsyntax on\n\" > ~/.vimrc\n\nNote that this will overwrite any current information in .vimrc. If you don't want that to happen, use >> instead of >. But keep in mind that the source should remain somewhere near the top of the file, as to not overwrite any custom configurations.\nMethod 2\nTL;DR ➡ install vim with homebrew then open a new terminal tab\nMethod 2 is more ideal if you want greater configurability and better default configurations.\nFirst you'll need to install homebrew, which will take some time depending on your Mac's specs: /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nOnce homebrew has successfully installed, I recommend ensuring that your system is ready to brew, using brew doctor. Before continuing, make sure that any warnings or errors displayed by the command are resolved.\nNext, go ahead and install the newest version of vim using brew install vim. This version of vim should have syntax highlighting enabled by default, along with many other options.\nOnce vim has been installed, you'll most likely need to log out of your account and log back in. If you don't, the new version of vim won't be used, and therefor won't have syntax highlighting enabled by default. Not sure why this is, but that's just how it works.\nOnce you log back in, syntax highlighting, along with other previously disabled options, should now be enabled.\n\nPre 2022 Edit\nThere are two common methods:\nMethod 1: One of the easiest and most commonly recommended methods is by creating a file called .vimrc in your home directory. The one and only command you need to run is echo syntax on >> ~/.vimrc. The next time you access a non-txt file with vim, you will notice highlighted text.\necho \"syntax on\" >> ~/.vimrc\n\nMethod 2: Another method, one that I personally use/used, is by installing \"vim --override-system-vim\". First run vim --version in the terminal. Notice the +(s) and -(s) and keep it in mind, maybe even take a picture. Next we will install a package manager, if one is not already installed on your computer. We will use Homebrew for this tutorial. Run xcode-select --install in the terminal. It will take about 10-15 min to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Once the installation is complete, run ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\". After brew has installed, run brew doctor to make sure that everything is in working order. If it recommends you run any commands to resolve an issue, run them first before continuing. After the previous step is complete, run brew install vim --override-system-vim. After vim is installed, run vim --version and notice the difference of the +(s) and -(s) in comparison to when you first ran the command. Not only has syntax highlighting been enabled, but there are other features that have been enabled as well.\nCommands: (Note: The $ signs represent the start of a new line/command.

Your configurations in this file will still be overridden by system initialisation. The easiest way without recompiling vim is to invoke it with your configuration file as command-line option as follows (all other unknown initialisations will be bypassed):\nvim -u ~/.vimrc\nYou can set up an alias in .bashrc should you use bash shell as follows:\nalias vim='vim -u ~/.vimrc'\n\nA: If you want to toggle this on/off (without creating a .vimrc file) simply type :syntax on while in vi/vim.\n\nA: syntax enable is better for this, read help for further info\nif !exists(\"g:syntax_on\")\n    syntax enable\n    filetype on\nendif\n\n\" To toggle syntax \n\" nnoremap <Leader>s Toggle Syntax\n\" with a little help from vi.stackexchange.com: https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/24418/7339\nnnoremap <silent> <expr> <Leader>s exists('g:syntax_on') ?

I have installed the OS multiple times, which appears to have just recovered the existing OS and user setup. I have read online references to booting from another account to do this, and I now have a thunderbolt cable to go to a late 2006 imac 27 also running Sierra.\nI have also read that there is a way to reset to NVRAM to disable the Find My Mac feature.\nI thought Apple was superior to PC, but format C sure is simple...\nCan anyone help me with getting the disk arased, New copy of OS in a clean install, and no more tracking of the laptop once it goes to the new owner?\n\nA: You don't say but I assume you are booting into Internet Recovery mode which allows you do do a lot more than just recover your Mac via the internet? If not that would be mistake number 1. If you are please proceed.\nBoot into Internet Recovery and go into disk utility. Select the Mac HD (or whatever the primary/largest partition is and format it. You need to do nothing else, just format it.\nOnce you are done quit out of disk utility and go into the part that lets you reinstall the operating system. You may proceed with installing this way or if you have a bootable installer with another version of macOS on it you can reboot, holding down the Option key and selecting the installer USB key to boot from.\nEither way, follow the prompts and reinstall macOS.\nOnce that is done and you have logged in. Use the App Store to update the installed OS (or upgrade to a newer version, your choice). Install your apps of choice and you may proceed to use the Mac.\nNote that formatting the HD does not securely wipe the drive of previous data. But the process of installing macOS, your apps and documents will overwrite the drive, with your data. Once that is done the chance of recovering any of the previous owner's data is slim to none. And completely nil if you don't attempt to recover any of it.\n\nA: I am a huge fan of DBan (https://www.pendrivelinux.com/install-dban-to-a-usb-flash-drive-using-windows/), could work if you can remove the harddrive and plug it in to an other PC temporarily. \nAfter erasing the disk, you can reinsert the HDD and perform a normal, clean install on it. \n", "Q: How to mount HFS+ rEFInd partition as boot in Arch Linux I am currently trying to set up dual boot on my Mac. I installed rEFInd to its own partition (512MB), formatted as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\". I wanted to use the same partition as my boot partition under linux. But every time I pacstrap my system, I get an error message stating that \"/mnt/boot is mounted as read-only\". It's probably because it can only read the mounted partition based on the filesystem I used.\nI read that installing it on the existing EFI partition has caused some problems for other people so I wanted to go and take the \"safe route\".\nI want to use rEFInd to start my OS', I do not really care if it shows up on the Startup Manager provided by Apple. I just want to be able to boot into OS X if something happens and goes horribly wrong :)\nIs using FAT32 as the formatting a good idea? It would allow me to mount is as rw and make it usable as my boot partition. Or how do you guys have installed rEFInd on your systems? \n\nA: For those that might have similar questions/problems. You have to explicitly disable journaling using diskutil on the command line. Using Disk Utility.app does not work properly.\n", "Q: What application uses the rstf://scheduleState=1 URL scheme? For some time now (perhaps since the 10.13.3 upgrade of MacOS) I have been waking my Mac up from sleep and seeing between 3 and 7 cascading dialogue boxes with the error message:\n\"Unable to find an application to open URL rstf://?scheduleState=1, with \"Ok, Cancel, Find Application\" buttons.\nI have searched everywhere and cannot find any reference to rstf or scheduleState (there some scheduleState stuff, but it seems unrelated).\nDoes anyone know how I can find and kill what is trying to open this URL?\nPresumably the job is scheduled somewhere, but crontab just has a SuperDuper entry and I've since deleted SuperDuper.\n\nA: You can use the RCDefaultApp preference pane to see a list of all URL schemes provided by applications on your system.\nThese supported URL schemes are defined in the Info.plist of an app, and registered collectively by macOS.\nSadly, I do not have any apps installed that handle rstf:// but please let us know when you find out what it is!\n\n\nA: I faced the same issue.

How Apple handles encryption for various aspects of its services is detailed here: https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\nMost relevant is the section on Internet Services, starting on p. 49. In general, keys are tied to your device(s) which are protected by your passcode (that only you know), and hopefully also with two-factor authentication. \nIf enabled, iCloud \"Keychain items are transferred from device to device, traveling through Apple servers, but are encrypted in such a way that Apple and other devices can’t read their contents.\" Keychain Recovery is optional, and in the absence of two-factor, is protected by an iCloud Security Code that only you know.\niMessage is end-to-end encrypted using device-based public-private key pairs: \"Apple can’t decrypt the data.\" Same for FaceTime.\n\nA: Yes - that's a vast oversimplification. But anything you write in two sentences about a company as big and multifaceted and long running as Apple would be an oversimplification.\nI think if anyone sat down and spent an hour with a panel of experts and chose any 100 privacy decisions and made a scorecard to grade the company, Apple would come out as very strongly pro-individual, have designed dozens of technological features to make privacy both possible and easy by default and that Apple's business model does not profit by deceiving consumers and they furthermore don't profit by collecting and selling information about people.\nApple's model is to sell a premium experience and integrated hardware and not surprise or abuse people so that they are inclined to buy more products - horizontally or vertically for decades to come. Apple's brand is about empowering individuals to make things and do things - not about selling information or even about selling one class of things.\n(p.s. I'll leave all the design decisions about iCloud key escrow, how that is different in China versus the EU versus the US versus 2 years ago vs what may happen next year and how fallible people will be forever when it comes to being operationally proficient at security practices that will block professionals and legal authorities who want to compromise one person's security to another thread.)\n", "Q: Newly created alias should be activated constantly I add an alias to `~/.bashrc and activate it.\n    # add some helpful aliases\n    alias l.='ls -d .* --color=auto'\n\nActivate it \nsource .bashrc\n\nIt work well on current bash.\n    $ l.\n    ls: --color=auto: No such file or directory\n    .   .cups   .python_history  ...\n\nUnfortunately, it refuses to work when I quit and restart the bash\n    $ l.\n    -bash: l.: command not found\n\nIt has to be activated manually again.\n  $ source .bashrc\n  # then it works\n    $ l.\n    ls: --color=auto: No such file or directory\n    .   .cups   .python_history  ...\n\nWhat's the problem with my configuration?\n\nA: Terminal opens a login shell.

I was just curious about the command key, a little thing that seems to have been used for quite a long time.\nIs there any particular reason that the founders of Apple decided to use the ⌘ symbol, not the Apple logo (like Windows does on their keyboards) as the Command Key? Just to clarify, I want the reasons why the designers chose it, and not personal opinion. Thanks!\n\nA: From the Wikipedia entry on the Command Key:\n\nThe \"⌘\" symbol (the \"looped square\") was chosen by Susan Kare after Steve Jobs decided that the use of the Apple logo in the menu system (where the keyboard shortcuts are displayed) would be an over-use of the logo.\n\nIt is also interesting that the ⌘ is not something Apple came up with. It is actually an ancient symbol called looped square. \n\nA: The command key was initially called Apple key and it was used in combination with other key to create a menu command shortcut. The shortcut for menu command was displayed in the Menu bar alongside the menu item.\nReportedly, Steve Jobs didn't like the on-screen overuse of the Apple logo. In typical Jobsian fashion:\n\n\"There are too many Apples on the screen! It's ridiculous! We're taking the Apple logo in vain! We've got to stop doing that!\"\n\nAn alternative logo was hunted for by the famed Apple designed Susan Kare, that according to her was distinctive, attractive and had at least something to do with the concept of a menu command.\nYou can read a first hand account by Andy Hertzfeld on Folklore.org, How we got the unusual symbol used for the menu command key.\n", "Q: Can iOS 11.0.3 automatically logout from WhatsApp? My phone storage was full and I couldn't open WhatsApp. I put the phone on charging and the next day when I tried to open WhatsApp, I was logged out. I had to provide my phone no and other information to login as we do when we change our device. Also, all of my WhatsApp data was gone, messages, history and pictures. Although, the saved media was still available via the Photos app. Was my WhatsApp account hacked, or did iOS deleted the data? \nAlso offload unused apps setting (available under Settings app -> General -> iPhone Storage)was not enabled. I am using an iPhone 5S 16GB.\n\nA: No, iOS can't delete your WhatsApp account.  iOS can't, on its own, delete any account for any app.\nYou stated you didn't have Offload Unused App enabled so it's more probable that WhatsApp didn't have the available space it needed to store your history.\niOS will determine if it needs to 'unload' an app from memory to make space for system process, another app's use, etc.  I can't say for sure but it appears that WhatsApp was removed from memory because the system needed to reclaim that memory to use for something else.\nIf you delete apps you don't need, turn on Offload Unused Apps, and then reinstall WhatsApp, you might see your history return.  This answer from a similar question might help, too.  That user stopped all apps using the app switcher and then restarted their iPhone.  That helped them regain space and add their apps back.\n", "Q: Hitting Play/Pause key (F8) ends FaceTime call In High Sierra, hitting the Play/Pause (f8) button now ends a FaceTime call if one is in progress. This is quite frustrating as I often pause music after I answer a FaceTime call, is there any way to disable this?\n\nA: You mentioned in the comment that the music playing app is usually Spotify.\nThe media keys (Previous, Play/Pause, Next represented by F7, F8 and F9 keys respectively) gets associated with the an app outputting audio/video (if the app is programmed to support it).\nIf two or more apps are simultaneously outputting audio/video, the keypress is captured by Apple's own built in app (in this case FaceTime).\nThis explains your observation. In this case, it would be recommended to pause Spotify using it's menu command.\n", "Q: XML phonebook for iOS ? Ive got a online phonebook that our company voip phones connect to, which allows us to keep a centralised list of all contacts phone numbers which is available on all voip phones. \nThe online phonebook outputs an XML file with the contact phone numbers, which the voip phones read. \nIs it possible to also get our mobiles (iOS 11) to read from the same XML phonebook and input the data into the iphone contacts ?  \n\nA: Out of the box, iOS supports CardDAV and LDAP.  There's no native way to import an XML file for contacts.\nI have (in the past) set up an LDAP server (Solaris based) specifically for this scenario - I was connecting Nortel VoIP phones that supported a contact list with folks who needed access to this list but weren't on our Exchange Server (which had this list by default).\nYou may be able to set up some sort of synchronization between your phone system and the CardDAV or the LDAP server which will keep the contacts updated.  It may have this capability built in, but given that you can get an XML document of the list as output, creating a script to update a CardDAV/LDAP server would be pretty straight forward.\n", "Q: How to programmatically get available wifi networks without airport utility? Is there a way other than using the airport command line utility to get the list of available wifi networks programmatically (for consumption by an application)?  Here is the context:\nI have a command line application for managing wifi networks (https://github.com/keithrbennett/wifiwand, gem install wifi-wand) in which I get the list of available wifi networks using airport -s.\nUnfortunately, because the network names are presented right aligned, there is no way to determine whether or not, or how many, leading spaces the name contains. There is a -x option to output the data in XML format, but in Ruby, parsing XML usually requires installing the nokogiri gem, which is legendarily problematic, and I don't want to impose that on my users. So I go through this weird and less than 100% reliable process to return the correct results in most but not all cases.\nWhat are my other options, if any, for getting this information?\n\nA: You could (mis)use awk to filter the result:\nairport -s -x| awk '          { if (catch == 1) { print; catch=0 } }\n                   /SSID_STR/ { catch=1 }'\n<string>UPC Wi-Free</string>\n<string>UPCE191589</string>\n<string>The Cloud</string>\n<string>UPCE191589</string>\n<string>The Cloud</string>\n\nNot very nice, but does the job :-)\nOTOH, a SSID can be anything, it doesn't even need to be printable (see Is there a standard that defines what is a valid SSID and password?).

I need what format did it used to use to revive my old Macintosh Plus. So I'm doing a research on what format did old Macintoshes used. (on hard drives or hdds). What I mean with this is what format did old macintoshes use back in the day, like a primitive version of hfs+ or something like that.\n\nA: You can’t get older than Apple File System with the first Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System\nThe Plus ships with HFS so that’s the place to start if you just need that one model.\nHFS Wikipedia article as well should cover all the classic Mac OS releases. So those two likely cover all the os from System 1 to System 7 so I would focus on what system you want to run on your Mac Plus (I’d start with System 6 if I were you) as opposed to what the filesystem might be. But maybe that’s all you need so start with MFS/HFS.\n", "Q: I don't want to use Apple's Mail.app on macOS - Any unintended consequences? Mail app is using 10GB on my laptop (High Sierra 10.13.3). I don't use it at all; I usually use the web interface and occasionally Thunderbird for my Gmail account. \nThis is the only Mail-connected account in Internet Accounts. If I were to uncheck it in Internet Accounts for my Gmail account so that I can delete the cache and free up some space, is there the possibility of any unintended consequences? For example, will I somehow stop getting email reminders of things in my BusyCal calendar? Or some other possibility that I am unaware of?\n\nA: It is safe to remove your Gmail account from Mail.app without any unintended consequences, as all the Gmail data is stored on Google's servers.\nAlso, there’s no harm in never setting up any mail account in Mail.app for macOS. The system does want to have a default mail app, so if you click a mailto://hi@me.com link, it will open Mail.app. Mail will then try to onboard a new account, but you can end that action easily by not choosing to continue.\nSimply removing a Gmail account from Mail.app won't delete any of your Gmail data (although performing any action on any of the mail or folder will reflect the changes in Gmail). This is the same for any purely cloud based IMAP mail services (iCloud as well as Gmail) where deleting the local cache leaves the server copies of all mail intact.\nThe only small caution is if you save mails locally and delete a copy from the server - maybe make a quick backup of your Mac or export your local mails to an export file or folder just in case you fear you’ll delete those and want them back.\n\nA: I think it's easiest to keep Mail.app functional and instead reduce the amount of space it uses - mainly by limiting how much mail will be available locally (this is set in gmail). \nNote this WILL affect thunderbird as well. Assuming you're using thunderbird for reading new mail, and the web for searching old mail, this works well.\n\n\n*\n\n*IMAP Limit: gmail.com → Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP → Enable IMAP → Folder Size Limits (bottom): Limit IMAP folders... 1000 (or lower).\n\n*Don't download attachments automatically: Mail → Settings → Accounts → (choose gmail account) → \"Download Attachments\": None\nYou may want to un-sync gmail and make sure all the mail is deleted before re-adding it, if you don't see the space come back (may work on its own if patient).\nAlso you should periodically clean your large attachments, try searching \"size:25000000\" in gmail to find and delete the ones you don't need. If you do above, it won't matter much but still good practice.\nMore info on reducing Mail.app space usage.\n", "Q: If I copy an application already listed under Purchased to the Applications folder, will it be able to update through the App Store? If I copy an application already have in my Apple ID (Edit: for example, Xcode) from another computer to the Applications folder, will the Mac App Store be able to update it?\nOr will I have to do something manually in order to enable updates from that app?\n\nA: In general, Yes - you can side load apps to Mac and as long as it’s on the filesystem (doesn’t even have to be in /Applications or on the boot drive) - the App Store app will see you have that app installed and offer updates when they are available.\nThere is no installer, receipt or other accounting needed to indicate an app should be managed / updated once it’s copied on to the filesystem intact (with the intact part being key).\nIn specific, some apps have helpers and need to be programmed to detect their helpers are not deployed for the app to run properly. That’s more about how the app is designed, though, than whether it will get caught and updated the next time that is needed by the Mac App Store app.\n", "Q: Is there a way to automatically adjust EQ settings when the audio output changes? I have particular EQ settings I like to use for my speakers at home, however when I'm using my laptop speakers or Bluetooth headphones I prefer to have a flat EQ.  Is there a way to specify different EQ settings for each audio output and automatically switch to the correct setting when the audio output is changed? \n\nA: Reading the current audio output gives \"Built-in Output\" for both headphones and internal speakers, however we need to be able to tell between headphones and speakers.  In order to do this, you can use code from this answer to create a program that checks whether headphones are plugged in or another audio output is in use:\n#include <CoreAudio/CoreAudio.h>\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid updateEQ() {\n    AudioDeviceID defaultDevice = 0;\n    UInt32 defaultSize = sizeof(AudioDeviceID);\n\n    const AudioObjectPropertyAddress defaultAddr = {\n        kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice,\n        kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal,\n        kAudioObjectPropertyElementMaster\n    };\n\n    AudioObjectGetPropertyData(kAudioObjectSystemObject, &defaultAddr, 0, NULL, &defaultSize, &defaultDevice);\n\n    AudioObjectPropertyAddress property;\n    property.mSelector = kAudioDevicePropertyDataSource;\n    property.mScope = kAudioDevicePropertyScopeOutput;\n    property.mElement = kAudioObjectPropertyElementMaster;\n\n    UInt32 dataSourceId = 0;\n    UInt32 dataSourceIdSize = sizeof(UInt32);\n\n    AudioObjectGetPropertyData(defaultDevice, &property, 0, NULL, &dataSourceIdSize, &dataSourceId);\n\n    if (dataSourceId == 'hdpn') {\n        std::cout << \"Changed to headphones\" << std::endl;\n        system(\"osascript <<path to speaker EQ script>>\");\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"Changed to not headphones\" << std::endl;\n        system(\"osascript <<path to other EQ script>>\");\n    }\n}\n\n\nint main(int argc, const char * argv[])\n{\n    updateEQ();\n    return 0;\n}\n\nEach EQ script is then a simple AppleScript script that updates iTunes's EQ, for example the speaker EQ script is:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set current EQ preset to (get first EQ preset whose name is \"Speakers\")\n    set EQ enabled to true\nend tell\n\n", "Q: iPhone 5 says \"disabled, connect to iTunes\" but iTunes says it \"can't connect because of an unexpected error\" I rebooted it but it still says \"iPhone is disabled, connect to iTunes\" even though I don't have a password on it anymore because I rebooted it.

There is no item in Login Items, but why I boot  my Mac, there still has a few software launch automatically? \n\n\nA: There are a group of special files that manage the opening and running of programs at launch and in the background. These files are known as Launch Agents and Daemons. Often times, third party software makes system  modifications that installs these files as a part of the software package. The software doesn't always appear in the \"Login Items\" list. Additionally, the \"login items\" list doesn't actually disable automatic launching of programs but just gives you the option to hide it. \nWithout knowing the specific software, the best way to solve your issue is to look within the software's preferences. Often times, there is an option available to disable \"Automatically open at Login,\" or something similar.  \nIf you cannot find an option within the program, then look to the developers website for possible instructions. Or, simply googling the issue - \"how to disable [name of software] from automatic launching\" will provide you with a solution. \nAlternatively, you can manually disable launch agents and daemons by changing the keys within them, but I don't recommend doing this. As I said, most software provides you with the option.\nThere are a few programs that scan your system and show you which launch items are actually enabled and running. Etrecheck is a great example that I recommend downloading and running. \n", "Q: Shortcut to Bottom border in Numbers Here there are many shortcuts for Numbers https://support.apple.com/kb/PH23737?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US.\nI would like to have one for Borrom border.

I'm trying to declutter (and come up with a way of easily switching my peripherals between my windows laptop and my Mac) and there are a plethora of USB-C hubs with HDMI out. Is it possible to use a USB-A Male to USB-C female adaptor to use this port for HDMI out on my machine?\nI have a USB 3 type A docking station at work that outputs DVI and Display Port that I use with my Mac, so I'm aware that my laptop will output video over USB, but I've tried the above configuration and the laptop sees the hub as USB 2.0 and no display is detected.\nTLDR;\nCan I use a USB-C hub with a Type-A to Type-C adaptor to get HDMI from my Early 2015 MacBook Pro with no USB-C port?  \nIt may be my flawed understanding, but I am under the impression that USB-C was just the type of connector and independent from the spec, so I don't know why this wouldn't work.\n\nA: USB-C is indeed just a connector, and so a number of different standards can use it. HDMI output needs the Thunderbolt 3 standard to be delivered over the USB-C connectors, but your 2015 MacBook Pro doesn't and can't use that standard on its USB-A ports. A USB-A to USB-C adaptor will simply pass on the USB data.\n\nA: \nCan I use a USB-C hub with a Type-A to Type-C adaptor to get HDMI from my Early 2015 MacBook Pro with no USB-C port?\n\nNo.  An adapter with a male USB-A jack to female USB-C receptacle violates the USB specification.  These adapters have no defined function in the spec and so run the risk of doing nothing, doing what you want and expect, or doing damage to your hardware.\nThe reason this kind of an adapter exists is because there are people that prey on the ignorant with cheap fixes to complicated problems.  There's nothing wrong with ignorance except those that do not seek to end it.\nThere are USB-A to HDMI adapters but they use a GPU, not a protocol converter like most USB-C to HDMI adapters.  You can know the difference in that the cables and docks with GPUs will require drivers to work, the cables and docks with DP-to-HDMI protocol converters do not.\nUSB-C is independent from the USB 3.0 spec.  USB-C can be used for USB 2.0, USB 3.0, DisplayPort (DP), HDMI, Thunderbolt 3 (TB3), and more.  USB-A only supports USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, to get video from it means using a USB GPU.  Because these USB GPUs are using a protocol not intended for connecting a GPU they are known to be expensive, slow, and difficult to set up.  Because many laptops with USB-C support DP natively on the port the cables are simple, low cost, fast, and require no drivers.  There are GPUs built for computers that support TB3 on USB-C.  Because TB3 was built for adding GPUs they are much easier to setup, fast, and while they are often not cheap they are worth every penny.\nUSB-C ports that support HDMI natively is possible, it's in the spec, but I have not seen it.  There are micro-USB to HDMI cables that use HDMI natively (though more accurately it's the MHL protocol but it uses the HDMI connector) but these are also rare.\n\nI have a USB 3 type A docking station at work that outputs DVI and Display Port that I use with my Mac, so I'm aware that my laptop will output video over USB, but I've tried the above configuration and the laptop sees the hub as USB 2.0 and no display is detected.\n\nThere are USB 2.0 docks with GPUs in them to get DP and DVI outputs.  They work reasonably well for many people, they won't win any prizes for frame rates on gaming or video processing.  USB 2.0 is considerably slower than USB 3.0 or TB3.\nThere's really only one way to get video from USB-A, a GPU.  The most common I've seen is called DisplayLink.  A confusing name as it is far to close to DisplayPort.  DisplayLink is a brand name of USB-video GPUs.  DisplayPort is a video protocol.\nThere are many ways to get HDMI from USB-C.  There's the same DisplayLink GPUs as used in USB-A docks.  There's native HDMI.  There's DP-to-HDMI conversion, which is likely far more common than other options.  There's TB3 GPUs with HDMI output, which is likely the most capable option.  There's MHL on USB-C for video, including passive and active adapters to HDMI, but I have not seen actual products that do this, only spec sheets that indicate this is possible.\nThere is no easy solution here.  I hope I've been clear enough on where the issue lies so you can decide on options.\n", "Q: Put OSX under version control I have recently learned about Docker and love their declarative approach which enables me to put everything under version control and make the whole application basically immutable.\nI understand that this is a much harder task to accomplish for a full blown OS like Mac OSX.\nStill, I would love to have more control over how everything runs.\nI am a developer so I frequently install stuff on my machine to try out, use command line tools that download packages, etc. pp.\nA recent example was that I installed a OSX Developer Beta because a sound controller was not longer working and it was already fixed in the beta version.

Should you connect the power cord to your notebook and then plug the power cord into the socket, or should you plug in the socket and then the notebook?\nAre there any recommendations from Apple?\n\nUpdate: I have seen both recommendations. Most of the advice says to plug in the notebook first. Maybe it doesn't matter at all?\n\nA: Plugging in a heavy load to a circuit causes arcing as the circuit is completed. Historically, this could damage wall outlets, plugs, adapters, and whatever was connected on the far end of plug (e.g. a computer). This would only happen when the device was in an \"already on\" condition, as classic devices used physical switches to connect the power supply to the motherboard. The classical advice was to plug in to a wall first for devices that might arc.\nModern devices have soft-switches and lots of protective circuitry, which is why arcing practically never happens and device damage is a lot less frequent than it was historically. The only practical time you might want to plug in to the wall first is if you're in a place that is known for power surges, but then again, you probably wouldn't want to have your device plugged directly into a unfiltered current to begin with (use a surge protector). In most practical cases, it doesn't matter which end you plug in first, but do use common sense.\n\nA: As hinted at in some comments,  the safe procedure when using any electric power converter is to get the converter itself powered up and stabilized first.  A wall-charger has caps to filter the load, and these should be allowed to charge up and eliminate any possibility of power surge at the output (the device side).  \nA well-designed AC-DC converter will have builtin arc and surge suppression, but you never know what you've got in hand.  Caution is recommended.\nAs an extreme example,  take a 50-kW Generac.  If it's starting cold after disuse, it may take a minute or two to stabilize both the AC frequency and the AC voltage output.  If you crossover before starting it up, undesirable transients could damage devices which \"dislike\" overvoltage or 40 Hz vs. 60 Hz drive.  \n\nA: Apple recommends to plug the adapter into the wall before connecting it to the computer.\nFor more information, refer to the Apple Support article, Using and maintaining your Apple MagSafe Adapter.\n\nConnecting the MagSafe Power Adapter to power\nMake sure that the AC plug or AC power cord is fully inserted into the power adapter before plugging the adapter into a power outlet. And be sure to plug your adapter into the wall before connecting it to your computer.\n\n\nA: We always want to keep good maintenance of our electric products, and to make it have a long life before retiring it.  There is reason why Apple wants us to plug the power adapter first, as I believe they want to put the load on the circuit in the power adapter before the Mac.  It also acts as a buffer zone.  It is cheaper to replace the power adapter than the Mac motherboard.  Here is a link that provides the understanding of the arc.\n", "Q: External HD partition table destroyed I was trying to create bootable USB media in Boot Camp Assistant.

Immediately I ran diskutil and gpt which show:\n$ gpt show\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         MBR\n           1          62\n          63  2344529857      1  MBR Part 7\n  2344529920  1562497024      2  MBR Part 7\n  3907026944        2220\n\ndiskutil (I already tried to fix using gpt add - causing both partitions to read NTFS):\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n   #:                   TYPE NAME               SIZE      IDENTIFIER\n   0: FDisk_partition_scheme                   *2.0 TB    disk1\n   1:           Windows_NTFS                    1.2 TB    disk1s1\n   1:           Windows_NTFS                    800.0 GB  disk1s2\n\nI tried to recover it using gpt add and made the GUID NTFS for both. They wouldnt mount.\n\nI then tried pdisk and completely ruined my partition table.\n\nIs there a way i can get my partitions back? After pdisk my gpt show now reads:\n$ gpt show\n       start         size  index  contents\n           0   3907029164\n\nand diskutil reads:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                   TYPE NAME               SIZE      IDENTIFIER\n   0:                                          *2.0 TB    disk2\n\nAm I screwed? I havent written to the HD. I know my files and partitions are still there. I just need help fixing this.\n(p.s. currently using testdisk and scanning as an INTEL drive).\n\nA: Given that this is about data loss on a windows-formatted disk, you might want to ask in a windows-centric place. It sounds to me like data recovery (deleted file scans) would be your only hope. \nI'm not clear, did you have a USB thumb drive and a 2 TB USB HDD plugged in, and picked the wrong one for making the Bootcamp tools?\n", "Q: Lost Wi-Fi after running USB to Ethernet driver I recently bought a USB to Ethernet dongle, and I ran the package script and restarted the computer, only to find that I had the infamous ‘Wi-Fi: no hardware installed’ issue. I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset NVRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Moved and renamed /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n\n*Ran the AHT, and entered recovery mode.\n\n\nOn attempt 3, after it didn't work, I undid it.\nOn attempt 4, I found no hardware issues, and when I clicked the link, I could connect to Wi-Fi.\nMacBook Pro 12,1, Insignia USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet adapter\n\nA: I decided to brute-force my way to a solution. I first ran the AHT by holding down \"d\" while booting up. Then I held down Command R when booting up, and reinstalled the OS. That worked.\n", "Q: Are restrictions in iOS by device and not iCloud account? Just getting to grips with restrictions on multiple iOS devices using the same AppleID. Are restrictions device specific? If yes, do I have to set them up again on the other device?\n\nA: Yes. Restrictions are limited in scope to the device on which they are configured. If more than one device is tied to the same Apple ID, restrictions will have to be set up separately.\n", "Q: Search Bear notes using `grep` command With grep, I can search through the content of all the files in a directory, for an instance:\ngrep 'program' *.md\n\nsearches for the pattern program within the content of all .md files in the current directory.\nHow do I search the Bear notes in Terminal using thegrep command?\n\nA: You can use the same grep command as mentioned in the question, to search through the contents of .md files exported by Bear. For instance, use\ngrep pattern *.md\nto search for pattern in .md files in the current directory. You can use -i option to ignore case or -n to print line number in file.\n", "Q: Adding macros to Touch Bar in Terminal.app Whenever you type in a command, there is a macro on the touch bar that displays the manpage for whatever command you are currently typing. \nIs it possible to add (e.g.) a macro to compile a project or refresh a python webserver?\n\nA: BetterTouchTool has the ability to create widgets on the Touch Bar. BTT cannot add widgets to the existing app controls, but can provide a secondary Touch Bar layout which can be switched to using your own defined shortcut or other trigger.\nBTT provides normal buttons which can perform any action when tapped (whether standard actions provided by BTT or custom shell or AppleScript). BTT provides widgets which can run AppleScript or shell scripts, displaying the result on the bar in the button and colouring the button appropriately, or taking other action.\n\n", "Q: Mail rules not working at all I am running MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 and I wanted to create a basic rule that would look for the word \"Monitoring\" in a message subject and move it to a \"Monitoring\" mailbox if it was found.  I created this rule and nothing happened to either my existing messages or new incoming messages.  \nWhen I select a message and click \"Apply Rules\" nothing happens.  I deleted all other rules to be sure that nothing was preventing other rules from being applied - and even with my rule as the only rule available messages are not moved under any circumstances.\nWhat do I need to do to get my rules to work?\n\nA: I had a similar issue, although I'm not sure it matches your situation perfectly.\nI had some unrelated email issues that required disconnecting and reconnecting my email accounts. After reconnecting them, the email rules stopped working.\nNothing looked out of place in the rules, including the destination mailbox for the message. If you opened them and clicked cancel, the rule would close normally. However, if you opened them and clicked OK, you'd get this error message:\n\nError\nA destination mailbox has not been selected for the Move/Copy action. Select a mailbox or remove the action.\n\nIf you then go to the mailbox selector and don't select anything new, it'll switch from whatever mailbox was shown before to No mailbox selected. If you then reselect the mailbox you wanted it to be sent to, it would work again.\nUltimately, I found the fastest way to check on these was to do this for each rule:\n\n*\n\n*Double click on the rule.\n\n*Press return. If no error, you're good.\n\n*If you get the error, click on the drop-down menu and select the correct mailbox (usually the one already selected).\n\nApple Support helped me to figure this out and the working theory was that something broke the connection to the mailbox even though the mailbox's name remained displayed until you clicked on the drop-down menu. Clicking on the mailbox again in the drop-down menu must have reestablished the necessary connection.\n", "Q: How to backup my iPhone without access to Internet, PC or a Mac? I have unlimited data available on my phone, but my plan does not let me create \na mobile hotspot. So I can’t even share my own data. I am also in a place where I do not have access to Internet or a computer and my iPhone needs to be backed up.\nIs there any way I could possibly get this done? \n\nA: You can enable iCloud backup in your settings. You will not need to create a hotspot, only use your data to upload the backup to your iCloud account.\n\nA: A mobile hotspot would not help in this scenario - that is to enable other devices to connect to the internet through your iPhone - but requires, of course, that your phone can already connect to the internet. It would not help your connect you phone to the internet; for that you would need a net-connected computer or WifI.\nIf you have no internet connection & no computer, you cannot make a backup.\n", "Q: \"New Item\" in Finder's right-click menu In Windows when you're in File Explorer, you can right-click anywhere and create a new item of various types (there's then a submenu option to select which type: text file, ZIP file, etc., just to name a few). In Finder there seems to be no such option. I imagine the expected workflow on Mac would be to open an Application and create a new file from within the application, then save it. But I sometimes prefer this alternative workflow of creating a blank file first, and then opening it as the entrypoint into the application.\nIs there some way to configure Finder to add a right-click option to create new, empty files?\n\nA: 1 - Create anywhere on your computer a Source folder with the files you want to use:\n\n\n2 - Open Automator and create a new service:\n\n\n3 - Set the Service to receive a folder in Finder as input:\n\n\n4 - Drag a \"Set Value of Variable\" action to the workflow:\n\n\n5 - Save a new variable \"Storage\":\n\n\n6 - Now that we have the target location lets clear the memory placing an Applescript action using this code:\n\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set the clipboard to {}\nend tell\n\n\n\n\n\n7 - Get the file you created using a \"Get Specific Finder Item\" action:\n\n\n8 - Copy to the new folder using a \"Copy Finder Item\" action and dragging the Storage variable from the bottom:\n\n\n9 - Save your workflow:\n\n\n10 - Usage - select the folder you want, right click and find your service:\n\n\n11 - Repeat the process for the zip file or other files you want.\n\nEdit: if you know how to Applescript and want to improve further, you can use a dialog box to choose between several filetypes and build a single service, using a \"choose from\" command like this:\n\n\nset fileType to (choose from list {\"txt\", \"zip\", \"etc\"} with prompt \"Choose File\")\n\n\n\nA: You can add Services to Finder's right-click context menu using Automator: create a workflow which you save as a Service, and it'll be available upon right-click.\nI know that out of the box you can add create new text file and create new keynote presentation that way, as well as new folder, new folder within folder and so on, but... I think you may need to find more Automator actions for other document types to be able to add a \"new type XX file\" to your Finder Service.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/MakeaSystem-WideService.html\n", "Q: Can't enable Siri in High Sierra?

I'm using an application called Better Touch Tool which does keyboard mappings, and so requires that you give it permission to the Accessibility API in System Preferences > Security & Privacy. I did this immediately after installing the application as you can see in this screenshot.\n\nHowever, I've noticed something odd. I often will walk away from my computer and after some minutes it will show the screensaver and eventually go to sleep. When waking it back up, it seems this checkbox in the Accessibility settings has sometimes unexpectedly un-checked itself. This has happened to me at least three times now and I can't really explain it, besides to say that it only seems to happen after the computer has gone to sleep and come back. It's quite annoying because not only do I have to re-check the box to get it working again, it also requires a restart.\nIs there any reason why this box would get un-checked without me doing so manually? How can I prevent that from happening?\n\nA: Contact Boastr\nBoastr, the developers of this commercial product, will be best placed to answer your question.

Upgrading to High Sierra is really painful. I cannot do brew upgrade, I am getting thousands of security notifications - see the attached file.  There are some recipes in Internet but they are not working, maybe the latest upgrade does not allow them.  I can approve files one by one but there are hundreds of them.  Maybe at least I can approve all files in a directory? Or run a script approving all files?\n\nA: It appears you have an anti-virus application called Bit9. If it is causing more difficulty than help, you can always deactivate or uninstall it. If this is a institutionally managed machine, contact your system admin or help desk.\nIf you feel you need to have an anti-virus application, be sure to confirm that it will run correctly with macOS High Sierra. You may need to disable the anti-virus' blocking of scripts if you are intentionally running scripts for what you are doing.\n\nA: This does not look like any Apple software dialog box. The icon is unfamiliar, .exe is not an application extension on OS X and there's no reason why Apple should want (nor you should be required to provide) any justification for running a piece of software, nor your email address when you approve it.\nIt looks like that might be Eclipse (or some other IDE) running behind your dialog? If so is it possible this is coming from a plugin for that application?\n", "Q: Invalid plist error I'me getting Invalid property list when trying launchctl load -w /Users/open/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.inMemTask14.plist for this .plist:\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n    <plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>KeepAlive</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.apple.inMemTask14</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/Users/open/Library/Containers/.heheosx/MacOSHighSierra.py</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>StartInterval</key>\n    <integer>300</integer>  \n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n    </plist>\n\nWhat is wrong with my list that I get this error?\n\nA: In the last but third line, <true/> value has no corresponding key.\nReview the entry and make necessary correction.\n", "Q: Is Adobe Lightroom v6.0 (standalone and NOT cloud) serial# stored in a file on my Mac?

This often transfers app licenses & settings successfully between computers. \n", "Q: Can I use the same Apple ID for multiple Macs if I only need Apple ID to update macOS? I don't use any Apple apps (iBooks, iTunes, iCloud etc). I just need to create an Apple ID to download and install macOS updates.\n\nA: You can use a single Apple ID to log into a maximum of ten devices at a time (no more than five of them can be Mac).\nFor more information, you can refer to the Apple Support article, View and remove your associated devices in iTunes.\n\nA: If you're just installing and updating the OS, there's no real limit to how many Macs you can use the same Apple ID for. In fact, the Apple ID is needed only for downloading the OS installer app. Once you've downloaded the installer app, you can copy it to as many Macs as you want, or create a bootable installer disk from it and use that to install onto multiple Macs, or even set up one Mac as a Server, and serve a NetInstall image over the local network.\nUpdates to the OS are similarly unrestricted; you can install OS updates in the App Store application without any Apple ID, or download updates from support.apple.com/downloads and install them by hand. Note: an Apple ID is needed for purchased apps, but updates to the base OS and included apps (iTunes, Safari, etc) don't require one.\n\nA: It is possible to download the installer from the App Store and you won't be asked for an Apple ID.\nAs far as I can tell, the App Store will ask for Apple ID as soon as you try to download anything else, even if it's free.\n", "Q: Why is sed outputting no text? I have a text file that I need to remove double quotes from. I found this question that suggested using the following:\nsed 's/\"//g' < infile > outfile\n\nI understand what it's doing as I'm familiar with Vim. But the output file has zero bytes in it after the command is run.\nI did try the other suggestion from that question:\ntr -d \\\" < infile > outfile\n\nThis results in an error:\ntr: Illegal byte sequence\n\nNote that when I open the file in MacVim and use\n:%s /\"//g\n\nit works perfectly.\nIs there some difference in macOS's sed? Any other suggestion on how I can do this?\n\nA: Apparently, the file is in UTF-16 format, but most of the text-manipulation tools in macOS don't know how to work with that and will garble files if they try. UTF-16 uses two bytes per character; for plain-ASCII characters like \", it's the single-byte ASCII code followed by a null byte. Something like tr -d \\\" will delete the first byte, leaving a stray null byte and throwing the entire rest of the file off by one byte.\nI think you can get perl to work in UTF-16 (see here), but I'm not sure of the ins and outs. This might work (based on this):\nperl -pe 'BEGIN { binmode $_, \":raw:encoding(UTF-16LE)\" for *STDIN, *STDOUT }; s/\"//g;' infile >outfile\n\nYou could also convert it to UTF-8 and back with \niconv -f UTF-16LE -t UTF-8 infile | tr -d \\\" | iconv -f UTF-8 -t UTF-16LE >outfile\n\nIf the output doesn't need to be in UTF-16, you can leave the last iconv out.\n\nA: Well, I don't know exactly why this problem is happening, although I did find a bit more information here and here, neither of which worked. I think it's the encoding and that the LC_CTYPE=C might be on the right track, but it converted the text into something completely different because of some sort of encoding problem.\nRegardless, I did solve it, for now, at least, with this:\nvim -c '%s /\"//g|wq' infile\n\n", "Q: Sharing > Remote Management and network security I need to \"rdp\" into my mac mini on my local network from my windows machine, to do this I simply enabled Remote Management, downloaded VNC viewer on windows and then connected, viola!... Except it is not encrypted; which is fine because I trust my local network. \nHowever, I need to understand, in doing this, am I opening up any security concerns? I do not assume so but wanted to be sure as I do not understand Apple's remote management features entirely. Basically, I want to be sure I am not exposing my local network through my mac mini when I enabled this feature.\nThank you.\n\nA: You shouldn't be, no. \nBut that may depend on whether you are then also internet connected on your Winbox at the time you're VNCing into the Mac, especially if you're using IE, even more so if you're using IE with .net framework applications, or even more exposed, Active X as well.\nYou could potentially end up exposing the Mac to attack via the VNC connection if your Win box were compromised.\n", "Q: RAID array creation in macOS I have a LaCie 2big Thunderbolt 3 RAID drive. I'm currently using LaCie RAID Manager software to create RAID array. \nI noticed that MacOS is recognizing the RAID volume as an external drive instead of a RAID set whereas in LaCie RAID Manager, it is detected as a RAID array. If i try to create RAID set using RAID Assistant via macOS Disk Utility instead, LaCie RAID Manager does not recognize the volume as a RAID array. \nWould it be better to use LaCie RAID Manager to create RAID array/set instead of macOS Disk Utility?\n\nA: I think what is going on here is both expected behavior and an exercise in learning a little terminology.\nIt is normal for a Mac to see a third party created RAID array as a single disk (which I am assuming it does) In both the Finder and Disk Utility? Why? Because the LaCie utility is designed to create RAID arrays that are completely transparent (or if you prefer invisible) to the operating system.\nThe converse is also correct, if you create a RAID array with Apple Disk Utility the LaCie utility will just see it as a single disk.\nI work with Windows/ESX servers at work and RAID is created in the firmware of the RAID controller, before the operating system even loads. So both Windows and ESX see the RAID slices as individual disks even though the RAID array knows that there are 6 physical drives set up in a RAID-5 array.\nThere may be reasons to use the LaCie software over Apple's Disk Utility (or vice-versa) but I am not aware of the relative merits of each utility.\nBUT You can be assured that what you are seeing (if I understand correctly) is entirely normal and expected behavior.\n", "Q: Reusing iPod touch 3.1 to play music I would like to use my iPod touch 3.1 only for music, pictures and videos.

I've made a few plots in a Pages graph (as well as their R^2 values). It is especially useful to move the equations around, especially when there are multiple plots on the same graph.\nI have tried everything that comes to my mind, such as clicking multiple times or dragging in strange ways, but it seems as though I can not move the equations on the graph at all. They remain on the top left corner. When I try clicking on them and dragging, the graph is moved instead of the equations.\nIs it possible to move these equations around? The only other way I'm seeing it copying and pasting these equations into textboxes, but that likely would be a huge headache in terms of layouts as well as updating the graphs' data (and thus their trend line equations).\nHere is a video of the issue I am describing.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is a regression with the current version of Pages at the time of writing. It's not possible to move the equations in Pages 7.0.\nDocuments created with previous versions of Pages will preserve the equation position. If you still have the previous version of Pages, you can copy-paste the graph into the older version, move the equations and paste it back into the newer version.\n", "Q: How do I remove a name from my VIP list in Mail?

I am migrating my email database from Apple Mail to Windows Outlook. Plenty of my emails were on the online web mail that were automatically downloaded when I signed in Outlook for windows but there are many emails that are offline and stored in apple mail. How can I migrate those emails from Apple mail to Windows Outlook?\n\nA: First you need to understand that every email client used different email formats while saving/archiving their email database. For example Apple Mail archives its email database in .mbox format. \nOn the other hand Outlook for windows can imports or archives its email database in .pst file.\nSo, in order to migrate your email database from Apple Mail to Windows Outlook you will need to convert .mbox email database files into .pst. \nUnfortunately there is no free solution to this problem. There are paid application available online for such conversion. I am mentioning one that appeared on top ranks for my search of \"Apple Mail to PST\" on google.\nhttp://applemailtopst.com/\n(I haven't used this application)\n\nA: The solution requires to configure your 2 E-mail clients so as to connect to your servers with the IMAP protocol.\nNext with Mail you will transfer all your Mac resident mailboxes onto created ones on your mailserver.\nThese newly created mailboxes will be directly accessible from Outlook. If you want to bring them back as resident mailboxes, you will have to create new resident mailboxes and transfer your mailserver mailboxes into your resident ones.\nThis double transfer will make both a content format translation, and a mailboxes index upgrade.\nThe whole operation will require approximately a quarter of an hour per gigabyte of mailbox.\n", "Q: Problems with saving to external USB Flash Storage I have an external USB Flash storage which is generally realiable.\nWhen editing text files on the drive I often get the message:\nThe document “…” could not be saved.

Could I just customise the Touch Bar to input the character n?\nPS: This would be handy, I could also use this to add special characters like ë, ù or € in the Touch Bar.\n\nA: OK, I've worked out how to do this. Working nicely on my MacBook now, I now have a  button on my Touch Bar, which types the  symbol. \nInstructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the app Automator, create a new Quick Action. Save the new Quick Action using a name consisting of the symbol it will represent e.g. I named mine \"\". (Optional: At the top of the Quick Action window you can also choose an image which will appear in front of it on the Touch Bar, I chose the plus symbol. If you don't want one you could create a blank image and use that).\n\n*In Automator, find the 'Run Applescript' action (search for it or look under Utilities) and drag it into the script area on the right.\n\n*Paste the following script into it, replacing the \"thumbs up\" symbol with your desired character. \n    set the clipboard to \"\"\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using command down\n\n\n\n*Save the new Quick Action you have created.\n\n*Go to System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Keyboard and either: a) set \"Touch Bar shows: Quick Actions\" (this will make the new icon appear on the touch bar immediately), or b) use Customise Touch Bar to add the Quick Actions icon to the touch bar (this will make the new icon appear on the touch bar when you press the Quick Actions icon).\n\n*Icon should appear on Touch Bar. Press it and an error message will appear.\n\n*Cancel the error message then go to System Preferences --> Security and Privacy --> Privacy --> Accessibility. Click the lock to make changes (if necessary) and under \"Allow the apps below to control your computer\" tick the new one which should have appeared named \"ServicesUIAgent\".\nDone!\n\nNB The method above should work for any Unicode character including the special characters you suggest (obviously you could also use it for multiple characters, any text string that'll go on the clipboard should be ok), but if you only want the letter \"n\" then the script can just say:\nkeystroke \"n\"\n\n\nA: Thanks for the tip, I used this to set up shortcuts to use Chinese pinyin characters. This script works a bit better for text rather than emojis as it preserves the format of the original:\nset the clipboard to \"ǎ\"\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"v\" using {shift down, option down, command down}\n\n", "Q: Is there a mail app handling maildir format on one's mac in a reliable manner? I need to handle, i.e. read, write, store and search, mail in maildir or maildir++ format.\nMail must be stored on my mac, that is, reading and storing maildir on a server, via IMAP would not be good for my use case.\nI am aware Thunderbird can handle \"almost-ready\" maildir format, but it still has a few bugs.\nAlso, Thunderbird is still non completely maildir-compatible.\nI am aware of this question, but it does not apply to my case, as I need to be able to store messages in maildir or maildir++ proper format on my mac.\nIs there a mail app handling maildir in a reliable manner, without resorting to the terminal?\n\nA: I can only suggest that you run a local mailserver on your Mac using Parallels and on there you create a virtual machine being Ubuntu Linux. Strip down the install so you have Dovecot, Postfix and Getmail, and of course the GUI bits. you can then instruct Thunderbord to read mail from  Maildir store. I had this done and it works perfectly. One caveat though is that the VM MUST be able to connect to the client. otherwise you end up with a mailstore that is not accessible by Thunderbird, nor can it retrieve Internet email. YMMV depending on Linux knowledge.\n\nA: I have searched far and wide, and it seems there are no GUI apps that do what I need. But, as of 3 April, it seems Postbox supports maildir.\n\nWe've changed the default storage format from mbox to Maildir.\n\nI will test it thoroughly and report back here.\n", "Q: Is it possible to STOP the 'Upgrade to macOS High Sierra' message that keeps stalking me?

Is there a way I can stop unknown numbers from messaging/calling before the event, i.e. for numbers that aren't in my Contacts list? My iPhone is running iOS 11.2.6.\n\nA: You can create a contacts group and add all (or desired) contacts to that group.\nOn your iPhone, enable Do Not Disturb. Go to Settings app → Do Not Disturb and select the group All Contacts from within Allow Calls From section under Do Not Disturb.\nYou can also create a Contacts group to selectively segregate contacts.

It seems like the trackpad gets locked when the MacBook is turned off and gets unlocked when turned on.\nI tried googling it but didn't find anything useful. Is this like a feature which is not being advertised or something? I am curious to know how does it works?\nI have a MacBook Pro 2016 Model. \n\nA: What you are experiencing is the haptic feedback from the Force Touch Trackpad available in your MacBook Pro. Starting 2015, the MacBook (Retina) and MacBook Pro Trackpads include a technology called Force Touch which can be configured to provide haptic feedback. Haptic feedback is experienced only when the MacBook Pro is powered on.\nTo learn more, refer to the Apple Support article, How to use the Force Touch trackpad.\n\nA: It is possible that you have run into a feature available in Apple's MacBook Pro and MacBook Retina models. The feature is called Haptic Feedback and is available on Force Touch trackpads. This was introduced with Retina MacBooks in 2015 and was subsequently made available in MacBook Pro models.\nThere are no moving parts in the trackpad itself. Rather a device under the trackpad senses a click and responds with movement of its own that feels like a click.\nYou can learn more about it by googling MacBook Haptic Feedback. Your symptoms seem to point in that direction, i.e. when powered off no click, when powered on it clicks.\n", "Q: Windows stopped working on Macbook I was able to install Windows 7 32-bit on my Macbook 2,1 and it functioned well.

For a MacBook2,1 the BCSS can be found at \"Boot Camp Support Software 4.0.4033\". \n\n", "Q: Changing the Desktop background of the current Space does not change the background for other Space(s) When I change the Desktop background in macOS, the change gets reflected only in the current Space and not the others. The background image I am selecting is one from the default set.\nI tried disabling use different spaces for displays but that didn't work either.\n\nA: This is the default behaviour in macOS. If you have more than one Space, the desktop background is changed only for the current Space and not for the others.\nDisabling use different spaces for displays have no relation to this behaviour whatsoever.\n", "Q: Option + Z keystroke does not insert the ohm symbol/omega (Ω) Every article that I can find on web suggests the keystroke Option + z to insert that Ω symbol on a Mac. However, on my Mac, when I press that combination, I get the ˀ character. I followed the instructions in this article.\n\nA: After changing my Input Source to U.S. (via System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources), the keystroke works as expected. Now pressing Option + z inserts the Ω character.\n", "Q: Disable \"Return to previous app\" button in iOS In iOS, when some action in an app causes another app to launch, a button appears in the status bar towards the left side of the screen, and when you press it, it returns you to the previous app (the app that caused the current app to launch). Here is what I mean:\n \nIs it possible to disable it? If so, how?\n\nA: This is the standard iOS behaviour and nothing can be done to change it.\nFor more info, read this answer and subsequent comments on StackOverflow.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect iPhone to Sound In port on PC running Windows 7? Is it possible through a male/male cable to route audio from my iPhone 6 to my computer through the Sound In port?\n\nA: Yes, you can use the iPhone 6's headphone port to connect a male to male mini-stereo cable to a line-in/microphone port on a PC. Since you are going from digital to analog to analog to digital, you should expect the sound quality to be fairly poor.\n", "Q: Malware and Viruses on Mac In most of the places, the Mac computers are protected against the malware and viruses, but not all of them. This means that even Mac computers may be infected with these dangerous things.\nHow can we understand that mac computer is infected with a malware or virus ? This is very easy for the computer with windows operating system because antivirus programs detect all dangerous things in the computer. On the other hand, anybody do not advise me to install a Mac protecter program because most of them are malware itself.\n\nA: It's generally upto you to keep a watch for any suspicious activity on your Mac to detect presence of a malware or virus. If you are tech savvy and follow news around Apple, you should be able to hear about any newly discovered threat. Apple software engineering team is quite prompt and quickly releases patches fixing any newly uncovered serious iOS and macOS threats.\nIt is highly recommended to always keep your OS up to date.\n", "Q: Merge folders and subfolders in macOS I have 2 folders that I need to merge.\nInside each folder are subfolders.

Today I saw that 2 different positions in \"manage storage\" menu differ in size: Photos and Photo Library. I would like to know what is stored in which, but it is my first Mac and I cannot (or do not know how) simply check what lies underneath - both positions opens in the same window of Photos app.\nScreenshot below: \n\nA: I checked the file sizes on my computer as well:\n\nAs you can see, my Photos application is 56.4 MB, while my Photos Library is 13.38 GB.\nWhat's Going On\nThe reason that the Photos application is so small compared to the library is because the application only contains the files necessary to run the application - you can right-click and select \"Show Package Contents\" to confirm this. The library, though, is stored externally, by default in ~/Pictures/Photos Library/, and all of your photos are stored there instead of in the app.\nI believe the reason the application works this way is so that you can store your files externally, saving space, while keeping the core application internally, where it doesn't take up much space but still runs more quickly than accessing an external drive. Note that you can move your Photos Library and/or use option+click on opening to select a different library to flip through.\nOther native applications that work in the same or a similar way include iTunes (files stored in ~/Music/iTunes), Photo Booth (~/Photos/Photo Booth Library), iPhoto (RIP; ~/Photos/iPhoto Library), and iMovie (~/Movies/iMovie Library and ~/Movies/iMovie Theater).\nWhy the Size Changes\nIn a comment, you had mentioned that\n\nIt was one of my suspicions, but initially I am sure I saw, that it was bigger than 294mb (approx. 1GB), so it looks like it also changes in time.\n\nThis is entirely possible. You don't say how long ago you saw it being that large, but Photos does contain some files that can be accessed by other applications as well, such as those contained in .../Photos.app/Contents/Library/Automator, which, on my copy, contains 13 Automator actions which can be inserted into workflows, such as \"Add to Album,\" \"Display Reference Photo,\" or \"Instant Slideshow Controller.\" Furthermore, at .../Photos.app/Contents/Plugins there is, on my mac, two plugins. It's possible for this list to be modified by adding in other .appex files.\nThe simplest explanation for what you're seeing, though, is that the software was updated in a MacOS software update at some point. Remember that the filing system was completely overhauled in High Sierra; perhaps a corollary to different files being stored differently is that they are now smaller.\n", "Q: pf.conf to block *only* a specific IP address when VPN is not connected I'm trying to configure a packet filter firewall to block access to a small range of IP addresses when a VPN is not connected.\nMy rules should allow https/http traffic apart from this small, specific list of IP addresses. It's important the device can not reach these IP address when the VPN is not connected. \nI'm using the built in macOS VPN in 10.13\nI've got some fairly standard stuff in my rules so far:\nvpn_ifs = \"{ utun1 ipsec0 }\"\nhw_ifs = \"{ en0 en1 en2 }\"\n...\npass quick on $vpn_ifs\n\nThe reason for my request is that I have a web based resource I can only access once the VPN is connected. Allowing connectivity to this resource before the VPN is connected disables access to my account. \nI need access to http and https traffic before the VPN is established to enable services that need to function before the VPN connection is up. Including, but not limited to captive portal support.\n\nA: Each packet is evaluated against the filter ruleset from top to bottom and the last matching rule wins. The quick keyword is the only exception: the packet will be blocked or passed immediately unperturbed by any later rule.\nAssuming you are using the deny all approach you have to explicitly allow packets to pass in or out.\nRule set:\nblock all\n...\n\nTo meet your \"web based resource\" requirement you have to quick allow/deny packets depending on the interface:\npass out quick on $vpn_ifs from any to { <web_res1>, <web_res2> } no state  \nblock out quick on $hw_ifs from any to { <web_res1>, <web_res2> } no state\n\nTo meet your \"http and https traffic\" requirement you have to allow outgoing traffic to port 80/443:\npass out on $hw_ifs from any to any port { 80, 443 }\n\nUsing the deny all approach you have add some more rules (e.g. to allow traffic from/to local networks).\nThe final rule set looks like this then:\nblock all\n...\nrules\n...\npass out quick on $vpn_ifs from any to { <web_res1>, <web_res2> } no state  \nblock out quick on $hw_ifs from any to { <web_res1>, <web_res2> } no state\n...\npass out on $hw_ifs from any to any port { 80, 443 }\n...\nmore rules\n\n\nHere is an example of a deny all pf.conf with a lot of rules explained. The rules are used on a FreeBSD Gateway though: some mustn't be applied or aren't useful in your environment. Single rules don't work at all (e.g. ALTQ related features).\n", "Q: Can’t choose startup disk after wiping hard drive from OSX Utilities I’m helping someone with their old laptop (17”, mid-2009, if that matters). I restarted with cmdR to load OSX Utilities, and I used Disk Utility to wipe Macintosh HD, overwriting it three times and formatted as OS X Extended (Journaled). \nAfterwards, after successfully connecting to my Wi-Fi, I clicked on Reinstall OS X, and it’s giving me the option to set up El Capitan (the OS X that’s installed, and from what I can tell, the latest that can be installed). But when I hit continue, it gives me an error message:\n\nAn error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again. \n\nI get the same message every time I try. So I thought I’d try quitting OS X Utilities without reinstalling OS X and see what happens. \nAfter clicking on Choose Startup Disk, I get a blank list to choose from, with a restart button. No startup disks are available. Clicking restart, as one might expect, yields the following error message:\n\nYou can’t change the startup disk to the selected disk.\nStartup Disk could not gather enough information on the selected disk. \n\nSo I quit Startup Disk and went back to Disk Utility, and I tried running First Aid on both Macintosh HD and OS X Base System. Neither one had any issues. \nSo what is my issue? Did I mess up when wiping the hard drive? Do I just need to reformat it? Is there anything I can do, or have I rendered this computer a hunk of junk? Also, how do I prevent this in the future?\n\nA: Well, your having wiped and reformatted the HD, there IS no bootable volume on that machine, so that HD cannot be selected as a bootable startup disk, as it has NO data on it at all, let alone a full Mac OS with which to boot.\nYou'll need to see about getting that OS installer downloaded set up as an ISO on optical media using a different machine to do this, and then running the installer on the target machine from the optical media I think, given the issues you're seeing when trying the network install option.\n\nA: Try to restart with alt cmd R. In the OS X Utilities, the Reinstall OS X option, installs the most upgraded and compatible OS for your MAC model. It worked for me (no need to change the date and boot off line from external drive).\n\nA: You need to close the startup window through top bar navigation\nAfter that you will have options to re-install MacOS through the Internet\n", "Q: Transferring data to a new external hard drive without breaking links I'm trying to migrate my data from an old external hard drive to a new one. When I copy and paste from within Finder, the data seems to expand to take up much more space, so I'm assuming some link structure is being lost. What's the most robust way to do this?\nDetails:\nI have a Mac Pro running High Sierra with 1TB internally, plus a 4TB external drive that I use for data, including iMovie projects. It's formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). The external drive is now full, so I want to replace it with a new 10TB drive. I've formated the new drive identically, and now want to transfer all my files across to it. When I did this by copying and pasting within Finder, I noticed something strange - Disk Utility tells me that the space used on the old drive was 3.9TB, but on the new drive this had jumped to 5.2TB. Looking at the original folders individually, I see that they indeed add up to 5.2TB, which is clearly impossible since they fit on a 4TB drive. I notice that there's an iMovieEvents folder and an iMovieLibrary package, both of size 1.35TB, and I'm assuming that some links between these are using the same data twice. So how can I best copy the entire drive with all its link structures etc onto the new drive? Rsync? cp?\nThanks.\n\nA: This might be due to the file system’s allocation size. \nTo check, use Get Info to get the space on disk for a tiny file on both disks. \nFor a more definitive answer, try this command in Terminal on each disk:\nstat -f %k .\n\nIf the large disk uses a larger size, your small files will take extra space. That can be resolved, but it might not be worth the work. \n", "Q: Setting an alarm using Siri on Apple Watch does not set an alarm on iPhone When I set an alarm on my Apple Watch only the watch goes off when the alarm time comes around. I'd like my phone to also participate in the alarm. \nI've even tried saying: \"Hey Siri, set an alarm on my phone...\" and that went off on my watch only.\nIs this just the way it is, or is there a setting I'm not seeing that pushes the alarm to the iPhone?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is just how the Apple Watch handles alarms and timers. You can set an alarm or timer on your iPhone and get it on both your Apple Watch and iPhone, but an alarm or timer on the Apple Watch only goes off on the watch.\nIf this is something you are interested in having added in future iOS releases, perhaps send some feedback to Apple via this form. No guarantees on effectiveness of these feedback forms, but it's certainly better than nothing.\n", "Q: Safari search suggestions do not appear when iOS restrictions are enabled If I set Website Restrictions to Limit Adult Content, Safari stops showing search engine suggestions regardless of the engine being used (Bing, Yahoo, Google, or DuckDuckGo). If I change the setting back to All Websites, it starts working again. Search suggestions do show up if I make the query from the search engine's webpage.\nI'm currently seeing this behavior on an iPhone 5S running iOS 11.2.6, but I've also seen it on other devices and OSs. If this is a known issue to Apple, I have yet to find a public statement about it.\nHow do I make search suggestions work when iOS restrictions are enabled?\n\nA: I was wondering too so asked Apple Support and got a confirmation that this behavior is expected. In my opinion, it does not make sense to disable this feature since the suggestions still work in other app browsers. It only makes the Safari user experience worse.\n", "Q: What does \"The iTunes Store is unable to process purchases at this time\" message mean and how can I fix it? I’ve been getting this message a lot. It just started today and I haven’t tried to purchase or download anything.\n\n\nA: This message typically occurs due to some temporary server side issue. For troubleshooting an error message like this, you should view Apple's system status.\nThere is no user-side fix. You have to simply wait for Apple's services to come back online.\n\nA: I had this problem for several weeks, starting in December 2020. I had four apps marked as having updates available. All of these failed with the error shown if I tried to update them. This is on an iPhone 4S running iOS 9.3.6.\nApple support suggested using two step security and registering a payment method, but these had no effect. Reset Network Settings had no effect. In Settings -> Privacy -> Location Services [on] -> System Services -> Setting Time Zone ON had no effect.\nAt this point I noticed that I could install a new app (different from all of the ones waiting updates).\nSigning out and back in again to the App Store had no effect. Force restart had no effect. Factory Reset and restoring apps and data from iCloud had no effect.\nWhatsApp was the app I was keenest to update (because they blocked the use of my previous version). I deinstalled WhatsApp. I installed WhatsApp. The first attempt no longer showed the \"The iTunes Store is unable to process purchases at this time\" message but failed in an obscure way. The second attempt worked!\n\nA: Actually, there is a way to fix this on user-side. I've been having this issue for several days and nothing seemed to help. The fix isn't soft, you should either restore your device from iTunes backup using your mac (not iCloud backup that Apple recommends) or set it up as a completely new device. Setting it up as a new device will erase your programs and data so you should understand what you're doing, however for me it was the only option to fix the \"The iTunes Store is unable to process purchases at this time\" issue.\n\nA: on an iPhone 4 i fixed this by switching on 'automatic downloads' for 'updates' under: settings -> 'iTunes & App Stores'...\n", "Q: Limit Total Size of Cached Files I have a beefy Docker image that I'd like to run on my work machine (OSX 10.13.3, 16 GB RAM, Core i5), but I find that when running the image, along with a web browser, that the computer crashes or needs to rest for long periods of time due to memory errors. Most of these  seem to stem from the set of cached files stored in memory, which seem to increase over time:\n\nIs there a way to put a hard limit on the size of the file cache (say, 2GB)?\n\nA: As seen here, it is possible to clean Cached Files manually, or you can install a third-party cleaner such as CleanMyMac 3. However, I would recommend leaving the Cached Files the way they are, as it can greatly speed up load times of applications running on your computer. Unfortunately, there is no native way to limit the size of the Cached Files folder.\n", "Q: What is portProxy.bin and why is it sucking/eating/using up my CPU? Through today, portProxy.bin has been eating up my CPU, constantly using about 60% and making the fans in my computer whizz up.\nI'm guessing it might be connected to my VPN use, but now I haven't been running any VPNs for some hours and portProxy has still been staying at around 60% CPU usage.\n\nI use Cisco AnyConnect to access my schools private network and Disconnect to block trackers and hide my location. Sometimes I forget to disable Disconnect before trying to connect through Cisco AnyConnect, but then AnyConnect can establish a connection and I'm reminded I have Disconnect running. Could this have something to do with it?\nThank you.\n\nA: I haven't figured out what portProxy.bin is or why it was hogging my CPU, so if you know this, please edit and replace this text with an explanation.\nI did a restart and that corrected the problem.\n", "Q: Is cloud syncing possible with FileVault? Today, on my professional computer, I wanted to open a personal document (PDF) directly from Dropbox website. However, it was impossible for Dropbox to show a preview of this PDF file (This file can’t be previewed). Actually, I couldn't preview any of the files stored on my Dropbox, and downloading them didn't help either.\nMy Dropbox is synchronized with a local folder on my Mac, on which FileVault is activated.\nI have another folder on my Mac which is synchronized with a webserver, using Nextcloud's app (similar to Owncloud). When using the web interface of Nextcloud, I couldn't open the files either.\nIs it possible that, with FileVault activated, an encrypted version of my files are stored on Dropbox and Nextcloud server?\nIf yes, is there a way to circumvent this issue?\nI didn't have this problem in the past, but since I activated FileVault some weeks ago, I thought it could be the cause.\n\nA: No, there's no possibility of FileVault suddenly \"activating\" and encrypted the contents of just one file. This is not at all how FileVault works.\n", "Q: Recovering lost voicemails after carrier switch I switched from AT&T to T-Mobile today, and all the voicemails I had on my iPhone 5S (iOS 11) were lost after my AT&T account was closed.\nHow can I recover them?\n\nA: Luckily, this was possible (my important voicemails were not lost!) and you have three options, which I'll describe below. The first two will require a Mac (or maybe PC would work) and will cost you money (if you haven't already purchased the right app, or find an alternative that's reputable and free), while the third may be free.\n\nThe best option: obtain from iTunes backup\nIf you recently backed up your iPhone to iTunes on a Mac (fairly recently, before switching carriers) then you can use an app like PhoneView ($30) or iExplorer ($40) to recover your voicemails from the old iTunes backup.  PhoneView is free for up to the last 10 voicemails, but for more than that you'll need to buy it. With iExplorer, you'll need to buy it for any number of voicemail exports.\nPhoneView:\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your Mac (be sure to trust the Mac) and open PhoneView.\n\n*Click the \"iTunes Backups\" button in the top bar of the app and then click \"View Voicemail iTunes Backups\".\n\n*Choose the correct device in the Phone dropdown, then select all items (with command + A) and choose \"Save Messages\" to save them to your Mac.\n\niExplorer:\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your Mac (be sure to trust the Mac) and open iExplorer.\n\n*In the left sidebar, click the dropdown arrow next to the most recent backup of your iPhone.\n\n*Choose the \"Voicemail\" button you'll now see in the sidebar.\n\n*Click \"Export All...\" to export all of your voicemails to your Mac.\n\n\nThe other good option: restore from iCloud backup\n\n*\n\n*Check in iCloud settings to ensure your phone was last backed up to iCloud before switching carriers.\n\n*Then, factory reset your device (or, better, a separate iPhone whose data you don't care about losing).\n\n*Once it resets, set it up by signing into your iCloud account and restoring from an iCloud backup. Be sure to use the most recent backup (before switching carriers) of your iPhone.\n\n*Wait for it to restore, then connect it to iTunes on your Mac. Follow the iTunes portion of these instructions to create an iTunes backup of your newly-restored iPhone on your Mac. You don't need to encrypt the backup.\n\n*With the iTunes backup made, start following the instructions in the section above (\"The best option\").\n\n\nThe questionable, but maybe free option: call the GLDC\nI contacted AT&T's chat support to ask them what to do before figuring out the methods above. Their representative told me to do the following:\n\nTo recover your VMs, you'll want to call the Global Legal Demand Center (GLDC), formerly known as the National Compliance Center (NCC). Their number is 800-635-6840.\nJust ask them you need your VMs for legal purposes.\n\nKind of questionable, but maybe worth a shot!\n\nHope this helps, and leave a comment below if I can help more.\n", "Q: Is there a recommended method of maintaining multiple Photos libraries on same hard drive My main Master Photos Library is over 400GB, and getting too big to tote around on trips.  I keep it on removable HD.  So I started creating new library for each trip.  Problem now is managing them all, and creating a master.  I use Power Photos (from Fat Cat) to move photos between libraries, but they don't support Live Photos.  A given trip might be as many as 4000 photos.  Some from SLR some from iPhone (Live Photo) and I combine them in the library.  Any suggestions on managing these and combining the libraries?\n\nA: Honestly Photos.app is not really designed as a pro or semi-pro photo managing application. It certainly seems to handle larger libraries better than iPhoto ever did but if you are taking that many pictures and want to manage them on your Mac you might want to consider an app designed specifically for the workflow and archiving of thousands of pictures.\nAdobe has an app for that (Lightroom, I think it is called), and like many Adobe apps is the subject of much praise and anger online. Me, I just use photos.app because my needs are met with photos.app, but it sounds like you might be better served with something more capable than a consumer level photo managing app. IMHO\n", "Q: Can't move items to Trash – resistant to usual fixes On an internal data-only SATA HD, the OS forces me to delete files immediately, just as for removable media, a mounted network volume, or any unwritable volume. \nAlready tried removing and recreating the .Trashes directory, etc. \nThe error message is familiar: \n\nAre you sure you want to delete “filename.ext”?\n  This item will be deleted immediately. You can’t undo this action.\n\nI am working in the 501 account, the primary admin. \nFrom the volume root, the permissions settings I see are: \n\ndrwxrwxrwx     root  admin    .Trashes\n\nAnd for the Trash subdirectory belonging to the user account, it's also: \n\ndrwxrwxrwx     root  admin     501\n\nWrites are not getting denied by extended permissions (because there aren't any). \nThe drive is seen by the System as a generic internal journaled SATA HD that's writable, repairable, not ejectable, and not bootable. No problems found with file structures on the volume.  Already recreated the Finder's plist file for luck. \nI can live with the behavior, but it interferes with file de-duplication apps among other things. What am I not thinking of? \nTrash on the System disk works as expected. OS X El Capitan v. 10.11.6 (desktop OS, no OS X server).\n\nThanks for the pointer to https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/249328/trash-folder-not-a-directory-files-only-delete-immediately but I've got a different situation. \nThe earlier question was about a .Trash folder inside the users' Home directory on a startup volume. Other local volumes have a different file architecture, and the OS manages them differently by design. \nThe answers don't apply either, because the OP's temporary fix does not make a difference for me, and in my case the required attributes for the .Trashes and 501 directories are not getting removed. Those look fine on inspection, although the Trash folder on that volume doesn't function. \n\nA: Filesystem errors that bedevil daily use... grrr... I had something similar to that and nothing I did: repairing the disk, using DiskWarrior and some of the tricks you tried, did a thing.\nFinally I got fed up and backed up the drive, deleted the partition and recreated it and reformatted it. Problem went away. If you asked me what caused it I couldn't tell you, but backing up a drive that was basically an internal backup drive so I could re-partiton was almost as annoying as living with the problem.\n", "Q: How to return a captive portal page; e.g. Starbucks \\ McDonald's WiFi landing page? Normally, Safari provides a pop-up window for the public  Wi-Fi's landing page: requesting the user to agree to TOS (Terms of Service). \nAttempts to login to Wi-Fi were not successful because of the absence of the landing page:\n\n\n*\n\n*ifconfig revealed an IP address (172.31.99.185) was assigned to the laptop's Wi-Fi adapter\n\n*attempts to ping 172.31.99.1 failed\n\n*browsing to http://172.31.99.1/ failed\n\n*browsing to http://www.google.com/ failed\n\n\nIs there a Safari menu item or process that will call the TOS pop-up?\n\nA: If the captive portal auto detection doesn't work, and hitting a common domain (like google.com), try a domain you don't normally visit (and hence won't be cached anywhere). Try borg.org, for example.\nIf that still doesn't get you the landing page, it's time for extreme measures. You can get more information about the DHCP config it got with ipconfig getpacket en0 (or en1, or whatever the Wi-Fi interface is); look especially at the \"server_identifier\" (the server that sent the info), \"router\", and \"domain_name_server\" lines. Try hitting those in your browser and see if any get you a landing page.\nStill nothing? Next try host www.cnn.com x.x.x.x where x.x.x.x is the domain name server (if there are several, try with each). If you get back any IPs that weren't already on the list, try them in a browser.\nBTW, the reason this sometimes doesn't work automatically is basically that it's all highly nonstandard. Captive portals are a hack that someone came up with to control access to a wireless network in a way that the standards didn't handle. Lots of other manufacturers copied the idea, but everyone did it a little differently, and it hijacked real web pages in the browser, and was generally a mess. So Apple built a system into macOS that'd try to detect captive portals and display the landing page automatically, in a way that didn't hijack the browser... but since there are so many variants on the idea, it's hard to build a system that handles them all. And then sometimes the local network admin sets things up weirdly, and... basically, it's a hack to get around another hack, and as a result there are a lot of ways for it to fail. Frankly, I'm kind of amazed it works as often as it does.\n\nA: On macOS 10.15 I had to\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences-> Network -> Wifi -> Advanced -> Proxies\n\n*enable \"Auto Proxy Discovery\"\n\n*restart my Mac\n\n\nOther things I tried prior that did not solve the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*navigating to a non-https site (http://neverssl.com is my goto)\n\n*navigating to a well-known (even though https) site: google.com\n\n*navigating to the router's IP address\n\n\n*\n\n*This did for a second attempt to route to the login page (you could see it in the URL bar), but it didn't load.\n\n\n*removing this network and (restarting the computer before) reconnecting to it.\n\n*ensuring that my DNS settings were defaults (rather than e.g. google's or cloudflare's)\n\n\nn.b.

I’ve had success with this technique.\n\nA: Go to http://captive.apple.com it’s the only way to ensure it pops up.\nApple now supports DHCP option 114 (as of iOS 14 iirc) to let network operators define a non-default captive URL trigger and suggests the full URL is http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html\nThe shorter URL works great for me as does this explainer of how to drop and signal auto log in on these captive networks:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204497\n\nA: Usually captive portals are triggered by DNS and web browser requests to sites like cnn.com or nyt.com so I would try that first.\nThe “magic” url that seems to work across Apple OS is http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html and in practice, I rarely have to add the hotspot-detect.html to http://captive.apple.com/\n\nA: Usually www.cnn.com works for me, but not lately on my Mac Air.  What worked was opening up Safari browser and entering www.purple.com .  The login page popped up immediately!\n\nA: The biggest culprit was Kasperski anti-virus software. I uninstalled the software on my Macbook, and I'm now able to get the popup to work at Starbucks. Keep in mind - deleting Kasperski (or any other anti-virus) app won't do it. You have to use the uninstall program.\n\nA: I used to frequently run into this problem in older versions of macOS, such as Mavericks. I always worked around it by navigating directly to the address of the wifi router.\n\n\n*\n\n*option + click on the wifi icon in your menu bar, and look for the line that says Router: followed by an IP address (a series of dots and numbers). In a majority of cases, the address will be 192.168.1.1\n\n*In your web browser, navigate to http:// followed by the IP address from step 1. So in the most common case, I would navigate to http://192.168.1.1\n\nA: Many people use alternative DNS servers like Google or Cloudflare. Captive Portals depend on using their own DNS resolution. Try going to Wifi settings and clearing your custom DNS settings. I was at Starbucks and tried the captive.apple.com which did not work and then cleared the custom DNS settings which the portal then did pop up.\n\nA: Gordon’s answer is very good. There is a situation where it won’t work:\nI just realized that this issue can also happen if in the advanced network configuration you have configured a custom DNS IP address.\nCheck and to fix, simply go to\nSystem Preferences -> Network -> WiFi -> Advanced… -> DNS\nand see if there are only IP addresses that are greyed out (good) or if you have IP addresses in normal (bright) letters (bad).\nIf you find custom configured IP addresses, just click on each and the “-“ button at the bottom left of the window.\n", "Q: iPhone 7 not being recognized by computer I have an iPhone 7.  My screen broke so I got it replaced.  It went underwater and then the home button started vibrating when I pressed it.  The screen flickered in and out.  The next day I could press the home button and it would vibrate but the screen was completely off.  I plugged it into my computer and iTunes recognized it but I couldn't type in my passcode.  \nHow can I get a backup of my phone? \n\nA: If you have a wired lightning keyboard, you can connect it to your iPhone, press the home button twice with 1 second delay to bring up the password screen, type in your password and press Enter. Your phone should unlock and you should be able to back it up. If you didn't sync it with the current computer before, your phone will ask you if you want to trust the current computer. You might be able to use the Tab key or the arrow keys to navigate between yes and no buttons and then press Enter to allow the computer to sync your iPhone (not tested).\n\nA: Sounds like your LCD screen may be damaged as a result of the water contact. If possible try another replacement screen and that will confirm if its the motherboard or the visual ic chip. \nP.s. After having a screen replaced your iPhone is no longer waterproof!\n", "Q: Cannot play videos in in macOS Finder Upgraded on 2018/03/28\nAfter restart macOS, Safari/Google Chrome cannot play embedded videos. \nBut...\nIn macOS I opened Finder and located a mp4 file, press space to quick view the content. I got a blank window with a loading icon. (This video can be played in this way yesterday.)\nI use ctrl+click and select Open with, use QuickTime to play it. But QuickTime responded an error said The document \"xxxx\" could not be opened. An unknown error occurred (-101).\n\nOriginal question\nSafari/Google Chrome cannot play embedded videos in website. I can see the 1st frame of the video and I can drag the progress bar to move the timeframe, it shows the frames. But when I clicked play button the video does not get played.\nIn Google Chrome I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling the hardware acceleration.\n\n*Disabling the Ad Blocker.\n\n*Clearing the browser data.\n\n*Disabling the QUIC protocol.\n\n\nIn Safari I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allowed auto play for videos with sounds\n\n\nThe websites in question are not using Flash, just HTML5 video.\nI am running macOS High Sierra 10.13.3 with Google Chrome 66.0.3359.45 (beta-64bit) and Safari 11.0.3.\n\nA: After contacted Apple Support I got this problem resolved, by using the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down Mac\n\n*Unplug all external devices. To me they are bluetooth keyboard and trackpad\n\n*Start Mac and hold on Command + Option + P + R immediately\n\n*Mac tried to restart (the screen turned on and off)\n\n*Release Command + Option + P + R, let Mac restarted\n\n\n\"Command + Option + P + R\" cleared PRAM and let Mac re-exam all hardwares and build correct info into PRAM.\nFor more information about it please refer https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1788029 \n\nA: I experienced the same issue, and it turned out that it was a hardware problem for me: after replacing the hard disk in a Mac mini, I accidentally did not reconnect the audio board. Reconnecting it resolved the problem. A give-away was that the Mac could not detect a sound output either.\nSo it seems that the -101 error indicates a hardware error.\n", "Q: How do I get \"get-iplayer\" to use an already installed ffmpeg? I'm following these instructions (scroll down to \"Manual Installation\") to manually install get-iplayer Terminal command (don't want to use brew):\nI see that this requires (and talks you through--partly) the install of ffmpeg and AtomicParsley. \nI already installed ffmpeg weeks ago for another purpose so I really don't want another install of ffmpeg if I can do without it. (Can I?)\nHow can I proceed without installing another copy of ffmpeg?\n\nA: I would reccomend installing Homebrew and running brew install ffmpeg. That way you can delete the other one, because Homebrew installs it in /usr/local/bin so you won't have to worry about path issues.\nTo install from the source you've already got:\nFrom this page:\ncd ~/Downloads/ffmpeg to go to the FFMPEG directory\n./configure along with your needed flags. You probably won't need anything additionally for what you're doing.\nmake and then sudo make install. Be sure to type your admin password.\n", "Q: AirDrop fails to transfer files from MacBook Pro to iPhone I am unable to transfer a music file from my MacBook Pro (2015 model A 1398) to my iPhone 5s. Here are the messages shown on both the MacBook Pro and the iPhone:\nmacOS:\n\n\n\niOS:\n\n\n\nI have turned on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Both devices (iPhone and MacBook Pro) are able to detect each other through AirDrop. But when I attempt to transfer the file from MacBook Pro to iPhone by clicking on the iPhone, it shows failed.\nThere is no problem transferring files (images, music) using AirDrop from iPhone to MacBook Pro.\nHow to resolve this one-way failure issue?\n\nA: It appears that you are attempting to copy audio files from MacBook Pro to iPhone using AirDrop. It is not possible to transfer audio files this way. The way to get audio files from MacBook Pro to iPhone is to sync them via iTunes.\nUsing AirDrop, you can transfer photos, videos, locations, to an iOS devices or share a URL to open in iOS Safari. For more details, please refer to the Apple Support article, Use AirDrop to send content from your Mac.\nHowever, it is possible to transfer an audio or any other type of file without restriction from one Mac to another using AirDrop.\n", "Q: Copy files searched with find command using xargs command I'd like to copy the files searched using find command into the current directory.

Half an hour ago the battery was fully-charged, it is now at 84% charge.\nI'm not running any energy-intensive app, as determined by the energy tab in Activity Monitor app, as shown in the illustration below:\n\nAdditionally, my MacBooks dies without any warning. macOS used to notify of low charge previously, but now it just dies without any notification.\nI've never seen the percentage when it dies but I am suspicious that the battery isn't hitting 0%.\nHow do I resolve the issue.\n\nA: Since it's easy to do, the first things I'd try are to reset both the NVRAM and SMC in that order. Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected (so, unplug any external displays, storage devices, etc) and make sure you use the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nHere’s how to reset the NVRAM on your particular MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the SMC on your particular MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issue still persists.\n\nA: If you're on a new 2017 or 2018 MBP and your battery is dying quickly, it may be Google Chrome.  Chrome forces high performance GPU mode regardless of being on battery/AC.  As soon as you shut off Chrome you'll see your battery extend back to 8-10 hours. \nSource: https://mkn.us/blog/brand-new-macbook-pro-battery-dying-quickly/\n", "Q: Recovering photos deleted from iOS devices I deleted photos from my iPhone when the phone memory was full. I subsequently deleted them from my iPad too. Now I can't find them anywhere.\nI checked on iCloud but I can't see all of them. How do I recover the photos on my iPad?\n\nA: If you didn't delete your photos from \"Recently Deleted\" album and it hasn't been 30 days since you deleted them, you can check that album in the Photos app. They should be there. Otherwise, they are gone for good if you don't have any copies or backups of them.\n", "Q: Unable to find an app in the App Store I am trying to locate an app in the App Store, but I couldn't find it. I want to download it to my iPad. All the software on iPad is updated to the latest available version.\nThe App name has been entered correctly. Is it possible that the app is blocked for certain areas/regions?\nHow can I locate and download it?\n\nA: You can try visiting the developer's website and click the App Store link for the app. Searching for the app on the Web can also fetch you the App Store link.\nIf you have previously downloaded the app and are not able to find it anymore on the App Store, there's a possibility that either the developer of Apple has taken the app off the App Store or the same is no longer available in your region.\nThe best way to resolve is to get in touch with the developer via their website.\n\nA: You can do a web search with Name of your app + iTunes.By this way you can easily find the App Store link for the app, which can take you to directly to the app in the App Store.\nFor example, if you search Reeder 3 iTunes, then you can find this App Store link.\n", "Q: Ownership of the .config folder in home directory Who is supposed to be the owner of the .config directory under user's home folder?\nOn my machine it appears to be owned by the system user and it is only readable by that user.\nSeveral programs, like Homebrew and git (which should be allowed to be used without root permissions) complain by producing warnings as shown below:\nwarning: unable to access '/Users/andrea/.config/git/attributes': Permission denied\nPerhaps the ownership of my .config folder was changed in mistake?

What were the sysmptoms? How long has it been acting up? (etc...) Having said that, experience dictates that often times drives of all types just stop working.\nI have even had drives that stopped working start working again when I try something else. Similar to what you did in re-creating your fusion drive.\nI would be willing to bet the SSD is toast and needs to be replaced. And considering how SSD prices have dropped you can get a big SSD and use it entirely as a stand alone drive and the other drive as \"overflow.\"\nYou could try rebooting in recovery mode and running disk utility on the SSD. And even a third party disk repair utility. But the drive working intermittently (or at this point not working more than it is working) is a sign that you need to replace it.\n", "Q: My mac will not let me save word documents I have a MacBook Pro from 2016 and as of this morning I have not been able to save my Word documents (Word 2017). I've never had issues before.\nWhen I press save on a new document, a message pops up saying, \"Word cannot save this document due to naming or permissions error on the destination volume.\" Once I press OK to dismiss the message another message pops up and says the \"Document 13\" cannot be saved as \"New Name\". Why is this happening? \n\nA: The hint here is \"... naming or permissions error on the destination volume.\" Word is telling you that it sees corruption/damage where you want to save the document.\nAnd I'll bet you see it even if you try to save it to a USB key as well.\nMicrosoft is a great provider for those of us who do tech support for a living. What that error likely means is that something in MS Word (and possibly the rest of MS Office) on your system is damaged. The part is most likely in the part of Word that writes to disk.\nWhat I would do is run the MS Word/Office installer and reinstall (or repair if that option is available) MS Word.\nFailing that it could be that the temporary (recovery) file that Word creates for every document is damaged or that the preference file for MS Word is also damaged.\nThe former is here:\n /Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery.\n\nThe latter is here:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Word.plist\n\nTrash all the autorecovery files and trash the .plist file and launch MS Word again. That should fix it.\nIf not you may actually have file system damage on your HD. In that case boot into Recovery Mode, launch Disk Utility and repair/verify the disk.\n\nA: This is a repeating error that seems to keep coming back once you get it. You can re-install Office and it will go away for a short while, then come back. I've seen people buy a new Mac, and the problem will follow from old Mac to new. It is clearly a software problem, and it is somewhere in Word. I've spent hours reinstalling over and over, deleting every last trace if anything microsoft related. It keeps coming back. I don't know if it's random, or a conflict with some other software. But unfortunately, you may be stuck with this problem. \n\nA: The true problem is that word for mac (and Windows) saves in the .docx  file format and word can no longer find that folder.For some reason Apple iCloud has taken the folder so that it can not be seen by word.Go to Finder and locate and then drag the 'documents\" folder back up to the top of the list of finder folders.That should do it.It did for me.   \n\nA: I gave up and clicked the red \"Close\" button, which allowed the \"Save As\" box to finally appear. But don't want to live with Word like this going forward - what happened to the usual \"Save\" and \"Save As\" drop-downs?\n\nA: Check the permission of the location you are trying to save at. Make sure that 'everyone' is allowed to read and write. That fixed it for me when trying to save to desktop (permissions must have somehow changed).\n\nA: All I needed to do is sign back into MS Office. Worked seamlessly.\n\nA: Okay, I had this problem too and think I found a solution. My circa 2014 desktop runs 10.13.6 and would get locked up on the swirling rainbow ball when I tried to save a Word .doc intermittently. I tried the solutions above and none fixed it permanently, but I finally noticed at the bottom left of the document frame a reference to it seeking my printer.\nWhy does it seek my printer when I'm not printing and only saving? No earthly idea. But after the umpteenth angry Force Quit, I went to my Systems folder, clicked on the Printer icon, and found that I had none. I refreshed and suddenly both were there (I have a scanner attached as well).\nNow, I check that before I open Word, and yep, problem solved. It's stupid and I hate it, but it seems to work now. Hope that helps someone.\n\nA: I was getting to the point where I couldn't save a Word document even with a new file name, and at times couldn't even open a previous document. I even changed every permission I could think of.\nFinally found the answer on a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUlEOoDd7Ks).\nI am running Mojave 10.14.6 on a Mac Pro.\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer, and as soon as you hear the chime (crescendo), press the Command+R and it will open your Mac in Recovery Mode.\n\n\n*Once your computer opens in Recovery Mode, go up to the \"Utilities\" in the top menu bar. Scroll down to Terminal...click on it to activate the Terminal\n\n\n*Once the Terminal screen opens (it looks a bit like code...which it is) simply type in the following (there's a grayed out box...just start typing...don't use your cursor):\nType the following:  csrutil disable\n(That is a space in-between the two command words) Then hit return. You should get a message that it changed the code:\nSuccessfully disabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect\n\n\n*Delete the Terminal box using the red button on the upper left corner of the Terminal screen\n\n\n*Under the Apple, go to \"restart\" and let your computer restart. It worked great on mine...no more permissions issues with Microsoft Word.\n\nA: Alternatively you can mail it to yourself if the problem persists.\n", "Q: Move the position of or hide the brightness/volume pop ups on high sierra \nCan I move the mini window that appears whenever I change the monitor brightness or keyboard brightness?\nI want it higher on the screen, or (ideally) not there at all.\n\nThe suggested duplicate doesn't answer my question because the answers work only on previous versions of macOS, here's what I get:\n$ sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.OSDUIHelper Disabled --bool YES\n2018-03-28 14:45:26.589 defaults[16565:159433] Unexpected argument YES; leaving defaults unchanged.\n\n\nA: SIP needs to be disabled, then I ran these:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.OSDUIHelper Disabled -bool YES\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.BezelUI Disabled -bool YES\nsudo reboot\n\nAnd it's worked, I no longer see the Overlays.\n\nA: I use Karabiner-Elements to re-bind the F1 and F2 keys to run my own Application which increases and decreases the brightness.\nThis prevents the overlay from being shown.\n\nI edited the ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json file to add a rule to Karabiner-Elements:\n\"rules\": [\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Assign brightness conrol to brightness keys, but hides the overlay\",\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"from\": {\n            \"key_code\": \"f1\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"mandatory\": [\n                \"fn\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to\": [\n            {\n              \"shell_command\": \"open -a DecreaseRetinaDisplayBrightness.app\"\n            }\n          ],\n          \"type\": \"basic\"\n        },\n      {\n        \"from\": {\n          \"key_code\": \"f2\",\n          \"modifiers\": {\n            \"mandatory\": [\n              \"fn\"\n            ]\n          }\n        },\n        \"to\": [\n          {\n            \"shell_command\": \"open -a IncreaseRetinaDisplayBrightness.app\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"basic\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nI am going to make my own apps DecreaseRetinaDisplayBrightness.app et al. because I need to be able to grant my AppleScripts assistive access, and I don't know how to grant osascript itself assistive access.\nTo make the Apps create a new Application in Automator:\n\nThe code to increase brightness by 1/16 at a time is this:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"displaysDisplayTab\" of pane \"com.apple.preference.displays\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\" to tell window \"Built-in Retina Display\"\n    set value of value indicator 1 of slider 1 of group 2 of tab group 1 to (get (value of value indicator 1 of slider 1 of group 2 of tab group 1) + 0.0625)\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\nObviously to decrease it's the same thing but subtracting 0.625 instead of adding it.\nI saved the Application in my Applications folder, then granted it assistive access from System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility:\n\nNow hitting fnF2 increases the brightness without showing any pop-up. Obviously some of the above steps have to be repeated to create the DecreaseBrightness App.\n\nOf course an almost identical method can be employed for volume and keyboard lights. Just write an AppleScript that controls each.\nE.g. my \"shell_command\" for volume decrease looks like\nosascript -e 'set volume alert volume ((alert volume of (get volume settings)) - 100/16)' && osascript -e 'set volume (alert volume of (get volume settings))*7/100'\n\n\nWhile it works it's not a perfect solution, it can sometimes momentarily steal focus, and is much laggier than Apple's default.\nI wonder if the lagginess can be improved by adjusting some of Karabiner's settings,\n\"parameters\": {\n  \"basic.simultaneous_threshold_milliseconds\": 50,\n  \"basic.to_delayed_action_delay_milliseconds\": 500,\n  \"basic.to_if_alone_timeout_milliseconds\": 1000,\n  \"basic.to_if_held_down_threshold_milliseconds\": 500\n}\n\nThe lag can be made less annoying by increasing the 0.0625 to larger values, so that you can faster get to the brightness you want (although with less precision). The 0.0625 was chosen to simulate the steps taken by Apple by default (1/16).\nAn ideal solution would be the updated version of the\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.OSDUIHelper Disabled --bool YES\n\ncommand that works for High Sierra 10.13.3.\nI also don't know how to fix this error that occurs if System Preferences is already open and doesn't have focus:\n\n", "Q: Thumbnail floating on screen after deletion from desktop I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running High Sierra 10.13.3.\nRecently when I have dragged and deleted image files from my desktop there has been a thumbnail of one of the pictures deleted left floating on the screen, it seems to be on a layer above anything else and the only way I can get rid of it is restarting my laptop.\nAnyone else experienced this/found a fix?\n\nA: ⌥-right-click on Finder in the Dock and choose Relaunch.\nThis is an occasional bug in Finder that's been around for years. In my experience it happens fairly randomly when dragging files or folders around. If you have reproducible steps to recreate the problem, you should file a bug report!\n", "Q: Override and restore the normal functionality of Apple keyboard media keys in VLC? We're all used to the media keys in the top row of an Apple keyboard to command iTunes, even when some other application is frontmost. \nIf I have VLC frontmost, those media keys don't control iTunes but work as \"next / previous\" in VLC, which is a rather annoying exception because not does it only make iTunes controlling unreachable, it's plain unnecessary because to navigate within the frontmost application, the norm is to use arrow keys, or cmd+arrow.\nHow do I reserve the good old media keys for iTunes, always?\nI'm on Yosemite.\n\nA: You can use Karabiner-Elements to set the play/pause button (on my keyboard fn+F8) to always control iTunes from any App (I know Apps besides just VLC also commandeer the iTunes buttons sometimes).\nJust add something like the following rule to ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json\n{  \n   \"description\": \"Play/pause button should only control iTunes.\",\n   \"manipulators\": [  \n      {  \n         \"from\": {  \n            \"key_code\": \"f7\",\n            \"modifiers\": {  \n               \"mandatory\": [  \n                  \"fn\"\n               ]\n            }\n         },\n         \"to\": [  \n            {  \n               \"shell_command\": \"osascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\" to previous track'\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"type\": \"basic\"\n      },\n      {  \n         \"from\": {  \n            \"key_code\": \"f8\",\n            \"modifiers\": {  \n               \"mandatory\": [  \n                  \"fn\"\n               ]\n            }\n         },\n         \"to\": [  \n            {  \n               \"shell_command\": \"osascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\" to playpause'\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"type\": \"basic\"\n      },\n      {  \n         \"from\": {  \n            \"key_code\": \"f9\",\n            \"modifiers\": {  \n               \"mandatory\": [  \n                  \"fn\"\n               ]\n            }\n         },\n         \"to\": [  \n            {  \n               \"shell_command\": \"osascript -e 'tell application \"iTunes\" to next track'\"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"type\": \"basic\"\n      }\n   ]\n}\n\nGet rid of the \"modifiers\" part if you normally press F8 without pressing fn to play/pause iTunes.\nThen in Karabiner-Elements you'd add your new rule as a complex modification:\n\n\nA: You don't need a third party tool. VLC has an open source heritage and they are all about customizing your apps to suit your personal preferences.\nOpen VLC and go to VLC > Preferences > Hotkeys\nYou can change what VLC uses there. \nNote that you will likely have to change what is already set by VLC to change to your preference.\nOn my Mac it would not let me select just F8 to change the keyboard shortcut for play/pause.

Or has anyone else fixed this issue before?\n\nA: It's not likely related your SATA drive because (besides it being specifically referenced to unencoded) decoding that error code tells us that it's the Ambient Temp Sensor.\n\n\n*\n\n*4SNES = System Error\n\n*T = Temperature\n\n*A = Ambient\n\n\nIf it had anything to do with the drive, you would see an \"H\" in the code - like THxx)\nThis is something that you will need to replace.\n\n", "Q: MacOS : No Japanese input method I have added Japanese as a favourite languages in preferences : \n\nHowever, in the Input Methods panel, the Japanese input method seems to be missing : \n\nHow can I fix that / add the Japanese IME ? \nNote : I don't want to install Google's or Mr.third party's Japanese IME.

On my Mac I have only 256 GB of storage so I chose \"Optimize Mac Storage\" to make more room. \nI have a NAS with a lot of available storage (it has apps for my Apple TV).  My internet connection is not great here so I would like to be able to extract the photos and videos from my Mac and into a common format on an external or network drive. \nI can write a script or a Swift program to do this work but I do not have a clue how to approach a resolution. I also looked at SQLite file of Photos, which can be queried with sqlite3 program an used the following query: SELECT imagePath FROM RKMaster but it does not contain all the photos since I did not Download everything to my Mac.\n\nA: You could do it in the Photos apps. If you launch it holding the option key, and choose to create a new library on the external drive. Then change the preferences to download all photos. It will take a while but that will download a full version of the library to the external. Then quit, safely remove the backup drive. Open again and choose the old local library, and quickly change the preference back to \"optimize\". It's a bit of a process but it should work.\n", "Q: How can I combine multiple groups of PDFs using the command line? I have 1000 groups of 5 pdf files I need to combine/merge. I aware of the \"/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py\" command and have created the 1000 different versions of the command I need. Currently I am copying and pasting each separate line into Terminal to run it. Is there a way to put all 1000 lines into a script and run the script.\nThanks\n\nA: The functionality to combine PDFs is built into Preview.app, and this can be a handy approach for dealing with small numbers of documents.\nRecent versions of macOS also have a Python script that automates this process for multiple PDF files. This script is located at: \n/System/Library/Automator/Combine\\ PDF\\ Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py\nYou can run the script directly in Terminal, but it might be handy to add an alias in your ~/.bash_profile:\nalias combinepdfs='/System/Library/Automator/Combine\\ PDF\\ Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py'\n\nInstead of typing the long location to the script every time, now you can run this script using a single command! (Don't forget to reload after making changes: source ~/.bash_profile.)\n\nSay I have a directory of lecture notes ~/Documents/Lectures that contains the following files:\nlec2.pdf  lec3.pdf  lec4.pdf  lec5.pdf  lec6.pdf  lec7.pdf  lec8.pdf  lec9.pdf lec10.pdf lec11.pdf lec12.pdf lec13.pdf lec14.pdf lec15.pdf lec16.pdf lec17.pdf \n\nI can combine these PDF files using the following command:\n$ combinepdfs -o lec-combined.pdf lec{2..17}.pdf\n\nThe general usage pattern is listed in the help command:\n$ combinepdfs --help\n\nUsage: join [--output <file>] [--shuffle] [--verbose]\n\n\nThere is also an extra feature to shuffle pages:\n--shuffle\n#       Take a page from each PDF input file in turn before taking another from each file.\n#       If this option is not specified then all of the pages from a PDF file are appended\n#       to the output PDF file before the next input PDF file is processed.\n\n", "Q: `devfs` runs in fully capacity continuously Run df and it reports from MacOS:\n    Filesystem    1024-blocks     Used Available Capacity iused               ifree %iused  Mounted on\n    /dev/disk1s1    118284248 89296708  25200204    78% 1280499 9223372036853495308    0%   /\n    devfs                 186      186         0   100%     644                   0  100%   /dev\n    /dev/disk1s4    118284248  3145860  25200204    12%       3 9223372036854775804    0%   /private/var/vm\n    map -hosts              0        0         0   100%       0                   0  100%   /net\n    map auto_home           0        0         0   100%       0                   0  100%   /home\n    /dev/disk2s1    126712832 29139200  97573632    23%  227650              762294   23%   /Volumes/Transcend\n\nThe devfs entry occupies physical space of 186, while it runs persistently in full capacity on my Mac. \nWhat's the mechanism behind it?\n\nA: It is a shim to hold just the directory entries needed to abstract the hardware devices and software outlets that the system mounts over /dev\nPay it no mind. \n", "Q: Change default highlight format in preview To highlight text in pdf files, I select the text and hit the highlight button:\n\nThe default was yellow highlight. Somehow, it got changed to a red underline. How can I change this back to yellow highlight again?\n\nA: The trick is that the Highlight defaults to the last font/type you used in the Note. Delete the notes and do again with the right Highlight\n\nA: The Preview help mentions:\n\nUse highlight mode: Click the Highlight button  (so it turns blue), click the down arrow next to the Highlight button, then choose a highlight color, underline, or strikethrough. Now, whenever you select some text, the highlighting style you chose is automatically applied to the text.\n\nSo de-select any text in an open PDF. Click the Highlight button - nothing should be highlighted additionally in your PDF now - click the down arrow and choose a color or strikethrough.\nYou can also determine several different highlight colors in a single PDF with this method (here yellow, pink and underline):\n\n\nA: I activated the Highlight button and, with that activated, I chose the new highlight color (yellow) - and whoa! Now the highlight color is yellow and I need not use the button every time, but only my mouse/pen.\n\n", "Q: Apple Activity March Challenge can anyone explain calculation? The March Challenge in the iOS Activity app is making no sense. At the beginning of the month it started out telling me I needed 719 Calories a day. And my average at the start of the month was:\n\n(Never mind the fact that I'm in Australia and my local setting is kilojoules, and that it should localise like every other app in the world does. Has no trouble showing me activity in kilojoules but the challenge can't show kilojoules?)\nObviously that figure is wrong. First mysterious number right there. 20,263 kilojoules, would that even be possible?\nI decided I wanted to get this badge so I converted the required daily average (719 calories) to kilojoules and got 3008.3. So I set the daily move goal to 3000 and planned to exceed it. And I have been, getting to around 4500 a day. So if I exceed the daily average goal the calculated average should be trending UP, right?\nNot so. Now it tells me I am under the daily required average (today it reports 699) and the figure is trending down though I am still exceeding it by 50% a day and have been well above it all month.\nPossible explanations I have considered....\n\n*\n\n*the USA uses a different kind of calories from the rest of the world\nand my conversion of cal-kj is wrong (seems ridiculous but U.S.\ngallons are different to imperial gallons)\n\n*this challenge is as broken as February's\n\n*the decreasing daily figure shown is how much I would need to every day of the rest of the month? But then the ridiculously high figure\nfrom the start of the month makes no sense. -\n\nSo can anyone explain this?\n\nA: Your phone’s math looks off. I’d contact support in case they have a unit error in your locale. In the US I can confirm from three different people, we have pretty aggressive goals set. One person is far less active than me and far less calories on their goal. Another works out a lot more and has a much higher increase needed in their daily burn. \nMy goal was 25,015 calories and I’m barely going to make it tomorrow on the 29th having worked out at least once a day which is far more than I did all year.  \n", "Q: How can I complete an iPad update when I can't hit \"continue\"? (broken digitizer) My iPad's digitizer has a few dead areas.  I can live with it.   I just updated iOS using iTunes, and it's saying \n                   Update completed  \n  Your iPad was updated successfully.  There are just a \n     few more steps to follow, and then you're done!\n\n                       Continue\n\n..... and, the \"continue\" button is right in a dead area on the digitizer. \nRotating the iPad does nothing; it will only interact in the home-button-down orientation.  \nI have tried home button, on/off and rebooting.  \nIs there any way I can access the iPad through iTunes to get through this screen? \n\nA: No. You'd need to enroll that iPad in a MDM that can push a profile to suppress that setup step. I still believe you'll need to tap something there as well on iOS 11 so you may need to pay to repair the digitizer at this point.\nIf you had screen zoom accessibility on, you might be able to multi you h your way to zooming and panning that control so it was on part of the digitizer that still works but I don't think that's enabled either during the pre-setup portion of iOS or amenable to set over iTunes and USB/WiFi sync. \n", "Q: Can we use two thunderbolt 1 ports as two inputs into a 4k monitor I'm wondering if an early 2013 macbook pro retina (so two thunderbolt 1 ports, each supposedly outputting up to 10gbps) can have both thunderbolt ports plugged into a Dell or LG 43 inch 4k monitor as two separate inputs to drive 4k @ 60hz.\nOnline, it says that these monitors support multiple inputs, so half of the screen can be driven by one computer and the other half by another.  Although thunderbolt 1 alone can't output 4k @ 60hz, I'm wondering if I can use one port to output 4k @ 60hz to the top half (or left half) of the monitor and use the other port for the other half, and thereby put two pieces together.\nHas anyone tried this?  Is it even theoretically possible given the data transfer rates with thunderbolt 1 and the data necessary for 4k @ 60hz?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is only possible on monitors that require two cables to run at full resolution. As far as I know this is only the Dell 5K monitor (http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/dell-27-ultrasharp-ultra-hd-5k-monitor-up2715k/spd/dell-up2715k-monitor).\nEven if you were to connect a 4K monitor that supports multiple inputs to your MacBook, it would connect as two separate monitors with two separate spaces, so you'd see the menubar twice.\n", "Q: Command + Tab won't restore a minimised app I'm on a Mac for the first time in 25 years. It is running macOS Sierra version 10.12.6.\nWhen I press Cmd + Tab on the keyboard, I can cycle through the open applications, but if I Tab and release Cmd key on an app that is minimised, the minimised app won't open.\nIs this the normal behaviour?\n\nA: While holding ⌘ and tapping ⇥ to cycle apps, when you get to an app with a minimised window, instead of just releasing ⌘, before releasing ⌘ hold ⌥alt to restore minimised windows.\n\n\nthe minimised app won't open\n\nThis is a bit of a misnomer. The app itself is opened (the macOS term is ‘activated’), as shown by the menu bar changing to display the menus for the newly activated app. It is more accurate to say that the minimised window is not opened (restored).\nThe distinction is important because I use this feature constantly (it really is a feature!). If I minimise a window, that doesn't mean I no longer want to interact with the app in other ways. For example, a common workflow for me is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder and work in a Finder window.\n\n*Minimise the Finder window since I won't be needing it for a while, but want to keep my assortment of tabs etc.\n\n*Work on something else for a bit.\n\n*Now I want a Finder window for what I'm working on now. I don't want to restore the Finder window from being minimised, so I'll ⌘⇥ to Finder to activate the application and not restore the window, then ⌘N for a new window.\n\n\nIf you want to switch between apps as a whole, consider taking action on the app rather than a specific window: use the Hide functionality with ⌘H to hide all windows of an app. Then, when ⌘⇥ activates the app, the Show action is performed for you and the windows appear again.\nYou can always restore minimised windows by holding ⌥ when ⌘⇥. \n\nA: Use AltTab, it is the exact replica of windows functionality of Alt+ Tab. Takes care of both minimised/maximised window\n\nA: I am running system version: \"10.13.3\" and the behaviour is the same.  I can't say whether this has always been the case with OS X/macOS, or whether it's a recent development, but it's reasonable to assume there's nothing wrong with your Mac.\nThe following thread on Reddit corroborates this as standard behaviour, and also offers some alternative solutions from frustrated former-Windows users who recommend hiding apps, rather than minimising them:\nHow to Command + Tab to minimized or hidden apps?\nOne user recommends the following:\n\nTo improve your Hide functionality, do the following two things in the Terminal. First:\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock showhidden -bool YES\n\nThen:\nkillall Dock\n\nHidden applications' icons will now become translucent in the Dock. I love this feature and I think it should be the default. No idea why it's tucked away like it is.\n\n\nAnother recommends a piece of software called HyperSwitch as an alternative app-switcher, although having just looked at the website, it states that there is no solution for viewing minimised apps just yet.  A solid recommendation, then.\n", "Q: Missing ftp command line tool on macOS Use ftp to obtain source code.\nI am following a linux command line book to learning compiling.\n[me@linuxbox src]$ ftp ftp.gnu.org \nConnected to ftp.gnu.org. \n220 GNU FTP server ready.\n\nI tried and it reported an error\n$ ftp ftp://ftp.gnu.org/\n-bash: ftp: command not found\n\n$ ftp \n-bash: ftp: command not found\n\nHow to solve the problem?\n\nA: macOS does not come with an FTP command line tool. You can connect read-only (just for downloading things) to FTP servers using Finder. Open Finder and choose Go → Connect to Server (⌘K or ) and enter ftp://ftp.gnu.org/.\n\nWhen prompted for a username and password, choose Guest if the server does not require authentication, which is the case with ftp.gnu.org.\n\nIf you do need ftp on the command line, you can install ftp using Homebrew: \nbrew install inetutils\n\n\nA: You can open ftp://ftp.gnu.org/ in Firefox and Chrome without going to the Finder, which is what Safari does.\nIf you have a complete URL to download, use curl, as in\ncurl -L -R -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bc/bc-1.07.1.tar.gz\n\nDo man curl or curl --help for more information.\n\nA: Edit:\nI didn't see the last part of @grg's answer: brew install inetutils is even better.

Those words get underlined in blue. So basically, words underlined in blue are the words that dictation decided to change based on the context of the sentence. Usually, they’re good changes. Hope that answers your question.\n\nA: The blue dots usually indicate that Dictation is not completely sure of what you said (this is not the official explanation, but what I've found in my experience). This is similar to the blue dotted underlines you get when autocorrect corrects a word you type. It is possible to choose alternate phrases by going back to the underlined phrase using the cursor to change it. I currently do not know whether doing this \"trains\" dictation to understand your voice better.\n", "Q: Apple Developer Account Link Recently I enrolled in Apple developer program.

It’s literally the moment it senses an additional finger on the pad that it freezes. \nAs there were no physical or software changes between when it worked and when it didn’t, can I assume it’s something to do with the long sleep? Are there any further tips for potential solutions or has anyone experienced this specific problem?\n\nA: I've recently had this issue as well. I found the temporary solution to be related to the hidd process.

I've read elsewhere that the Login Window halts processes, and the Lock Screen method shouldn't, but I've personally seen the opposite or inconsistent behavior.\nWith a better understanding, perhaps a native solution can be found - if one exists, I'd like to know!\nI have zero interest in a screensaver, but if it can somehow lock the screen while allowing all background user processes to run, I'm listening.\nYes I have Sleep set to NEVER\nI'm familiar with headless windows services automatically starting and running with zero user interaction, not even a need for an initial login.  \nI wish to have similar behavior on my Mac mini serving as Plex and Airplay server. \nUnfortunately Plex and AirServer are user processes - so that means I have to log in initially... fine.\n\nA: I just tested this in my Macbook Air, you can use Shift-Control-Power to lock your screen and it kept the processes running.\nIf you want to enter lockscreen after this command, you have to setup this option:\nand your Energy Saver Settings should look like this:\n", "Q: ‘bin needs to download the font “Nanum Myeongjo”’ My Mac gave me a pop up that asked \"bin needs to download the font “Nanum Myeongjo” I clicked it away and ran Malwarebytes which found and quarantined \"Adware.Spigot\". Am I fine? Should I still be worried? I am using 10.12.6 on a 2015 Macbook Pro 15 inch.\n\nA: Nanum Myeongjo is a free Google font. When a program asks to download a font, it is because it is because it calls for it but it is missing from your font library. This is a normal behavior, but you can ignore it if you want.\nThe Adware.Spigot is most likely unrelated to the font and is not a virus, but it is Adware. Adware is not a virus, but it can be considered Malware, which is an unwanted program. I would recommend removing it.\n", "Q: Changing swipe direction on iBooks (MacBook) When I swipe from left-to-right on my Trackpad, iBook goes to the next page.

If not then you are looking at a logic board replacement.\nIf you have a time machine backup or a separate backup of your things\nelsewhere then you should be fine, if not then you'll want to get the hard drive (if that is the issue) taken out and then purchase a new one, so you can take your current hard drive to the nearest data recovery center nearby you. \n", "Q: Does anyone know why my bootcamp partition shows up as a folder in Startup Disk? So recently I updated my computer to MacOS High Sierra. When I tried to boot up my Windows disk (running Windows 10) using Startup Manager, it wasn't there.

Here's a screen grab from my system\n\n\nA: Your computer appears to have Windows installed to use the BIOS boot method. You can confirm this by following the steps given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Find application window.\n\n*Select your Windows boot drive.\n\n*Press the shift+⌘+. key combination. This will allow the Finder application to show hidden files and folders.\n\n*If the Boot folder appears, then open this folder. Otherwise, Windows is not using the BIOS boot method.\n\n*If the Boot folder contains a file named BCD, then Windows is probably using the BIOS boot method. Otherwise, Windows is not using the BIOS boot method.\n\n*Press the shift+⌘+. key combination to undo step 3.\n\n*Close the Finder application window.\nIf Windows 10 is using the BIOS boot method, then you should use the same accepted solution to the question: \"Bootcamp: no bootable device – insert boot disk and press any key\".\n", "Q: importing Apple Wiki - error 27 when running wikiadmin command I exported Apple Wiki data on an Apple server running 10.10 using the command 'wikiadmin'.

I have a 201 MacBook Air.\n\nA: An external USB keyboard will allow you to log on. Then you can change your password using the external keyboard, and you will be able to log on with the internal keyboard again. But you won't be able to type the character 0 ever again, unless you get the keyboard fixed.\n\nA: If you can't display the virtual keyboard, but still can change the keyboard layout at the login screen, choose Unicode Hex, or some keyboard layout entry with a similar name. Then you can enter each character by holding option key and entering the four digit hex code. For instance the number '0' would be entered with option + 0030.\n\nA: In the top-right corner you should be able to change the keyboard layout.

But many of the sellers in their descriptions point out that it is Wi-Fi only.

The loading bar doesn’t fill up and then,\n  after 10 minutes or so, it shuts down.\n\nThis is just one of the symptoms of a possible hard drive crash.  It could be that it boots but is horribly slow.  It could also boot and perform well, then suddenly crash (kernel panic).  It could make horrible noise, or it could be as quiet as the day you bought it (SSD's of course).\nIn this particular case, it attempts to repair the volume, fails, then shuts down.  This definitely points to a failed drive.\nWhat to do...\nStop using your device and remove your drive.  If you ever hope to have a chance at recovering your data you need to stop attempting to boot from it.  Most of all, don't try to \"stress\" it in the hopes of making things better.\nA Word on Backing up Your Data\nIronically, the last item mentioned is the most important:\n\n(I haven‘t saved my files on a external hard drive and I don‘t want to\n  lose it)\n\nWhether you are using an iMac, a MacBook Pro, a PC or even working on an IBM mainframe, the very first thing you need to consider is backing up your data.  Everything fails. Period. Whatever it is, at some point in time, it will fail. What we cannot predict with any certainty is when it will fail\nYour operating system can be easily reinstalled.  It may take a few weeks to tweak your settings just so, but that doctoral dissertation, picture of your family from last holiday, or file with the original recipe Coca-Cola will be gone - forever (generally speaking).\nBackup is a very inexpensive insurance policy.  You can recover your data, but at a very high cost.  Would you rather pay $100USD for an external USB drive or thousands to a data recovery service?\nIs it practical to backup your data now?  Probably and personally, I would avoid using the drive until I could get set up with a fully functioning machine before I begin my data recovery attempts.\nReplacing a Failed Drive\nThe specific iMac model wasn't referenced, but it really doesn't matter in the context of this answer. It could be a spinning hard drive or an SSD inside an iMac, Mac Pro, or MacBook.  The drive has failed and it must be replaced.\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac - must remove the glass to access the internal hard drive.  All Intel iMacs (at the time of this writing) have user serviceable drives - they can be replaced.  SSDs are normally proprietary, however.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pre-2012 iMacs used magnets to hold the glass and screws to hold the LCD.  The removal is fairly straight forward.\n\n*2012 and later iMacs have the glass and LCD fused together with the assembly fastened to the body with adhesive.  This must be cut to access the internals\n\n\n*MacBook Pros\n\n\n*\n\n*2012 and earlier MacBook Pro's used off-the-shelf standard 2.5\" HDDs.  Removal of the bottom cover allows access to drive and memory.\n\n*2013-2015 MBP's used a \"proprietary\" PCIe SSD that was also accessible after removing the rear cover\n\n*2015 and later MBP's have the SSD soldered to the PCB.  It is no longer a user serviceable part.\n\n\n\n\"Rebuild\" your Mac\nTo begin the process of rebuilding your Mac, you need to start with a clean slate and a fully functioning machine.  You can't rebuild you car's engine or transmission while you're still driving it and you can't rebuild your data while operating on a faulty system.\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy a USB drive for Backup\n\n*Install a new drive\n\n*Re-install macOS and your Applications.\n\n*Make a backup\nThe Recovery Process\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a USB to SATA enclosure/adapter to connect to your failed drive\n\n*Obtain recovery software and attempt the recovery process\n\n*After you have recovered all that you can, make another backup\n\n*Set up a backup strategy and schedule\nEach one of these items has been address separately on this site and at many times linked back to Apple's own site (i.e. Using Time Machine).\nOne very important thing to note is that iCloud is not backup; it's file synchronization.  Meaning if you delete it on one device, it's deleted everywhere.  \n", "Q: See messages search matches in OS X High Sierra I do a search in the messages application on High Sierra and it lists the conversations that have matches.

Safari Preferences Extensions tab says \"Extensions can be enabled in the Develop Menu\". However when I try to uncheck \"disable extensions\" in the Developer menu nothing happens and it stays checked.\n\nA: I \"fixed\" it by deleting the 'Safari Extensions List' Keychain item and then restarting. I believe this is related to some Keychain issues I've been having because the Reset Password screen appeared after I restarted (after 5 mins of a black screen). After I reset my password my Safari Extensions were back but my Keychain had been blown out. \n\nA: This worked for me on Safari 11--> bottom of developer menu there is \"allow unsigned extensions\" click that;  Now go back to the developer menu and click disable extensions...\n\nA: I fixed it by editing the plist for Safari to reset a variable that indicated extension were disabled after a reboot. \"ExtensionsEnabled\" was already set to YES -- and now that I fixed it I cannot find the key that was reset. Take a look in the plist for Safari.\n\nA: In my case I had to trash all of my keychains, log out and then log in again.\nOnce the keychains were re-created, I could access my extensions in Safari.\nI'd also note I was having difficulties logging into iCloud before trashing the keychains. This issue was also resolved at the same time.

Any way to modify the time before menu disappearing?\n\nA: There are two ways of navigating menus on macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modern: Click or right-click and release the button, then click on an option by once again depressing the button and releasing it again.\n\n*Classic: Click or right-click and keep holding the button, then move the mouse to the option, where releasing the button on an option selects the option.\n\n\nIt seems like macOS is receiving inputs following half of each of these: the click is held long enough that macOS thinks you're going to use the classic option, but you're actually trying to use modern.\nThere are a couple of possibilities for why this is occurring:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a bug with the Dock.

I know that some apps won't work with certain encodings, and that they will throw error if the encoding isn't ASCII. But its alarming that even TextEdit.app is unable to open this file.\nFirst I tried Numbers.app. I made sure this isn't a Launch Services error, because I opened the file within the app. It wouldn't load. The progress bar always gets stuck half way. When I open this CSV file with TextEdit.app, it wouldn't load either. Not even Google Sheets. The file is just 40 Megabytes and has only ASCII characters. Running file command in Terminal.app returns the following message:\nfile.csv: ASCII text, with very long lines. \nI am able to open the file using Visual Studio Code but not in TextEdit.app. How can I fix it? I cleaned the file for any \\r characters.\nUpdate: Running wc -l file.csv command returns 176831. My system is a 2016 MacBookPro with 16 GB RAM.\n\nA: It is quite common for GUI programs to be unable to handle large text files. Although 40MB doesn't sound like large regarding todays standards, but that might bloat up to a lot more in memory depending on how the application is written. And GUI applications often aren't the most efficient ones.\nYou might want to split up the text file in multiple smaller ones using the terminal. First, check if you can open the file using less filename.csv in the Terminal, and if the characters read fine. If not, the file might be corrupted, and that might be the issue.\nFor the acutal splitting, try using something like this on the terminal:\n#!/bin/bash\nN=10000 # Number of lines per file\ni=1\nj=0\nfilename=\"hugefile.csv\"\nextension=.csv\nwhile [ $i -le $(wc -l $filename|awk '{print $1}') ]\ndo \n    newfilename=\"$(basename $filename $extension)$j$extension\"\n    echo $newfilename: $i\n    sed -n $i,$((i+$N))p $filename > $newfilename\n    j=$((j+1)); i=$((i+$N))\ndone\n\nCopy and paste that into a plain text document (e.g. TextEdit in plain text mode or nano on the Terminal) and name it split.sh or something similiar. Customize the paramters N and filename as needed, e.g. enter the desired count of numbers per file in N=... and the filename of your sourcefile as filename=\"...\". This will generate the neccessary amount of files in your current directory to cover all the lines of the source files in smaller files of N lines each. The files will have a number appended, e.g. hugefile0.txt to hugefile9.txt or something like that.\nNow you should be able to open each of these files in your desired application. It's often desirable to work with smaller portions of one large file than with the whole file at once. You could even open the resulting CSV files in Numbers one after another and copy the lines from each file into one large Numbers document. That way the importer probably won't hang on such a large file.\nIn case you get any errors regarding sed or awk, that's because Mac sed and awk are different than the regular sed or awk. In that case, you might need to install regular sed and awk from something like macports or homebrew.\n", "Q: Computer shutting down (dirty) randomly Everyday when I come back to my system it will be shutoff no matter what I do, if I log out, it'll be shutdown, if I restart it will be shutdown. A grep through the log files shows me this:\n2018-03-29 16:06:29.964161-0500 0x4a8      Default     0x0                  0      kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2018-03-29 18:30:34.297536-0500 0x435      Default     0x0                  0      kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n2018-03-30 09:42:33.355573-0500 0x420      Default     0x0                  0      kernel: (AppleSMC) Previous shutdown cause: 3\n\nThe 3 means hard reboot (or so I've gathered) but I'm not rebooting my system. Is there a way for me to tell what is causing my reboots or if there is an application that is crashing that could be causing this?\nEDIT:\nI've figured out that the 3 is a dirty forced shutdown, so this leaves the question, how can I determine what is causing the issue?\n\nA: I actually believe I've found a fix for this.\nI started greping through all the log files from when this issue started happening looking for a pattern. As it turns out the pattern is that the GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon runs everytime right before the crash happens:\nMar 30 13:33:55 <COMP-NAME> GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon[19078]: 2018-03-30 13:33:55.245 GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon[19078/0x7fff77030000] [lvl=2] -[KeystoneDaemon main] GoogleSoftwareUpdateDaemon inactive, shutdown.\nMar 30 13:34:00 localhost kernel[0]: Previous shutdown cause: 3\n\nSo doing some research, this is a updater that is secretly installed by Google (it is nowhere in their terms of service, nor is there a warning for it) what this does is update your Google applications every 5 hours. In order to disable this you can do the following:\ndefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 0\n\nWhat that command will do is set the interval for checking to 0. This is probably not recommended since security updates are important, so you can also set the interval for once a week:\ndefaults write com.google.Keystone.Agent checkInterval 604800\n\nNow apparently this updater takes up very minuscule amounts of resources, but what they don't tell you is that it depends on how much Google software is on your system, it runs all the updates at one time. For example, if you have Google Chrome, Google Drive, and Google Hangouts installed, it will attempt to run updates for all of those pieces of software at once.\nSo what I did is the first option, set it to 0 and watched the computer for over an hour. Nothing happened, restarted and it boot right up, watched for another hour and it didn't crash or turn off. Going to assume this was the problem and move on with my life. \n\nA: A shutdown cause of \"3\" is a hard shutdown - when you press and hold the power button.\nMore than likely there's a contaminant causing a short that is forcing the button to engage (electrically speaking) thus making your Mac \"see\" an ACPI shutdown.\nTry cleaning it but you may have to have it replaced.\n", "Q: How to keep track of external hard drives?

Setting my soundbar to its lowest volume point leads to low volume, and a comfortable listening volume is about 1/3-1/2 of the max volume.\nBut when listening to music via Apple Music app on the Apple TV, setting the soundbar to its lowest volume point still outputs loud music. There is no way I can comfortably set it to something between mute and loud. Increasing the volume on the soundbar by 1 step up from mute leads to music that is louder than what I would expect at this low volume point.\nI am able to mitigate this by enabling Reduce Loud Sounds and Sound check, but the music is still a bit too loud to my taste, even on the lowest volume point on my soundbar. Plus, Reduce Loud Sounds has a negative effect on the music (highs are muffled, etc).\nSo what I've been doing to avoid this issue is to Airplay from my Mac to the Apple TV and setting the volume to 50% in iTunes on my Mac, but it kind of defeats the purpose.\nI am observing the same behaviour with my 4th generation Apple TV, plugged into a Yamaha receiver via HDMI. When watching movies, I set the receiver volume between -20db and -30db. But when listening to music, I have to set it between -50db and -60db. So, the same behaviour (music louder than movies), but since I have a finer-grained control over the volume with my receiver it is not really a problem.\nHow do I resolve the issue?\n\nA: Your issue raises from the way audio data works when transferred digitally. It's possibly a bug in either your Soundbar or your TV, which you might not be able to resolve.\nBoth the connections from your Apple TV to your TV and from your TV to your Soundbar are digital. That means, the audio is transferred entirely digital during playback. In analog transfers, setting the volume of the audio transferred is really easy, it is equivalent to with how much electrical energy the signal is put onto the cable. Much energy results in loud audio, etc.\nThis isn't so easy when using digital transfers. Digitally encoded audio has always the same volume, no matter if you set the volume high or low. This is due to the encoding of the audio in bits. The amplitude of the audio at any point of the timescale is represented by a value ranging from 0 to 1 (to keep it simple). The audio should be normalized, so that at it's loudest point the amplitude is 1.\nOf course, you could re-encode the audio stream before sending it out using the digital connection, and reduce the overall amplitude of the audio, so that the audio has an amplitude of e.g. 0.5 at it's loudest point. That's what the Apple TV does when transferring video, in order to allow you to change the volume of the audio using for example your streaming device. But that reduces the quality of the audio signal.\nTo keep quality optimal, the Apple TV does not touch the audio signal when transferring music. Therefore, music is always transferred at max amplitude 1 (and therefore probably louder than most movies). Of course you could add metadata to the audio stream to transfer the desired volume the audio should be played back with, but metadata is not always understood by all devices. In that case, it seems that either your TV or your soundbar are able to understand that volume control, or the feature you'd normally control the audio with by using your TV's or your soundbar's remote does not work for music.\nIn order to be able to set the volume on the soundbar, you might try an analog connection from the TV to the soundbar, or using a dedicated device like a digital-analog-converter that creates an analog signal out of the optical audio from your TV. That way, you'd keep the analog conversion away from the soundbar, and the volume control might work as expected.\n", "Q: FaceTime, iCloud and iMessage in China Can one use FaceTime on an iPhone 6 without being billed international rates?\nI have a iPhone 6 bought in U.S. and I am going to China to visit family for six weeks. The iPhone region is United states. Do I have to change my region on my iPhone while I am in China in order for my U.S. WeChat account to work? Or do I use the FaceTime or iMessage apps?\n\nA: FaceTime, iCloud and iMessage are location-independent. The location of the sender or recipient does not affect the price you pay to use the service: free.\nHowever, how you connect to the internet may cost. Using free Wi-Fi will be free, or you can pay roaming rates to your SIM card provider for cellular usage, or you can purchase a Chinese SIM card and pay a provider in China. This is payment for connecting to the internet, to use any service, not specifically for any Apple services.\nYou should not change your iPhone region.\n\nA: In general, there is no need for you to change your iPhone region when travelling overseas.\nAs @grgarside already mentioned, whether you will be charged will depend on the Internet connection type.

To view them at higher resolution, using the YouTube app is your only resort.\n", "Q: iPhone connects to WiFi but drops Internet connection I am able to connect to WiFi alright, but the Internet connection drops off after about 60 seconds.\nIn the routers console, the assigned IP address is shown which matches with one on the device.\nIn the current connections list in routers, the iPhone is listed.\nAfter 60 seconds of connection to the WiFi, when the Internet connectivity drops off, the IP address in the connections list in the router for the iPhone changes to 192.2.28.112 and the host name changes to Static IP. I am unsure why this is happening. The mac address for the listed item matches with that of my iPhone.\nAll the iPhone network settings are at default. I have tried restarting the device and resetting network settings on both the router and the iPhone.\nThe model is an iPhone 6. I have had this problem ever since the day I bought it. I have faced similar issue with one of my friends computer. All the other devices never face any issues with the WiFi.\nCurrent router settings matched with the one recommended by Apple. There are no special items such as MAC filters enabled in the router.\n\nA: This is abnormal behaviour, and therefore probably a bug in either your wireless router or iOS, more likely your router. It seems to assign your iPhone a static IP after some time for no visible reason (although you haven't used a setting to tell your router to do that).\nA list of what you should try, try one after another if it still does not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check for firmware updates for your wireless router. That rules out any known issue to the manufacturer, where fixes are already available.\n\n*Reset your wireless router to factory defaults, as that rules out any issues with configuration (intended or unintended).\n\n*Tell your iPhone to \"forget\" your wireless network, and connect to it again, supplying the password. That way, you're ruling out any issues with configuration files with your particular network.\n\n*Make an encrypted backup of your iPhone using iTunes if you want to be able to rollback any of the following changes.\n\n*Reset your iPhone's network settings (In Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings). You'll have to reconnect to all wireless networks again, as it also deletes passwords, but it makes sure that no issues exist in configuration files regarding general network configuration.\n\n*Do a factory restore on your iPhone. If it works now, try restoring the backup and check if the issue is still fixed.\n\n*If it still does not help, you might consider calling Apple support (although there is not much more they can do).\n\n", "Q: How should I migrate my iTunes library to a larger external disk while preserving metadata? I currently have a set up where my default iTunes Library (of ~550 HD movies) resides on a 2TB external HD. I share this library and use it to serve my Apple TV/other LAN devices. The drive is close to full, so I got a 4TB External HD to migrate the Library to. \nThe default library path is set to /Volumes/MEDIA_2TB through iTunes Preferences, though all the .xml and .itl data still resides in ~/Music/iTunes/. \nI'd like to migrate my current library contents to /Volumes/MEDIA_4TB while retaining the metadata (ratings, play count, watched/unwatched, date added, etc), as well as set Volumes/MEDIA_4TB as the new default library. \nIt seems that the file paths are tied to the metadata files though. If I change the default iTunes Library through iTunes and then \"Consolidate Library\" will this work? Is there another/better way?\n\nNote that I don't want to create symlinks as in this Q&A: Move external iTunes library files to different location without losing metadata\n\nA: So I successfully migrated the library without losing the metadata by:\n1) Changing the default library under iTunes > Preferences > Advanced > to /Volumes/MEDIA_4TB first \n2) Selecting all the contents of the library within iTunes. \n3) Going to File > Library > Consolidate Files\nAfter many hours of copying, I confirmed it worked by right clicking on a movie > Movie Info > File Tab > Location: /Volumes/MEDIA_4TB/Movies/[Name of Movie]. I can now safely delete the contents of the old 2TB drive and reformat it. \n\nA: One good way would be the classical linux-like approach: use rsync from the Terminal. Rsync is an application designed for file transfers preserving anything from timestamps over access rights to other metadata. And it's really straightforward to use, since Apple was smart enough to include it in OS X :)\nThe basic syntax is as follows:\nrsync -aP <source> <destination>\n\nThe -a stands for archive (which means, preserve time stamps, access rights and other metadata) and the P stands for progress (which means show progress during transfer). This will create an exact copy of source over to destination which copying by Finder would not.\nIf you never ran a command from a Terminal, don't fear, it's not hard! And in this case, there isn't really something you could do wrong.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, open the Terminal from Applications/Utilities, or use Spotlight.\n\n*Then type in the start of the command: rsync -aP. Make sure to include two spaces: one after rsync and one after -aP.\n\n*Then drag the source folder from Finder into the Terminal window (probably /Volumes/MEDIA_2TB/iTunes/ in your case). This will insert the path of that folder into the Terminal.\n\n*Now type a space after the path, so that the source is separated from the destination you'll drag in now.\n\n*Drag the destination folder (probably /Volumes/MEDIA_4TB/iTunes/ in your case) over to the Terminal window. If the iTunes folder does not exist on your drive yet, create it (e.g. using Finder).\n\n*Make sure that both the source and the destination path end with a /. Otherwise, the iTunes folder from the original hard drive would be integrated into the new iTunes folder on the new hard drive, resulting in two iTunes folders nested within each other (wouldn't be too bad, though, but unneccessary ;))\n\n*Hit enter to run the command. Now you should see all your files rush by on the Terminal and the new iTunes folder on the new hard drive should get populated.\n\n\nThat way, you'll create an exact copy of your iTunes data including all metadata. Are you sure that the current version of your .itl files are still in your Music folder? I haven't seen a case where these were located outside the library folder. Check the modification dates on these files to check if they are really the current version. If they are, you should use rsync again to copy them over to your hard drive. Just use ~/Music/iTunes/ as a source now, it will overwrite any files already existing in your destination if the new files you are moving are newer, and all other files will be kept in place.\n", "Q: Download link for older Safari Technology Preview version 51 As was answered in this question, Cannot paste images from clipboard to Facebook in Safari unlike Google Chrome, Safari Technology Preview 51 has the attribute to copy and paste Facebook and Tumblr images. Apple has recently upgraded Safari Technology Preview to release 52 and it has more Facebook related bugs than release 51. It has also lost that attribute.\nWhere can I download Safari Technology Preview version 51?\n\nA: There is no official way to download older releases of Safari Technology Preview.\n\nA: Use the Wayback Machine:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/*/https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/\nOnce you find the download page of the version you'd like to download, strip Wayback Machine's URL prefix, and download it directly from Apple's servers.\n", "Q: Hide invitations on work calendar, only show imminent events I have an Exchange work calendar syncing with my iPhone (iOS 11.3) and often I have many new work invitations appearing on my iPhone notifications and subsequently on my Apple Watch too.\nFor all of these invitations, I manage the replies (Accept/Decline) on my work computer. The only reason I have my iPhone syncing with my work calendar is to see which events are coming up in the next 15 minutes, and to see which room they're at.\nIs there any way to hide all work event invitations from my iPhone? I only want to see the events as part of my iOS calendar.\nI don't want any work events appearing in my notifications (except event reminders shortly before the event happens; those are fine). Lastly, I'd like to keep my personal event invitations, so turning off all calendar notifications doesn't seem to be a good solution.\n\nA: You can manage these notifications in Settings > Notifications > Calendar. This will allow you to configure your notification preferences individually for both invitations and upcoming events. There isn't a \"turn notifications off\" toggle for them individually, but you can manually disable all of the alerts (sounds, badges, banners etc.) for invitations alone.\n\nI misread the last part of your question. My mistake. I don't know if it is possible to adjust notification preferences for individual accounts. I ran into this issue a while back and never found a solution.\nSo, in summery this is a no, you can’t have some notifications and not the rest. \n", "Q: How do I create an installer for a macOS app? I want to create an installer for a Apache Mesos for Mac. I don't want to use brew since that needs several steps and an internet connection and packaging makes one definite version we can push and also isolate from version changes. \nFurthermore, Mesos has dependencies on java, git, autoconf, automake, libtool, subversion, and maven.  \nHow do I start with packaging all these dependencies?\n\nA: For a simple package where you just want to pack up one folder (or three) of files, you can use a quick and easy tool and often make good packages.\nFor something more on the complicated side, you may need a book or couple of tutorials as well as the ability to have a virtual OS so you can test your package on a clean macOS or test Mac.\nThe best book I know on how to package is this one by Armin Briegel \n\n\n*\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/packaging-for-apple-administrators/id1173928620?mt=11\nPackages on macOS can contain pre-install scripts, several layers of files and post-install scripts and the second chapter of the book goes over all of those in detail.\nIn your case, I would try to leverage a community packaging resource like AutoPKG recipe for every dependency you can find and hopefully mesos itself:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://autopkg.github.io/autopkg\nHere is a very nice list of starte recipes you can examine and inspect to learn how to layer in many files or take apart a simple package vs a complex one:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/autopkg/recipes\nIf all this git and scripting and tools is too much learning (for ever or just for now), you could also do far worse than get a great tool to help you just build the package manually using an app to guide you in the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html\n", "Q: I keep getting alerts stating startup disk is full when it's not I keep getting alerts saying that \"your start-up disk is almost full\".  \nI have an early 2015 13 inch MacBook Pro running macOS 10.11.6 with a 128MB SSD that has 63GB free according to About this Mac > Storage.

Is there a way for an AppleScript command to display the last time it was run? I have a few scripts where it would be useful to have a timestamp of the last time it was run for logging purposes. I am very green to scripting, any ideas are welcome.\n\nA: You can retrieve the time that any file was last accessed using the command-line tool stat with the following arguments:\n    stat -f \"%Sa\" -t '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' /path/to/file\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-f \"%Sa\": This requests only the file access data, as stat can provide other data as well, such as modification times, creation times, device information, ownership and permission data, etc.  See man stat if you want to know more about the other capabilities of stat.\n\n*-t \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\": This tells stat what format to output the date and time in.  You can change this to suit your needs, but for the purposes of this answer, I chose a standardised format that output this for one of my AppleScripts: 2018-03-31 16:55:42.\nBear in mind that the access time for an AppleScript file will be updated, not just if it is run, but also if it gets read or copied or moved.\nTo use this within an AppleScript, you can wrap it within a do shell script:\n    do shell script \"stat -f '%Sa' -t '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' \" & ¬\n        quoted form of POSIX path of theFileAlias\n\n\nA: Make sure if you change the value of set theFile to \"/tmp/script_run_log.txt\" -- value can be changed , then you must change the value of set theLogFile to \"Macintosh HD:private:tmp:script_run_log.txt\"  in the second script also\n-- PLACE THIS FOLLOWING CODE ANYWHERE IN A SCRIPT FILE\n-- FOR NEATNESS, CONSIDER PLACING AT SCRIPT BOTTOM\n-- THIS CODE WRITES TIME AND DATE OF LAST RUN OF THE SCRIPT OR APP\n-- TO A SEPARATE FILE\n\nwriteToFile()\non writeToFile()\n    set currentDate to (current date) as string\n    set theFile to \"/tmp/script_run_log.txt\" -- value can be changed\n    set myName to name of (info for (path to me))\n    set theText to myName & \" was last run on \" & currentDate\n    try\n        set writeToFile to open for access theFile with write permission\n        write theText & linefeed to writeToFile as text starting at eof\n        close access theFile\n    on error errMsg number errNum\n        close access theFile\n        set writeToFile to open for access theFile with write permission\n        write theText & linefeed to writeToFile starting at eof\n        close access theFile\n    end try\nend writeToFile\n\n\nSave the following code as an application,.

IMO Saving the value of a property within the script is the easiest from a coding aspect, however because the value is reset if the code is later modified or recompiled, this may present a drawback from using this method. It just depends on your real needs. That said, and to give you another option to choose from:\nExample AppleScript code:\nproperty lastRunTime : missing value\nset lastRunTime to (current date) as string\ndisplay notification lastRunTime subtitle \"This application was last run:\"\n\nI saved the three lines of code as an application named Last Run Time and upon running it, it showed the notification as:\n\nYou can also use the display dialog or display alert command if you don't want to use the display notification command.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways to accomplish a task.

Why do you think the OS estimates a battery percentage a little above the actual value? I noticed it is always between 0% and 5% more. In particular the two percentage gets closer when the remaining battery gets lower. Maybe this way the device seems to get faster to 100%, since the 95%-100% takes a lot of time...?\nSome details. I can find the percentage two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the battery menu bar icon or with pmset -g batt (eg. now they say 96%)\n\n*By calculating it manually from System Information.app or with information from ioreg -l -n AppleSmartBattery -r (eg. now I get: MaxCapacity: 4181, CurrentCapacity: 3813; meaning 91.2%)\n\n\nA: My guess is that with AppleSmartBattery, you are calculating the percentage based on the batteries brand new, fully charged state. Whereas the OS is basing the percentage on what the battery is currently capable of at full charge, which will slowly degrade over time. \n\nA: If you were to script this - keep in mind. One lithium cell charges very non-linearly. And a battery of individual cells will charge like a mess of non-linear units - none of them in phase.\nYour data from ioreg is far superior to the processed guess of percentage from pmset and I would only use the power manager tool to log and process changes - not to do the calculations you seek.\nFrom the registry - you can focus on these three items in my opinion:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"DesignCapacity\" = 5297\n\n*\"CurrentCapacity\" = 2331\n\n*\"MaxCapacity\" = 5059\n\n\nSo in my case, the theoretical design maximum milli amp hours is 5297 and I can expect from the readings to only store 5059 mAh of which I have a measured 2331 left to use before I'm flat.

It was observed in iOS 11.2.\n\nWhen browsing the Web on my iPhone X with Safari, when ever I go to one particular site I occasionally see what appears to be a Face ID validation scan being reported. For e.g., when I land on the website, I see the Face ID overlay superimposed with a spinning and rotating circle, and after a short time the Face ID happy face icon (the one which appears upon successful validation).

Last year I replaced the Mac's internal 500GB SSD with a OWC Aura 1TB SSD.  Everything has worked fine up to now, although the OS still recognizes the SSD as an \"external\" drive.  \nI am now trying to upgrade to High Sierra.  The installer won't run on this drive, complaining that that it's missing a firmware partition.\n\nI'm not sure if this is related to other posts (e.g.) I've seen about OWC SSD drives installed internally but appearing as external.  Or, if it has to do with attempting a three-version leap in the OS.  \nI have an external Time Machine drive with a recent backup, so I guess I could attempt reformatting the OWC drive, installing High Sierra, then restoring from Time Machine.  But that takes so long I'd like to avoid it if I can. Also, if the fault is in the drive itself I'm not sure it would work.  Anything else I should do?\nUpdate: I have spoken with OWC customer service, and they say I will need to reinstall the OEM SSD.  Then upgrade to High Sierra, which will update the Mac's firmware.  Then re-install the OWC drive, and upgrade that to High Sierra.  I hope I can find the old drive...\n\nA: I finally did get this to work.  Here is my process with the non-functioning loops edited out.  It's inspired by, but slightly different from, this process outlined by MacSales in How to Format a New Internal SSD in macOS High Sierra.\nFor this process, you need not just the original (OEM) Mac SSD, but also the enclosure that OWC sends with their upgrade kit.  The screwdrivers (P5 and T5) come in handy too.  And a spudger tool, sold separately.  Also, this process wipes both the original and the new (OWC) SSDs clean, so you need a recent backup, for instance Time Machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Macbook, and replace the OWC SSD with the OEM one.  \n\n*Boot into recovery mode (command-R at startup).  Use Disk Utility to erase and reformat the internal drive, and install a clean macOS on it.  It will be an old version; in my case Yosemite.\n\n*Reboot, and using an administrator account, install macOS High Sierra on the OEM SSD. You now have High Sierra, but on the wrong drive, and none of your data.\n\n*Open up the Macbook again and remove the SSD.  Install the OEM SSD in the external enclosure, and the OWC SSD in the MacBook.  \n\n*Plug in the external, reboot, and hold down Option at the chime.  You will have the option to boot from the internal (OWC) SSD into the old MacOS version, or the external (OEM) SSD into High Sierra.  You want the latter.  It will slow down a bit, but it will work.\n\n*Use Disk Utility to erase and reformat the internal (OWC) drive.\n\n*Go to the Mac App Store and redownload the \"Install MacOS High Sierra\" application.  It should be about 5.2GB large.  Run the installer, and use it to install High Sierra on the internal drive.  Remember, everything's running off the external drive with the OEM SSD.  You now have High Sierra on both drives.\n\n*Use the Migration Assistant to restore your files from the Time Machine (or whatever) backup back to the Mac.  Repeat with any other backed-up data not stored in Time Machine (e.g., Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, etc.)\n\nThe linked article says that you can replace steps 5–7 by booting into Internet Recovery Mode (option-command-R at startup).  I believe this is what OWC told me in tech support chat, too.  The idea is that upgrading the OEM SSD to High Sierra will update the firmware, so that internet recovery mode gives the option to install High Sierra.  That didn't work for me; I could only install Yosemite in Internet Recovery Mode.  If it did work, I would not have needed the enclosure, since I wouldn't need two SSDs running at once.  One of the commenters says it worked for them, so maybe I screwed up.\nAlso, you may wonder why you can't skip step 4, put the OWC SSD in the enclosure, boot from the internal OEM SSD, and install High Sierra on the external OWC SSD.  I tried this several times, and it would error out at various stages.  There is a sticker inside the enclosure that says \"Mac SSD only\".  I finally believed it.\n\nAt least this process eliminated an annoyance that I had when I originally installed the OWC SSD.  Even though it was installed internally, it showed up in the operator system with an orange \"external drive\" icon.  I think this is part of the reason the update process was so complicated—the Mac knew this drive was an impostor of sorts.  But now it's got the same icon as the original one.  \n--\nEdit 2018-04-13: OWC has published a firmware update (beta as of this writing) for their OWC Aura 6G SSD's which purports to deal with this very issue.

The computer turns on and functions but there is no lcd backlight. I can see there is video to the screen when shining a light through the back of the apple logo.\nThe lvds connector looks fine. The motherboard looks good. I've tried an SMC and a PRAM reset but those have failed.\nI've heard that backlight fuses go bad but I don't have the right soldering iron, or confidence, to replace the fuse.\nI see another board beneath the LCD clutchplate. Is that board an inverter? If so, maybe the inverter is the cause of the problem?\nI have a couple mid 2010 mbp lcd assemblies sitting around but it appears those have a different cable layout. Before I try to dismantle these LCDs to find any cross-over parts, does anyone know if the 2010 mbp LCDs are compatible with a late 2011 board?\nWhat do you suggest trying next? How can I isolate this problem?\n\nA: Thank you @allan for helping me move forward through the isolation process. Through deduction, I found the problem to be with the motherboard.\nThis is the entire process I used to isolate the issue...\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on and shine a light through the Apple logo or examine the LCD closely to see if it is receiving video. The other option is to connect the computer to an external display.\n\n*Perform SMC and PRAM resets.\n\n*Remove back cover and examine the LVDS connector (it's the gold connector located near the hinge facing the display assembly. Look for any broken pins or corrosion on the motherboard in case of liquid or prior repair damage.\n\n*Try using another, working, display assembly. Also, check the backlight fuses on the motherboard. If the working LCD still doesn't have backlight power, the problem is isolated to the motherboard. All the A1278 MacBook Pros use the same LVDS cable (and pinout) so it is safe to connect. The other cables are for the camera and wifi connectivity. Leave those disconnected. Also, unlike older laptops, the display inverter is integrated onto the motherboard so it is nearly impossible to repair it\n\n", "Q: Add spacing before and after paragraph in iOS Pages?

This happens on two machines I have; a MacBook Pro and a Mac Pro.\nHas anyone else seen this behavior and, more importantly, have a fix for it? Or is it just a bug in 10.13.4?\n\nA: I have the same problem for a while.

I just came from holidays and added photos from my camera to it and again, nothing. Photos is stuck at \"Uploading...\" but there is no network activity.\nSome facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a Mid-2014 Macbook Pro\n\n*battery health: 82%, cycles: 209, condition: normal\n\n*MacOS High-Sierra 10.13.4 (updates in the past didn't help)\n\n*I'm on a wired 1gb fiber connection (8ms ping, down: 880, up: 470)\n\n*Fully working iCloud photo library across my iOS devices with more than enough free space\n\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*deleting ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.cloudphotosd/Data/Library/Application Support/com.apple.cloudphotosd/ and killing cloudphotosd\n\n\n*\n\n*It does rebuild the index and re-syncs shared albums, those always work\n\n\n*Resetting the Macbook SMC & PRAM\n\n*Fresh install of MacOS, reimport photos from scratch\n\n\nThe actual problem:\nThe console logs the following which seems highly relevant:\n502:com.apple.cloudphotosd.pending-work:509E84:[\n    {name: ThermalPolicy, policyWeight: 1.000, response: {Decision: Must Not Proceed, Score: 0.00, Rationale: [{thermalLevel >= 1}]}}\n ], FinalDecision: Must Not Proceed}\n\nSince I have tried so many different software things this makes me think that the system thinks the battery is bust (or some other thermal thing, like CPU temp, which is actually normal ~140F).\nCan anyone think of anything else that I should try? Apart from replacing the battery / taking the laptop for service.\n\nA: The short answer is you want your Mac to get out of CPU use so that iCloud photos will resume. Thermally cooling the case and/or quitting all other processes that use CPU would be warranted.\nSince you're technical minded - you can dump the thermal stats to see if you feel you have a hardware issue or can shape the workload to relieve a proper thermal pressure warning:\n pmset -g thermlog\n\nThe long answer is there are many throttles and other things that could go wrong with iCloud upload. Look at this reverse engineering of things in the plain files portion of iCloud file upload - let alone the more detailed Photos use that does face, moment, web app and more features in play like daily upload caps, uploads to shared storage being different than your iCloud storage and optimizing the versions when you run low on storage space.\n\nDiagram from the amazing article by Howard Oakley - https://eclecticlight.co/2018/03/30/inside-icloud-drive-uploading-a-file/\n", "Q: Network share always mounting in Finder, but never for Time Machine (High Sierra 10.13.4) I have two Macs (MBP 2017 and an older Mac Mini with two internal SSDs) on my local network, both running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4, and I'm encountering strange problems.\nOne of the Mini's internal SSDs (HFS+) is partitioned.

If I try to reinstall Mac OSX on the main disk (Macintosh HD aka /dev/disk1s2), the installer complains that there isn't enough disk space available. \nSo I opened up a terminal and tried to manually delete unnecessary files. \nUsing rm -rf, it looks like everything works, except that the disk space isn't freed. On reboot, the files are there again as if nothing happened. \n\n\n*\n\n*Folders I 'delete' with rm -rf seem to vanish from the directory listinng (ls)\n\n*df -h never updates the amount of free space after rm\n\n*Rebooting into recovery console shows the deleted files are there again\n\n\nAnd when I look at the disk in Disk Utility in the recovery console, it tells me that there are 4 GB of free space, but 0 KB deletable. \nHow can I delete the missing files without reformatting the whole HD and losing all data?\nAnd why doesn't rm -rf work? \nUsing rm without -f (e.g. # rm -r /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Developer) first asks me to confirm each file deletion, then errors with \n\nno such file or directory.\n\nWhich I would assume is a permissions issue. But I'm root (#) in the terminal and the files are owned by root/wheel. As suggested, I tried to remount with write permissions (mount -uw). This did not give me an error message, but the behavior is still the same (files reappear on reboot).\n\nA: Using -f hides errors. Try running the command without the f option: rm -r ….\nWithout the actual error message, I can guess what the problem is: you're trying to delete files by providing a path you expect to the files but do not match the actual path.\nWhen you're booted into Recovery, the Recovery environment is mounted at /, so paths like /Users are actually pointing to the Recovery HD. For example, instead of\nrm -rf /Users/…\nyou should prepend to your paths the correct path to the volume\nrm -rf /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/…\n\nwhere Macintosh HD is your startup disk volume. Try ls /Volumes to see what's available.\n\nA: When you boot in single user mode, the disk is mounted read-only. As others have pointed out, running rm with -f can hide errors. \nPrior to running rm, try setting the mount point to read write using\nmount -uw /\n\n\nA: Normally two questions is hard to answer, but in this case - it's easy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't rm -rf when you want to reinstall - many of the images you mount in recovery are read-only and almost everyone is going to be confused between deleting parts of the system that runs recovery versus deleting files from the normal running system.\n\n*All installs are now archive and install - so if you have a failed install - you can either try the archive install again or you need to erase the volume entirely (with disk utility and not with a file removal tool like rm) throwing away the container and then run a clean install.\n\n\nSo to take that general advice and try and fit your specific instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you have your data backed up? If not - please boot to recovery HD and connect a drive and make a backup. That frees you from mistakes, misunderstandings and you'll need that backup drive next week once you have a working computer. You can't get your time back and you can't get your files back without a backup.\n\n*The one true way to erase and install is here: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25649?locale=en_US\nIf you want to fix the archive install - hit me up in the comments or chat room or a follow on question.

Plug it in and install macOS on that. Set up any old user, and from there, you can easily see and access and delete any files you want on the internal drive. Then go back into recovery and reinstall the OS on the boot drive. \nTHEN once that works, erase the external drive and use it as a Time Machine backup.

I usually work with multiple Safari windows open. Each has multiple tabs. Each window is a particular theme.

When switching tabs, the changed name will be taken when you return to the tab.\nIn my example I only required one tab, so my approach is this:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    -- get the window I want to change the name of\n    set playerwin to first window whose name starts with \"RVR\"\n\n    -- Prepend \"Web Player - \" to the document title\n    do JavaScript \"\n        document.title = 'Web Player - \" & (name of playerwin) & \"';\n    \" in document 1\n\n    -- open & close an empty tab\n    tell playerwin\n        set current tab to (make new tab)\n        close current tab\n    end tell\n\n    -- get the properties. Name should be changed now\n    return properties of playerwin\nend tell\n\n\nA: Tab Groups (https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/group-tabs-ibrwa2d73908/mac) will do this, at least on newer versions of Safari.\nCreate a group for each window and give it a name according their theme it'll show up in the title displayed in the Window menu: \"Theme — Tab Title\"\n", "Q: Require admin password when changing Mac Wi-Fi How can I go about requiring an admin password when changing Wi-Fi networks on Mac?

The power source shows as \"Power source: power adapter\".\nI checked system info and I have 1100+ cycles, which I guess is a lot. So my guess is that the battery is dead, and so it stopped charging. \nRight now, the battery percentage shows 6% and seems to be staying that way. It is not increasing at all.\nWhat worries me is every time I reboot, the battery seems to drain a bit, meaning that after sufficient reboots the battery will eventually reach 0% (as my MacBook isn't charging), and at that point I won't be able to boot up again at all.\nShould I set all my energy settings to \"never sleep\", \"never turn off\", etc. to prevent any rebooting, so that the battery does not drain any further?\nWhat can I do short of buying a new computer? I don't think there is Apple service where I am for the next few weeks. I would buy a new charger, but it appears that the charger is not the problem (or at least there is a good chance it isn't).\nCoconut Battery status:\n8440 mAh, Full charge capacity 6973 mAh (guess that means my battery is 82% healthy?), Cycle count: 1177, macOS battery status: good.\n\nA: Well - there are a lot of questions in the first version of the post, so here’s some general advice.\n\n\n*\n\n*For non-removable batteries - don’t remove them unless you have no other option and feel they are a fire risk or they are bulging and of-gassing and you worry that physical damage will happen or you can’t get service to prevent a fire risk due to overcharging past the service life.\n\n*All Apple products will run much slower when the battery is failed or disconnected.\n\n\nFor the slower - this can be a very noticible - like 2/3 as fast as normal or worse slowdown for some benchmarks. Think of a water service where the water coming in to the building depends on how much is in the tank supplying the house, how much pressure is present to push the water and how large the pipe supplying the house is.\nApple designs the battery to serve as a local tank to cover quick surges that can’t fit in the pipe. You run slower when you don’t have that “accumulator” or “capacitor” to store bursts of energy.\nAs to the safety, when a battery is done it needs to be removed from service since if you continue to charge them - the chemistry can’t take the energy and the cells are designed to safely off gas that energy in a permanent chemical change and there are bags to contain that gas / growth. The pressure of that expansion will eventually remove the battery from the device and cause anyone to see that the Mac is deformed. So it’s never safe to keep a battery in forever - especially when it says “service battery” or the charging chip literally disconnects itself from the charging software and says - no more charging.\nYou probably are at low risk for a couple weeks and will want to get a backup of your files in case you need to call for service and arrange to ship the Mac to a place where it can be repaired. Battery exchanges are low cost compared to the price of a new or used Mac in most cases, so unless you need a new computer - fix the battery. If you do sell it - just get a quote on the battery and know the value of your computer is less that amount unless the person is buying it for scrap or spare parts.\n\nA: I just had this problem - solved simply by resetting the SMC. This takes around 30 seconds - definitely recommend that you try this first.\n\nA: I found the answer to my charging problem in another question:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/301722/41731\nPlease make sure to upvote the answer I linked.\nShort version: yank the cord forcefully and horizontally out of the notebook. Repeat it a couple of times, until the orange light starts and it starts charging. Visit the link for more information.\nFor reference, this is what my pins look like after the yanking (sorry, don't have a before foto):\n\nThe second pin from the right maybe looks kind of intended still, it could be the ground pin, but I don't actually know.\n", "Q: Make Link shortcut Is there a document shortcut for Make Link or where I can bind it?\n\n\nA: With the URL highlighted, you can press ⌘K to open the Add/Edit Link sheet, followed by ↩︎enter/return to OK the sheet.\n", "Q: System won't boot after attempting 10.13.4 update I have a MacBook Pro Late 2014 model. I decided to do the update to 10.13.4, the incremental update to 10.13.3. It gets everything downloaded and does the reboot. I get to a gray screen and it sits for a long time and finally states \"installer resources not found\" and asks me to reboot and try again. Even when I try again, this process repeats.\nThis is what I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting the SMC and NVRAM\n\n*Boot into recovery (1)\n\n*Single user mode (2)\n\n*Boot menu and choose \"Macintosh HD\" to boot back into my system (3)\n\n*Boot a Linux Live USB Image (4)\n\n\nRecovery\nWhen I got to recovery, the first thing I decided to try was to look at disk utility. My drive does NOT appear. I then decided to go and try to \"reinstall\" macOS. It shows my 500gb drive, but the icon isn't a drive, it just looks like the generic paper icon and states that I don't have enough free space to install.\nI opened a terminal and tried to view the file system. It hangs. Screen\nSingle User Mode\nI noticed in the kernel messages that disk2 'media is not present' - /Volumes is empty.\nBoot Menu\nWhen I go to the boot menu, I can see the macOS installer option (which takes me back to the original problem of no installer resources) and then Macintosh HD. When I choose the latter, I get to my login screen (yay!) except when I login, if I can, the system eventually hard locks with the spinning pinwheel and I can't do anything else at this point. \nLive Linux Image\nI tried a live linux image just to see if I would get similar errors in dmesg, but I don't. I can mount the EFI partition fine. Of course, since Linux doesn't have APFS support, I can't mount that. So nothing I can do there. It was just a simple test.\nI took my Mac to an Apple store to have them to their diagnostics. They saw the same things - essentially their tests showed the hard drive being in a good state and everything being OK. But clearly it isn't. I'm assuming the drive is dead.\nIs there anything else I can do to further confirm if the drive is dead or not? I do have my data backed up. I would like to see if there is anything else possible, assuming that I may end up having to buy something from OWC anyway.\nEdit: The drive has bad blocks. macOS images refuse to install to the drive, no matter how the partitions are formated (HFS/APFS). \n\nA: My 17\" MacBook Pro, late 20011, had the same issue with the 10.13.4 update.\nI finally tried safe mode, (hold down Shift key until login). This took a few minutes.\nThat allowed me to log in. The system then went back to the boot up screen, and then took more than 10 minutes to actually finish installing.\nThat worked for me, as it's now back to normal.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with the 10.13.4 update. It failed to install and booted into Recovery Mode where the Console showed a file not found error in the logs and a menu to shutdown or restart. If restarted the system would again try to install the update and then fail the same way, resulting in a loop. Here is how I managed to fix it.\nFirst I booted into Safe Mode (hold shift while booting) and started the update again from the Mac App Store. But this didn't succeed and the same problem appeared. I then booted again into Safe Mode, but this time deleted the folders which contained the update files which caused macOS to attempt to install the update every startup. These are the two folders I deleted\n/macOS Install Data\n/Library/Updates\n\nThis requires admin privileges. The easiest way is via the Terminal command sudo rm -rf /path/to/folder (Warning: Be sure that the path is right, otherwise you might delete your files. In any case make a backup of your drive first!). And even then it will tell you it can't delete all files in those folders because some are system protected but this is enough to solve the problem.\nAfter deleting these folders I was able to boot up normally again although the system showed it was still on 10.13.3. I restarted the update in MAS again which then installed properly.\n\nA: I have several times updated macos 10.13.3 to 13.3.4 but always failed on installation.\nAt the end I downloaded whole high sierra 10.13.4 and installed. Done, all OK.\n\nA: Yes - you should go through the erase / install procedure to repartition the drive. That seems like something the Apple store would have reviewed, but maybe it took more than the 15 to 20 minutes allotted to try some quick fixes.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25649\nBasically, don’t try terminal or mount - just wipe the drive and start over with a clean partition map. Your “tried so far list is good” since one SMC/NVRAM reset is plenty and unlikely to help in this case, but you ruled that out.\nAll the other items are not very good other than booting to a recovery HD or a createInstallMedia installable USB or internet recovery. From there, you should be able to erase / repartition / set up a clean drive.\n\nA: Try doing internet recovery mode (Similar to recovery mode - CMD+R+Option) and see if it can detect your hard drive this time.\nIf not then you may want to take it in to an ARS so they can detect why its not able to be detected by disk utility. \n\nA: Had the same issue, kept ending up in the macOS Installer utility. Re-installing from App Store in Safe mode gave the same issue.\nSelected startup disk from the macOS Installer menu and booted into 10.13.3. Using the browser downloaded the full update.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Make custom keyboard layout switch by Caps Lock I created custom Cyrillic keyboard layout using Ukelele. It works fine except one problem - I can't switch to it using Caps Lock from english layout. I even don't have option \"Use Caps Lock to switch to and from US\" in keyboard preferences. Ctrl+space switches layouts ok. Default rus layout can be switched by Caps Lock.\nHow could I make my custom keyboard layout to switch by Caps Lock?\nEDIT\nI didn't find a way to make it work. Also there is not promising topic in ukelele group: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/ukelele-users/rRPaOXQj8Hs/discussion.\nInstead I installed Karabiner-Elements, make Caps Lock map to F19 and set F19 as layout switch in keyboard shortcuts. Works fine with my custom Ukelele layout and system English layout.\n\nA: Switching the keyboard layout using CapsLock is a feature added to MacOS 10.12 in 2016.  It does not seem to be very well documented by Apple–which should not come as a surprise to anyone who's been using their products for very long.  I haven't managed to find any 'developer-level' documentation of this function at all.\nSo, basically, to answer your question: In order to switch from one language/layout to another using CapsLock you must create a custom keyboard layout which combines both layouts.  I believe that Ukelele would be the easiest way to accomplish this.\nHowever, be aware that this is work-around that comes close to duplicating the original feature although there are some minor discrepancies which for me personally are actually preferable to the way the original feature was designed to work–although your preferences & priorities may obviously vary.  While your work-around using Karabiner more closely emulates the original feature which makes my option somewhat redundant and potentially inferior.  But it has some advantages in my opinion so I've decided to post it.\nIn any case, in order to use my work-around you must create a single custom keyboard layout based on the US keyboard that also has the appropriate foreign language/writing system layout programmed directly into the CapsLock-based modifier combinations (keyboard layers or shift levels–such as Caps+Shift, Caps+Option & etc.). Mac OSX essentially treats CapsLock as a regular, but locking, modifier key without any limitations. So, with Ukelele you may create a layout which supports multiple scripts and uses CapsLock to switch between them.\nThe Latin-based modifier combinations can mostly (if not entirely) be created automatically in several ways (the easiest being to duplicate the US keyboard you use, or create a layout that mirrors the currently active layout).\nFor the secondary script layers you can open a keyboard for that language you wish to emulate (or approximate) and drag the key mappings from that keyboard to you yours (with the proper CapsLock-based modifier combination activated).\nI don't think that a little bit of manual labor can be avoided, but you can accomplish your objective natively in this way. There are some potential advantages & disadvantages to this option depending on your preferences. For example, the flag will not change from US to another flag which may be seen as a disadvantage although that is irrelevant to me personally. However, you will have the CapsLock LED as an indicator which is visible on the keyboard itself which may be seen as an advantage. This also circumvents having to change the keyboard layout which is sometimes necessary when switching apps or documents, as well as the slight delay involved with that–that is of particular value to me as it drives me crazy when the keyboard layout is potentially different in each app.\nSince you've already got a solution working this probably won't be of particular use, however, perhaps another user may find this solution helpful or informative.\n", "Q: When renaming files, how do I use keyboard to rename the next file?

I noticed a mysterious hidden folder on my desktop containing one hidden file. The folder's name starts with .E05268AB3AE5F72AF... and the file name starts with DF2CEE62032EFA2196B0B673...\nThe folder was created on July 19th 2014 and its file on October 22nd 2014\nMy mac is a \"MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\" and I got it sometime in October 2014. So, my guess is that the folder is put on the computer when it's manufactured and the file created on the first boot.\nBut that's just a wild guess and doesn't explain their utility.\nDo you have those on your desktop?\nDo you know why they're there?\nOpening the file with text edit I get this:\n/MG›ÿ“.¥%Pü;Pó¸û-øa]J´âË…≠RÑ€ïÆÀ\\ˇ_ÔÅJ•W›Ã†õ‘m\nõ'Õ∂Ø≠{a3oP)%<U\n6?ó≥$há ÄdY\n¯8º◊\n9ü”‘–pJÈt∞“≤L »óPØ}˝)YÄeÅôà(zk‹&>O◊>∂:\n\nand then a little bit more of that, probably binary not meant for humans.\n\nAs requested, the output of ls -al is the following \n\nFeldev-MBP:.E05268AB3AE5F72AF1E451 feldev$ ls -al\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwxrwx@  3 feldev  staff   96 19 Jul  2014 .\ndrwx------+ 19 feldev  staff  608  3 Sep 21:07 ..\n-rw-rw-rw-@  1 feldev  staff  242 22 Oct  2014 DF2CEE62032EFA2196B0B67336814E\n\nand the output of file .E05268AB3AE5F72AF.../DF2CEE62032EFA2196B0B673... is data\n\nA: They are for deleting. They don’t ship with the os and aren’t worth worrying about since they are machine generated and you’d need to use the command line or a hex editor to examine the binary file for clues. \nIf you’re super worried, set up Time Machine to back them up, then delete them. \nYour home folder wasn’t created until after you received your Mac and chose your short name, so it came from a program or transfer you made soon after this mac was customized for you. \n\nA: \nDo you have those on your desktop?\n\nNo and nor have I ever seen that exact file.  I have, however, seen similar files with seemingly gibberish text.\n\nDo you know why they're there?\n\nIt is impossible to tell why they are exactly there but my best guess would be the following: They are old temporary autosave file created by some unknown program.  Many programs will create hidden autosave files when you unfocus the program or at certain intervals incase of a crash or force quit.  This is extremely helpful for many different reasons.  Many times this file is compressed to save space or written in some other format (this is why its ineligible).\n\nThe folder was created on July 19th 2014 and its file on October 22nd 2014\n\nMy guess is that the file was copied over from some kind of transfer form an older computer. Maybe from Time Machine or another backup software, although, again, it is impossible to know for sure.\n\nYou probably already know this but I will reiterate, files starting with a '.' are hidden.  They can be unhidden with the following command(s):\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\n*killall Finder\nOr the simpler method of \n⌘ + Shift + . \nwhile in a Finder window\n\nAfter re-reading I realized I never said what you should do with them! As the other answers have said, you can back them up and delete them. You should not see any problems.\n\nA: I don't have those on any of my mac OS... (Tiger, Snow Leopard, Sierra, High Sierra).\nIdea 1 \nIf the file/folder(s) are older than your mac ownership, they could have been generated after the first installation of mac OS on the machine. I don't know anything about Apple's factory installation process, but I'm pretty sure that they randomly check some laptops with diagnostic tools (I can't imagine they are checking all of them). Those files could be an output of those tools.\nIdea 2 (linked with idea 1)\nBy looking at the file and folder's partial names, they look like generated by a hash algorithm (why? they are only containing HEX characters (0-9, A-F).\nThese files are generated by a lot of programs for either: saving a state before quitting, backuping their configuration. Most of the time, they are temporary and they are many reasons why they can finally stay on your computer: \n\n\n*\n\n*The app crashed whilst creating the file, it's then a malformed file according to the app, it can't recognize it anymore... \n\n*The app was removed from the laptop. \n\n*...\n\n\nBackup the file, delete it. I'm pretty sure it won't harm your computer. If it does, restore it...\nJust for being curious: can you give the output of ls -al in this folder.

Is it possible to install a Safari extension on an iPhone, if so, how?\n\nA: On iOS 12 you can run JavaScript on website through siri shortcuts share extension.\n\nA: Safari on iOS does not support general extensions added to the web browser. Apps on iOS can provide app extensions such as action extensions and share extensions which are supported on iOS, or content blockers, but these frameworks are limited in what access the extension has.\n", "Q: Power button not working on Macbook PRO 13\" 2013 - ideas on how to reset SMC We have a 2013 13\" MacBook Pro that is behaving strangely on the keyboard. As far as we are aware there has been no water damage to this MacBook.\nSymptom:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power Button on keyboard shutdowns but won't allow a restart.\n\n*Left Shift key works, but won't switch to uppercase.\n\n*Closing the lid and reopening 5 mins. later, the keyboard will not respond. A restart from the menu will reboot and keyboard comes back to life.\n\n\nThoughts are to reset the SMC, but with the power button not working this is proving very difficult to do.\nAny ideas on away around this issue?\n\nA: If you disconnect the battery, it will reset the SMC.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the back cover\n\n*Using a plastic spudger, disconnect the cable from the battery to the logic board\n\n*After 30 seconds, replace the connector to the logic board\n\n*Replace the back cover.\n\n\nIn another related post, I detail how the SMC is reset.\nReplace the Keyboard\nThe symptoms you are describing point to an electrical short in the keyboard.  See this related post for more details.\nBottom Line\nIf you are hoping that the SMC reset will fix these problems, it will be a fruitless endeavor.  The SMC regulates power distribution and cooling,  not functionality (resetting the NVRAM wouldn't help either).  The only way to repair this is to replace the faulty components.\n", "Q: My MBP will only charge with a T shaped magsafe now I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) which came with a L shaped magsafe charger. I have been having problems for sometime now, wouldn't charge properly, cut off randomly, charger would cut out/not good connection. I replaced the battery, bought new chargers, reset the SMC and NVRAM many times. Eventually I gave up on it and let it sit for many months and used a work laptop.\nA couple days ago I decided to see if it would start and of course the L shaped charger I bought from Apple wouldn't work, I then plugged in my wife's cheap Amazon T shaped replacement charger and it connected great and started charging perfectly. I have tested many perfectly good L shaped chargers since and they will not work well, keep cutting out. \nAny ideas? Is my port wearing out and that T shape just happens to fit better?\n\nA: Technically speaking, you should be using the L-shaped adapter.\nAs to why it's working with the \"incorrect\" adapter and not the correct one is because the pins on the MagSafe connector are probably pushed \"in\" or just contaminated.  Additionally, the pins on the T connector stick out just a bit further than the L connector.\n \nYou may have some luck cleaning out the MagSafe connector, but in my experience, you have to replace it.\nYou have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*use the adapter that's currently working\n\n*attempt to clean the MagSafe connector\n\n*replace the DC in board\nReplacing the DC-in board is not \"difficult\" inasmuch as being tedious and detailed.   It involves removing the logic board because the connector is under it; iFixit has excellent step-by-step guide.\nIf this is not your cup of tea, I would simply continue using the adapter that works.\n", "Q: iOS 11.3 & iTunes 12.7.3 - any way out? I've been resisting moving to iTunes 12.7 as Apple have removed functionality & are insisting on far greater reliance on OTA than I am happy with.\niTunes 12.6.3 was touted as the 'opt out' version which kept Apps locally yet was capable of handling iOS 11.\nAs of iOS 11.3 this appears to no longer be the case & it is insisting on updating to iTunes 12.7.3 [even though I'm aware 12.7.4 is out] in order to update the iOS.\nIs there any way round this; or does 12.7.3/4 restore any of the old functionality?\nI remember the trouble I had originally reverting to 12.6 after falling for the 12.7 'upgrade' last year & don't want to have to repeat that if I can avoid it.\n< rant> I really am becoming quite disenchanted with Apple & their insistence on dumbing down each successive version of both Apps & OS < /rant>\nI suppose I'd also be happy with \"Use 12.7.4, it really is better because...\"\n\nA: I may have found a workaround, rather than a solution...\nI kept iTunes 12.6.3 & did the iOS 11.3 update OTA.\niTunes can still sync/backup & still keeps the older apps features operable.\nI imagine this workaround will fail the first time I need to set up a new iDevice or restore from a backup.\n", "Q: Deleting iPhone's Apple Support General Log File I have an old iPhone 3GS I'm trying to use back again.\nI loaded it up on iTunes and noticed I have 3.8Gb worth of \"Other\" data stored in it. Keep in mind this is the 8Gb model.\nI've tried all conventional methods for clearing up \"Other\" data, to no avail.\nOn a more thorough search through the phone's folders I found a very large .log file stored in this directory:\nvar/mobile/library/logs/Apple Support/general.log\n\nThis log file is 2.7Gb!

It allows immediate access to the search function on various websites through Safari’s address bar, merely by typing a keyletter or two; the user can specify both the sites searched and the keyletters. This dispenses with the intermediate step of navigating to the website to be searched, or even typing out the whole website URL in the search bar: the search occurs immediately upon the user’s entry of the site-choosing keyletter, the search term, and the return key.\nI’d like to duplicate my Omnikey list of websites and keyletters on another computer. The net returns no info, and I’m not a programmer so the Git Hub link doesn’t help. Searching on the mac for the URLs in the Omnikey shortcut had no results.\nCan any of you tell me where the data is retained, and how I might accomplish this?\n\nA: The Omnikey developer finally responded. Omnikey data is kept within the folder located at ~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage.\n", "Q: Installation of macOS High Sierra Update 10.13.4 failed; how do I recover without losing data? This morning I updated macOS High Sierra from 10.13.3 to 10.13.4. It appeared to install fine (I got to the login window), so I clicked on \"Shutdown\", and when I got to the office, and turned on my Mac, it rebooted into recovery, with the Installer Log open, and a dialog that read, \"The macOS Installation couldn't be completed\".\nI called Apple and they had me run a check disk, and the boot-up volume didn't have any error. My internal SSD showed up just fine, unlike what happened to this poor chap. Apple also had me try to restart in Safe Mode, but the Apple icon got stuck at 100% progress (3+ minutes waiting).\nSo, since my drive appears to be intact (I used Terminal to browse my data), is it possible to undo the update or reinstall macOS High Sierra and have the system work as it was before the update (apps and data still accessible)?\nNote, I use Time Machine backups, and I have a 2TB drive with about 40% free space. There are lots of \"snapshots\" on the volume. Is there a way to recover the system to the Time Machine snapshot taken before each update? Or, will I need to reinstall macOS High Sierra?\nSince posting this, Apple called me back and they said that I should be able to reinstall macOS Sierra without formatting the drive and I should be back to the state I was before the failure. I haven't tried this yet as I wanted to see if others have followed this or another procedure to recover from this failure without blowing up the hard drive and starting from scratch.\n\nA: I had the same problem (15-inch, Late 2016 MacBook Pro). I was able to fix my issue without losing data by running First Aid (from Disk Utility) when the laptop was in the crashed state. Once First Aid completed the pass on the drive, I simply rebooted and the OS loaded successfully.\n\nA: Fortunately I was able to simply reinstall macOS High Sierra by booting into Recovery Mode (Command ⌘ + R) and choosing Reinstall macOS High Sierra.\nI did not erase my drive first since system volume was intact (no errors after running Disk Utility). I simply reinstalled the OS and I was able to log back in with all my data, settings, and apps still there just like before. \nAlso, this installed the 10.3.4 version of macOS High Sierra, so I don't have to go through the update process again.\n\nA: I had the same problem with the update to 10.13.4.  I was able to boot to Safe Mode (hold Shift during power up) and then restart normally into 10.13.3.\nFor now I'm happy with 10.13.3 and I hope that the update will be patched in the near future.\nI hope this might help.\n\nA: In the past I have used a procedure for upgrading macOS versions that I had good successes with, especially when discussion groups and news are seeing problematic installs: using a system cleaner.\nEG using something like Onyx before installing, then a reboot and proceed with the install. Yah, too late now for you but something to consider for the next time.\nIf the restarting in Safe mode doesn't do the trick (it may...) If I were you I would use Recovery Mode and restore from a Time Machine backup. If I remember correctly you have the ability to restore from a specific point in time.\n\nA: I had the same problem (15-inch, Late 2016 MacBook Pro). What I did first was to enter the safe mode (Shift when starting the apple) try to download the update but I had the same problem again, then try to enter Recovery Mode (Command ⌘ + R) and set my startup to be my disk \"Macistosh HD \" by default, I restarted and the error message not appeared.\n\nA: At the installation log, I clicked on startup disk and chose Macintosh HD and restarted. The system successfully booted into 10.13.3. Now I'm trying to update the OS from the App Store again.\n\nA: One thing that worked for me was holding down the Option key and selecting the original partition to boot into. Then downloading the update directly from Apple and installing it.\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 Combo Update can be downloaded here.\n\nA: Same problem; installation of 10.13.4 failed with 'could not be completed'. I booted into recovery mode, ran disk utility repair and tried again after restoring from backup. Still no joy, and disk utility is now reporting lots of 'invalid internal_flags'. Finally I restored again and I'm sticking with 10.13.3.\nChecking the fsroot tree.\nwarning: inode_val: object (oid 0x5edb): invalid internal_flags (0x48000)\nwarning: inode_val: object (oid 0x5edb): invalid pad2 (0x2a)\n.\n.\n.\n.\nwarning: inode_val: object (oid 0x5ee1): invalid internal_flags (0x48000)\nwarning: inode_val: object (oid 0x5ee1): invalid pad2 (0x2a)\nChecking the snapshot metadata tree.\nChecking the extent ref tree.\nChecking the snapshots.\nChecking snapshot 1 of 3.\nChecking snapshot 2 of 3.\nChecking snapshot 3 of 3.\nVerifying allocated space.\nThe volume /dev/rdisk1s1 appears to be OK.\nFile system check exit code is 0.\nRestoring the original state found as mounted.\nOperation successful.\n\n\nA: Same issue here. I was under the impression that I was running 10.13.4 but after a restart was presented with the same Installer Log error screen. I was able to reinstall macOS High Sierra (Command ⌘ + R at boot) without needing to wipe my drive and my data and settings were retained and I was successfully updated to 10.13.4.\n\nA: I had this problem on a 15\" 2017 MacBook Pro. I was able to solve it by entering Recovery mode, mounting Macintosh HD (it was unmounted), checking it with First Aid, then restarting the computer and downloading the update.\n\nA: I got exactly the same problem: after 8-9 minutes got the message to restart because the update didn't work. I had the same with the previous update, but didn't learn my lesson. Then I downloaded the update and with the dmg file managed to update. Mistakenly I didn't this time. \nSo, first I restarted in safe mode, which worked, but when I restarted again back in normal mode, I got the same problem.\nThen I restarted with the space bar. Didn't work. Same problem.\nThen I restarted in recovery mode, and that finally worked. However, regretfully my most recent time machine backup was 2 weeks old (I was traveling), meaning I lost 14 days of work.\nFor the past hour I have been trying to download the dmg file instead of using the update via apple store. First attempt, the download got stuck at 577KB; second attempt stuck at 4.1MB.\nSo, now I decided to wait & see and ignore the apple store message to update, until I read some good news.\n", "Q: MacOS intermitently shows system messages in wrong, non-default language So at some point last year I set MacOS language to my native language. I didn't quite like it, so after a while I switched back to English. Since then, MacOS keeps sporadically showing me messages in my native language, usually in low level scenarios (during startup, shutdown or update, in some system dialogs like Disk Utility repair disk log, etc.). \nI tried every solution I could find (re-add and remove the other language, do it in safe mode, set English as default through the terminal, etc.) with no luck. Messages in my native language keep popping up from time to time. The weird thing is that the same message (like in the attached photo, which shows the restart computer dialog window) will sometimes be displayed in English, sometimes in the other language, with seemingly no logic as to why.\nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix this? Thanks!\n\n\nA: Had the same problem today. I've opened the terminal and ran the following command:\n$ sudo languagesetup \n\n\n*\n\n*You'd have to add the password from your Mac's user. \n\n*You'll be prompted with a language list. \n\n*Select the one you desire, restart your Mac and just in case disable the option to reopen windows when you log back.\n\n", "Q: Why is Xcode starting on macOS Sierra start up? After starting or restarting macOS, Xcode is launching and opening a file that I never touched.

(In reality I'm running this in a context where I can log the exit code and it's always 0.

But no output, no video.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: (Edited/Updated)\nAccording to this thread on StudioSysAdmins, the problem I'm running into is because of aerender's reliance upon the Window Manager.\n\nAerender is a hack that wraps the entirely GUI based After Effects\n  application with a basic command line render interface.

A little convoluted, but it works!\n\nA: As you have discovered, aerender requires access to the Window Manager. You could try putting your job into ~/Library/LaunchAgents which runs in the user session, or use another scheduling tool.\nlaunchd Alternative\nIf a user is logged in or even fast user switched out, you could use a tool like Power Manager to run your Window Manager requiring scripts and applications.\n\nI wrote Power Manager, so feel free to ask technical questions. I suggest it in this case, because what you want is possible thanks to the tool's architecture.\nper-user and Window Manager Access\nPower Manager runs a per-user process called pmuser. This process allows you to run scheduled scripts and tasks as a specified user or as the Active User – the front most user.\nWithin your Power Manager event, look for the Environment pop-up. This controls which user environment your shell script will run in. Active User is the front most graphical user session and it has access to the Window Manager.\n\n", "Q: Mid-2015 MacBook Pro shuts off without warning when an Ethernet adapter is *not* plugged into a Thunderbolt port. Why? I have been dealing with random crashes all of the time on my MacBook Pro. The screen will go black (not off) for about 30 seconds while the fans spin up to max, then everything shuts off. When I boot back up there is no warning that my computer was shut off because of a problem like there is with a kernel panic. The crash occurs for all users of the computer, so it must be something that got installed for all users and not in my Home directory.\nI tried many different things to resolve this (i.e. standard resetting NVRAM, reinstall the OS, safe mode, etc). The only thing that has \"fixed\" the problem was booting into Safe Mode, though I cannot easily tell what changed since there is not much to test there. The hardware diagnostics do not indicate any problems.\nFrom what I can tell, nothing gets logged into the console when the computer shuts off. There is nothing that indicates power failure or overheating either, which is strange. \nFor troubleshooting, I tried a few things one at a time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erasing and rebuilding the Spotlight index (mdutil -Ea → mdutil -ia off → mdutil -ia on)\n\n*Uninstalling enterprise VPN software\n\n*Resetting network settings \n\n\nNone of these things seemed to work. However, I remembered that I do not have this issue when plugged into my Thunderbolt Displays, which led me to believe there could possibly be something related to the Thunderbolt port that causes this (quite the longshot, admittedly). I tried all of my Thunderbolt dongles one at a time:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDMI\n\n*DisplayPort\n\n*Ethernet\n\n\nAnd I stopped here. When the Ethernet adapter is plugged in (not necessarily attached to an actual Ethernet cable) the crashes simply do not happen. As soon as I unplug it, I get about 5 minutes and the laptop shuts off. Why on earth could this possibly be happening?

I want to create custom Quartz filters to reduce file sizes to custom specifications when exporting a PDF in Preview.\nI found a helpful article on how to do it with an old operating system.\nI found the code to modify here on Ask Different: How to decrease .pdf size without losing quality\nMy only problem is I can't get my Mac to recognize and use the custom files I created. It looks like the file structure has changed as Mac has upgraded its operating system. I have tried placing the files in the following locations and none of them have worked.\nLibrary/Filters/ (created a new Filters folder)\n\nLibrary/Users/my_user_name/Library/Filters/ (created a new Filters folder)\n\nLibrary/PDF Services/\n\nLibrary/PDF Services/Filters/ (created a new Filters folder)\n\nSystem/Library/Filters (not allowed to edit)\n\nThis was my reference, macrumors.com, for where to place the files.\nI am running High Sierra 10.13.4.\n\nA: I have had success on macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 with putting Quartz filters in a Filters folder within my user's Library folder:\n/Users/my_user_name/Library/Filters/\nin other words:\nMacintosh HD > Users > my_user_name > Library > Filters\nHowever, your Library folder is normally hidden. An easy way to navigate to it is to click on the Go menu in Finder and while the menu is down hold the Option key. Library will then appear in the list. Once you open it you can create the Filters folder which probably doesn't exist, and put your filters there.\nFor reference, the filters I am using are those that Josh Carr posted to GitHub.\n\nA: If the Quartz Filter is not correctly written (it's an XML file), then it will not load. \nThe ColorSync Utility should show you all the installed Filters on the system. You can also create and edit them here.\nAs you say, Filters will be loaded from any \"Filters\" subfolder of the User or root-level Library. (Also the /System/Library/Filters folder, now protected by SIP.) This has not changed in any version of MacOS.\nFilters can be placed in the PDF Services subfolder of the Libraries, and then will appear in the PDF button of the print menu. If selected, a PDF will be saved to the Desktop with the Filter applied. \nThere was a bug in early versions of High Sierra in which filters would not always be applied to certain PDFs, but it has been fixed by Mojave, if not earlier.\n\nA: In Catalina (and probably earlier) you can also use the ColorSyncUtility that comes with MacOS and add new filters under \"Filters\".\nIf you just want to adjust an existing filter, right click on the filter you want to change and select duplicate. Now you can change the values as you wish. You also have the option to create a whole bunch of new filters.\n", "Q: How can you assign a custom shortcut to stop a QuickTime screen recording? I am looking to record my screen using QuickTime on my Mac, but stopping a screen recording requires you to press ControlCommandEsc. I would like to know if it is possible to create a custom keyboard shortcut, such as ControlCommandS, to stop the QuickTime recording.\nI prefer not clicking the Stop button in the menu bar because the recording captures the mouse trailing up to click that button.\nIf it is possible, how can one create a custom shortcut to stop a QuickTime screen recording?\n\nA: This can be accomplished using an Automator Service bound to a custom keyboard shortcut, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator (/Applications/Utilities/Automator.app) and create a new Service.\n\n*At the top, set this service to receive no input in any application.\n\n*Use the search bar on the left side to find the Run AppleScript action and drag it into the main workflow pane on the right side.\n\n*Set the contents of the Run AppleScript to the following:\non run\n    tell first document of application \"QuickTime Player\" to stop\nend run\n\n\n*Save the Service under a name you'll remember (perhaps \"Stop QuickTime Recording\").\n\n*Open System Preferences, go to Keyboard preferences, go to the Shortcuts tab, select Services from the menu on the left, and find the Service you just created (it's probably located under Text). Click on it to select it, then click the Add Shortcut button.\n\n*Press the keyboard shortcut you want to assign to this action (⌃-⌘-S).\n\n\nYou can then close System Preferences and Automator. From now on, any time you press that key combination, it will attempt to stop the first active recording in QuickTime Player, including screen recordings.\n\nA: You may use the default stop recording shortcut: ⌘ + Ctrl + Esc to stop recording when you finished.\n\nA: To end the recording you can press: ⌘+Ctrl+Esc, or press the ⏺ (stop recording) button on your Macbook's touchbar.

I'm doing some remote Mac administration and finding myself needing to copy a keychain to the machine and then add it to the default list of keychains. \nUsing VNC and the GUI, this is simple: just double-click it and Keychain Access opens, revealing that it's been added.

The security tool doesn't seem to have an \"add-keychain\" command or an argument to any other command that would do this, as far as I can tell. \nHow do you do this?\n\nA: For some reason, the feature is hidden in the form of the -s argument to list-keychains. The other gotcha is that you need to simultaneously re-add all existing keychains. This should take care of it:\nsecurity list-keychains -s `security list-keychains | xargs` [path to keychain you want to add]\n\n", "Q: How to get back the missing monitor option in High Sierra's menubar?

I want to be able to read text on it while running on a treadmill, from a distance of 1-2 feet.\nFrom this distance, it is difficult to read as the text is too small. I work around it by increasing the font size. For apps like iBooks, it isn't a problem as there's a setting to adjust font size. However I usually read in a browser (usually Google Chrome or Google Search app). Unlike desktop versions, there doesn't seem to be any setting for changing font size. Google searches have led me to believe that I can change the font size in the iOS Settings app and that these apps should respect that change, but they don't appear to do so.\nHow do I make the font size changes to read text from a distance.\n\nA: If you are not adverse to reading articles using Safari, many websites can be viewed in Reader Mode.  From here you can adjust the font size along with the actual font and background color too.\n\n\n", "Q: Upgrade path for CouchDB 1.x to 2.x on macOS?

This has been working fine until recently. I now only get intermittent access in a predictable way.\nIf I try to connect to the database on port 3050, I get an \"Unable to connect to network host ...\"\n\nHowever, if I open a Windows Explorer window and try to navigate to the host as a UNC path (e.g. \\\\192.168.0.1), I get a Windows Security prompt.\n\nI don't have to enter anything in this at all, or submit the dialogue, but after this point, I can connect to the database server on the Mac for about 30 seconds or so.\n\nCould anyone explain this behaviour with a view to getting more reliable access to the database again?\nUPDATE\nAfter gaining access to the iMac, I seem to be able to reproduce the issue by putting the iMac to 'sleep'. After putting to 'sleep', I can't access the database, then trying to navigate using Windows Explorer to the mac, I can call it. To me, it seems as though Windows Explorer is doing something to 'wake-up' the mac - temporarily at least - but a standard call to the database on port 3050 doesn't wake it up? Further investigating...\n\nA: The issue appears to have been caused by the Mac going into Sleep mode.\nIt appears as though trying to connect using Windows Explorer from a Windows machine is issuing a Wake On Lan request, which wakes the target Mac for 30 seconds or so. During this 'wake' period I was then able to connect.\nBy implementing a Wake On Lan request from my application, I now seem to be able to reliably connect again to the target mac.\nI would not have expected the target 'server' to be put into sleep mode, however, because we don't control the environment in which our software operates, we need to account for all possibilities really.\nBecause the target mac and windows computers are on different sub-nets, I've only been able to issue the wake on lan directly to the target mac's IP address, rather than completing a broadcast wake on lan.\nI was able to modify the code available here to transmit the WOL to the target mac.\n\nA: Understanding that until I read this I never even knew there was a DB on the Mac called \"Firebird.\" I am approaching this as a Windows support tech of a number of years and what this sounds like it might be. This will be a bit general and only point in a possible direction.\nThe first error message could be so many different things you could write a book. But the second error message may be pointing in a new direction: authentication.\nWith the Mac all you need to provide is a username and a password and you are in and depending on how you are authenticating you may not need to authenticate at all. Windows Does Not Work Like That.\nWindows is all about authentication even if that authentication is (username) guest and (password) 1234. Oh wait did I mention that Windows expects the username to be in the form of \"DOMAIN\\Username.\" Domain could be the name of the user in an Active Directory domain or it could be just the name of the PC you are connecting to.\nIf you need to log into a domain-connected Windows PC computer as a \"Local\" user (EG not authenticated via an AD Domain) you need to enter the name of the computer (sometimes called a NetBIOS name) a backslash and the username. This is so Windows knows where to authenticate, locally or in the domain. This can be annoying especially if you don't immediately recall the NetBIOS name of the PC you need to log into.\nSo how would you log into that Mac from a Windows PC and tell the Windows PC to authenticate from the Mac's user list? Like this:\n[MACNAME]\\[Username]\nWhere MACNAME is the name of the Mac listed in the sharing Preference pane at the top next to Computer Name. Note that keeping the name short and free of spaces will help you here.\nAnd the password being the password of the user on that Mac.\nSo to connect to that Mac reliably over a network connection from that PC you would map the network drive and check the box to authenticate using different credentials. In the first box you would enter the computer name of the Mac, a backslash \"\\\" and a username with the appropriate permissions on that Mac (also remember that spaces in computer names and passwords on Windows is verboten!.\nAnd put the password in the password field. If you have entered the right info you should connect to the Mac and be able to Explore it's file system on the PC.\nThis is a long explanation to make sure you understand what is going on in the background when Windows authenticates. I believe (remembering my limited knowledge here...) that it is possible that you need to authenticate to the Firebird database in a similar fashion from the PC. IMHO.\nAlso you may want to contact the folks who support Firebird and see if I am totally full of little red ants or not and find out how you would authenticate in this fashion from a Windows PC.\n", "Q: Where are tex /mactex binaries after brew install mactex As can be seen: mactex was installed successfully:\n==> Installing Cask mactex\n==> Running installer for mactex; your password may be necessary.\n==> Package installers may write to any location; options such as --appdir are ignored.\nPassword:\n\n\n\n\n==> installer: Package name is MacTeX-2017\n==> installer: Upgrading at base path /\n==> installer: The upgrade was successful.\n  mactex was successfully installed!\n\nWhere is it however.. \n21:22:37/hw6 $which tex\n21:23:35/hw6 $which mactex\n\n\nA: At the time of writing (June 17th, 2018) running:\nbrew cask install mactex\n\nwill install MacTeX-2018 and\nwhich tex\n\ngives\n/Library/TeX/texbin/tex\n\n\nA: Perhaps this is answer is unrelated to the issue the OP had, but I found the question while I was having a similar issue.

Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: If you're on a laptop, make sure it's plugged in as FileVault will pause on battery.  If that's not causing it, you can create a clone of your system using Carbon Copy Cloner (http://www.bombich.com/) or SuperDuper - that's what I would do - and then wipe the system, re-install the OS (High Sierra isn't that bad).  Then I would enable FileVault on the clean system, wait for it to finish encrypting what little is there (OS only, a few gigs), then restore your files from the clone manually, then enable Time Machine and have it do its backups.\n\nA: Error: This command requires root access.\n\nYou'll have to run as root.

I have noticed that when I open an app from the App Switcher it actually shows me a screenshot of the latest state of the app instead of showing me the real app.\nCan someone clarify the process of opening apps from the background?\n\nA: Because the action of quitting an app actually uses some battery power in the process of doing so (e.g. clearing it from RAM, etc) and then again later when the app is launched again, iOS is designed so that it’s usually best to leave apps open. \nNow, even though they’re open, they’re really just sitting in a type of suspended mode that isn’t using any battery power whatsoever. So, while the app is still loaded in RAM and taking space, it’s not actually doing anything - it’s just lying there dormant. \nFor this reason you only need to quit apps if they're not working properly (e.g. an app has frozen, it isn't displaying properly, etc).\nSo, usually apps listed within the App Switcher are not necessarily running - in fact most of them are not running at all. Most apps in the App Switcher are in a suspended state - this means they're not: visible on screen, executing code, using the CPU or GPU, or using the battery. However, they are still resident in memory until they are purged (if necessary) by the system to free up memory.\nNow, what happens here is that the last screen displayed by most apps is what's stored in this suspended state. So, the screenshot you're seeing is not really a screenshot per se, but the last known state displayed by the app prior to it being suspended.\nSee below reference for further info:\n\nSuspended - The app is in the background but is not executing code. The system moves apps to this state automatically and does not notify them before doing so. While suspended, an app remains in memory but does not execute any code. When a low-memory condition occurs, the system may purge suspended apps without notice to make more space for the foreground app.\n\nSource: See Table 2-3 in Apple's App Programming Guide for iOS: Execution States for Apps.\n", "Q: How to stop iPhone 6 lock screen from rotating to landscape mode I have an iPhone 6, running iOS 11.

It kind of freaks me out especially because of the weird non-latin characters associated with one of the devices. \nIs it something potentially dangerous? Could it be an attempt for hacking? \n\n\nA: Most probably they appeared if you have ever connected to some other devices (other mobile phones, for instance) which shared their internet connection with you OR for charging.\nAnother possible reason is that someone near you has a device with the ability to create a personal Wi-Fi hotspot. Your computer is able to detect this so will add it to your list of available providers.\nYou can safely delete them.

Whenever I try to connect to the network, it will fail 95% of the time with the unhelpful message \"Can't connect to this network\".\nWhen Windows is trying to connect to the network, the network sort of \"resets\" (icon goes red momentarily in the taskbar and the Wi-Fi connection in Network Connections goes disabled momentarily) just prior to it failing (almost as if the network driver crashed or something).\nWhen it does manage to finally connect (after attempting numerous times), the end result could be any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Loading a page in Edge or attempting to access the Internet in any way will crash the system.

It should extract the drivers (make a note of where) and then start an installer. You can exit out of the installer as all you need are WiFi drivers.\n\n*When you booted into Windows it may have tried to automatically install the WiFi drivers (Windows plug-n-play). Cancel out of that and open Device Manager.\n\n*Find the WiFi hardware, it could be under network or unknown devices. Right-Click and select Update Driver. If you are given the option to let Windows search for a driver or installing manually, cloose the latter and point it to the folder that step 6 created, that contains the WiFi driver.\n\n*Windows should install that driver and though it is not strictly necessary I would go ahead and reboot.\n\n\nAt this point if WiFi is still acting squirrely, remove the WiFi driver again and Google the WiFi device that Device Manager identified. It should lead you to the chipset manufacturer's website. Look for their drivers for your version of Windows and (following the directions outlined above) install those drivers instead of the ones that Apple provides with bootcamp.\nUsually this procedure will fix Windows Bootcamp driver issues. If that does not do it there is likely something deeper going on either with Windows or the WiFi hardware in your Mac.\n", "Q: Prevent application from requesting password on MacOS Is there a way to prevent applications from requesting for password forever? I found lot of references to give applications root permission so they won't prompt for password. But I don't want to give any permission, I just want to deny all requests for password. Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks!\nEdit: The application I'm talking about is Slack. It works great, but every time I open it and sometimes even after it's opened, it keeps requesting password to install helper tools. I don't want it to install anything and I just don't want it to keep asking me every time.\n\nA: In my opinion, any app which is routinely asking to escalate permissions is either badly written or suspect, or is an admin-type tool which should be run intentionally from an already-elevated user condition at all times.\nIf this is supposedly an app aimed at everyday users, and it's routinely needing escalation, that indicates it's needing to change preferences or permissions in a way which violates the most basic tenets of security and/or sandboxing to a degree which would worry me until I determined exactly what the offending subprocess(es) was or were, why this caused continual escalation, and if that was either acceptable to me or defensible in some manner.\nSo for me, the answer would start with \"what, why and how\" is causing the escalation, and only after nailing that down really solidly would I consider undertaking setting this app to always run elevated, which honestly is a simple thing to do in Terminal, but... it's very much a non-trivial, only do it when both essential and you are dead sure it's safe and appropriate way to go.\n\nA: If the app in question happens to be slack, you happen to be an admin, and you happen to just want it to shut up... change who owns the app so that it can update itself.\nsudo chown -R YOUR_USERNAME /Applications/Slack.app\n\n", "Q: Why do I have an extra hard drive? When I go to \"About this Mac\" it shows I have 1 500GB hard drive, but when I use diskutil list it shows I have 2 500GB.

How can I tell if my hard drive is encrypted or not?\n\n\n\nA: You are seeing the listing for both the logical volume and the physical disk on which that logical volume resides - note the Apple_APFS container disk1 matches the APFS container scheme Identifier disk1 - lines 6, 7, & 10 of your output from diskutil.\nSuggest you look in the GUI version of disk util to get a sense of physical disk and logical volume - I think that will make it clearer for you:\n\n\n\nhope this helps mate.\n", "Q: Cannot convert m4a files to m4b with AppleScript I use Make Bookmarkable to convert some audio files to the m4b bookmarkable format. However, since macOS High Sierra, there is a problem when running the script with a batch of files.\ntell (add loc) raises --> error number -1700 that number -1700 can't be converted to item\nThe conversion does happen but then stops executing, meaning files have to be converted one by one. I'm not not familiar with AppleScript but suspect that the problem maybe because of changes in iTunes.\n\nA: mp4, m4a, and m4b are alternative filename extensions for the MPEG-4 Part 14 container format. To \"convert\" an m4a file to m4b, just rename the file. That's what the script you linked to also does.\nThe option to remember the previous playback position in iTunes is enabled by default for files with an m4b extension but not for files with an m4a extension, but it can just as well be enabled for files with an m4a extension, so they are not any less \"bookmarkable\". Just check the \"Remember playback position\" checkbox from the \"Options\" tab in the information window. (I think old versions of iTunes didn't have that checkbox, which is probably why the script you linked to was originally created.)\niTunes also displays m4b files under audiobooks by default, but an m4a file can be listed as an audiobook by setting \"media kind\" to \"Audiobook\" in the \"Options\" tab of an information window.\nEdit: the script below renames the files of the tracks selected in iTunes and changes the bookmarkable and media kind properties.\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    repeat with t in (get selection)\n        set bookmarkable of t to true\n        set media kind of t to audiobook\n        set l to location of t\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            set f to file l\n            set name of f to (text 1 thru -2 of (get name of f)) & \"b\"\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Can you install or downgrade to an older point release of macOS? I need to do some software testing against macOS. I know I can download the El Capitan and Sierra installers, but they seem to install the last version (i.e. 10.12.6) rather than the 10.12.0 release. \nIs there a way to get ahold of the older installers, or some way to downgrade? \n\nA: There is no way to downgrade to or download an older point release of macOS from any official source.\n\nA: You may be able to load an earlier macOS using Recovery, the HD/SSD partition on the computer's boot drive. Briefly, you may be able to load the macOS that originally came with your Mac, or the closest software still available, whatever that is. \nBooting while holding Shift + Option + Command + r (if your machine has macOS Sierra or later), or Option + Command + r (if your machine has an earlier release of OS X) should restore an earlier version. Refer to the Apple Support Document, How to reinstall macOS for more info.\nI would also like to point to another discussion, How can I download an older version of OS X/macOS?, which goes into much more detail on what macOS reversions can be restored using Recovery and other Apple resources.\n", "Q: emailing a larger set (15-20) of photos If I need to send a set of 15 photo images via email, what is the best way to do this? Will I need to send them in multiple emails? I understand that I should resize the files to 72 dpi.\n\nA: For sharing photos, you can use iCloud Photo sharing. For more information, refer to the Apple support document, iCloud Photo Sharing.\nIf the recipient are not using Apple devices, they can still access the photos via iCloud website.\n\nA: \nIf I need to send a set of 15 photo images via email, what is the best\nway to do this?\n\nIt sounds like this isn't something for \"social media\" where uploading to Facebook, Flickr, or another image sharing site would work.\nCloud File Sharing\nThe best way, at this point in time (IMO) is to use a cloud (file sharing service) service like OneDrive, Box, or DropBox.  Personally, I use OneDrive; Apple (internal) uses Box.\nThe benefit here is that you can create folder and share a link (read only or with editing privileges) and share that amongst the people you need to give access to.  With direct integration into Finder, you can share access to a folder without going to a website.  The link you generate can then be safely emailed to your recipients.\n\nThe \"beauty\" of OneDrive (and similar File Sync sites) is that it's cross platform; meaning it works on macOS, iOS, Android, Windows and even BSD/Linux (no shell integration, but web access works great).\nSending via Email\n\nIf I need to send a set of 15 photo images via email, what is the best\nway to do this?\n\nEmail might be a viable option, but you could hit limitations imposed by your email provider and/or ISP limiting the total size/number of attachments.  The email clients (Mail.app, Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.) don't care how many or how big they are - it's the servers that do.\nThe \"best\" way is definitely to zip the files to compress them and limit the attachment to just 1 file.  However, that doesn't eliminate the fact that the single zip file might be more than allowable size.  In this case, you would have to break it up into smaller ZIPs to come under the imposed limits.\n", "Q: Failing to Connect Remote App to AppleTV (4th Gen), While Screen Sharing Works I don't have access to my proper AppleTV remote to control my AppleTV (4th Gen), but that's no problem because I can use the Remote app on an iPhone and iPad.\nThe Remote app was working fine until one morning it wouldn't connect from any iPhone or iPad.

On the other hand the Remote app requires that the AppleTV is connected to WiFi.\nThis explained my problem.  My AppleTV was connected to a 2.4 GHz WiFi network, which stopped working. For some reason the 5 GHz network continued to work and my iPhone switched over, so I didn't notice.\nSince I didn't have an original remote, I was able to follow these steps to switch the AppleTV over to the 5 GHz network:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a regular TV remote (with directional pad buttons). \n\n*Plug the ethernet cable to the Apple TV.\n\n*With the iOS Remote App go to Settings -> General -> Remotes\n\n*Select Learn Remote and follow the steps to teach AppleTV your TV\nremote. \n\n*Once done, unplug the ethernet cable and set the WiFi under\nGeneral -> Network -> WiFi.\n\n", "Q: How do you enable Oracle VirtualBox's autostart daemon?

And none of the processes listed in Activity Manager jump out at me as anything that might be a Subversion server. \nTo get ssh tunneling to work, I had to make adjustments to System Preferences --> Sharing. The ssh server is involved first. But then, what is ssh connecting to to manage the Subversion repositories?\n\nA: When you tunnel over ssh using svn checkout svn+ssh://.., the svn client is actually running svnserve -q -t for the duration of each ssh connection and then shutting down svnserve when the connection closes.\nIf you want to see this in action, try opening two Terminal sessions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal session 1, run an svn command with the svn+ssh:// protocol. Assuming you don't have any ssh identities saved in your ssh-agent, this should pause waiting for you to enter your password: svn checkout svn+ssh://localhost/Users/johndoe/dev/svnroot.\n\n*Now switch to Terminal session 2. You should be able to find at least one svnserve process open via:  ps -ef | grep svnserve.\nFor example, you should see a matching process similar to:\n501 12869 12856   0  6:06pm ttys001    0:00.03 ssh -q -- localhost svnserve -t\n\n*If you return to Terminal session 1 and either complete or abort the svn command, the associated ssh session and svnserve process will quit.\nNote: if you are connecting to a local repository you can use the file:// protocol instead of tunnelling back into localhost via ssh.\nFor example:  svn checkout file://localhost/Users/johndoe/dev/svnroot\n", "Q: MacBook Pro late 2011 cannot boot using regular tactics I've tried every suggestion provided by Apple and a few i found here but am still unable to boot my laptop.\nThis occurred yesterday and i did manage to get in & do some work.

But the size is so big now, it looks very funny on my screen.\n\nA: I actually just solved that problem on my Macbook Pro.\nTried all possible solutions.

It would complain that the Server Update required 10.13.4 but offer to install the previous version.  Clicking OK for that, but nothing happened and 10.13.4 did not download.  Then the update panel stopped populating; it would briefly show the connection spinner, then go completely blank.\nA web search showed lots of people having this blank updates problem back in 2013, and at least one person solved it by deleting and reinstalling Server.\nI deleted Server, but the reinstall attempt gave me the same previous version offer, but again, clicking OK, nothing downloaded.  So I tried hiding it from Purchased.  Noticed that Purchased wants me to \"accept\" GarageBand, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, & iMovie.  I clicked Accept, but every time I go to Purchased, it still wants that.  Updates is still blank.\nLogging out of App Store and back in didn't help.  Reboot didn't help.

Take your AppleID to a clean install of macOS (you could download the installer and install on to a USB drive or boot to Internet Recovery and see if you can install on to a USB drive.\nThen you'll know if the problem is your computer or your AppleID. Despite the delay in getting to Apple Support - they are the one true source of account information and the best troubleshooting and the inside access to engineering to fix your account and/or get you the best chance of a precise fix.\nSorry it's not some easy thing, but the likely cause is you need to wipe and reinstall your Mac and that might only take a couple hours overnight - especially if you have a backup to restore tomorrow.

My Mac just \"restarted\" while I was looking away and I'd like to know if it was a crash or a postponed restart due to an update.\nMy Mac does sometimes crash and restart but hasn't done so for a couple of months.\nI installed some OS updates in the past couple of days but chose not to restart yet.\nGoogle Chrome was getting slow and had been displaying the green update arrow for a day or two. I clicked on the update button and wandered off to do something before it responded in any way.\nWhen I turned back to the computer it seemed to be \"restarting\". I'm using the scare quotes because I don't think it was rebooting from scratch since I didn't see the Apple logo with progress bar, which can be a little slow on my system.\nI verified that it had restarted by switching to the Terminal app which showed the Restored text with a timestamp from about a minute ago.\nWhen I check when the last reboot was using uptime or System Information it tells me 32 days.\nThe App Store is telling me that I still need to restart to complete updates.\n\nSo how can I check why it just \"restarted\"? I want to know if my crashing problem came back after such a long time of stability, if asking Chrome to update somehow allowed the other pending upgrades to restart the OS, or if it was some other reason.\n\nA: If there is going to be a message somewhere about a restart, crash or the like it will be found in console.app.\nConsole.app is your one-stop shop for all of the Unix logs that macOS generates and that most people will never look at or understand. You can find it in /Applications/Utilities.\nIt usually opens up with a view of the logs from the entire machine (top left pane of the window). You can drill down and see logs generated by specific subsystems, apps and manufacturers.\nThough I occasionally have a peek at the logs in console.app I find that a lot of what is displayed is confusing and/or just \"noise.\" However you may find a system message in there that might point to why your system restarted.\n\nA: I use Terminal a lot, so my answer will include commands used in that application.  I know Console provides details, but I rarely see it as more than a GUI to access the logs.  Terminal can be found in the Utilities folder which is found in the Applications folder.\nOn newer macOS (macOS 10.12 and later) with the unified logging system, the processing of the text files doesn't show the whole story, so use the log show command below:\nlog show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"Previous shutdown cause\"' --last 24h\n\nOf course, expand the time if your restart happened more than 24 hours in the past.\nAfter a while, you should see a message which contains a number indicating a reason.  To find the meaning of that number, you can use this site:\nhttps://georgegarside.com/blog/macos/shutdown-causes/.  For example, my last shutdown cause was \"-128\" which, unfortunately, is \"unknown\".\nOn older systems, you should be able to find the text \"Previous shutdown cause\" in your system log.  You can find this by using this command (which you can copy/paste into terminal):\ngrep \"Previous shutdown cause\" /var/log/system.log\n\n\nA: In a terminal, type this command:\n$ log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"System shutdown initiated\"' --last 1h\nFiltering the log data using \"composedMessage CONTAINS \"System shutdown initiated\"\"\nSkipping info and debug messages, pass --info and/or --debug to include.\nTimestamp                       Thread     Type        Activity             PID    \nTTL  \n2022-03-07 17:10:37.430378+0100 0x1116819  Default     0x0                  \n1      0    launchd: [system:] System shutdown initiated by: reboot[84708]<-bash[84578]<-launchd[1]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n-----------------------------------------\nLog      - Default:          1, Info:                0, Debug:             0, Error:          0, Fault:          0\nActivity - Create:           0, Transition:          0, Actions:           0\n\nThis gave me the precise timestamp when the shutdown started and that a shell script started by launchd initiated it (reboot[84708]<-bash[84578]<-launchd[1]).\n", "Q: Prepend folder names to file name and flatten file structure I have a bunch of folders with various names, for example\n2013-02   Snow and birds\n    PICT0001.jpg\n    PICT0002.jpg\n2013-06   Bicycle trip\n    edited_panorama.jpg\n    From phone\n        DCIM0001.jpg\n        DCIM0002.jpg\n        DCIM0003.jpg\n    From camera\n        DSLR\n            PICT0001.raw\n            PICT0002.raw\n        Compact\n            S0000001.jpg           \n\nAs you can see, the general structure is a varying level of nested subfolders containing images. What I want to do is to flatten the structure, adding the name of each level of subfolders to the filename, like this:\n2013-02   Snow and birds_PICT0001.jpg\n2013-02   Snow and birds_PICT0002.jpg\n2013-06   Bicycle trip_edited_panorama.jpg\n2013-06   Bicycle trip_From phone_DCIM0001.jpg\n2013-06   Bicycle trip_From phone_DCIM0002.jpg\n2013-06   Bicycle trip_From phone_DCIM0003.jpg\n2013-06   Bicycle trip_From camera_DSLR_PICT0001.raw\n2013-06   Bicycle trip_From camera_DSLR_PICT0002.raw\n2013-06   Bicycle trip_From camera_Compact_S0000001.jpg\n\nHow can this be achieved by using either a Terminal script or any other kind of script? I have found some similar solutions, but they all seem to rely on a fixed level of subfolders, whereas my folder structure is varying.\n\nA: Tricky one, especially if you want to keep all the spaces etc. Run the following in the top directory (the one which contains 2013-02   Snow and birds etc):\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c 'for f do x=${f#./}; echo mv \"$x\" \"${x////_}\"; done' {} +\n\nThe assignment to x gets rid of the leading ./ from find, the ${x////_} replaces all (remaining) occurrences of / with _.\nAlso, I've protected the actual mv with an echo so you can verify first whether the commands look ok. Rerun the command without the echo to actually rename/move the files.\n\nA: @nohillside 's answer above is great actually. The only issue with it is that it does not account for files with spaces in them. That will cause some of the commands to fail.\nSo I'm putting an answer here that would support that as well.\nThis will just echo out the mv commands:\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c 'for f do x=${f#./}; y=\"${x// /_}\"; echo \"mv ${x// /\\ } ${y////-}\"; done' {} +\n\nThis will just echo out the mv commands into your pasteboard directly:\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c 'for f do x=${f#./}; y=\"${x// /_}\"; echo \"mv ${x// /\\ } ${y////-}\"; done' {} + | pbcopy\n\n[Careful] This will immediately run the mv commands for you:\nfind . -type f -exec sh -c 'for f do x=${f#./}; y=\"${x// /_}\"; eval \"mv ${x// /\\ } ${y////-}\"; done' {} +\n\n\nA: For purposes of this script, I had all of your folders contained in a folder named \"Filez\" on my desktop.

The bottom cover is a split bottom design. The battery cover is loose around the edge of the laptop. I'm guessing there was a magnetic strip holding it along the edge. It looks like there was a metal strip previously lining the edge but it is missing. The latch is only toward the inside (middle) of the laptop. Could someone confirm/explain how the edge of the cover is held in? I'm hoping I can get some magnetic tape to line the edge of the battery cover.\nI'm trying to avoid spending $15-$30 on a replacement cover.\nThis is what the battery cover looks like.\n\nA: The battery cover is held in place by four metal hooks on the outer edge as shown in the image:\n\nSource: Macworld/Jason Snell, First Look: MacBook and MacBook Pro\n", "Q: Installing two different versions of Windows via BootCamp? I am using a Mid-2013 MacBook Air running macOS High Sierra. I have installed Windows 10 on it using bootcamp.\nCan I also install Windows 7 on it using BootCamp and run it alongside Windows 10 and macOS High Sierra? i.e., while starting up, I can hold down Option and select between the three installed OS.\n\nA: I tried and found that you can’t install two different operating systems. When I tried, I came to the installation screen and nothing responds.\n\nA: I personally don't see why not.\nIt's looking like Boot Camp wants 48GB minimum for a partition, and a system I'm working on right now is allowing me to do 16 partitions \n(251 GB drive, with 106 used. 1 partition with 106 GB, and 15 with 9.6 GB each.)\nI'll test it out next week with a system with a larger drive.\n", "Q: How do I make aliases hidden in macOS? When I enter in Terminal:\nchflags hidden location_of_alias\n\nit hides the actual original folder the alias points to but it does not actually hide the alias itself.\nHow do I do it?\n\nA: To change the file flag of a symbolic link, or a Finder alias, rather than its associated file, use the -h option:\n$ chflags -h hidden file\n\nTo  unhide a file that has the hidden flag set, use:\n$ chflags -h nohidden file\n\n\nA: Filenames starting with a dot are hidden by default.\nIn Terminal you can rename the file with the mv command.\nmv \"old location\" \"new location\"\n\nor\nmv path/filename path/.filename\n\n", "Q: Finding and disabling unnecessary open ports on High Sierra I know open ports let applications communicate with devices or applications on network or internetwork, however I have been using my MacBook for 5 years and I have installed and removed lot of things over time.\nI will highly appreciate it if someone can please tell me how to list all open ports, and which ports are being open/used, and by which applications on my MacBook.\n\nA: The command you're looking for is sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep LISTEN.\nlsof by default lists all open files (where an open file may be \"a regular file, a directory, a block special file, a character special file, an executing text reference, a library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or  UNIX  domain socket.)\" (source: lsof man page).\n-i lists all Internet and x.25 network files.\n-n tells it not to resolve hostnames but use IPs instead, resolving hostnames potentially takes a long time\n-P tells it not to convert port numbers to port names (i.e. 80 -> http).\nPiping this output to grep LISTEN shows only the open ports which are listening for incoming connections, if you need to see all open internet connections, omit this pipe.\nThe list shows all listening ports, their processes, pids and users, so you can easily trace the programs from there.\n", "Q: Location of system file that connects roles with apps RCDefaultApp can change so-called macOS \"roles\", eg. change the handler of the mailto: protocol. This is stored in the following file:\ndefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist\n\nLSHandlers = (\n...\n    LSHandlerRoleAll = \"com.apple.mail\";\n    LSHandlerURLScheme = mailto;\n...\n\nQuestion: In which file in the filesystem is it defined how the value set in LSHandlerRoleAll, e.g. com.apple.mail, is connected to the actual program that is run, eg. \"Mail.app\"?\nPut differently, what is the full path to the system files that RCDefaultApp manipulates?\n\nA: The full path to the system file that RCDefaultApp manipulates is:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist\n\n(i.e. this is the file you already mentioned in your question)\nThis is the actual file that Finder queries (through LaunchServices) to find the global preference for whichs applications are associated with certain types of files.\nYou seem to be thinking that RCDefaultApp manipulates some other file, which mentions explictly \"Mail.app\" (i.e. the actually app folder for the application). This is not so.\nInstead Mail.app actually provides this information to the operating system by way of its Info.plist file inside the application folder. This is scanned when the application is opened, so that the system knows about the application itself and its supported file types.\nInside the Info.plist file for Mail.app, you'll find that it defines the \"CFBundleIdentifier\" for Mail.app to be \"com.apple.mail\". This is how the information from the LaunchServices preferences is \"linked\" to the actual Mail.app.\nAdditionally, it defines supported content types inside Info.plist within the CFBundleDocumentTypes, where LSItemContentTypes includes for example com.apple.mail.emlx, com.apple.mail.mbox, etc. \nThis ensures for example that even if you move Mail.app to a different folder, the system will still be able to start Mail.app when you double-click an emlx file in Finder for example.\n", "Q: Incredibly High Fan Speed Reading I have a 2014 iMac 5K. I find that the fans seem to have two speeds - slow, or top speed. Using SSD Fan Control, the optical drive seems to sit around 1200 rpm on startup at 43 degrees, and hits 100% max rpm when I launch anything taxing on the CPU. The other fan is the Hard Disk fan, which sits at the same temp of 43, but permanently reads 65,535 rpm, no matter what. It hasn't changed once!

I am using an Aukey Multiport USB-C Adapter.\nI can't connect the two monitors at the same time. When I do it, only the HDMI works. If I plug it out from the multiport, the VGA monitor shows up.\nWhat could be the reason for this behaviour? How do I resolve this issue?\n\nA: With that adapter, you can only use 1 video output at a time.  From the product description in the link you provided:\n\nAlternative Video Outputs: Connect a display to your computer using\n  either the HDMI port (4K@30Hz Max resolution) or VGA port (1080p Max\n  resolution). If both are connected, only HDMI will output\n\nEmphasis mine\nTo connect two monitors, you need two video adapters - an HDMI and a separate VGA adapter. The following should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type C USB-C HDMI Active Adapter\n\n*USB-C Thunderbolt to VGA adapter\nI always recommend using Active Adapters because they regenerate the signal from DiaplayPort to actual HDMI or VGA signals.\n\nA: It isn't possible to use the HDMI and VGA port simultaneously with Aukey multiport adapter.\nYou'll have to look for an alternative. It is advisable to go with 1st party cables and adaptors for the best results.\nYou can use an Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter. It is available on Apple Retail Stores and Apple Online Store for $69.00.\nProduct description from the Apple Online Store web page:\n\nThe USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter lets you connect your USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) enabled Mac to an HDMI display, while also connecting a standard USB device and a USB-C charging cable.\n\nYou will additionally need a Belkin USB-C to VGA Adapter for connecting the VGA monitor.\n", "Q: Unable to open \"Remote Desktop Protocol\" (RDP) URLs from command-line I am unable to open RDP URLs from the command-line.\nWhenever I try to open RDP URL from command line by executing the following:\nopen rdp://localhost/\n\nor any other IP address, I get the following error:\n\nThe URL is not valid.

I adjust the volume slider to where I want it (-13.8 db) , but when I start playing the song, the volume slider for that track instantly resets itself back to a much higher volume (+1.8 db).\nIf I adjust the volume while the song is playing, it works, until I restart. If I start the song from anywhere but the very beginning, it plays at this right volume. If I start it from the beginning, it plays with the higher volume. I'm so confused as to why this is happening. I'm using volume automation to fade out at the very end, but it's flat until then, so I don't know why it would cause this. (Yes, the line in the automation is where I want it).\nAny ideas?\nHere is a video of the issue in case my description was unclear.\n\nA: I was having this same problem and I think I figured it out. You have to click on ‘Editor’s button’ which is the scissors cutting the sound wave, which should open the MIDI region menu at the bottom of garage band. The make sure your track is unlocked, and then click on the little button just above where it says MIDI Region that looks like three tiny sliders or dots with lines coming out of them. That should open your MIDI draw area where you can not edit the volume and such. From there, edit your volume in the draw area, then fine tune it with the slider located on the track. Make sure when you're done adjusting you lock the track before you press play or it will reset again. It may take a few tries where it does reset a couple times before it sticks, but now, you should be able to get it to stop resetting for you. \n\nA: I think all you need to do is turn OFF the controller. That is:\n1. go to the editor (scissors)\n2. select the edit tool (line with dots on it)\n3. turn OFF the controller (button right under the word controller)\nNote that the controller for the track is disabled for all functions, e.g. both 'volume' and 'pan'\nI assume this is only a MIDI fix, but for me, it's only been a MIDI problem\n", "Q: Is it possible to screencast from an iOS device to a Chromecast?

Examples for when they show a different IP address:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've added the address to the Mac's /etc/hosts file.\n\n*The IP address has recently changed and the Mac apps still use the previous one it has cached.\n\n\nSo, is there a tool that tells me the IP address that's currently known to OS X instead of the address the external name server reports?\n\nA: It appears I made wrong assumptions about DNS caching. However, I was right on the /etc/hosts file, in that the host command ignores it, while apps running on the Mac do not ignore it by default.\nSo, I've made a very simple program that uses one of the Mac OS functions to resolve the host name into an IP address. This way, changes to the hosts file will be seen by this program, as they're seen by any other Mac app.\nThe program, including Xcode project, can be downloaded here.\n", "Q: Downloading an old app released for an older version of iOS I am trying to download the YACHT & JET DESIGN app on an iOS device running iOS 11. I am unable to do so. The app was released during iOS 7.\nHow do I download it?\n\nA: Honestly I do not believe it is possible. You may have to find yourself an iOS device that already has iOS 7 on it in order to download this app.\nIt is also likely that even if you could download it, it just would not run as iOS has changed a lot since iOS 7.\nIf you have an iOS device that supports iOS 7 you may be able to jailbreak it and install an earlier version of iOS (iOS 7) from unauthorized download locations. But that is way beyond the scope of what we discuss and support here. So you would have to go elsewhere for help with that.\n\nA: As can be seen from the App Store screenshot, the app has not been updated to work with iOS 11. Hence, you will not be able to download/install this app on your iPad running iOS 11.\n\nYou may still be able to install it on an iPad running iOS 7 - iOS 10, if you have access to one such device.\nTechnically speaking, iOS 11 lacks support for running 32-bit apps. The reason this app cannot be installed is because the developer of this app is yet to add support for 64-bit.\nYou may wish to get in touch with the developer by visiting their web-site mentioned in the App Store page to check if and when they are planning an update.\n", "Q: Bootcamp and disk space I tried to install Windows via Bootcamp and when I first launched BC it said (something like): The drive cannot be partitioned because there is not enough free space and it said I needed 40gb. \nHowever, when I tried to check my total storage in the \"about\" section it said that I had over 100gb free space!

While switching from the larger to the smaller, often times the mouse pointer is stuck at the bottom corner between the monitors.\nIs there a setting somewhere that I can set so that this annoying issue doesn't happen?\nA quick video showing the annoying state.\n\nA: Open system preferences, click 'displays', and then click the 'arrangement' tab. Here you will see a scaled down representation of your displays' positions relative to one another. Drag the displays around until the mouse switches over at the correct position. For your case, it'll probably look something like this:\n\n\nA: The mouse pointer stuck problem that you are experiencing is due to the way the monitors are aligned respective to each other.\nOpen System Preferences app → Displays → Arrangement and adjust the relative locations of the connected displays. Notice the layout of monitors as depicted.\nThe mouse pointer will only be able to switch between screens where the corners are aligned and there's a continuous path for the pointer to move. This pattern hold for whatever relative placement you choose for the two or more monitors. (For e.g., if one display is placed vertically above another, you'll not be able to move the mouse pointer to another display by moving it sideways, but towards top/bottom of screen).\nOnce the pattern is understood, you'll no longer face the mouse pointer stuck issue.\n\nA: Sadly this is just the default behavior. In their defense, it's the same in Windows.\nI've never been able to find a 3rd party app that handles this quite the way I want. It's easier to just have screens with the same resolution, quite honestly as well as sensible virtual display arrangement.\nThere are many applications that move your mouse to another screen via shortcut, but to me, that just doesn't cut it. It's too clunky.\nAs a side note: DisplayFusion (windows only) has the desired features implemented in the best possible way. It just slides to the other screen as if there was no corner there at all. It's fantastic. It has two settings:\n\n*\n\n*Prevent mouse cursor snagging on unaligned monitor edges\n\n*Prevent mouse cursor from sticking in Sticky Corners (Windows 10 Only)\n\n\nI think the most useful application I have found to get around this issue is Mouse Warp 2. It warps your mouse to the center of the active window when you switch to it using Cmd+Tab. It also has the option to only warp the mouse cursor if the activated application is on a different screen.\nI haven't used Mouse Warp in a while because it had a small issue, where if you Cmd+Tab too fast, I think if you release Cmd before the application switcher appears, it won't center the cursor.\nBecause of that, I've been using Keyboard Maestro\n\nKBM is expensive enough that you probably won't be buying it just for this feature, but it does have a trial if you want to try it out.\n\nI made a macro that kind of replicates Mouse Warp's behavior. It's a little janky and could be improved but it works very well (no matter how fast I Cmd+Tab).\nAlso, because this works by detecting that an application was activated, it is not limited to just Cmd+Tab, which may or may not be a good thing depending on what you like. That's why there is a conditional saying that if you click a window, don't center the mouse. If you open a new application, for instance, the cursor will be centered on it.\nI also included a version of that macro called Active Window (disabled by default). It's included in the same package. It will trigger every time a window activates. Literally any window. This includes \"open file\" windows. And likely most regular Alert windows. I like the Active App better personally.\nDropbox link\n\n", "Q: Downloading YouTube music videos Is there a reliable YouTube video converter than can download music videos?\nI am a professor teaching overseas and often download music videos for classroom use.

Some allow specific folders for the video files to be saved in and allows to begin download immediately without dialogue boxes further quickening the grabbing process, while some allow downloading only the audio track as mp3 files.\nSince the best one changes from time to time and differs from person to person, I will not list specific add-on names here.

When the script finds an existing lock file, consider sleeping for n seconds and then exiting.\nWhat happens if your script is killed or exits because of an error? Can you be certain the lock file is removed?\nIn C, a trick to ensure a file's removal is to create, open, and delete the file – a deleted file held open on UNIX will remain until the opening process exits. The file is deleted even if the process crashes.\nIn a shell script, catch the terminate signal and ensure the file is removed.\nAnother potential problem is checking for the file existing. This check could happen factions of second before the previous script finishes. This will be rare but possible. The approach quoted above claims to overcome this.\n", "Q: Recover data in Sparsebundle disk Image I'm afraid I'm out of luck but...

I last mounted this a month ago, and have used this like this for years.  The dates on the files in the bands/ directory are believable, with a couple bands dated on Feb 18, the last time I did anything.\n\nA: Well, I'm in luck.  I wandered around google drive, and right-click on the relevant folder showed me activity in March.  And, strangely, 14 of the band files had been deleted. Google drive had an option to restore them, individually.  After that downloading the whole sparse bundle as a .zip file, and expanding it, the bundle is now recognized again.\nI think the file deletions happened when I was messing around with google drive settings, changing it from \"Ask before deleting everywhere\" to \"Remove items everywhere\", on a computer that was sync-ing a much smaller subset of directories.\nLesson, (a) don't depend on Google for anything (although in fairness Drive did provide the tools to recover), (b) for important things, have multiple backups\n", "Q: Activity Monitor dock icon CPU history aggregate On my old Mac I have a CPU history icon showing single aggregate graph.\n\nOn the new Mac running the same OS version and having the same number of cores I can't seem to find this option.

On my 8 core system the history shows a single graph (helpful, but contrary to the text) while my usage shows 8 cores (not helpful, but also contrary to the text). It may be that the Activity Monitor dock icon is buggy in general for my version (10.13.4).\n\nA: I had this setting change as the result of an upgrade as well, but it's not necessary to edit config files manually.\nThe dock icon for Activity Monitor can be configured under View->Dock Icon.\nI believe what you're looking for is \"CPU History\", what you currently have configured is \"CPU Usage\".\n", "Q: What is the username of the macOS recovery? so I am trying to add a user to the admin group on my computer, but I don't have any admin powers. I do however, know the password that allows me to enter the macOS recovery mode, which I think must be in the admin group and I could use to give another user admin powers.\nDoes anyone know the username of this macOS recovery account?\n\nA: macOS recovery doesn't really have users or passwords. Well, technically it does have one user account: root. But Recovery's root account doesn't have a password; when you start in Recovery mode you're automatically logged in as root.\nIf you need to enter a password to get into Recovery mode, that's probably a firmware password. If a firmware password is set, you need to enter it in order to invoke any alternate boot mode (such as Recovery). This password has nothing to do with any user name or account, and has no use after the computer has started up.\n", "Q: How can I stop my iPhone from “Cleaning” apps in the background? As of a few months ago I began to notice my iPhone would automatically close and unload open programs if I don’t have them immediately running. This effectively eliminates any “multitasking” ability the iPhone used to have. For example, if I have a spreadsheet open and I switch to email, after a few seconds in the background the spreadsheet app will automatically close; if I reload it then I need to go through the process of opening the app, reopening the file, and waiting for it to load (which can take several minutes with a complex file). I’ll be on a social site, see a thread that I’d like to comment on by linking an article, minimize that app, find the article in Safari, and return to my app, only to find that the social app was closed for me and I probably can’t find the thread again. Playing a game? If the game doesn’t constantly auto save then I lose all progress if I answer a phone call while playing. \nI’ve managed to catch the iPhone “Cleaning” my apps if I watch the main screen - the opened app will grey out for a second and the word “Cleaning” will appear, after which I find the app has been closed and I’ve lost my data / place / progress. So it seems to me that preventing this from happening is the answer. But I can’t seem to disable it. Any ideas? (Before someone asks the obvious, I have 3GB of space open and unused on the phone. Also to be clear, this has nothing to do with the “Offload Unused Apps” feature.)\n\nA: You can't. It's up to the individual app to save the current context if the user switches to another app. Some apps handle this better than others, but in any case this issue needs to be addressed to the developers of the apps.\n", "Q: Where are my fonts after macOS 10.13.4 update?

Now, I didn't have an issue with that the first couple of days because I was using an external display so I didn't really mind the cracked black screen. \nThe problem is, one day I restarted the computer and now it won't connect to the external display and won't even get past the login screen (I was using voice over to login but after that nothing works, I'm assuming since voice over is not saying whats on screen).\nIs there a way to fix the external display issue? I tried Command F1 to connect to it and I also tried resetting the NVRAM and SMC, but it didn't work.\n\nA: Here is a slightly crazy idea to \"give you eyes\" on the Mac with the dead display. If you have easy access to a second Mac and the right cable to connect the two (e.g., Thunderbolt to Thunderbolt, USB-C to Thunderbolt, USB-C to USB-C, etc.), you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the two Macs with said cable\n\n*Put your damaged MacBook Pro into Target Disk Mode by holding down its \"T\" key while you turn it on\n\n*Turn on the second Mac while holding down its Option key so you get to choose which partition to boot from\n\n*Choose the system volume of the broken MacBook Pro\n\n\nThis basically lets you use the intact second Mac to boot into the system that is installed on the MacBook Pro with the damaged screen. If there are indeed any software or hard drive issues with that first Mac that prevented you from logging in, you are now able to see and potentially address them.\nFor more details on Target Disk Mode, see this guide.\n", "Q: mac screen goes sleep mode even I set never sleep I want my mac screen never dim, never sleep, never turn off.\nbelow is my power setting\n\n\nProblem: my mac goes log out and goes screen saver mode if it idles for 15 minutes.\n\nA: It sounds like your Mac will indeed never go to sleep, but the Screen Saver is set to activate after 15 minutes.\nYou can disable the screen saver by opening the Desktop & Screen Saver preference pane in System Preferences then selecting Never in the drop down box in the bottom left corner of the window.\n\n", "Q: Make sysctl changes at startup I'd like to change the default smb settings at startup to remove timeouts.

What color wallpaper do I need to use to make the page control dots invisible?\nI know, you can't really hide them, as in remove from the screen (without iOS jailbreaking) but you can make them almost invisible if you select the right color of the wallpaper.\nI have tried using two different wallpapers, while one makes them almost invisible the other does not, but the dots are over the same color on both wallpapers.\n \n\nA: You can't make the dots completely invisible.\nThe iOS SpringBoard (or Home screen as it is generally called) is programmed such that the Page Controls (dots) which appear just above the Dock remain legible irrespective of the colour of the wallpaper in the background. This is done by assigning them colors which are in contrast to the colour of the background.\nThe logic ensures that at-least the colour of the dot representing the current page of Home screen is most clearly visible.\nThere is no publicly available official document to back this fact. The conclusion can be reached by performing a small experiment as described:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the background to solid #000000 or RGB: 0, 0, 0 (Black color).\n\n\n\n\n\n*Get the color code for the Page Control dots corresponding to non-current screens. Notice the colour code for the dots. The value is #727374 or RGB: 114, 115, 116.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Create a solid colored background image of resolution equal to that of iPhone's screen (640 x 1136 in my case, iPhone 5s), with the above noted color code and assign it as iPhone background. The color code was picked corresponding to non-current screen dots as they can have more than one instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now once again, get the color code for the Page Control dots corresponding to non-current screens. It can be observed that the colour for the dots has changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now, create a solid colored background image with colour code #FFFFFF or RGB: 255, 255, 255 (White colour). Once again, notice the color of the dots. The color corresponding to the current screen has changed from White in first image to Black in the current image.\n\n\n\n\nP.S.: I have played around a lot with both macOS and iOS to minimise eye-candy by working through such tricks. Above conclusion is just an observation without any documented backing from Apple.

Yet another marvellous new 'feature' - Safari 11.1 now will not auto-fill any login data unless you specifically click the first field, select the login drop menu, select the login....  \nIs there any way to go back to the old method & prevent this complete & utter waste of time, every time?\nTo clarify, after comments.\nThe mac is unlocked, I'm sitting at it working. Security is not at issue; if I leave my machine, either I will lock it or it will self-lock.\n Any web site I visit that requires a  log/pass [already saved in Keychain, which is also unlocked] then requires me to click in the first box. Safari then presents a credentials drop menu for that box. I then have to click on it to populate the fields.\nThis does not improve security, it merely wastes time.  \nThis is in no way an improvement on simply auto-filling with the same information, which it used to do until recently.\nI could understand it if there were potentially multiple entries to choose from; but that would be an edge case not a standard practise.\nWhether or not there are 'hidden text fields' is not really an issue, as this data was previously manually entered into the visible fields then saved to Keychain. Keychain wouldn't populate fields with data it had not already saved for that page.\nThis is not for the  the 'personal info autofill'  -  - which already needs specific user interaction for good reason, only site-specific previously saved Keychain log/pass information.  \n\nA: This is only a partial answer covering a slight alleviation for:\n\nYet another marvellous new 'feature' - Safari 11.1 now will not auto-fill any login data unless you specifically click the first field, select the login drop menu, select the login…\n\nMy personal grievance with this situation is that there seems no way to use the keyboard for this and being forced to use the mouse/trackpad to hit a usually tiny caret to achieve the desired result. Using the keyboard for this task would be at least much faster and less error prone. \nUnfortunately, it looks as if you still may use Tab to get to the username field, but after that all keyboard actions seem to be inert and it's back to using a pointing device?\nThat seems to be amplified by a bug. If you Tab past the username field and into the password field, then Shift+Tab back into the username field, then the information is auto-filled in for the most recent credentials and you may even select other identities with the cursor keys.\nThis behaviour differs depending on the page in question and also has its level of practicality depending on the page design: how many fields there are to tab into, before reaching the desired one.\nOn a relatively cleanly designed page like Apple's developer program login page the behaviour is as described above. On other pages the behaviour can sometimes be different and even be more like it was before. For example, Microsoft dedicated login pages preselect an open field and it's just a cursor down + Return to go forward.\nThis was tested on 10.12.6 and with Safari Version 11.1.1 (12605.2.1).\n", "Q: Can I output 1080p at 240hz from my 2017 MacBook Pro 13inch with Touch Bar I just bought an Acer XB252Q gaming monitor that has 1080p 240hz.\nI was wondering if I can output 1080p at 240hz with my 2017 MacBook Pro 13\" with Touch Bar using a display port cable?\nI ask because on HDMI it only outputs 1080p at 60hz.\n\nA: Unfortunately, no.\nBecause your MacBook only has USB-C Thunderbolt, you will need a USB-C Thunderbolt to DisplayPort adapter. This Apple USB-C to DisplayPort adapter states that it can provide up to 60hz. This Apple article covers connecting UHD monitors with your Mac and states (paraphrased):\n\nThe MacBook Pro (2016 and later) can support these resolutions and refresh rates over HDMI 1.4b when using the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter with macOS Sierra 10.12 or later:\n  Up to 1080p at 60Hz\n  3840 x 2160 at 30Hz\n\nAllan is correct, you will probably want an active Thunderbolt to Displayport adapter. I forget USB-C and Thunderbolt are not interchangeable terms.\n\nA: Hardware\nMacBook: 2017 15\" MacBook Pro (maxed out)\nDisplay: AOC AGON AG251FWG2 (1920x1080@240Hz)\nUsing DisplayPort\nI used this generic 4K@60Hz USB-C to DP adapter and it correctly handled 1080p@240Hz resolution on my MacBook.\nUsing HDMI\nOn my MacBook, I only get 1080p@120Hz since I only have a 4K@30Hz adapter (which would translate to 1080p@120Hz, logically).\nHowever, on my Hackintosh (Vega 64), the maximum refresh rate I get is 1080p@144Hz. So there’s probably also a macOS + HDMI limitation.\nFreeSync\nNeither on my MacBook Pro, nor on my Hackintosh, FreeSync works in any of these configurations. I think it’s not supported at all by the macOS drivers.\n", "Q: Where should I install new (source code) software on a Mac? I am new to the Mac philosophy, but I have been using Ubuntu since a while. Now I am using Mac at work, and I have to install a few programs, not apps, from source code distribution.\nI did try to gunzip a folder in /usr/local/ but it says permission denied. Same result with sudo. The su command just freezes.\nIs /Users/ a better place to go? I suppose I do not need permission to write in there, right?\nWhere should I install new software (from source code distribution) on a Mac?\n\nA: To start we should define a few terms. An install from source code means that the software needs to be built before it can be executed.\nSo your first step is to find a place on your computer to perform the build. The best place for this is a directory in your home directory. I use a directory at ~/src/ to hold the packages. So, create this folder and unpack your source into here. Then you can build the software here.\nWhen it comes to the executable files man hier will tell you that /usr/local is the place to install things not included in the OS. Homebrew, for example, will install into here. So executables should go into /usr/local/bin. Most software packages will have an install tool that will perform this step. Of course /usr/local/bin needs to be in your PATH variable.\nThis is identical to Ubuntu in almost every respect.\n\nA: \nI did try to gunzip a folder in /usr/local/ but it says permission denied.\n\n/usr/local/ is a protected directory in macOS. The observed behaviour in your case is due to System Integrity Protection. SIP does not allow even the root user or using sudo to chown /usr/local/.\nAs per man hier, /usr/local/ is the recommended directory for placing executables, libraries, etc. not included by the basic operating system. So it is where you should be installing your software (from source). The approach to take here is to create a directory under /usr/local and chown it to logged in user. This new directory can be used to install new software as per your liking.\n/Users/ houses the users home directories, along with a Shared directory, shared between users. So, this is not the place to install new software, whether from source or not.\nYou can also refer to this nicely written answer discussing Standard for macOS filesystem.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s Plus experiencing unexpected touch input Recently, my iPhone 6s Plus randomly starts opening programs and games one after the other until I shut it down. Then yesterday when I was on a phone call, numbers started rolling across the top of the screen like it was trying to dial. Today, when I was on a call, it disconnected twice with the message \"system failure!\"\nAny idea what is going on?  It is a little over a year old.\n\nA: It is recommended to get your iPhone inspected by an Apple authorised technician. It appears there is something wrong with the hardware. It is also advisable to update to the latest version of iOS (iOS 11.3 as of this writing). You can try resetting your device (after taking a backup), and see if that resolves the problem.\n", "Q: My user preferences are gone after restart I restarted my computer and it's like I have a new install.\nThe system tells me it can't find a telephony file and my login startup items are gone. All my Finder preferences and other settings are gone.\nI am using El Capitan 10.11.6 and my home folder is on an external drive.\nHas anyone ever seen this?\n\nA: I believe somehow my external drive was momentarily disconnected and after I restarted it was like a brand new computer.\nI restored from my last time machine backup and everything was back to normal except....my external drive was missing from the last time machine backup.\nTime machine then backed up my entire external drive again.\nIt seems all is well now.\nThe moral to the story.....don't go without time machine or some other backup scheme.\n", "Q: How to make CarPlay and Google maps coexist peacefully The 2018 Subaru I bought has a \"Starlink\" media center that supports CarPlay. I have an iPhone 7, tethered to the player by USB. For various reasons I strongly prefer Google Maps to Apple Maps. However, if I'm playing anything in the foreground (radio, podcast) and Google Maps interrupts it with spoken instructions, the media doesn't resume playing afterward.\nThe problem doesn't happen when using Apple Maps.\nThere's very little documentation about how CarPlay, apps, and the media center co-operate. I was wondering if anyone could enlighten me as to how to make CarPlay work in this situation.\n\nA: This is likely an issue with your Starlink media center. Try looking through the settings on it for an autoplay on connect or something similar. In my car's media station, a bluetooth connection will pause and auto-play when using Google Maps, but does not always perform the same when using the USB connection.\n\nA: From information I received on Subaru's forum: it apparently is not possible to use Google Maps on CarPlay in the Starlink head unit of the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek Premium, and have it relinquish the audio channel to whatever was using it before it was interrupted for a spoken driving instruction. Only Apple Maps can do that - at least, currently; it's unknown whether this functionality could be added to Google Maps.\nHere is a link to the discussion: http://www.subaruxvforum.com/forum/interior-audio/162970-using-google-maps-carplay.html \n", "Q: 10.13.4 = 1 fewer monitors on my MacBook Pro mid 2012 (non-Retina)? I have a 2012 MBP non-retina.  I've been running 2 old CRT's along with the laptops monitor.  One CRT is connected through a Thunderbolt converter, and the other through a DVI/USB converter.  When my system automatically updated to 10.13.4 today, I soon learned that: 10.13.4 does not support the USB converter... which I guess Apple considers an 'enhancement'?  \nJust looking for some clever ideas as to how I might regain my expansive desktop, without 'having' to Time Machine back to 10.13.3.\n\nA: Your problem is due to a bug in the DisplayLink driver used by your converter.\nDisplayLink are aware of the problem,. They have issued a beta of a new driver that actually doesn't fix the problem. You can view their note on the problem at http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/macos It doesn't support multiple screens on multiple displays.\nThey have a mailing list supposedly for updates but have failed to notify the mailing list of the last two updates so I wouldn't bother.\nI also wouldn't blame Apple. Both Apple and a number of 10.13.4 beta users (including myself) advised DisplayLink of the problem quite some time ago.\nUpdate: DisplayLink have issued a second 4.3 beta that doesn't fix the problem. They have also removed the 4.1 version from their site. (4.2 has never been seen.)\n(I will update this answer when DisplayLink put out a working driver.)\n", "Q: How to retrieve notification once I cleared them?

This iPad is not listed on the Apple ID I have established.\n\nA: Go into Settings, click on iCloud, and it should tell you the ID.\n", "Q: Is it possible to update macOS without Apple ID? I don't really like an idea of using an Apple ID and want to refrain from it. Is there a way to update macOS without registering into the Mac App Store?\n\nA: Yes, there are three ways to update macOS without using an Apple ID. Most important thing to remember is that a user only needs the Mac App Store to download the installer, which downloads the update to the machine. \nYou can also download the installer from the Web by visiting this link on Apple Support website. Then copy the installer to the Applications folder. Double click on the application and you will be able to install the update.\n", "Q: can't find \"WhatsApp Web\" on my iPhone I am trying to set up WhatsApp on my computer (Mac running OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6).

I installed the latest update which attempted to restart the machine. The usual progress bar was showing and then it shut off. Curiously, it didn't restart.\nNow, when i press the power button, the sleep led flickers and then dies along with the machine. The screen never turns on.\nThings I've tried\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting SMC\n\n\nAre these symptoms familiar to anyone?\n\nA: The number of times the sleep light flashed was an indicator of the problem. Three flashes means the Mac can't find any RAM.\nPractically, this means the RAM you have installed is bad, or has a bad connection. Step one is re-seat like you did. Meaning remove and reinstall the RAM. If you still have problems, swap it out with some other compatible RAM and see what happens.\n\nA: In my case, it was sufficient to remove and reinstall the two RAM modules and disconnect and reconnect the battery. Probably it was just a coincidence that the update and the power-on problem appeared at the same time.\n\nA: Just did the latest update with my iMac and it looked stuck on the white screen with progress bar after already restarting twice.\nI went and made a coffee : patience is a virtue : it finished and got to the login screen and is working fine.\nSo moral is : even if it looks stuck let it finish... it took mine about 10 to 15 mins - didn’t time it as hadn’t expected it to take so long... perhaps a warning to be patient would help !\n", "Q: How to turn on my iPad Air 2 Last night I left my iPad close to my bed, placed above my Windows phone 8.

The battery may have run out of charge. Leave it plugged in to the charger for half an hour and then try turning it on again.\nIt's recommended to follow the steps outlined in this Apple support document, If your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch won‘t turn on or is frozen.\nThe last resort would be to get in touch with Apple Support or get it inspected by an authorised Apple technician.\n", "Q: Can I charge my MacBook Pro 2015 without using MagSafe 2 power port? I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015). Now after three years of use, the charger isn't responding to being plugged in. I tried to reset the SMC by holding down the left side shift control option and the power key but no luck.\nIs it possible to charge my MacBook using Thunderbolt 2 ports or USB 3 ports? I have seen some videos on Youtube people charging their device using these but I am not sure.\n\nA: It is neither possible nor advisable to charge your MacBook Pro using Thunderbolt or USB ports.\nIt is possible that either your MagSafe 2 port or the charging adapter is damaged. Please stop plugging in the charger if you spot burnt marks on either one of them. It’s recommended that you get your MacBook Pro inspected by an authorized Apple technician.

The software is all up to date.\nI'd like Safari to use DuckDuckGo as its default search engine. However, when I choose DDG in the dropdown at Safari > Preferences > Search, the dropdown immediately and spontaneously reverts to Google, without further input from me. All other Safari functionality works correctly. Interestingly, I have exactly the same software running on a mid-2010 MacBook Pro, and that Safari allows search engine selection.\nI have only two extensions (wipr and Omnikey) installed; removing them did not affect this behavior. Quitting Safari and the OS had no effect. Restarting in Safe Mode had no effect. Trashing the com.apple.safari.plist (from ~/Library/Preferences/) had no effect. Replacing the .plist with the plist from the correctly-operating MBP had no effect.\nAny ideas how to remedy this?\n\nA: I found a solution in this Apple Discussion thread.\nIt turns out that there are two places to select the search engine. Setting the search engine from Safari's URL bar overrides whatever's set in Safari > Preferences > Search. My Safari had Google set from the URL bar, and whatever I set in Safari Preferences was immediately reverted to Google.\nTo reset the default search engine in Safari's URL bar, click on the magnifying glass icon, which appears at the left side of the URL bar when no page is displayed. A dropdown appears. Then select which engine you'd choose.

I want to watch them via the AppleTV.\nI’ve tried putting them in iTunes and that works but only while my PC is on. My thinking is that if I store them in the iCloud, surely there must be a way that I can then watch them on my Apple TV without needing an iTunes engine running elsewhere?\nIs there a simple solution?\n\nA: There are no direct solutions. However, you could consider a service like Plex (Link) this would allow you to create a Plex server with your media and stream it to several devices.\nI have used plex for many years and it has worked perfectly for me. The service has some fees but they aren't massive and it will allow you to stream the content both to your tv and other apple devices with the Plex app.\nYou will need to bare in mind the CPU and GPU cost. Plex won't run well on a laptop you'll need a desktop of some form so Plex can transcode the videos for you to watch.\nDownload Plex server here.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: There is no way to rip and store the DVD contents in iCloud. If the same content as in DVDs is available in iTunes Store, you can purchase it and stuck the DVDs in the loft. The purchased content is linked with your iCloud library and can be streamed directly via your Apple TV.\n", "Q: A PDF file on my Desktop shows up with the name and properties of my root drive I am using a 2009 13\" MacBook Pro running El Capitan 10.11. On my desktop, I strangely have a PDF with the name \"Macintosh HD\" and the properties of my main system drive.\n\nDoes anybody know why this is happening, or how I can resolve it?\n\nA: In all likelihood this is a bug.   \nA \"real\" PDF, or a malicious file (which would probably better hidden or disguised), would not show for \"Get Info\" things like \"Capacity\" etc.\nIf under Finder > Preferences > General the checkbox is set to\n\"Show these items on the desktop:  harddisks\" it just is displaying the correct name for the internal drive: \"Macintosh HD\" but mixes up somehow the filetype/association.\nThat means the suspected explanation in the question is exactly backwards:\nSomehow the root drive/volume \"Macintosh HD\" is reported as kind \"PDF\".\nTo confirm this scenario, open a Terminal, type file (note the trailing space!) and drag the offending icon onto the Terminal window.   \nYou should now see the following output or something similar:\n$ file / \n/: directory\n\nIf that is the case, the solution is quite simple:\nOpen again the Finder preferences in the general tab and uncheck the \"show hard disks on desktop\" option,\n\nand restart the Finder with a method of your choice. That might include a logout, login cycle, or just type in Terminal:\n$ killall Finder\n\nNow, even if you you re-tick that checkbox, your hard disk should show up with the proper icon and filetype.\nIf these steps fail, deleting the Finder preferences, and then the caches might be the next steps.\n", "Q: Third party application cannot write to disk I downloaded this application: Donkey Simulator\nAnd after unzipping there should be an executable file but also a folder called \"log\", and once the application is running, new files are written into this \"log\" folder.\nHowever this does not happen and they warned about this situation:\n\nIf logs are not being generated you are probably running a version of\n  OS X that sandboxes untrusted applications. This prevents the\n  simulator writing to disk. To resolve this, move the executable within\n  the Applications folder.\n\nTheir solution of dragging the app into the Applications folder didn't solve the issue.\n\nA: The logs are indeed getting created. I executed the app on a Mac running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 (17E199). I have verified the log creation by precisely following the steps documented on the linked download web-page. Three important instructions to take note of from the linked web-page:\n\n\n*\n\n*\nIf logs are not being generated you are probably running a version of OS X that sandboxes untrusted applications. This prevents the simulator writing to disk. To resolve this, move the executable within the Applications folder.\n\n\n*\nThis simulator can create log data in the donkey tub format. This is stored in the log dir at the root of the folder next to the executable. On the mac you will need to browse the package contents to see this folder. If this folder is missing, no data will be recorded.\n\n\n*\nHit Auto Drive w Rec button.\n\nNow, follow the steps as described below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double click the downloaded DonkeySimMac.zip file.

Upon first launch (only), you'll be presented with a dialog box stating\n\"donkey_sim.app\" is an application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?\n\nClick Open to launch the app.\n\n*Select your preferred Graphics options and hit Play!.\n\n*Start scene of your choice by double clicking.\n\n*Hit Auto Drive w Rec button.\n\n*You'll be able to see a running counter against the label Log in bottom left corner of the app window. This verifies that the logs are getting generated.\n\n\n\n*Once you are done, click Stop → Exit → Quit.\n\n*Navigate to /Applications directory.\n\n*Right click on donkey_sim.app and select Show Package Contents.\n\n*Double click to open log directory.\n\n*Voila!

(Yes, keyboard is mistyped as Keryboard!).\n\n\nA: Did you try creating a new folder in the Applications folder (i.e. \"Donkey Simulator\") and then moving the application inside of that folder?\n\nA: From reading the Mac install instructions, once you unzip the downloaded archive file you have a folder you then move to (the root level) /Applications folder. However, if your account is a standard user account then you will not have write access to the /Applications folder or any of its subfolders. You can open the Get Info window for the /Applications folder and add your user account and give it Read & Write access then do the same operation on the Donkey Simulator folder you placed in /Applications, but add the additional step of clicking the gear icon pop down and select \"Apply to enclosed items...\" so that your read & write access is applied to the logs subfolder as well. This should solve the issue.\n", "Q: I have a Magic keyboard with the numeric keypad, how do i use it in bootcamp with windows 10? I got a wireless magic keyboard with the numeric keypad.

I connected with a Logitech 'Dual Mode' Bluetooth V4/BLE dongle, which I installed first. Note I do not have bootcamp (I don't even know what that is/for)\nThere are a few differences to a normal windows keyboard:\n- ALT key renamed 'option' \n- I have have to use the 'command' key for the Windows key \n- BACKSPACE is named Delete (there's a separate forward Delete key too)\nApart from these it seems completely normal so far, supporting all other keystrokes like F2, Control-Home, Conttrol-ALT-Delete (i.e. Control-option-Delete)\nThe only niggle = I can't tell the current charge level of the rechargeable battery.

After installing High Sierra when it was released, I was initially happy with APFS and gave no care to its relative novelty. Recently I've been using Linux, macOS, and Windows, and having to reboot back into macOS just to grab a file and then copy it to my Windows or Linux partitions is becoming inconvenient and tedious, not to mention a waste of space. I decided that I'd make the attempt to convert my macOS partition back to HFS+. Here are the steps I've taken so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Made a full backup of my internal drive using gdd. I've tested this backup and am writing this booted off of it.\n\n*Installed macOS High Sierra onto a disk drive (thereby keeping it HFS+).\n\n*Copied all of my macOS files onto this drive using sudo cp -a (Target Disk Mode).\n\n*Written this HFS+ partition over my APFS partition (gparted-live).\n\n*Transferred the Apple_Boot partition to immediately after the HFS+ partition on my internal drive (Target Disk Mode).\n\n*Attempted to boot off of my internal drive.\n\n\nThe resulting HFS+ partition appears as a bootable drive in the hold-Option-at-boot menu, and when I attempt to boot it (verbosely), it throws tons of warnings/errors along the lines of kernel[0]: ... dyld_shared_cache_x86_64': owned by uid=89 instead of 0, then infinitely outputs Process[32] crashed: opendirectoryd. Too many corpses being created (number ranging from about 30 to about 150) and increments the number. After powercycling multiple times it now outputs Waiting for DSMOS before the infinite loop.\nHere is a diskutil list of my internal drive:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS macOS                   169.3 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot                         600.8 MB   disk0s3\n   4:           Linux Filesystem                         31.5 GB    disk0s4\n   5:                 Linux Swap                         8.5 GB     disk0s5\n   6:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                40.8 GB    disk0s6\n\nGiven all this, what would be the cleanest way for me to accomplish converting my macOS partition to HFS+, keeping in mind I can start over if needed?\n\nA: Once you formatted an HDD as an APFS volume it is not easy to get back to HFS+. I made the experience when I formatted an external 10 TB backup disk as APFS just to decide that maybe HFS+ would be better for my usage scenario. When I tried to reformat the HDD, the HFS+ version was gone from diskutil. I had to erase the complete volume structure and as soon as I did this, I was able to format as HFS+.\nSo I guess you will have to go through this too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Full backup (time machine, carbon copy, ...)\n\n*Following my experience I would say to completely erase the volume structure of your internal HDD, through target disk mode or while booted into the recovery partition of an external USB drive.\n\n*Reinstall\n\n*Restore\n\n\nGood luck!\nWith other words: I would say there is no way of avoiding a complete erase and reconfiguration of the whole volume structure + reinstall.\nThe “too many corpses” hinds at a corruption of your account/machine setting.

I now have a mobile plan with unlimited LTE data, it's faster and more reliable than most Wi-Fi connections as well. So it would be great if I could tell my iPhone that it's ok to do things such as download 100+ MB apps from the App Store, or actually download videos from my iCloud photo library in full 4k/60fps resolution, or download an iOS update etc.\n(The aforementioned restrictions are in place only in mobile data mode and not when the device is connected to Wi-Fi.)\nBut I don't see a user-settable option anywhere? Seems certain restrictions are in place such that iOS wants certain network things only to happen on Wi-Fi?\nIt should be smarter than that. It's good that iOS tries to save mobile data by default, but it's strange that there is no choice for the user here. The data saving options are kind of arbitrary and actually moot anyways. If you allow some app to use data (which is the default), that app can then download as much as it wants on mobile.\n\nedit - I've been using a hacky workaround:\nA macOS computer is needed. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB, make sure the Mac is network-tethered to your iPhone via USB connection (in Network Settings). Then, enable Internet Sharing in Sharing Settings on your Mac. Set it up to share the internet connection from iPhone-USB via Wifi. Your Mac will create a WiFi hotspot. Then, on your iPhone, connect to that WiFi hotspot. \nYour iPhone will be pleased by the WiFi connection and lift its arbitrary restrictions.\nThe obvious downside is that you have to have a Mac up and running, and your iPhone must be hooked up to your Mac via USB cable.\n(This WiFi setup will also allow you to use HomePods in stereo mode, which is not possible without a WiFi network. Get them to connect to the Mac WiFi and you're golden).\n\nA: iOS doesn't restrict data consumption in general sense. The data restrictions are present only for a few specific scenarios, such as downloading large apps and iOS updates and that too are in place only in mobile data mode and not when the device is connected to Wi-Fi network.\nIt should be understood that the that the restrictions are only in place while you are on mobile data. Though debatable, those are valid restrictions to keep the overall user experience for an average user smooth.\n\nThere is no way to work around the mobile data download restriction in iOS. The restrictions are in place not due to technical reasons but a policy to restrict a few users from hogging the mobile network thereby brining down the network for everyone. This is more about encouraging fair usage among the users in the network.\nAs far as app installation is involved, the cellular download limit is now increased to 150 MB from 100 MB (Source: Higher Limit for Over-the-Air Downloads). Updating iOS still require Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\nThe data saving options are kind of arbitrary and actually moot anyways. If you allow some app to use data (which is the default), that app can then download as much as it wants on mobile.\n\nThis observation is correct, but it still isn't as common a use-case as installing apps and updating iOS.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is currently no way to disable this. If you are wanting to add to the cause of having this restriction removed, you can submit feedback to Apple through this form:\nhttps://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html\n", "Q: MacBook Pro display suddenly has a very faint warm/pink tint I have a MacBook Pro Touch 2017. A few days ago, I noticed that the display seems to have started to have a very faint warm/reddish tint, but I can tell the difference nonetheless. The greys aren't \"cool grey\" anymore, but more like \"red grey\", and the whites are sort of \"faint pink-white\".\nI really started noticing this because once after startup of macOS, the display was first \"cool/bright\" (what I would describe as normal), but perhaps 30 seconds after entry to the OS/Desktop, the whole screen switched to the red tint. This \"alteration\" doesn't happen every time starting the computer, but quite regularly. When comparing the display to that of a MacBook Pro 2013, it is clearly bluer/cooler in its display. \nNote that the displays aren't calibrated beyond the factory calibration and default profiles. The issue occurs regardless of any external displays being connected. This is not related to True Tone, Night Shift or anything like that.\n\nA: It sounds like you have Night Shift on. It tints all of your screens colors to be easier on the eyes. \nSystem Preferences > Displays > Night Shift > Schedule > Off\nTry that and see what happens. If that's it, you might want to turn it back on and set a schedule that works better for you. \n\nA: Old answer, provided as background\nI handed in my computer with the problem to an authorized service partner. At first they didn't recognize the error, but after some further convincing from my part they claim to have spoken with Apple about it.\nThe authorized service partner claimed that the problem with warm hue is a software bug introduced in one of most recent versions of MacOS High Sierra (spring 2018), and it afflicts various Mac models. They claim that Apple is aware of the problem, and a fix will applied in an upcoming MacOS patch.\nEdit, May 2021\nAs of MacOS Big Sur 11.2.3 (2021-05-04), Apple haven't applied a fix, as the problem persists.\nUpon multiple further contacts with Apple, it has become clear that Apple's support are not aware of this issue. They have asked for video evidence when the issue occurs. I would encourage users who experience this issue to contact Apple and send video evidence to get the issue noted.\nSince Apple isn't recognizing this issue, I have unmarked my answer as a solution.\n\nA: This solution worked for me - check the Color profile:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open preferences > Displays > Color\n\n*Select a display that matches your setup, like \"Color LCD\"\n\n\nFor some (unknown) reason, with the last reboot, a different device was selected, a projector, so all the UI elements, frames, and some whitespace turned pink.\n", "Q: App for playing multiple tracks from different sources simultaneously I have a 6 generation iPod touch and am looking for a specific app.\nI want to be able to play some track in the background, let's say song A, and then not only that it'll keep playing when I minimize the app - I also need it to keep playing while I play different tracks on the Music app, for example. \nSong A (from the app I'm looking for) and Song B (from my iPod's music) should be playing simultaneously.\nIs that even possible on iOS?\n\nA: Audio playback is handled as a background task in iOS. Only one app is allowed to playback background audio in iOS at a time.\nMusic playing apps usually programmed to continue playback even when in background (i.e. while you are using some other app, such as Safari). As you are looking to play music via two different apps, it will not be possible if both of them are programmed to support background audio playback mode.\nHowever, when one of the apps plays back music while not supporting background mode (such as a game app), it will be possible to playback music simultaneously from two apps, i.e. one supporting playback in background while the other is frontmost.\n", "Q: How to sync photos from iOS to MacBook just as songs sync from MacBook to iOS If I am at a camp site with no internet access, but with a wifi router, a macbook, and an iPhone, I can sync songs on iTunes from the macbook to the iPhone seamlessly.

You're traveling, for instance, and you'd like to backup the photos on your phone to your macbook, wirelessly (wifi/bluetooth), automatically (just as with iTunes), and without going through iCloud.

It all worked fine this time around.\n", "Q: How to remove an application update file? I was updating Xcode and macOS High Sierra at the same time. The OS restarted and then Xcode was in update \"paused\" state. I tried but couldn't restart/resume it so I deleted the app hoping it would be fixed. Now the app is removed but I still have that icon in my Launchpad.\n\nHow can I remove this?\n\nA: You can try these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Launchpad, press and hold the Option key. If you see a cross icon towards the top left side of the app (Xcode) icon, click on it.\n\n*Make sure that Xcode is really removed by checking for its absence in /Applications directory. Then restart your computer.\nEither one of the two steps should remove the icon from the Launchpad. You can install Xcode afresh thereafter.\n", "Q: Move Window by clicking on any part (as on Linux)? On Linux (or X in general), it's possible to move a window while holding down a modifier key (Alt+drag or Super+drag) and clicking on ANY part of the window.\nThis makes moving windows super easy, as one doesn't have to aim so well ;)\nOn macOS (High Sierra), this doesn't seem to be enabled/possible by default.\nHow do I enable this or what add on do I need?\n\nA: For High Sierra (macOS 10.13) or later:\nShortcut: Ctrl + Cmd + Click to move windows.\nRun below command in terminal to enable the shortcut. Restart after.\ndefaults write -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture -bool true   \n\nRun below command in terminal to disable the shortcut. Restart after.\ndefaults delete -g NSWindowShouldDragOnGesture\n\nReference: http://www.mackungfu.org/UsabilityhackClickdraganywhereinmacOSwindowstomovethem\n\nA: You can use the free utility called \"Easy Move+Resize\", which allows you to use Cmd + Ctrl + Left click anywhere inside a window to move it. The modifier keys can be customized so that you can choose for example Alt + Left click instead.\nYou can download the utility from here:\nhttps://github.com/dmarcotte/easy-move-resize\nRead under the heading \"Installation\".\n\nA: BetterTouchTool has worked for me forever for this with no hiccups. Still ok on Mojave Beta 18E184e. It's got lots of other useful stuff, none of which I've used.\n\nA: The best application for this is Zooom2. Unfortunately in 2016 the author shut down the project [1] and the only place to download it is off of 3rd party mirror sites [2]. Luckily it's still working in OS X High Sierra as of this writing. It's a shame that the author did not open source his work.\n[1] http://coderage-software.com/index.html\n[2] https://download.cnet.com/Zooom/3000-18487_4-126030.html\n", "Q: `AppleCamera` used by Google Chrome even with all extensions+apps disabled/tabs closed I'm noticing that Google Chrome (Version 65.0.3325.181 (Official Build) (64-bit) — current version as of writing this question) has enabled my MBP camera and, perhaps, the microphone:\n$ lsof | grep \"AppleCamera\"\nGoogle    1466 areynolds  txt       REG                1,6     354304 4305421720 /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AppleCamera\n$ ps -p 1466\n  PID TTY           TIME CMD\n 1466 ??         0:38.47 /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\n\nI have no tabs open (just one window, which defaults to https://www.google.com).

If relevant or useful, I am running OS X 10.13.4.\nEDIT\nPerhaps an alternative or more general question is: Given that this application is accessing the camera without permission, is there a way in OS X to block access to the AppleCamera device (or any particular device, generally) on a per-application level, as a general security measure? Is there a way to lock down OS X to this degree (perhaps via LDAP attributes used via OS X Server/Open Directory)?\n\nA: You have presumed too much from the software's name. The CoreMediaIO Device Abstraction Layer (DAL) Apple.Camera.plugin does not control the camera, and wouldn't know how to control it even if you gave it permission. It has one job: to manage video (and muxed) streams from video devices that are already streaming. With no hardware driver running in the kernel, there can be no power sent to the camera--no kext, no power, no picture: Apple Documentation\nSo, why is it running? It helps avoid a little wait time when it is called into actual use. It's been there for well over ten years, and if AppleCamera.plugin was a vector for intrusion, we'd have heard much sooner.\n", "Q: Change default key combination for backslash character on a German Mac keyboard? As pressing ⌥⇧7 keys simultaneously to type a backslash character (\\) on a German iMac (macOS High Sierra 10.13.4) keyboard is rather unhandy and painful I would like to know whether it is possible to change the key combination to something different, like ⌃7? Is there any way to achieve this without using any third-party application?\n\nA: If your macOS version is recent enough (Monterey or perhaps also Big Sur), you will find Apple has added an input source called German Standard where backslash is on Option ß.\n", "Q: Dock restarting continuously after High Sierra update I updated an iMac 2011 to High Sierra and now the dock and the upper bar disappear continuously and the wallpaper turns black. Just for a second, then all restart again. And it is happening all the time.

Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\n", "Q: Import/Send Gmail and Work Email to iCloud Online?

I plan to delete my gmail after that and I want to send my office emails from iCloud (preferably web interface) (as in myname@myoffice.com and not @iCloud.com).\nMy concern is I have way too much mail to clutter my Mac and I would just be happy to store the mails online and have access to them through the iCloud online mail interface (that is ultimately making iCloud my onestop goto for all my emails).\nIs that possible? If not what are my options?\nThanks.\n\nA: That's possible! The Mail app is great for keeping track of more than one email account and also has rule features, so if you're worried about clutter, you can set them to automatically get deleted. macOS also automatically clears space (if you allow it, Apple Logo up the top -> About This Mac -> Storage) after time.\n", "Q: Unable to partition a SDXC card using Disk Utility I have placed 200GB SanDisk card inside Nifty adapter and put it into SDXC slot in my Mac.\nI want to use it as permanent & encrypted storage.

Hey there fellow users,\nI purchased an iMac (Retina 5K, 27-Inch, 2017, macOS 10.13.4, 4.2 GHz, 32GB, 3TB Fusion Drive) less than three weeks ago, and had it delivered by Apple here in distant, little New Zealand.\nThe iMac itself and extended Magic Keyboard that I opted for work without issues, but the Magic Trackpad 2 that came with it is being horrendously troublesome. I've seen similar issues throughout forums, but I believe that this problem requires more attention from Apple and have additional details to put forward on my end that I cannot find matches for through Google searches.\nHopefully this can a) Help others out, and b) Get Apple's attention, which seems to be an impossible task even after spending thousands of dollars with a company that supposedly prides itself on service. I hate ranting, but it has its place. I have tried to post this on Apple Communities, but upon doing so am told the following, which didn't end up resolving itself:\n\nYour post could not be saved. Please try again in a few moments.\n\nSymptoms\n\n*\n\n*Starts to disconnect after four to eight hours of use (if it has not been used for an extended period prior to switching on).\n\n*Either ceases to click (through haptic feedback) and stays that way or continues to disconnect (stopping haptic feedback) and reconnect (re-enabling haptic feedback).\n\n*When the aforementioned ceasing-to-click occurs, the trackpad is still functional as a touch surface (mouse movement, multi-finger gestures), but is visibly laggy (as though the screen has a reduced refresh rate).\n\n*This behaviour occurs even though the trackpad is fully charged.\n\n*When the issue first started occurring, it could be solved by plugging the trackpad in via a lightning cable. This now has no effect for some reason, and the observed behaviour is the same whether plugged in or wireless. Plugging it in renders different output in Console.app which confirms that the iMac detects it as a USB device.\n\n*The issue remains after wirelessly connecting to a MacBook Air (11-Inch, Early 2015, macOS 10.13.3, 1.6GHz, 4GB, 120GB), and changing the location of both the Air and the trackpad does not change anything.\n\n*Turning the trackpad off and on immediately after this disconnection behaviour previously fixed the issue for about 15 minutes, but now only fixes it for 15 seconds, after which the previous behaviour recurs.\n\n*I can't confirm this as being consistent behaviour across attempts, but the iMac appears to cause the trackpad to simply stop working altogether, where the MacBook Air causes it to stop and then start repetitively.\n\n*Console logs seem to indicate that macOS tries to contact https://mesu.apple.com to update the trackpad, but fails to do so due to a 403 Forbidden response from the server. This also happens for my Magic Keyboard, but there are no observed issues when using it.\n\n*At one point when attached to the MacBook Air wirelessly, holding my finger down on the trackpad with enough force to normally make it click once, it would start clicking at about 15 clicks/second, with additional attempts sometimes causing about 7-8 clicks/second. Removing my finger from the trackpad stops this behaviour.\n\niMac Console.app\nNote: names have been replaced with (me)\nfud Stream event happened for filter: com.apple.mau.plugin.standalonehiddevice.trackpad.6.bt\nfud -[FudStateMachine isActive]: state=5 nextState=-1 filter=com.apple.mau.plugin.standalonehiddevice.trackpad.6.bt\nfud -[FudIpcDispatch dispatchStateMachineEvent:] -

I still think this has to do with failed firmware downloads, but Apple denies that's the case. It's only when the bluetooth peripherals disconnect that I see the attempt by fud (firmware update daemon). And they seem to fail.\nHere's the steps I've taken to troubleshoot this (and way too much of my time):\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a replacement 2018 MacBook Pro from Apple to replace the first machine that showed this issue.\n\n*Restore from a superduper image to the new machine.\n\n*New machine showed the same symptom, disconnect and reconnect of\nApple bluetooth peripherals.\n\n*Erase disk on old machine (still a 2018 MBP).\n\n*Install pristine 10.13.6.\n\n*Use the machine for a few hours with no external monitor, nor\nhandoff enabled. No symptoms.\n\n*Enable handoff after those few hours. Still no problem.\n\n*Connect to external monitor, symptom resurfaces after an hour or so\nof utilization.\n\n\nNext I'll be testing with no external monitor attached again. This time to see if the symptoms resurface or not. Hoping to eliminate the possibility of interference from USB-C external monitor connections in particular. (Note I'm using a Moshi USB-C to mini display port cable).\nIf it happens while disconnected from the monitor, then it's safe to say that it's not the problem.\nThen I'll test handoff on and off in isolation.\nBut, what I can say with 100% certainty is that it's not limited to individual machines, and it's not 3rd party software. This is an Apple issue one way or another, be it hardware or software.\n\nA: Hopefully this may help. I was having similar problems whereby my trackpad was connecting/disconnecting and being a general PITA. I searched all over and found this thread amongst others. I then also found the following article and noted about it could potentially be due to too many bluetooth connections. \nhttps://michaelkummer.com/technology/mac-bluetooth-issues-affect-keyboard-trackpad/\nI turned off bluetooth on my ipad which happened to be sat next to me and as if by magic my trackpad was fully functional again! \n\nA: I wanted to post my experience and my solution because I was pulling my hair out but was lucky enough to have two identical setups to test. I'm posting here because this is the first post I found when googling the question so maybe it will help someone else.\nTL;DR - It may be caused by interference from some other device that may not even have a radio. See the bold text below.\nI'm using a 2018 MB Pro 15 (same computer at both locations), 4k external monitor set 50mm off the work surface, Pok3r keyboard, Magic Trackpad 2 and a CalDigit DS3 Plus dock at hame and at the office. At home, my trackpad would disconnect all the time (4-5 times) for up to a minute. In that time the Mac would show connecting/disconnecting and the click would go away sometimes while this was going on. At work, this never happened.\nI went through removing the BT config, rebooting, and advice on Apple's Support page, etc.\nMoved my thunderbolt cable from the left to the right side port, tried different laptop orientations (flat on the desk, upright in a stand, rotated in different directions).\nI considered maybe my cellphone was an issue, the signal can be sketchy at home but I put it in airplane mode for an afternoon and still had issues. \nI swapped my trackpads between locations and the issue still happened at home but work was fine. So it was not the trackpad and the computer is the same...\nThe only other difference is the location of the CalDigit dock. At work, it was placed on the work surface but slightly behind my monitor, so it had no line of sight to the trackpad. At home it was to the left and it had line of sight to my trackpad. I placed a small metal box between the trackpad and the CalDigit dock and have been issue free for a week.\nMaybe you don't have this particular device but my advice is look around in your environment and see if there is anything that can be causing electrical interference.\n\nA: So I had this problem and it was driving me crazy. My modem has a 2.4GHz and 5GHz WIFI network.\nThe random disconnects only happened when I was connected to the 2.4GHz WIFI network. The problem did not happen on the 5GHz network.\nHope this helps whoever runs into this problem.\n\nA: First of all, I'd like to thank all that contributed answers to this question.\nAt the end of the day, much to my surprise, it seems like it was a hardware fault of the trackpad from factory. As a result, they fixed it free of charge within a week or so.\nAs awesome as it would be to be able to fix problems like this with testing procedures as seen in the other answers, Apple (intentionally) runs a black-box business model, making this hard to do.\n\nA: Well, I had the same problems on My Macbook Pro 2018 with randomly disconnecting magic touchpad and keyboard. I found a resolution here: https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/9brybd/issues_with_disconnecting_mouse/\nSo the problem is with USB type-c concentrator: if it is connected to the left side ports - it causes random disconnects of Bluetooth devices. If it connected to the right ports - wireless mouse and keyboard work stable without disconnects for me. \n\nA: My 2018 Mac mini had the same problem. It also has an external monitor connected to the USB-c port closest to the HDMI port. The monitor took at least 60 seconds to wake up after sleep, sometimes I had to push the power button.\nMoving to another USB-c port fixed both problems.\n\nA: Turning off bluetooth on an iPad and an iPhone in the same room as my Mac Book Pro/trackPad 2 fixed the issue for me. Probably to do with iOS update changes to bluetooth.\n\nA: Had the same problem. Switched to ethernet cable instead of 2.4 ghz wifi, problem - gone.\nOddly enough, that problem didn't affect my magic mouse 2 and magic keyboard 2.\nAlso, make sure that you don't connect more than 3 bluetooth devices to your mac. I had magic mouse 2, magic keyboard 2, magic trackpad 2 and a bluetooth headset connected all at once, so, 4 devices. That caused my headset's sound to cut out. As soon as I would disconnect either the trackpad or the mouse, the sound would be alright.\nBluetooth sucks sometimes. You just gotta feel it out and remove all possible causes of interference. \nGood luck to you!\n", "Q: Center an element which is \"inline with text\" In Pages it is possible to center an element (such as an image, a table, etc.) whose \"Object Placement\" has been made \"Move with Text\" and \"Text Wrap\" setting into \"Inline with text\"? When I click the image, table, or chart, I see no option in the format styles panel to center the element.\nThe only way I can see myself doing this is by adding spaces or tab characters before the image or table, but this doesn't seem like a nice way to do it (although it should be okay as long as the page size/margins stay constant).

One will be a server (the master that runs your programs, can be PC or iMac in some of these utilities) and the other will be the client (the target that will be the extended display of the other).  iMacs, PCs and some Android tablets and phones can be used.  Some programs are free, some have a trial period of a few minutes, then you buy, some are a few dollars.  Another choice is a remote screen view utility like TeamViewer or other VNC that will let you see the PC on the iMac screen or vice versa.

Long story short, an old LaCie drive failed spectacularly and I meant to replace it with two, LaCie d2 6TB Thunderbolt 3 drives running RAID 1. I use SoftRaid. I have an iMac Pro.\n\n\n*\n\n*SoftRaid recognized the drives, but wouldn't use them to build a RAID 1 volume because of some voodoo LaCie does that makes it look externally like there's only a few MB available.\n\n*The only thing SoftRaid would allow me to do is delete the 6TB volume on each drive. Which I did. Now nothing recognizes the drives at all.\n\n*Softraid started doing its \"reinstall driver and restart\" endless loop. No problem, I thought. Just disconnect all of my SoftRaid volumes, boot into Recovery Mode and use Startup Security Utility to turn off Secure Boot.\n\n*Tried to run Startup Security Utility. Tells me that there are no administrator accounts (?) so it won't let me load it.\n\n*Deleted .AppleSetupDone and reinstalled High Sierra, went through setup and created a new admin account, following Googled instructions. No difference.\n\n*Tried booting into Single User Mode to see if I could terminal-foo my way out of it. Hangs after an \"AdjustBusy timeout in 40000ms!\" so I could never get to a command prompt.\n\n\nSo at the moment, I'm at a loss. I can't load Startup Security Utility, and I think my road to recovery begins there. Really want to avoid the whole 2-day format/restore cycle. Any ideas?\n\nA: As I'm sure you know, troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience. \nThe first thing I would do is remove any non-Apple hardware (if connected) and try again. If this makes no difference, then I would proceed with resetting the NVRAM of your iMac Pro.\nHow to reset NVRAM on an iMac Pro\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a firmware password, first disable it before proceeding\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac Pro\n\n*Switch on your iMac Pro\n\n*Immediately press and hold the OptionCommandPR keys. \n\n*Keep the keys down until after the Apple logo appears and disappears for the second time. \n\n*Allow your iMac Pro to finish booting up. (NOTE: Upon reboot you may need to reconfigure some of your System Preferences (e.g. sound volume, display resolution, startup disk selection, time zone, etc).\n\n*Now reboot your iMac Pro and use the Command + R keys to boot into Recovery Mode and see if you can get the Startup Security Utility to work.\n\n\nIf this works, all good! If not, let's investigate Single User Mode again.\nSingle User Mode\nSince your iMac Pro itself seems to be running fine in normal usage, another thing to investigate is the issue you're having booting into Single User Mode. Some additional things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a firmware password you must disable it first. You can't boot into Single User Mode (or Verbose Mode either) with a firmware password enabled. So, if you have one, disable it and try again (I suspect if you had one it'd be disabled anyway if you followed my steps for resetting the NVRAM, but just wanted to be thorough and mention it again).\n\n*If you didn't have a firmware password, or if disabling it doesn't work, then try booting into Verbose Mode instead. The process is the same, except that you're holding down the command + V keys instead. Verbose Mode is actually a normal boot, except that you're seeing a description on screen as to what's actually happening during the boot process. You'll know you're in verbose mode when you start seeing white text on a black screen. \n\n\nIf you can boot into Single User Mode, great! If not, let us know if you see anything of interest when booting via Verbose Mode. \nAbout the AdjustBusy timeout error\nThe AdjustBusy timeout error while booting into Single User Mode is interesting and one of the reasons I asked at the outset for you to remove any non-Apple hardware. Typically this relates to an IOService (don't worry about the technicalities - it's basically just referring to input/output devices and drivers).\nAnyway, if you're still seeing this error, I would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your iMac Pro normally\n\n*Launch the Terminal app (found within your Applications > Utilites folder)\n\n*Type (or copy and paste) the following command:\n\n\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\n\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Within moments Terminal will list all 3rd party kernel extensions (Note: you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). \n\n\nThe above process is used to identify any 3rd party extensions you have installed. While this is a list of all 3rd party kernel extensions, I'm interested specifically in anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you no longer use. Also look out for anything that could be related in some way to LaCie hardware (either current or old) or to SoftRaid.\nLet me know if there's anything of interest.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse arrow briefly gets stuck at random places on screen As I move my mouse around the screen it will briefly get stuck at random points then start moving again. This doesn't happen on the MacBook Pro trackpad...only when I have a Magic Mouse connected. This also happens most often on the left 1/4 of the screen when coming from the right side of the screen or trying to transition from the lower to upper half of the screen.\nThis started happening right after Security Update 2018-002 for Sierra 10.12.6.\nRestarting hasn't fixed it.\nMy cursor size in Accessibility > Display is normal.\n\nA: I have found that sometimes the surface you're mousing on can have surface qualities that alter the reflectance of the mouse's IR beam and this can affect the cursor behavior. Study the mousing surface to see if any part of the area that maps to the screen has a change in color or texture as this can contribute the the behavior you're observing. \nOtherwise, you can try to reset your mouse by unpairing it, removing its batteries (if its an older Magic Mouse) then reseating the batteries & re-pairing again with your computer.\n", "Q: Avoiding Spotlight to spin up external drive I have Mac Mini with an external hard drive. The external drive is indexed with Spotlight. Whenever I use Spotlight to start an app on the local machine, the external drive spins up, because obviously Spotlight wants to check the spotlight files on the external drive for search hits. The drive makes an audible noise, and stays running for some five minutes until it idles to a stop.\nIs there any way around this, apart from disabling Spotlight or disconnecting the drive? Obviously, I understand that Spotlight must access the spotlight files to check for search hits, and can't tell the difference if I want to launch an app or find a file, when I just type \"Sa\" for Safari.\nThe only cure I could think of was if the entire spotlight database was cached in memory, or was placed on the local hard drive, or if I used a different hotkey for finding files and launching apps.\n\nA: Yes, this is pretty annoying behavior, especially if you have multiple hard drives connected to your Mac, and to my knowledge there is no way to prevent Spotlight from doing it.\nFortunately, most app launchers such as LaunchBar, Alfred, Butler, Quicksilver, etc. maintain cached file databases, so they don't spin up all your drives whenever you use them to launch an app or to search for a file. They also have a ton of other useful features. I personally would recommend Alfred or LaunchBar.\n\nA: I didn't look into the app for a while, but what about Alfred ? I'm sure there is a way to disable indexing for the drive. (or make it spin only when actually needing a file located there)\n\nA: In System Preferences and Spotlight (Privacy tab), you can configure Spotlight to prevent accessing certain drives or paths.\n\n", "Q: Downloading HTML Entities guide on TextWrangler for Mac TextWrangler for Mac does not have an HTML Entities palette built in to easily put  special characters and symbols into your code.

Bare Bones software no longer updates it or supports it.\nYou might want to look into BBEdit, the grandfather of Mac code editors. BBEdit has a free mode where certain features are not available. I've been using it since the \"Classic Mac OS\" days so I am not sure what the pulled features are in the free version. But BBEdit does have exactly what you are looking for, it's a fabulous bit of Mac code.

When the above script runs, however, the periods look like backspaces. End result:\n\nIn a Windows VM, . renders a period in Notepad (like normal). When the above script runs, however, the periods seem to be ignored completely. End result:\n\nQuestions\nIs there a way to truly emulate pressing the keys from a string of characters in AppleScript? Because clearly the above way isn't doing that.\nDoes anyone know why the behavior I described above is happening? Why does this work in TextMate and Terminal, and other mac apps, but not in Fusion VMs?\n\nA: I don't understand why this isn't working, however I do have a fix. I figured out that doing tell application \"System Events\" to key code 47 sends a period correctly.\nSo, I wrapped my read into a conditional like this:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    #set input_file to \"/path/to/file\"\n    #set file_text to read input_file\n    set file_text to \"test: ... hello ...\"\n    delay 0.3\n    repeat with ch in file_text\n        if ch as string = \".\" then\n            tell application \"System Events\" to key code 47\n        else\n            tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke ch\n        end if\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n", "Q: Can I connect two 27 inch (Thunderbolt-2) mac monitors to a 13\" 2016 Macbook Pro with touch bar?

To maintain a consistent user environment, both machines run the same macOS, currently Sierra 10.12.6.\nContacts, Safari bookmarks, Calendar, Keychain, and Find My Mac are synced using iCloud; I use no other iCloud service. My email is IMAP, and thus synched by my ISP's server. \nThe two computers are synched over an Ethernet connection using ChronoSync (on the MBP) and ChronoAgent (on the MBA). This synchs the computer's Desktop folders, my Documents folder, and Photos. I do this just before travel, and just after return.

Left click does not work at all, unless you press it very hard at the very corner and hold it there for a while until it registers, although it worked a little sporadically yesterday, worked completely normal the day before.\nThe computer was manufactured mid-2013, but the battery was in 2016 and replaced mid-2017 - that's all the modifications done to it.\nI'm guessing it's a hardware problem, but the clicking sound and feel is completely normal.\nAny ideas about what is at fault and how to fix it?\n\nA: The 2013 MBP has still the mechanical trackpad. Check if the trackpad is stressed physically in some way. When the battery swells it happens that the trackpad stops registering clicks, because it can not be pressed.\n\nA: I'd try an external mouse to confirm that the left-click issue you face is within the trackpad. \nI suppose it may be physically possible to repair a trackpad, but I've never read of anyone who's done so, nor seen instructions. Thus, if the trackpad is partially failing, you can either live with the intermittency, take the computer to an Apple store or service provider to replace the trackpad, or following the iFixit instructions (these are for a 13\" MBA), replace it yourself.\n", "Q: How can I stop applications from preventing restarts? I have some applications that routinely prevent restarts from happening correctly (most often iTerm2 and Slack, though others participate as well). When I request a Restart, these applications will present an \"Are you sure?\" dialog and halt the restart process.\nThis annoying most of the time, but especially so when I've requested system updates to install overnight and I instead waste the first several minutes of my day after clicking \"Yes I'm sure\" and then allowing the reboot to proceed.\nIs it possible to tell OSX to always reboot when requested and never stop for user input?\n\nA: If you insist to not save any work, open terminal and run sudo shutdown -r now\nYou could force the updates as well before issuing the restart with softwareupdate -ai and never see an “Are you sure?” or “Save this data?” dialog since the shutdown command sends SIGKILL which kills as opposed to asking nicely for programs to exit. \nBack up your files, the filesystem will be safe but your data in specific files won’t necessarily be safe. \n", "Q: Is it possible to clone directories in APFS? APFS supposedly\n\nfeatures cloning for files and directories \n\nI would like to figure out how this works, but I can't find a way to use this feature.\nThe only man page which seems vaguely relevant is clonefile(2), which says:\n\nIf src names a directory, the directory hierarchy is cloned as if each\n  item was cloned individually.  However, the use of copyfile(3) is more\n  appropriate for copying large directory hierarchies instead of\n  clonefile(2)\n\nBut when you check the man page for copyfile(3), it says:\n\nNote also that there is no support for cloning directories: if a\n  directory is provided as the source, an error will be returned.  (This\n  is only applicable for the copyfile() function.)\n\nThis is further clarified further down the page:\n\nBecause copyfile() does not allow the cloning of directories, a\n  recursive clone will instead copy any directory it finds (while\n  cloning its contents).\n\nNonetheless, a few blog posts on the subject seem to imply that Finder can perform this operation using option + mouse drag, but when I test it here, it seems identical to a recursive copy, and isn't even cloning the contained files, let alone the directory.\nSo what's the deal here? Is the feature implemented at all? If it is, how do I get it to work? Or is it something they implemented in the on-disk format but never hooked into any APIs or tools?\n\nA: clonefile() is the system call that you're interested in. It was introduced in macOS 10.12 (Sierra), coinciding with the public beta release of APFS.\ncopyfile() is a C library function that was introduced in Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard). As you have seen in the manpage, while it does support file cloning, this is not the default behaviour.\nI am not sure why clonefile(2) states that \"the use of copyfile(3) is more appropriate for copying large directory hierarchies instead of clonefile(2)\" — I can only guess that it is for efficiency reasons. Regardless, both APIs will allow you to clone files without duplicating any file extents on disk.\nI can confirm that, at least for me, macOS 10.15 (Catalina) does clone large files when \"copying\" them in Finder, whether using CMD-C and CMD-V, or ALT-drag-and-drop. The same is true for directories, in the sense described in clonefile(2). That is, all directories involved are copied (new inodes and dentries will appear on disk), and all files involved are cloned.\nIt's worth noting that, in order to comply with POSIX, cp is required to make non-clone copies (duplicate the file extents on disk), but using it with the -c flag will override this behaviour and clone files via clonefile() instead — see cp(1). The behaviour is identical to that of the Linux cp flag --reflink, which you might be familiar with if you use ZFS or similar.\nThus, cp -Rc is what you're looking for if you want to clone directories on the terminal. I am not sure when this flag was introduced, but it was likely alongside the release of clonefile() in macOS 10.12.

Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\nA final word\nFinally, as an aside, MBP models usually range from about 40ºC (104ºF) to 100ºC (212ºF) depending on whether the CPU is idle or under load.

When I bought it, it came with Sierra installed, and when High Sierra was released I made a clean install but formatted my Fusion Drive to APFS. I had some problems but finally I got the 10.13.3 working properly. Now when I try to update to the 10.13.4 it simply doesn't update. Nor via Apple Store, not via downloading the whole installer of the update. And when I try to reinstall the whole system via a thumb drive I receive the “an error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again” message. I have already corrected the date but even though it doesn't install. Any suggestions?\n\nA: FWIW I had huge problems running 10.13.2 thru 10.13.4. I'm on an Apple RAID that's HFS+ formatted. But apparently Apple suddenly dropped support for all RAID, even their own. Very annoying. Fusion is not a raid but it's kind of raid-like in many ways, I can see how that could cause the same problem I've been dealing with. The update runs through the whole process, everything seems to work, then it reboots and is still on the old OS. \nBut here's how I finally had to upgrade my system: I had to clone my boot drive (the striped RAID) to a USB drive. Boot off that USB drive, and run all system software updates. They worked fine off a single, normal drive. Then I cloned back to my RAID volume. And obnoxious solution for sure, but it worked in my case, it may work for you. \n\nA: Google tells me Fusion Drives & APFS are not the best of friends.

I just added a new contact to my iPhone. When I look at the contact page there's a FaceTime icon (Under, next to that person's phone number). Does that mean that this person has an iPhone?\n\nA: Broadly speaking, the presence of FaceTime row in a contact's screen means that the contact is registered with FaceTime service, which by extension means that the person uses/used one or more Apple products (Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod), which support FaceTime calling.\nThe person may or may not have an iPhone. Person's Apple ID is used to register with FaceTime. An email address is required to create an Apple ID. The mobile number gets registered/linked to the Apple ID if used with an iPhone where the user has logged in with his Apple ID.\n\n\nA: Yes, this FaceTime row means they can be contacted with FaceTime.\n\n", "Q: Why is Illustrator throttled to 2% speed when it's in the background? I regularly run a .jsx script in Adobe Illustrator that saves a bunch of files in a particular format.\n\n\n*\n\n*while Illustrator is the active app, running the script on 5 files takes 23 seconds.\n\n*When Illustrator is not the foremost app, running the script on 5 files takes more than 5 minutes.\n\n*According to Activity Monitor, Illustrator is using around 75% of the CPU when in the foreground but is throttled to less than 2% when in the background.\n\n*According to Activity Monitor, App Nap is not being used.\nWhy is this happening, and is there a way to change it?\nI would like to be able to do other tasks while waiting for Illustrator. As it stands, I am obliged to keep Illustrator in the foreground.\nSome things I have tried: I knew that\nsudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0\n\nworked to accelerate Time Machine backups, so I though it might help in this case. It had no effect.\nI also tried disabling App Nap:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES\n\nIt had no effect.\nI tried TinkerTool, but I believe that it's just a GUI to change the lowpri_throttle_enabled setting. It had no effect.\n\nA: This appears to be be an Adobe issue; specifically, the code-base for AI is not multi-threaded.\nI was able to find a discussion in the Adobe forums that addresses your exact issue - Make Illustrator multi threaded on CPU\n\nIllustrator performance is awful, its slow and lumbering at all but the most basic operations. It is bound to only a single cpu thread which is ridiculous now in an age of multi core and multi thread CPU's and it has been this way for many years. It cannot handle background tasks and is completely out of parity in function and performance with other Adobe software such as Photoshop and inDesign.\n\nEmphasis mine\nUnfortunately, if the code cannot support background CPU operations, there's nothing you can do from your Mac's perspective to speed things up.  As the users in the forum all (begrudgingly) accept, the only solution is to wait for an update from Adobe.\nWhy this is so\nGenerally speaking, applications in the background are \"paused\" - technically, they are given low priority.  What this means is that execution stops until the CPU has an opportunity to execute some more commands; usually during an IO fetch operation.  Managing this process is called \"CPU Scheduling\" and is something the hardware handles for you - the application just has to allow it (relinquish control).\nA common misconception of multi-threading is that things execute faster.  This is not the case, it's just more things happen simultaneously making better use of the CPU resources.  It's like having a single taxi (people carrier) shuttling people between an airport and a conference center versus four doing the shuttling.  They're all going the same speed, it's just now you're moving more.\nThe application being \"multi-thread capable\" allows the hardware to manage and schedule CPU time and being that there's more CPU that can be allocated, the background jobs get more resources to get the job done.\n\nA: This answer is from Mordy Golding, Product Manager for Adobe Illustrator (2001-2004), at Quora:\nVector graphics have their advantages and disadvantages. This, sadly, is one of the downsides. That's because vector graphics are drawn in a linear stacking order.\nTake one simple example -- take a single layer with a single rectangle. Duplicate that layer 100 times. Even though only the top layer is visible, illustrator draws each rectangle from the bottom most layer to the top. Illustrator can't draw layer 50 until the previous 49 are done. This is unlike photoshop that is just concerned with which pixels are ultimately visible.\nExtending the concept further. Say you had 4 cores. You could take a photoshop file and split it into a grid of 4 areas and tell each core to draw 1 area -- all at the same time. That's because a pixel in one grid has no impact whatsoever on pixels in another grid area. Since you can split a photo into multiple independent areas, you can assign multiple cores to render each area simultaneously.\nHowever, in illustrator, each object is drawn in the order it appears in the stacking order. So if I split an image into a grid of four, I still have to build all art object by object no matter what grid it is in. Meaning all 4 cores would still have to wait until all objects were drawn before rendering.\nWhat this means is that only some kinds of functions can support multi-core functionality in Illustrator. For example, if you print a large file, illustrator will hand the print spooling off to another core and return you back to your document to continue working immediately. But sadly, this isn't possible for speeding up linear tasks like drawing/rendering art.\n", "Q: What are all the available ACL attributes in Mac OS 10.13 High Sierra? In Mac OS, file and folder access permissions are managed in a layered way with basic unix (POSIX) style: owner/group/everyone and read/write/execute modes along with, recently added Access Control Lists (ACL) for additional access control.\nBoth the POSIX and ACL controls can be managed from the command line with the traditional unix command chmod. For example:\nMac:~> sudo chmod -R +a \"staff allow list,addfile,search,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,writesecurity,chown,file_inherit,directoryinherit\" path/to/folder*\n\nWhat is the comprehensive list of all ACL attributes which are settable in Mac OS 10.13 (High Sierra)?

All to no avail.\nAny way to diagnose this?\n\nA: WiFi by it's nature is generally going to be slower then most any wired network. Not only do you share the bandwidth with everything else attached to that WiFi access point, but you can also get slowed down by your relative position in relation to the antennas and what is between you and the antennas (Walls, steel, sheet-rock, whole buildings, etc.)\nFirst it would be helpful to know what the make and model of the WiFi hardware is that you are connecting to, where you are in relation to the device and what is between you and the device.\nAlso you may want to try a different access point. Possibly at work, a friend's house, a local coffee shop or other public location with WiFi.\nWith WiFi there are a lot of variables and before you go looking into problems with your Mac (possible but less likely than other things) you need to see if the problem exists connecting to other access points or even if just moving closer to your current one solves it.\nAdditionally I would be tempted to look in both /Library/Preferences and ~/Library/Preferences for any network/WiFi related preference file. Delete them and reboot. Then set up your networks again: you might have a damaged prefs file.\n\nA: FWIW - it's also worth looking through the settings on the wifi base station / router - are there QoS rules being applied which throttle that MAC address (the NIC ID) and don't throttle the android device?

It's a pretty vanilla system other than being a bit on the older side.\n\nA: Define \"Legacy Mac\" we will need the model to make an educated guess.\nI have an older iMac that (just barely) supported Sierra, but once Sierra was installed it became so sluggish as to be practically unusable.

The reason that I don't want to actually quit the program and start it again is that I don't want to lose the history, ie the print of the previous commands and outputs. (Compare to clear in MATLAB, that gets rid of all variables, function definitions et.c. that you've set in that session without removing the print of previous commands and outputs.)\nThe usual advice people get when asking this is\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nHowever, for example, this doesn't restore $PATH to the value it has when the terminal program is first opened. I have a few lines like\nexport PATH=$PATH:/path/to/some/useful/stuff/\n\nin my $PATH and for every time I source, more stuff is added to my $PATH variable. Hence it is not reset to terminal startup value on source.\nSame thing goes for any other variable set in that session that is not overwritten by some line in the ~/.bash_profile\nI've seen people recommend the reset command too. However, that doesn't restore my $PATH to it's original value either. It stays the same as before the reset.\nI am just using $PATH as an example here, the question is about resetting the whole shell environment.\nA quick and reliable way to reset the shell environment in the sense I describe above would be very handy when experimenting with installations and similar things. Also seeing what the $PATH variable looks like makes me wonder what other things are not reset using source ~/.bash_profile, and it feels unreliable to use as a reset method.\nThank you for reading this far!\nAny solutions folks?\n\nA: One option for resetting the Terminal session's state except for history is to save the current history to a temp file with something like history -w ~/.history_temp, then close the Terminal window, open a new one, then read back the saved history with history -w ~/.history_temp. Optionally, you can delete the temp history file when you're done.\nIf you don't want to have to remember & type those commands every time, you can create aliases for them and put those in ~/.bash_profile:\nalias savehistory='history -w ~/.history_temp`\nalias loadhistory='history -r ~/.history_temp && rm ~/.history_temp`\n\n\nA: Setting the original path in a variable at the start of your terminal session would be a simple solution.\nORIG_PATH=\"$PATH\"\n\nThen at anytime you can change the PATH variable back to its original state.\nPATH=\"$ORIG_PATH\"\n\nA more complex solution would be to set the PATH to the state set by the loginwindow app then run path_helper as in /private/etc/profile and source ~/.bash_profile.\n# Does launchd set the PATH variable?\n\nLPATH=$(launchctl getenv PATH)\n\nif [ -z \"$LPATH\" ]\nthen\n    PATH=$(getconf PATH)\n    eval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)\nelse\n    PATH=$LPATH\n    eval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)\nfi\n\n. ~/.bash_profile\n\nBoth solutions do not require a new terminal session.\n", "Q: Backing up external hard drive shared by two macs to network share without duplication In my household, there is a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, both of which backup to a NAS via Time Machine. There is also a portable external hard drive that we use for storing large media files. I would like the external hard drive to backup to the NAS when it's connected to either laptop, without duplicating files on the backup. Is this possible?\nThe only solution I can think of would be to have one machine exclude half the contents of the external drive from backups and have the other machine exclude the other half, so each machine's backup sparsebundle would include half the contents of the external drive, but that's a terribly inelegant solution.\n\nA: Another solution is don't use time machine for this type of backup.\nI use Chronosync (a GUI for sync) and in this case the scheduler would just skip the sync if the volume is not available. If it is available it would sync the drive to the NAS. You could also use Carbon Copy Cloner for this function.\nIf you feel comfortable with the terminal and you don't want to pay the money for Chronosync or its ilk, then rsync and chron could also be used.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Since we're talking about Time Machine, if it was me I'd only have the external drive backed up when it's connected to the Mac it's usually connected to. I know this isn't really what you're asking, but I believe it to be your safest option (mainly because it's simpler and you've got less room for human error). And, from my experience, external hard drives usually find themselves connected to one machine more than others.\nHowever, if you find that the external drive is regularly connected to either Mac for prolonged periods and you're really needing it to be backed up regardless of the Mac it's connected to, then your terribly inelegant solution is really the only way to go. If so, you may want to rethink your file structure so that it's easy to \"split\" the contents being backup up by each respective Mac. (Assuming, of course, it's not already easy to split things up).\nFor example, you could split your media files into two main folders (one for backing up via the MacBook Pro and the other by the MacBook Air). Of course, these folders may have any number of subfolders.\nAnother example could be that all files are grouped into folders labelled as 0-9, A-M and N-Z (or whatever works for you).\nRegardless, the idea is to make it easy for you to split them up within your Time Machine settings so that it's very clear which one(s) are backed up by one Mac, and which ones are backed up by the other Mac. Then you just keep organising your files within these folders as you need.\n", "Q: Finder's \"Date Added\" vs. \"Date Created\" I would like to know what does Finder's \"Date Added\" mean exactly (added to where?), and how does it compare to the \"Date Created\" (coming from Windows, there isn't something similar there to \"Date Added\").\nThanks!\n\nA: Put simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Date Added refers to when the item was added to the directory in question.\n\n*Date Created refers to when the item was actually created.\n\n\nThe best way to explain this is to use the example of a screenshot.

Has anyone tried this? Does the Ultrafine scale up the resolution satisfactorily?\n\nA: According to this article at Apple.com it should be possible to hook up an external display to an iOS device.\nThe only question that remains is if hooking up a couple of adapters in series will actually work.

My SSD has 250 GB free space and it has a single APFS container with a single APFS Volume. How can I fix this? \nThe computer is a late 2012 Mac Miniand it has a 16GB RAM and a primary SSD (512GB) and a secondary HDD (1TB).\nI would like to install Windows 10 to the primary SSD. \nThe output for \ndiskutil apfs list \n\n\nThe output for \ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 limits\n\n\n\nA: This answer is not finished. Please do not edit!\nThis answer is based on the accepted answer to the question \"Boot Camp Assistance is stuck on create a partition?\". Modifications were made to include improvements suggested by user128216 to this answer. \nBased on the lack of posted questions regarding using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows, I have assumed most users are successfully installing Windows on drives containing APFS partitions. When the Boot Camp Assistant fails, generally the problem is not with the Boot Camp Assistant, but rather with the APFS container. So, the usual solution is to backup your stuff, wipe the drive, and reload everything.   \nHowever, if you wish to install Windows without using the Boot Camp Assistant (except for creating the USB installation flash drive), you need to first determine how much space is available for Windows. This can be determined from the output of the command diskutil apfs resizecontainer diskXsY limits, where X is the drive number identifier and Y is the partition number of the APFS container.\nThese are the basic steps needed to install Windows 10 for an EFI boot.\n\nNote: To get a better view of the images shown below, either click on an image or open an image in a new window.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant application to copy the Windows 10 installation files and the Boot Camp Support Software to a 16 GB or larger flash drive. A USB 3.0 flash drive would operate considerably faster than a USB 2.0 flash drive.\n\n*The command below will create the 70 GB \"BOOTCAMP\" partition on your internal SSD drive. The space occupied by this partition will be used for installing Windows.\nsudo  diskutil  apfs  resizeContainer  disk0s2  180.8G  FAT32  BOOTCAMP  70G\n\n\n*If you have not already done so, insert the flash drive containing the Windows 10 installation files and the Boot Camp Support Software.\n\n*Use the command shown below to rename the AutoUnattend.xml file. \nmv  /volumes/WINSTALL/AutoUnattend.xml  /volumes/WINSTALL/NoAutoUnattend.xml\n\n\n*Next, you need to boot from the volume where the Windows installation files reside. Hold down the option key immediately after restarting on your Mac. Release the option when the Startup Manager window appears. Select the icon labeled \"EFI boot\". Next, select the arrow below the \"EFI boot\" label.\n\n*Open a Windows Command Prompt window, by following the procedure outlined in this step. Below is an image of what is initially displayed by the Windows 10 installer. Select \"Next\".\n\nIn the image shown below, select \"Repair your computer\".\n\nIn the image shown below, select \"Troubleshoot\".\n\nIn the image shown below, select \"Command Prompt\".\n\nThe result should be the image shown below.\n\n\n*Use the command diskpart to finish partitioning disk0. The commands you need to enter are given below. \n\nNote: Sometimes it can take a while for the diskpart command to produce the first prompt. Be patient.\n\ndiskpart\nlist  volume\n\nFrom the output of the command list volume, determine the number for the volume with the label \"BOOTCAMP\". In this example, I will assume the number is 0. Your number could be different. The next command selects this partition.\nselect  volume  0\n\nThe next commands effect the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume. The format is changed to NTFS. Next, the size is shrunk by 600 MB.\nformat  fs=ntfs  label=BOOTCAMP  quick\nshrink  desired=600\n\nCreate a Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) partition.

Take note of the drive letter (Ltr) for the volume with label \"WINSTALL\". In this example, I will assume the letter is D. Your letter could be different.\nlist  volume\n\nThe command below quits the command diskpart.\nexit\n\n\n*Enter the command below to start the Windows installation. If the drive letter, for the \"WINSTALL\" volume, is not D, then make the appropriate substitute when entering the command below.\nsetup  /unattend:D:\\NoAutoUnattend.xml\n\n\n*When a window similar to what is shown below appears, select the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition, then click on the \"Next\" button.\n\n\n*Continue with the installation of Windows 10. If the computer boots back to macOS, goto System Preferences and select Windows as your startup disk. Restart the computer to continue initializing Windows 10.\n\n*When finished, the Windows Support Software installer should automatically launch. If this does not occur, use the Windows File Explorer to open the Windows Support Software application named \"Setup\". This application can be found in the \"BootCamp\" folder on the \"WINSTALL\" drive. After the installer application completes, allow the computer to restart.\nIf asked, I can clarify any of the above steps.\n\nA: Do you have FileVault enabled? If you do, try to turn it off before attempting to create the partition again. FileVault is known to cause issues in the resizing of APFS/HFS+ partitions necessary to create space for a windows partition.\nIf what mentioned above doesn't work, try to first install without the secondary HDD mounted. If this doesn't work, try to back up with Time Machine, restore from backup in recovery mode (restart Mac while holding down ⌘+R to initiate recovery mode) to the backup. This may seem counter-intuitive, but in reality this is wiping the boot drive, reformatting it, and reinstalling MacOS with the same backup you got before.

The description for the Apple Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter on the Apple store website even says this adapter does not support DisplayPort video.\nI don't see an Apple adapter for USB-C/DisplPort to DVI-D but there is an adapter for USB-C/DisplyPort to HDMI.  https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUF82AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter\nThe adapter doesn't have a DVI-D port but passive adapter cables to HDMI are inexpensive and available from a number of reputable dealers.  DVI-D and HDMI are in many ways the same thing with a different connector.\nThere's many ways to solve this problem.  One thing to look out for is passive DisplayPort to HDMI or DVI-D adapters, they only work on DisplayPort ports with HDMI/DVI backward compatibility built in, which Apple may not support.  Active adapters work on all DisplayPort ports, and often support higher resolutions but they cost more.  If your display has only DVI-D then the higher resolutions may not concern you as DVI-D is more limited than HDMI or DisplayPort.\nGiven the age of DVI there's not likely to be a solution available that doesn't stack two adapters together.  The safest path is likely a USB-C to HDMI dock or adapter, and then a passive HDMI to DVI cable.\n", "Q: Run cron script at wakeup I would like to run a script at wakeup.

According to this article thunderbolt supports dual-mode DisplayPort (DP++), which in turn supports passive converters.\nSo theoretically I can buy a passive mini-displayport to HDMI or DVI converter, and connect to my monitor and it should work. Is this assumption correct?\nI ask because I bought two converters, one for HDMI and one for DVI, but neither of them worked. My monitor just does not detect any signal. So I want to double-check my assumption.\n\nA: The asker's own answer clarifies that a BenQ BL2420PT monitor was what wouldn't work with the passive adapters. That monitor has a native resolution of 2560x1440, which requires either DisplayPort, dual-link DVI, or HDMI 1.3&plus; (the monitor might still work with single-link DVI or HDMI 1.2− if the MacBook is set to output a resolution of 1920x1200 or lower):\n\n\n*\n\n*The MacBook Air (Early 2014, both the 11-inch and 13-inch models) supports up to 2560x1600 over DisplayPort. So if the DisplayPort input on the monitor isn't already occupied, the cheapest and/or least confusing solution might be to use a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.\n\n*Passive DisplayPort to dual-link DVI adapters do not exist due to DisplayPort's limited number of pins. There are active DisplayPort to dual-link DVI adapters available, and these require the use of a dual-link cable:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*For HDMI, there are both active and passive adapters available which support HDMI 1.3+, however one vendor adapter (Plugable) claims:\n\nWhen outputting a TMDS (DVI/HDMI) signal through Dual-Mode, most DisplayPort sources as well as the inexpensive passive adapters on the market are limited to a 165MHz clock rate. This limited clock rate generally limits the maximum resolution to 1920×1200 and reduces the maximum available color-depth to preserve the limited bandwidth.\nSome mid-range DP -> HDMI adapters such as the Plugable MDPM-HDMIF are capable of operating at up to 300MHz, but ultimately they are still reliant upon the Dual-Mode functionality of the host to transmit the TMDS signal required for HDMI/DVI displays.\n\nSo your passive HDMI adapter might be one that is limited to 1920x1200. Nor is it clear from the many existing questions† on this topic whether the MacBook Air can output more than 1920x1200 over dual-mode DisplayPort.\n† to name a few: Can a MacBook Air support 2560x1600 output via HDMI using a Mini DisplayPort/Thunderbolt to HMDI adaptor?, MacBookAir 2014 MiniDP to DP 2560x1440, \n2013 Macbook Air not showing 1440p Option on External Display, \nWhat's the max resolution for mini DisplayPort connected to a 2013 MacBook Air?, HDMI with resolution 2560 x 1440 possible?. Found using combinations of \"macbook air\", \"displayport to hdmi\", \"passive\", \"dual mode\" \"2560x1400\", \"1440p\", etc. Unfortunately many of these contain anecdotes, conflicting answers, or misleading advice (like forcing certain graphics or adapter hardware beyond specified limits, preferring HDMI over DisplayPort, etc.).\n\nA: I tried my two miniDP converters on two other monitors. Both worked fine.\nSo at the end I think it comes down to that passive adapters will work on less sensitive monitors. The more sensitive monitors (such as my BenQ BL2420pt) will not work.\n\nUpdate\nSomehow, very rarely, my dvi converter works on my monitor. It would display 1920x1080 on it. I assume it only rarely work because the signal happens to be detectable by the monitor (e.g. voltage?)\n", "Q: How to select vertically in textedit using keyboard How do i select vertically (columnar) in TextEdit using keyboard?\nI can do that using mouse i.e. pressing the option button and selecting the text but I would like to do the same with keyboard.\nHow do I do that?\n\nA: The problem with that is that the Mac's modifier keys Command and Option are used in conjunction with the arrow keys to navigate through text more quickly by going to the beginning or end of a line or the beginning or end of the next/previous word, respectively.\nThere may be a utility that will allow you to modify the system-wide defaults but you run the risk of breaking text editing everywhere in the system.\n\nA: I can't comment so I'll add here . . . Regarding @Steve Chambers and @Asdfg respective answer and comment, there is a checkbox in TextEdit Preferences that allow you to turn off \"smart\" copy paste.\n", "Q: How to boot into Sierra USB installer without Startup Manager? I'm trying to reinstall Mac OS on a late 2009 21.5 inch iMac. The previous owner tried to install ubuntu on it but failed to get it to work properly so I'm trying to install Mac OS Sierra from a USB stick. I know the USB works because I can boot from it on my Macbook Pro. The problem is that I can't figure out how to get the iMac to boot from the stick. Whenever I try to get into startup manager all I get is an all white screen and a mouse curser. I can get into Ubuntu safe mode and grub but I'm not sure what I can do from there to make the mac boot from USB.\n\nA: I'm assuming that holding down the option key when starting up does not show the boot drive selector displaying at least your internal drive. If this is the case then there is another bootloader getting in the way.\nYour next step should be to reset the NVRAM. You can find instructions here.\n\nA: The Mac probably has rEFIt installed, or it was uninstalled improperly. Try booting the computer off an original DVD and setting the startup disk. Or try booting with the option key and selecting your installer USB stick.\n", "Q: Cannot see macOS volumes in Boot Camp I upgraded from a MacBook Pro with Windows 7 in Boot Camp to an iMac with Windows 10 in Boot Camp.\nIn Windows 7 my I had read access to my macOS volumes (no write access), however, in Windows 10 I can only see the Windows Boot Camp volume in Windows Explorer.\nAre the Mac volumes no longer accessible from within Windows?\n\nA: APFS volumes cannot be read in Windows. Boot Camp only provides drivers for HFS+ volumes, so it's not a problem with the version of Windows but rather that the format of the Mac volume has moved on beyond the support drivers made available by Apple for Boot Camp.\n", "Q: How to get nfsd to serve NFSv4 on High Sierra? I'm hoping to serve an NFS mount from my High Sierra (10.13.4) server to a linux client. The linux client can mount using NFSv3 protocol, but I use ACLs on the served files and directories, so I think we need NFSv4.\nI'd like to use version 4 of the protocol. Is this possible? I see the nfsd(8) man page does not mention version 4. I found a manpage for FreeBSD exports(5) that uses the flag V4: at the start of a line in /etc/exports to declare the protocl version. \nI tried this with my nfsd and it failed to parse correctly, using \"nfsd checkexports\".\nIf I check rpc:\n$ sudo rpcinfo -p\nprogram vers proto   port  \n...\n100003     2   udp   2049  nfs\n100003     3   udp   2049  nfs\n100003     2   tcp   2049  nfs\n100003     3   tcp   2049  nfs\n\nThis makes me think my nfsd supports version 2 and 3 of the protocol. perhaps I can upgrade this server?\n\nA: The version of nfsd on the Mac does support v4. For ACL support you definitely need to connect using v4.\nYour failure to get a v4 connection is probably on the client side. Most NFS clients default to trying v3 first then falling back to v2 if unsuccessful.\nOn your client side you should specify v4 using the -o vers=4 option to your mount command. Do a man mount_nfs on the client to check that it supports that syntax rather than the old deprecated -o nfsv4 syntax. You could also use -4 but that is also deprecated and highly discouraged.\nTo get ACL support in your client you may have to add the -o acl option as most clients default to no ACL support.\nA close reading of man NFS and man mount_nfs on the client is highly recommended.\n\nA: The author of NFS Manager Marcel Bresink states in the help files that macOS only supports NFS 4 as a client. As server it is limited to NFS 2 and 3:\nhttps://www.bresink.com/osx/143439/Docs-en/pgs/0020-Intro.html\n\nA: I am yet to see any evidence that nfsd on macOS supports version 4.\nFrom man nfs.conf:\n For more information on the NFS and MOUNT protocols see Network File System Protocol\n Specification, RFC1094 and NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification.\n\nAnd as the OP points out rpcinfo localhost consistently reports versions 2 and 3 only. I have had no success getting any NFS 4 clients to connect to a macOS share.\n", "Q: iMac Intel 21.5\" EMC 2805 Looping chime on booting I am in trouble with my imac.

I am looking for a command line equivalent to the Get text from webpage option in /Applications/Automator.app. The Get text from webpageoption is pretty self explanatory, it gets the text only, without HTML tags, CSS, JavaScript, etc. from a webpage. I know I can use wget or curl but that will give me all the HTML tags, CSS, JavaScript, etc. not the only text version of the webpage.\n\nA: Your best option is the textutil command. Read the man page, but something like:\ntextutil -convert txt webpage.html\n\nshould work.\n", "Q: Move Keynote presentation from Mac to iPad/iPhone I am building presentations in the current version of Keynote on macOS Sierra. How do I move them to my iPad or iPhone for review and playback? \nI do not want to co-author simultaneously. The iOS 11 devices are for read-only use. Authoring happens only on the Mac.\n\nA: iCloud Drive\nIf your iOS devices are using iOS 11 or above, then the easiest option is to just save the Keynote presentations to your iCloud Drive. Your iOS device will be able to access them from the Files app and launch Keynote to view them. Likewise, you can launch Keynote first and then browse to your iCloud Drive to access them.\niTunes\nAnother option if your device is running iOS 10 or earlier, is to just use iTunes on your Mac to transfer your presentations. This option may also be quicker if you have large presentations or lots of them, as the transfer happens via USB cable rather than the internet.\nTo transfer via iTunes, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes on your Mac\n\n*Connect your iPhone/iPad to your Mac via USB cable\n\n*After a short while you'll see an icon appear that represents your iOS device - this should appear to the right of the drop-down menu (near top left of the iTunes window)\n\n*Click on the icon to view your device's summary screen\n\n*In the left-hand pane of your iTunes window you'll see various options for your device (e.g. Summary, Music, Movies, and so on)\n\n*Click on the File Sharing option (it should be the last one)\n\n*Now you'll see the File Sharing screen appear on the right-hand side of your iTunes window. This screen will list all the iOS apps that support file sharing.\n\n*Click on the Keynote app\n\n*On the right you'll now see a list of Keynote documents saved within this app on your device (assuming you already have some)\n\n*If you scroll down to the bottom you'll see an Add... button at bottom-right\n\n*Click on this button and use the window that appears to navigate to and select your Keynote presentations\n\n*Click on the Add... button \n\n*Now your Keynote presentations are transferred to the device\n\n*When finished, click on Done button \n\n\nNow when you open Keynote on your iOS device and select the Browse option, you'll see the presentations listed there.\nNote: This method is also available in iOS 11.\n\nA: AirDrop\nAnother option for sharing Keynote files between macOS and iOS is to use AirDrop.  \nBe sure both devices are in proximity and AirDrop is enabled. See this Apple support article for using AirDrop on iOS.\n\nFrom Keynote on macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Menu and select Share > Send a Copy... > AirDrop\n\n*Choose what format to send (in the case of the OP, Keynote)\n\n*Select your iOS device from the list. (If not shown see the support article referenced above.)\n\n*On the iOS device, AirDrop may ask you what app to open the file with.  Select Keynote.\n\n*Review the presentation using Keynote on iOS\n\n\nThis will be a separate, independent file from the original on the Mac so there is no co-authoring.  As for making the file so that it cannot be edited and yet still show as a Keynote presentation, see below.\nTo prevent it from being editable, see this answer.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Share > Send a Copy > AirDrop.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Choose the type of document to send.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Choose the AirDrop recipient from a list.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Accept delivery on the iPad.\n\n\n\n", "Q: iMovie advanced tools option not present in preferences I'd like to enable Advanced Tools in iMovie preferences.\nWhen I open preferences, I only see:\n\nUsing iMovie 10.0.9\n\nA: I don't recall from which version, but at some point iMovie changed its interface so that all of the advanced tools were already built into the interface, so there's no need to enable it in iMovie's preferences. \nTo see the various tools, just click on your clip and select the Adjust option to reveal the Advanced tools. \n\nA: Update: There is no \"Adjust\" menu in 10.1.9 - all the tools that were there are now either hidden until you need them or distributed in various other menus.\nMy issue was I could not find how to flip a clip in 10.1.9: the answer turned out to be rather un-intuitive. You go to the CROP menu. There, on the right hand side of the screen, you'll see a rotate left and rotate right button.\nOther menus, such as the green-screen/blue-screen options, only appear when you have one clip overlaid over another.\nThese are very difficult issues to search for, as the menus have changed so drastically across so many versions - I'm adding this clarification to one of the top results for my particular 10.1.9 issue, even though this will probably be useless with the next release!\n", "Q: How can you forward delete all in macOS? If you type a sentence and hold command then press delete then it'll delete the whole line. What if I want to insert the cursor in the middle of a sentence and forward delete the right of the sentence?\n\nA: Within default macOS apps (e.g. TextEdit) as well as other Apple apps (e.g. Pages) you can use the controlK keyboard shortcut to delete the text between the cursor and the end of the line (or paragraph). However, this isn't supported by default in many 3rd party apps (e.g. MS Word).\nHowever, you can use the optionfndelete keyboard shortcut (in standard keyboards) to delete everything to the right of the cursor up to the next space. This works in many 3rd party apps.\nIf you have an extended keyboard, then you don't need to use the fn as you have a dedicated forward delete key.\n", "Q: Late 2008 13\" MacBook not detecting brand new battery I bought a broken late 2008 13\" Aluminum Unibody MacBook on eBay. Supposedly, according to the listing, Apple had said the original battery needed to be replaced. The other issue was the slightly-damaged battery cover. The computer arrived and, upon powering on, did not even detect a battery indicated by the [x] mark on the screen. Hitting the battery indicator button on the side of the case also indicated no battery. I assumed the battery was completely shot and I bought a replacement third-party battery. The computer doesn't detect this battery either. I've performed PRAM and SMC resets. I tried two different magsafe chargers to eliminate the possibility of a bad charger.\nAt one point, I was looking at the system report and the magsafe led suddenly changed to orange from green and the computer powered off suddenly before immediately turning to green.\nI haven't removed the logic board but I have removed the bottom cover and I don't think this has any liquid damage. The computer works perfectly aside from the battery issue.\nI notice the original battery seems to have terminals on the walls of the battery connector that the replacement battery does not. See photos below:\nOriginal battery (notice the gold terminal at the far end of the battery socket wall)\n\nThe replacement battery (notice the gold terminal seen in the other battery isn't here)\n\nNote: this model is the late 2008 13\" unibody, aluminum MacBook. This is NOT a MacBook Pro but actually the only aluminum MacBook ever made. It is very similar to the MacBook Pro but has subtle differences which should be noted.\n\nA: I later deduced the problem to the logicboard. I bought a replacement board which successfully detected the same battery. I didn't bother testing the old battery. Strangely, the original board is perfect with the exception of the battery circuit.\nThe  issue could be the battery connector on the board or something more complicated.\n", "Q: iPad suitable for 18X7 environment? An industrial application needs a barcode scanning kiosk and upload scans 18 hours a day,7 days a week.  Users are not expected to touch the display, however, the display will be on broadcasting instructions and providing feedback that scans are successful.  \nHas the iPad been tested or used in 18X7 duty cycles or similar high duty cycles?\n\nA: Our iPads in factory settings are less expensive, faster to interact with and break less than all the other hardware we deploy. This includes corrosive atmosphere environments, metallic dust and all manner of things that tend to short out gear. Even if they failed at a rate twice of computers, they’re still cheaper to replace than other options we could use for our application.\nThe resale value of lightly used iPads is so high I’d start a pilot program immediately if you’re on the fence. \n\nA: I've seen many iPads used for kiosks in retail stores around Ireland where I live. These never seem to be turned off and are always working when I see them.\nBut, if you're looking for something a little more substantial:\n\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/02/28/FAA.approves.iPads/index.html\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is allowing charter company Executive Jet Management to use Apple's tablet as an approved alternative to paper charts.\n\nIf it's good enough to use in aviation, I'd expect it to be good enough for most things. Theres some more detail on cockpit iPads on Wikipedia.\n", "Q: How can I delete a whole list amongst my reminders? Seems like I’m missing a delete button at the bottom. I do not have family sharing enabled. How do I get rid of this list?\n\n\nA: If you have another account (like Yahoo! or Outlook) linked in your iPhone settings in addition to your iCloud account, then it could be the culprit.\nIf that’s the case, try either disabling reminders from that account or try to visit the specific account settings pages and delete it manually.\n\n", "Q: Apple TV4 VLC sees SMB but folder empty I screwed something up. i just got vlc for apple tv 4 and enabled file sharing from my mac mini 2014 running high sierra 10.13.4. it ran great but it allowed anonymous login, so i thought i'd restrict it because I live in high rise and use wifi. Anyway, I deleted some users ('staff', \"Everyone\") and added a new admin. Now nothing works. vlc recognizes my computer in smb but when i try to access it the folder reads empty. Can't see anything on iphone app, either. is there someway to reset the thing? i tried diskutil resetUserPermissions / id -u in terminal, nothing doing.\nAny advice would be appreciated. thank you\n\nA: I had a similar issue - VLC would only show empty folders once connected - this was happening from the first time I opened VLC on my Apple TV.\nMy shares are also on a Mac Mini (2012 model) running 10.13.4\nI got it to work by turning off file sharing, then disabling AFP sharing and only using SMB.\nOnce I turned file sharing back on, VLC could see all my shared folders.\nTo change sharing options, go into System Preferences, Sharing.\nOh, and I use a password-protected account called 'media' for accessing the shares from networked devices. I don't use anonymous logins.\nHope this helps, or you got the issue sorted already.\nI'm also trying out the app 'infuse' and it looks nice, but with some videos it wants me to buy a subscription to use the app to continue, so not sure yet if it's something I'll stick with.\n\nA: You should be able to restore the ATV4 to factory settings. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Apple TV go to Settings > System > Reset\n\n*You'll see two options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Reset: This reset your Apple TV to its factory settings and won't update the software. This can be done without an internet connection.\n\n*Reset and Update: As above, this resets your Apple TV to its factory settings, but also installs any available software updates. Obviously you will need an internet connection for this to complete.\n\n\n*Once your Apple TV is reset, reconfigure it by adding your Apple ID, etc.\n\n*Once you've logged back in, re-download the apps you want.\n\n\nA: If you see only empty folders on your NAS, you should also check if you set correct rights on the account you're using for login on VLC - this is being set on NAS users' account privileges, not on VLC nor Apple TV (ex. for the Synology NAS, you'd need to login via your computer's internet browser, go to the Control Panel -> User -> select user you're using for VLC login and click on Edit and check the privileges - or create a new user with correct privileges).\n", "Q: Can I install Win 10 (GPT formatted USB installer) on MacBook Pro without using BootCamp? I have a brand new MacBook Pro provided by our home & contents insurance which is replacing my wife's Mid-2013 model that was accidentally damaged.\nShe ran Win 10 on the old one, installed via BootCamp.\nMy question is, if I use a GPT formatted Windows 10 install USB that I usually use for UEFI installs on \"normal\" computers, can I just install straight onto the SSD without needing BootCamp?\nIdeally I'd want to use this with only Windows installed (i.e. I don't need it to be a dual boot machine).\n\nA: Of course you can!\n\nBefore continuing, make sure that you have a backup!!! I am not responsible for any damage caused by this guide. You have been warned.\n\nSkip to step 4 if you only want Windows and no macOS.\nStep 1: Open Disk Utility by simply typing Disk Utility inside Spotlight.\nStep 2: Select your disk from the list at the left, but NOT the containers, and press Partition located at the top. If it asks you whether you want to partition or add a new APFS volume, select Partition.\nStep 3: A pie of your disk should have appeared now. From here, select your macOS partition and click + (plus) button. There is a new partition now. Arrange it's size either from the properties, or by dragging it from the borders. This is going to be your Windows 10 partition. Give it at least 40GBs of space. Name the new partition (not macOS partition) with a name that you will remember, such as BOOTCAMP, but make sure it is all in capital letters. Lastly set it's type as MS-DOS (FAT) and press Apply. You'll be warned that you are resizing your boot partition, just press OK.\nYou need a USB formatted as FAT32 with at least 8 GBs of free space to continue... Skip to step 5 if you already have an installation media.\nStep 4: Download and install unetbootin from here. Then run it and select Disk Image option on the screen. Select ISO option from the dropdown menu next to Disk Image text if it is not already selected. Then press the button with three dots (...) and select your Windows ISO image (assuming you already have one). Lastly, select your USB from the dropdown menu next to Drive text and press OK. This will burn the ISO image to the USB.\nStep 4.1: To learn what your USB is called, open up a Terminal from Spotlight and type:\ndiskutil list\n\nThis will show you all of the drives connected to your computer. Your USB is something like /dev/disk1s1 or /dev/disk1s2 (but definitely not /dev/disk0). You can understand which one is your USB by searching for your USB's label.\nStep 5: Now open up the Bootcamp assistant for the last time. Once it's opened, select Action > Download Windows Helper Software. This will download Bootcamp helper. Select the target as your desktop and continue.\nStep 6: Once your bootcamp software is downloaded and unetbootin is done, copy the contents of the WindowsSupport folder to your USB's root directory.\nStep 7: It's time to begin the installation! Reboot your MacBook and when it's powering on, press and hold Alt (option) key on your keyboard. Once boot manager appears, select the EFI Boot or Windows option. This will start the installer. Give it a few minutes and once the button to begin the installation appears, press it. Wait for it to start. Once it starts, select Custom installation option. This part is important!!! A list of volumes should have appeared now.\nStep 7.1, For Dualboot: Select the partition you created earlier for Windows and click Format. When it's done, re-select the Windows partition and press Install. Now just relax and wait for it to finish.\nStep 7.1, Remove OS X and install Windows: This will destroy any data on your other volumes! Delete all of your partitions one by one. Once there is only free space left, create a new partition and install Windows on there.\nStep 7.2: Wait for the installation to finish.\nStep 7.3: Once the computer restarts, hold the alt key and select Windows or EFI Boot option with a hard drive icon.\nStep 8: Once you fully setup Windows, select your USB from Windows Explorer and go to WindowsSupport folder. In that folder, run the setup program. Install it like a normal program and you are done!\n\nA: I think you'd want to use the bootcamp media creation tool unless you have the windows drivers for that exact model already.\nI've done a regular windows install on a mac before and they don't make it too easy to get the drivers. Windows doesn't come with most of them either.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible. You can find my tutorial for help here : Installer Windows sur Mac sans Boot Camp\n\nA: There is probably a way, but regardless, this isn't how Apple wants you to do it. They put restrictions onto Mac such as drivers etc. You are better off, to just follow Apple's guidelines on using Boot Camp and installing it to be on the safe side. Even Microsoft themselves made an article for Windows 7, recommending to go with Boot Camp. \n\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2647609/installing-windows-7-on-your-mac-using-boot-camp\n\nIf you really are worried about drivers (as all the necessary ones for Windows to start should be there), you could try virtualization products like VMware Fusion, Parallels Desktop or VirtualBox.

I contacted Apple help center to get the location of my device, but they replied that they cannot do anything because the location service is disabled on my Mac, so no one can track the location. But I just learned about WPS tracking on this site in a relevant topic. \nCan anyone help me track my device? \n\nA: I'm sorry to hear about your MacBook Air being stolen.\nWhile there is software built in to macOS and separately available to track, monitor, or lock a device, this software must be installed and turned on ahead of time. Once the device is no longer in your position, there is no way to remotely activate any tracking feature.\nIf you mean Wireless Protected Setup, this is a feature of Wi-Fi routers to make connecting to the wireless network easier. It would not help you recover your stolen device.\nI can't say I know much about Pakistan's laws, but I would recommend providing as much identifiable information about your MacBook Air (serial number, MAC address, proof of purchase, stickers or other external marks) to the local law enforcement. If the device is recovered, I would hope they would contact you.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Cannot log in to apps or websites on iPad 1 I haven't used my iPad 1 for a long time.

Like this:\ntry {\n  // some code that might go wrong\ncatch (e) {\n  alert(e);\n  alert(e.stack);\n}\n\n", "Q: How can I use emoji on my Mac as easily as I can on my iPhone? Is there any easy way for me to add emoji to a document or email when I’m using my Mac?\nI know I can set up up an emoji viewer in the menu bar via Apple > System Preferences > Keyboard, but I find this very clumsy to use.\nA keyboard shortcut would be fantastic, but when I checked the Mac Keyboard Shortcuts https://support.apple.com/HT201236 page on Apple’s website I didn’t see any emoji shortcuts listed. \nWhat’s the easiest way for me to insert emoji on a Mac (one without a Touch Bar)?\n\nA: You can use the Mac Emoji keyboard. All you need to do is press the command + control + spacebar keys and this brings up the following:\n\nOnce the Emoji keyboard appears, just click on the emoji you want to insert!\nNOTE: - For the emoji to actually insert, your cursor needs to be located within a text document, text field, search field, etc. Basically anywhere you could normally type text.\n", "Q: How to stop long downloads/uploads to iCloud when browsing with Finder shared folder in other macs on the same LAN Every time I go to Finder and I select a shared folder in other macs on the same lan I notice that there is a long delay before the content of that folder is displayed.\nThe network monitor of Little Snitch shows me that uploads and downloads are performed to icloud.com. When these uploads and downloads stop, the content of the shared folder is finally shown in Finder.\n\nHow can I stop these downloads and uploads to icloud.com happening when I select with Finder a shared folder in other macs on my same LAN?\nPlease notice that I have the following Finder preferences:\n\nAnd and the following iCloud system preferences:\n\nPlease notice that all my macs are on mac os x 10.12.6 Sierra.\n\nA: For simplicity, I recommend using SFTP to transfer files. SFTP moves files using an SSH session. SSH can do authentication by user credentials, or by public keys. \nIt's secure, fast on modern hardware, and with modern tools, relatively convenient.\nHere's one way to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on \"Remote Login\" in System Preferences->Sharing on the remote Mac (be sure to Allow access for: All users)\n\n*Create user credentials on the remote Mac\n\n*Download an FTP client that can do SFTP. My recommendation is Filezilla.\n\n\nUse the FTP client to log in by SFTP to the remote Mac, and Bob's your uncle. \n", "Q: How to edit or add tag colors In Preview.app for macOS 10.13.3, how do I remove a tag from the drop-down menu and add additional colour tag, other than the few shown? I made a tag which I want to remove from the drop-down menu. Also, I wonder if it is possible to add custom colors to tags?\n\nA: The tags shown when saving or modifying a file are Finder tags, not specific to Preview, etc. Therefore you are limited to the colours available for Finder tags.\nGo to Finder → Preferences, then choose the Tags tab.\n\n\nClick on a tag, then choose – to remove it.\nTag colours can be changed by right-clicking on a tag in the list and choosing a new colour for it.\n\n\nDrag your favourite tags to the area below to make them available for quick use in Finder menus.\n\n", "Q: XLR Microphone not working with phantom power supply I'm using macbook air. My XLR mic works fine without phantom power supply in between, it's just that audio is low. When I use phantom power supply, macbook doesn't detect the microphone. Has anybody faced a similar problem? What's the solution?\n\nA: You still need a microphone preamp.\nAs always seems to happen with these mics, they are bought by people for whom it is their first venture into the audio field, beyond a headset mic.\nUnfortunately, nothing in any of these ads tells you precisely what you are going to need - nor do they even supply the right cables in the box to be able to do it.\nTheoretically, you can get a signal out of them by using a PC's built-in low voltage supply that can power headsets.\nIn practise, that really doesn't work well at all - so then people buy a phantom supply, without realising they still really need something to get the signal into the computer at good levels.\nIf you can return that phantom power supply, do so, you don't need it.\nEven on the picture for the supply it shows you need to connect it to a preamp.  \n\nPreamps are readily-available with built-in phantom power & USB connection.\nThey become the instant bridge between your mic & your computer. They supply the correct phantom power to the mic & become a useable input for the computer.\nInstead, get anything like the following list obtained by Googling \"USB Phantom\" -\nRandom selection on Amazon\nExample -  \n\nThey run from approx £30 to many hundreds, depending on number of inputs/features etc. All you need as a basic starter kit is 1 mic input with phantom power.\nYou also need a male-female XLR cable which will connect to the pre-amp's mic input, which those mics are not supplied with. \n\n", "Q: Space in foldername inside a FIND loop I´m working on a script that need to read files inside a FIND loop.\nSomething like this :\nDIRINI=/Volumes/dados/App\\ Data/DATABASE.noindex/30000\nfor FILE  in `find \"$DIRINI\"  -type f ` ; do\nstat $FILE\nstat \"$FILE\"\nstat '$FILE'\ndone\n\nThe problem is : when the foldername  has a space inside , i  have to put the var $DIRINI inside a \"\"  and this  make FIND works , but  the other commands inside the loop that use $DIRINI  does not work ,   they split  foldername in two use one half in each cicle.\nDoes someone have an idea of what can i do ?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Don‘t loop over results from find, there are too many things which can and will go wrong. Use\nfind \"$DIRINI\" -type f -exec stat {} \\;\n\nor\nfind \"$DIRINI\" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 stat\n\ninstead. \n\nA: This is a classic example with the shell performing word splitting. When you assign a variable with spaces the value must be quoted such as, var=\"foo bar\". When the variable var is expanded on the right side of a command the variable must be quoted or the shell splits the variable into two or more arguments.\nWhen you use command substitution in a for loop, the command substitution is expanded as space delimited results. So,\nfor line in `find dir -type f`\n\nexpands into\nfor line in filename with spaces filename file name with spaces\n\neach word becomes an argument instead of the actual filenames.\nSolution 1: is to pipe the results of find into a while read loop:\nfind \"$DIRINI\"  -type f | while IFS= read -r line; do\n    command \"$line\"\n    command \"$line\"\ndone\n\nSolution 2: use process substitution with a while read loop:\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    command \"$line\"\n    command \"$line\"\ndone < <(find \"$DIRINI\"  -type f)\n\nSolution 3: just use find:\nfind \"$DIRINI\"  -type f -exec command {} \\; -exec command {} \\;\n\n", "Q: How can I view PDF at two-pages and in the right-to-left order? How can I view PDF at two-pages and in the right-to-left order?\nAcrobat can do this but Preview is more responsive. \n\n\nA: Preview cannot do this.\nYou can manually rearrange each two-page layout in the sidebar, but this is time consuming.\nIf you don't care about the exact layout, you can add a blank page to the PDF in Preview (Edit > Insert > Blank Page) before the first page. This will shift the right page into left spot of the next two-page spread. This does break right-to-left formats, like manga.\nThere may be other apps that can accomplish this for you. Like you said, you can do it with Adobe Acrobat, and this is likely how you'll have to do it.\n", "Q: Using terminal, how can I install a DMG file without sudo rights? All of the answers to this question Is there a command to install a dmg work for me in installing a DMG file from the command line. \nBut I don't want to have users need to enter the sudo password, it is inconvenient. \nHow can I extract a DMG file to a executable directory without sudo? Or is there no way to do that? \n\nA: DMG is a disk image, not an installer. You can't see from the outside how a piece of software is installed just by it being distributed as a DMG.\nThat said, if the DMG contains an .app, your user might be able to \"install\" (copy) it to their ~/Applications/ folder. The software will be only available to this specific user.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone X use facial recognition hardware? Does the iPhone X use Facial Recognition hardware not found in previous models? Or is the algorithm executed on the CPU?\n\nA: Both. The iPhone X's True Depth Camera uses hardware unique to the X, specifically an infrared camera, an IR flood illuminator, and a dot projector to measure the depth of your face. The regular FaceTime camera is used for color information and iOS software handles facial recognition, but not concerning the \"fingerprint\" of your face for Face ID - facial detection works in realtime on all current iPhones and facial recognition exists in the photos app via software.\nThe True Depth camera does all the heavy lifting for Face ID. Additionally, Face ID works in the dark because of the IR camera, flood illuminator, and dot projector. Without this hardware, the regular FaceTime camera could be fooled by a sheet of paper with a person's face on it.\n", "Q: Can iTunes gift cards be used to make in-app purchases? Does Apple allow the use of iTunes gift cards (in this case a Japanese iTunes gift card with a Japanese Apple ID) to buy an in-app purchase (for in-game currency)?\n\nA: Why would it not be allowed by Apple? \nIf it's a Japanese iTunes gift card for an Apple ID with the Japanese iTunes Store, then that's what the gift card is for. You can use it to purchase Apple software, 3rd party apps, music, etc so long as they're from Apple's Japanese stores (i.e. iTunes Store, App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, etc). In-app purchases are included as well.\nWhat you would not be able to do is use it to add credit to an Apple ID based in another country or connected to another store. For example, if you had another Apple ID for the US iTunes Store, then you wouldn't be able to redeem a Japanese iTunes gift card for that Apple ID.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro question on former owner I have a used MacBook.  The former user was still the admin so I Googled and followed instructions to remove his password and get myself in as admin.  I then deleted his user account.  \nI just looked at my settings on my iPhone and saw under messages \"share with FORMER USERS NAME MacBook\"\nHow do I get his name off of everything?  I don't see him at all under user accounts. I don't have any discs, install media, etc.\n\nA: You need to change the name of the MacBook, not just the user account.  \nYou will find this in System Preferences -> Sharing.  The Computer name can then be changed by selecting edit (you may have to unlock, first).\n\n\nA: With iCloud, the App Store, Find My Mac and everything else that Apple has designed into the OS to make stealing a Mac difficult, they have also made buying a Mac difficult.\nAll of the apps on that Mac belong to someone else, as far as Apple is concerned. The operating system as well. If I were you I would download High Sierra and use a program like DiskmakerX to make a bootable USB thumb drive installer.\nI would back up all your documents. Everything you need from that Mac and then boot from the thumb drive and, using Disk Utility in the installer, reformat the hard drive so nothing of the previous owner is left on the computer.\nYou can remove apps, you can change the name, you can hope he disabled Find My Mac, but for me all of that is death my a thousand cuts. It's easier, in the long run, to wipe his footprint from the computer by doing the format and reinstall then endlessly fiddling with all of the myriad ways you will have to work around what he has already done with the Mac, IMHO...\n", "Q: How can I disable Photos Agent on High Sierra (10.13.4)? Looks like Photos Agent is running in the background. I'd like to dedicate this machine to file services and not run unnecessary processes. How can I disable \"Photos Agent\" at boot time. I'm hoping to free up resources like RAM and CPU.\n\nA: From personal experience, I can say that letting it finish once (it processes photos in the Photos app) makes it end forever.\nBut you can speed up that process by removing iCloud photos syncing. \n", "Q: How to find polynomial trendline x value when using a date? So I have a chart that I have created in Numbers, with a trendline using a polynomial function, and I've got it to display the formula, but I cannot for the life of me, figure out what x value I'm supposed to use to get the resulting y value!\nx is a date / time, so clearly it must be something related to the date value. But I've tried using ms since the unix epoch, secs since the unix epoch, etc. each to no avail. Some \"other\" spreadsheet tools make it clear how they convert dates into numbers when creating polynomial trendlines, Numbers however, does not.\nDoes anyone know what the hell value I am supposed to use!?\nFor those that might not be able to read the graph easily, an x value of 01/01/2019 00:00:00 should give a y value of 1,000~.\n\n\nA: My guess is x is the number of seconds since some particular time in 1998 or 1999.\nIf I put 644,430,371 in the formula, I get 1000, and 2019-01-01 is 644,430,371 seconds after 1998-08-01.\nIf I put 658,332,729 in the formula, I get 4000, and 2020-01-01 is 658,332,729 seconds after 1999-02-21.\nThe dates might not match exactly because the limited number of digits of precision in the formula is introducing some rounding errors.\n", "Q: What security preferences are blocking McAfee? I changed some of my Macbook's security settings today.  I also updated to the latest version of High Sierra (10.13.4) shortly before changing my security settings. \n Shortly thereafter, I got the following message from McAfee:\n\nYour system's security preferences are blocking McAfee software from loading.  Because of this, some software features are not enabled.  You can change your settings in the Security & Privacy System Preferences pane.  Click OK to open System Preferences.\n\n\"Cancel\" and \"OK\" are then given as options.\nThis keeps popping up.\nThe privacy features I changed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Share Mac Analytics and Share with App Developers were turned off.\n\n*Dropbox and Steam are no longer allowed to \"control [my] computer\", changed under \"Accessibility\"\n\n*Under Location Services, under System Services, \"Location-Based Suggestions\" was turned off and \"Significant Locations\" was reset and turned off.\n\n\nWhat security features are making McAfee upset? Or does it have to do with the OS update?\n\nA: When the message from McAfee appears, click OK and open System Preferences > Security & Privacy. Under the General tab, you may see an Allow button like the image below. You will need to click this and follow the prompts to allow your software to work properly.\nMcAfee's knowledge base has instructions on this under the \"Standalone installation on macOS High Sierra without a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile\" section of this page.This is a security feature introduced in macOS 10.13 to make sure certain kinds of software, kernel extensions, are loaded with the permission of the user. This Allow button is only available for 30 minutes after the alert appears.\n", "Q: Unable to sign in to iCloud on iPhone My friend gave me his old iPhone and reset everything so I could use it. I set up an iCloud account, but when I try to sign in, it says that my username (which is my email) is invalid. How is that possible when I can use the same email to sign into my iCloud account online? What should I do?\n\nA: Check your network settings, also go to iforgot.apple.com and enter your first and last name as well as the Apple ID email address to make sure that the account exists. If it does not identify it then it may be that you didn't verify your email address. If it does identify it then you may need to try restarting the device and the network connections to see if you are able to sign in (also sign in to the Apple ID page to verify that you can sign in after you have identified it as an Apple ID).\n"]
