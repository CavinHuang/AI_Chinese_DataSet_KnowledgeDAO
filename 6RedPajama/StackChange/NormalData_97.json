["Q: Triggering a UI message based on a terminal ssh'd to another server I am working in a multi-workspace multi-window configuration. I am constantly running scripts behind the scenes. \nIt would save me a lot of time and context switching if I could kick off a script on another server and have a message popup (growl notify or w/e) on my desktop letting me know that the command finished.\nIs there a way to do that in Ubuntu 10?\n\nA: Here's one way to do it, assuming you have password-less SSH set up:\nssh my-graphical-workstation 'env DISPLAY=$(w -s $USER | grep -m 1 \" :\" | awk \"{print \\$3}\") notify-send \"Done processing.\"'\n\nYou'll need libnotify-bin  installed on my-graphical-workstation.\nAdjust it as necessary.\n\nA: To augment the fine answer by @ændrük:\nyou might need to allow the connection from the remote machine. At the simplest, use\nxhost +\n\nbut you should restrict this to the target machine once working, if you do not want the whole world to open X11 windows on your machine. This is done automatically if you do ssh -X, but needs to be added manually if the ssh connection is not maintained.\nIf you are always connected, just add a -X to your ssh parameter to have it do the setup for you, as in\nuser@localhost:path$ ssh -X where_the_script_is_run\nuser@where_the_script_is_run:path$ run-script; xmessage 'whatever message'\n\nnotify-send did not work for me remotely.

It's older than maildir, after all.\nUnder Ubuntu, /usr/bin/mail has two alternatives: heirloom-mailx  and bsd-mailx . Each of the two have extensions to the historical utility, but the Heirloom version more so. In particular, Only the Heirloom version has maildir support (and IMAP, and decent charset handling, and MIME).\nMake sure you have the Heirloom version installed. If you have both, the alternative defaults to heirloom-mailx; check that you haven't changed the default setting by running sudo update-alternatives --config mailx.\n", "Q: How to enlarge indicators and window buttons in Unity?

(/dev/sda2 in your case)\n\nA: I agree with @psusi: the disk needs replacing, see my comment under accepted answer.  Doing an ntfsfix will not help at all, and just delays the essential action of:\n\n\n*\n\n*backing up all data on the disk ASAP\n\n*replacing the disk with a new one\n\n\nThere's no need really to check the SMART diagnostics - they only pick up a percentage of errors anyway.  The red flags are the two lines:\n[ 1019.726558] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda]  Add. Sense: **Unrecovered read error** - auto reallocate failed\n[ 1019.726602] JBD: **Failed to read block** at offset 462\n\nAs soon as a disk starts giving unrecoverable read errors (UREs), it should be replaced immediately and only used for data recovery.  (An excessive level of non-UREs also indicates replacement is needed.)\nDisks should be viewed as consumables that must be replaced every few years, hence having really good backups (automated, daily, complete, and at least to an external drive) is crucial.\n\nA: Your disk is toast.  Check the SMART diagnostics in the disk utility to confirm; it should say you have a ton of bad sectors and need to replace the drive.\n\nA: fsck and gparted apps cannot be used to fix a problem with a ntfs partition. ntfsfix should not be used to try and fix this problem.\nWindows tools should normally be used. However, chkdsk is not helping here.\nYou might try using testdisk from the Ubuntu OS.\nsudo apt-get update # update the software databases\nsudo apt-get install testdisk # install testdisk\nsudo testdisk # start testdisk\nGo to http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step for help in using this tool.\n\nA: I've just fixed my USB drive using \"testdisk\", a Linux command line (yet friendly) utility. My drive was not even mounting in Windows and Windows 8 discovered like 6 partitions (when the drive had only one).\nTo use the utility, install it:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nThen run it:\nsudo testdisk\n\nand follow the instructions. You must search for partitions and then write the changes.\nHope this help anyone.\n\nA: Unfortunately the free tools available on Linux are very limited with regards to fixing NTFS partitions.\nMost likely you can still recover your data by using the secondary MFT stored at the end of the disk. It is usually not used, but it should contain an up-to-date version of your directory structure. There is a good chance it was not affected by the disk errors.\nIn the past, I have used Runtime Software's (commercial, 79$) product GetDataBack NTFS with great success for this. It is one of the few NTFS tools (the only?) that runs in WINE and as a Linux LiveCD, and the free demo should be enough to see if your data is still there. If it is, your data might just be worth buying the tool.\nThe LiveCD runs Knoppix Linux and has all their tools preinstalled. Note that you'll still need a license key to actually use the tools, but it should be enough to see if it works on your computer.\nDisclaimer: I have no affiliation with Runtime software other than having bought their product a few years ago.\n\nA: Just to clear some of your points up.\n\nMy attempt to run fsck results in the following :\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fsck /dev/sda\n\n...\n\nfsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sda\n\n\nNow, thats not wonder, because you are trying to fsck the disk, and not its partition.\nWhat fsck does is, it tries to recognize the FS type. Because you have given it raw disk surface, it fails to recognize and resorts to default type - ext, calling fsck.ext.\nfsck.ext does not find any FS signature in the location and tries to find superblocks. Ultimately it fails, because its disk with only NTFS partition type.\nThis is why you have this error.\nThe correct command would be:\nsudo fsck /dev/sda1\n\nThat would feed the FIRST partition of first sata hard drive, not the first sata disk itself.\n\nA: NOTE: THIS ANSWER IS BOTH OUTDATED, AND NOT ADVISED IF YOU HAVE READ ERRORS.\nInstall ntfs-3g with sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g.\nThen run the ntfsfix command on your NTFS partition.\nFor example:\nntfsfix /dev/hda6\n\nntfsfix v2.0.0 (libntfs 10:0:0)\nUsage: ntfsfix [options] device\n\n\nAttempt to fix an NTFS partition.\n\n-h, --help             Display this help\n-V, --version          Display version information\n\nDevelopers' email address:\n\n\nlinux-ntfs-dev@lists.sf.net Linux NTFS\nhomepage: http://www.linux-ntfs.org\n\n\nFor newer Ubuntus You can use -b and -d option together. -b tries to fix bad clusters and -d to fix dirty states. So the command can be\nsudo ntfsfix -b -d /dev/sda6\n\n--help shows them\nntfsfix v2015.3.14AR.1 (libntfs-3g)\n\nUsage: ntfsfix [options] device\n    Attempt to fix an NTFS partition.\n\n    -b, --clear-bad-sectors Clear the bad sector list\n    -d, --clear-dirty       Clear the volume dirty flag\n    -h, --help              Display this help\n    -n, --no-action         Do not write anything\n    -V, --version           Display version information\n\n\nA: As the other answers have said, in this case it's probably a bad disk..\nBut for the benefit of others facing actual NTFS corruption - unfortunately the ntfsfix tool is very limited compared to Microsoft's chkdsk. Try to get a Windows install going - preferably with the newest version of Windows as Microsoft is presumably constantly improving chkdsk (I hope..) Newer versions of Windows are often available for free as trials. If the problem is in a USB disk you can try installing Windows in something like VirtualBox and give the VM control of the USB device.\n\nA: As of 15Jul2020, there is no option to check filesystem integrity of a Hard disk formatted as NTFS under Linux.\nWhat I did?\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded the free trial of Windows Enterprise as ISO\n\n*sudo apt-get remove Virtualbox virtualbox-dkms virtualbox*\n\n*Install the latest Virtualbox from here\n\n*Download the matched version of Virtualbox extpack\n\n*Add to disk group, me, as user, due to access deny hard disk error\n\n*\n\n*sudo usermod -a -G disk $USER\n\n*sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USER\n\n\n\n*Run sudo /sbin/vboxconfig\n\n*Run VirtualBox, and add Virtualbox extpack at File -> Preferences -> Extentions\n\n*Restart your Computer\n\n*Create a link to your physical Hard Disk which is NTFS (either usb or not) using VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename \"</path/to/file>.vmdk\" -rawdisk /dev/sdX\n\n*Create Machine -> New -> Windows 10 (64bit) (whatever match) -> Create a Virtual Disk\n\n*Attach the Downloaded Windows Enterprise Free trial ISO image\n\n*At your newly created Virtual Windows Image --> preferences -> Storage -> attach the vmdk image of your ntfs hdd\n\n*It may fail. Dont worry. To me failed too. I refer to it, because I found it. It may work for you.\n\n*Go to Virtual Windows Image --> preferences -> USB, check USB 3, add your NTFS HDD\n\n*Run your Virtual \"Windows Enterprize Free Trial\" machine.\n\n*Click Continue, Repair your computer (at left down side), Troubleshooting, Run Command Prompt\n\n*Go to your disk by writing eg. C:\n\n*Check that it is your disk somehow eg. dir\n\n*Run chkdsk /f when you are on your disk\n\nThis process fixed my NTFS filesystem that it was fault. I hope it helpt you too.\nIf you find any easier solution, only under Linux, please post it.\nUPDATE: After fixing NTFS, i formatted to Ext4, entire disk. Bye bye NTFS problem. As I read, it does not need defragmation as NTFS.\n\nA: This answer will probably just work for 10.04 (lucid) and later versions of Ubuntu!\nTry sudo ntfsfix -b /dev/sda2.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need ntfs-3g  installed.

Ubuntu uses lots of effects, services, etc. \nIf you want your laptop to work longer, try Unity2D desktop environment. It looks nearly like Unity, but uses much less resources. Check \"Unity2D\" in Software Center.\nYou should also check if any unneded programs are running.\nFor even lower energy consumption, you can try LXDE desktop environment, though, that's probably more advanced solution. Check \"Lubuntu\" in Software Center.\n\nA: I've got a 6-cell and it drains in 1 hour to 1 and a half hour..

If yes, what tool on Windows can allow me to do that?\n3.What other solutions do I have to install Ubuntu, whilst maintaining my Windows 7 partitions?\nthank u very much.\n\nA: You probably have upgraded to a \"dynamic disk\", which is a Microsoft proprietary system that can not be recognized by other operating systems.  You need to convert the disk back to \"basic disk\".  You will likely need to delete at least one of those partitions as well.\n\nA: I can see a major problem with your partition scheme. You see, Ubuntu requires two partitions to install (one of them is for swap memory). Chances are that your current setup groups all the partitions under one extended partition, or quite simply because you only have \"free\" partition, Ubuntu cannot place itself there. Essentially you would need to erase the 20GB partition, and don't do anything with it (leave it as just blank completely from within windows).\nIn other words, if it shows up in windows explorer at all - it's a partition and Ubuntu won't be able to use it.\nIf you can find a partition manager for windows (a third part one, since the tools in windows suck), you could possibly create an extended partition there yourself.\nSorry if my answer isn't 100% clear.\n\nA: First of all, Ubuntu uses Ext4 filesystem, while you created NTFS, which is used by Windows. Windows can't see Ext filesystems. However Ubuntu can manage NTFS systems without a problem. That doesn't mean NTFS fits for installing. Event if it's possible, NTFS would get fragmented.\nSecondly, to install Ubuntu, you need a SWAP drive. SWAP drive is used when your computer lacks memory. It's usually recommended to make it twice the size of your RAM memory. For example, if you have 2GB RAM, make it 4GB SWAP. However, in my experience (which isn't much). 3GB RAM was more than enaugh for me, so I make 1GB SWAP - I simply don't need it.\nWhat should you do? \n\n\n*\n\n*Insert Ubuntu CD.\n\n*When installing sellect Advanced\npartitioning. (However, You may simply select install alongside with windows - simple and effective solution - this way skip all the other points - installer will do the job)\n\n*Delete the partition you were\nplanning to install Ubuntu to.\n\n*In its place create SWAP (you\ncan select it in filesystem dropbox\nwhen creating)\n\n*and a partition with mountpoint \" / \"\n\n*Optionaly you can create a partition for \" /home \" folder\nmountpoint\n\n*OR set one of NTFS partitions as home (NOT RECOMMENDED - never\ntried and I doubt it would work\nwell).\n\n", "Q: What E-mail clients are available?

If so, how?\n\nA: You should just use GNOME Shell in 11.10, it will work as expected.\n\nA: Your best bet is to wait for 11.10 to come out and if you dont whanna wait then u can try the beta. Unless you whant to make the work rysking data,but still to make it easy and if i were you i would just wait for the 11.10 oneiric oncelot to come out because they have GNOME 3 available along side unity and what your triyng to do is higly risky and nearly impossibly {note:i said nearly}\n\nA: I'm reasonably certain that those will only run if you have gnome3 fully installed. Unity does not run on Gnome3 at the moment, so you will probably have to run them through Gnome-Shell (which is quite nice by the way)\nEdit: See comment by Uri Herrera below for more detail.\n\nA: Try to uninstall notify-osd package and restart.\n", "Q: Automatically start at specific time like BIOS? Some BIOSes have an option to start the computer from a fully off state (not suspended) at a specific 'alarm' time. Is there any command or way to set this in Ubuntu without restarting and going to the BIOS?\n(I have a server+router running for a school network and sometimes some random (well intentioned) people think it needs to be off at the end of the school day. I figure the best way to avoid getting calls at random times that the network quit working is to have a cron job every minute that sets the 'alarm wake' time as 2 minutes from now. That way it would auto start itself.)\n\nA: An operating system itself cannot bring hardware out of a completely-off state, as the OS is not running at that time. If there was any OS-level software to write to your BIOS, it would be proprietary software specific to the BIOS and motherboard etc., and highly unlikely to exist as an ubuntu command. Sorry.\nBIOS options such as Wake On Lan, or your auto-start feature are one option. The other is a hardware solution similar to what some tv tuner cards do by getting hard wired into the power button in order to trigger power-on events. In cases like this, cron job could be used to constantly update the wake-time for the tuner card.\n\nA: Easy. First you need to check if your computer supports wake-up on RTC. Most computers created in the last 10 years support this feature. First you need to enable RTC in BIOS settings, this is done in the boot process. On my BIOS it's possible to configure what S-signals the wake-up should respond to. Because I like to save energy I completely let my computer power down in between automatic startups and shutdowns.\nAfter BIOS is setup, boot up Linux and issue command dmesg |grep rtc. This tells you if you have RTC wake-up enabled. My output gives:\n~$ dmesg |grep rtc\n[    0.962976] rtc_cmos 00:03: RTC can wake from S4\n[    0.963096] rtc_cmos 00:03: rtc core: registered rtc_cmos as rtc0\n[    0.963119] rtc0: alarms up to one month, 242 bytes nvram\n\nTo set the wakeup time you need to be root. As root issue command:\necho 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\n\nThe above command should be used before you write a new wake-up time to the file, otherwise the wake-up resource will be busy.\nIf you want your computer to start up in 10 minutes in the future issue command:\necho `date '+%s' -d '+ 10 minutes'` > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\n\nCheck if alarm is set by issuing cat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm. If you get a bunch of digits it means that the alarm is set and if the file is empty there was something wrong with the date.\nTo check a more human readable format issue command cat /proc/driver/rtc.\nSo, if you want your computer to start 2 minutes after someone turns it off, execute a script that looks something like this from your crontab(this script will require root access, so be aware):\n#!/bin/bash\necho 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\necho `date '+%s' -d '+ 2 minutes'` > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\n\nSave the planet. :)\n\nA: There should be a way to do this... I know I've seen it work on an MSI motherboard in Windows. One of MSI's programs was able to set the wake-on-timer state/time in the BIOS from Windows. What's probably needed is just the right BIOS calls to do this. I looked around once and couldn't find anything, but I didn't look too hard. I'll try looking again and post here if I find them. I'm betting that a tool to do this could be very universal, unlike what drgrog believes, because most motherboard vendors are getting their BIOSes from one of two vendors and few do any extensive modifications to them. \n", "Q: Anyone have the Aspeed ast2050 vga working from a Tyan S7025?

I want to set the 'Path' variable in a .desktop file relative to the location where the desktop file is located and I can't manage to do that. \nWhen I don't declare it or set it to blank it defaults to my home folder no matter where I run it from; and it doesn't accept values relative to my current location within the file system.\n\nA: You cannot set the CWD inside a .desktop file. If you want an application to have a specific CWD, you will need to write a simple wrapper script for the application, that looks something like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n(cd /where/you/want/it/to/be && exec your_program)\n\nYou can replace your_program there with $@ and run the script with your_program as an argument, like run-in-dir.sh your_program. This way you can use the same script to wrap any program you want to start in that directory.\n\nA: I used this: \nExec=bash -c 'cd $(dirname %k) && ./SCRIPT_NAME'\n\nThe %k is the full name of the .desktop file including its path. It's then used by dirname to get a location and change directory to that location. Finally, now that it's in the right place, it finds the script and runs it.\n\nA: You can kludge around this by using an in-line bash mini-script on your Exec. This will add the .desktop file's path to PATH prior to running your command.\nExec=bash -c \"export PATH=$PATH:`dirname %k`; your_command\"\n\n%k will be substituted by the path of the desktop file itself. The dirname command chops off the filename part, leaving only the directory.

It is easily done automatically from within Ubuntu. \nsudo crontab -e\nadd to the bottom:\n0 22 * * * /sbin/shutdown -h now\nAnd your system shuts down at 22:00 (of course change the 22 to an appropriate time for you).\nBooting the system automatically depends on your current hardware: your system might support Wake On Lan (WOL). That way you can reboot it remotely. \n\nA: Problem: Hard Drive\nThe main problem is, that on a sudden powerdown some changes might be made to the hard drive, that are not welcome (e.g. an important write operation is interrupted or the read head hits the disk). So the main problems with a poweroutage is the disk.\nSoftware solution: \"Frozen system\"\nOnce I read about a \"frozen system\" that was loaded form hdd into ram. Then the hdd was unmounted. This way the hdd will not get damaged by a power outage. The downside is, that no changes that are made to the ram booted system will persist.\nI tried to find the article about that, but was out of luck so far.

Can i upgrade my linux Kernel 2.6.38 to the new one 2.6.39.1? Is it safe and stable to upgrade it in my Ubuntu Natty?\nTHNX!\n\nA: Kernel PPA\nThe Ubuntu Kernel team have a PPA which they maintain with the latest version of the kernel for Natty - having just checked, the current version in the repo is 2.6.39-0.5\nMainline Builds\nIf you want to test more vanilla Kernel Builds then the kernel team also do nightly builds as well as builds for each release candidate.\nFor example - the new v3 kernel builds are available - these are tagged as -oneric.  Obviously these builds are specifically been built for the next version of ubuntu in mind.  Also, if you install them, you'll need to keep up-to-date yourself.\nChange info for Kernel 2.6.39\nHowever - there is little point in upgrading a kernel unless you are having serious issues with you current official Natty kernel.  What do you expect to gain?\nIs it \"safe and stable\" - arguable terms.  Linus T calls it stable.  There are many thousands of users using 2.6.38 in Natty and many of the latest distros.\nLinus produces a change-log for each kernel release.  In my mind, this is a bit deep for me.  There are a few sites, such as this, that explains what new changes are available a bit more clearly.\n\nA: i advise to get it one step forward and install kernel 3.0.0 (also known as 2.6.40 but officially it's 3.0)\nIt's release candidate and  so far working perfectly for me (fixing described above bug with radeon)\n\nA: I installed it.\nNOT stable, had serious issues with my ATI card, ran occasionally with Unity but usually just failed to load the GUI, ran OK in Failsafe mode - but what fun is that?\nI'm anything but an expert but I had a lot of difficulty getting back to the previous kernel.\nObviosly works for some, but unless you are prepared for fun and games ....\n", "Q: Problems to boot on Natty with Kernel 2.6.39.1 I've installed this new Kernel version (2.6.39.1) and it seems to me that isn't stable.

I have given up on Wine (very frustrating). So I thought I'd install Windows XP as a guest OS in VirtualBox. In so doing, here are my basic questions:\n1) If I install XP as a guest OP in VirtualBox, will I still need to maintain/update Windows regularly as I do now on its existing sda1 partition to keep it secure?\n2) Is it recommended/better to install VirtualBox on a new, separate partition instead of on my current sda7 (/home) partition?\n3) Does VirtualBox really require a minimum 20GB HDD space?\n4) Does the memory dedicated to VirtualBox reduce the memory available to Windows only when running a VirtualBox machine, or all the time?\nAnything else I should know? Thanks for helping out a beginner!\n\nA: \n1) If I install exP as a guest OP in\n  VirtualBox, will I still need to\n  maintain/update Windows regularly as I\n  do now on its existing sda1 partition\n  to keep it secure?\n\nYes and No - If you intend to access the internet then you'll need to regularly update your windows XP virtual guest.  However, if you edit the virtual box network settings and disable the network adapter - then you'll have a very isolated virtual guest, both to ubuntu and the outside world!\n\n2) Is it recommended/better to install\n  VirtualBox on a new, separate\n  partition instead of on my current\n  sda7 (/home) partition?\n\nThere isn't a strong recommendation either way - it depends.  If you like to regularly backup your home partition but dont want to regularly backup your guest virtuals, then put your guest virtuals on a dedicated partition you will not often backup.\n\n3) Does VirtualBox really require a\n  minimum 20GB hhd space?\n\nVirtualBox requirements are described here - it says 30MB (megabytes not gigabytes).\nYou could try to remove unwanted files yourself such as help etc. - however if you are short of disk space - then virtualisation isnt really for you, because you need to allocate large chunks of disk space for your virtual guests.\n\n4) Does the memory dedicated to\n  VirtualBox reduce the memory available\n  to Windows only when running a\n  VirtualBox machine, or all the time?\n\nThe amount of memory virtualbox allocates to windows is up-to you when you define the guest settings.  Your ubuntu host will obviously suffer if you try to overallocate more than the recommended memory settings.\nIf you are not running a virtual guest, virtualbox itself doesn't \"reserve\" any extra memory (i.e. the amount you have allocated to the guest) other than for just running the virtualbox application itself.\n\nA: If it's only one single, not 3D-graphics dependend, and not Wine compatible application you need to run it is a good idea to do this in a virtual machine such as Virtual Box.\nBy doing so you will have the same limitations to your virtual guest OS as you have from a real install. That is, if your virtual OS is connected to the internet you are faced the same risks. This is why it is recommended to have an anti-virus software running on the virtual OS, or to never connect this virtual machine to the internet.\nThe virtual OS will be installed in a file on your host Ubuntu hard disk (preferably in your HOME to ease backups) that will grow up to the limit you defined when installing the virtual hard disk. Therefore there is no need to limit the disk space beforehand.\nTo further reduce hard disk usage you may consider to install a reduced version of Windows XP, e.g. by removing unwanted programs with nLite.\nMemory usage for Virtual Box depends on the application you are running. Try not to allocate more than half of your installed RAM to the virtual machine to avoid problems from the host. A minimum of 512 MB is needed to run XP.\nI recommend you install virtual box by adding the repository from Oracle to your sources to make sure you have recent updates.\nAlso you may need to install dkms to avoid problems after host kernel updates. After installation of virtual box you will also need to install GuestAdditions for full features.\n", "Q: Check if IP is static or dynamic programmatically I'm trying to determine whether my IP has been statically or dynamically assigned in Ubuntu 11.04 from within C. The closest I've come is examining /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases, but that doesn't change if a static IP is assigned (as it caches DHCP leases for future connection attempts).\nSo... is there a command line utility (for Ubuntu) that will allow me to check if DHCP is enabled or disabled?\nAlternatively: the machine is a server dedicated to one application; would it be easier just to maintain an environment variable that keeps track of DHCP status?\n\nA: You can put scripts in /etc/network/if-up.d to be executed when an interface is activated (either by ifup or by Network Manager). These scripts receive information about the interface, including the environment variable $METHOD set to static or dhcp. This is documented in the interfaces(5) man page.\n#!/bin/sh\n## This is /etc/network/if-up.d/zzzz_alex_notify_myserver\ncase $LOGICAL in\n  eth0)\n    case $METHOD in\n      dhcp) <notify server that it's on DHCP>;;\n      static) <notify server that it's on a static IP configuration>;;\n    esac;;\nesac\n\n\nA: I guess you're referring to the IP assignment of your ubuntu machine locally and not your external/public IP.\nPerhaps the following output could be of some help:  \ncat /etc/network/interfaces |grep ^iface\\ eth0 | awk -F ' ' '{print $4}'\nThis will print either the word static or dhcp, depending on the current configuration of interface eth0.\nYou can also make small adjustments, like:  \ncat /etc/network/interfaces |grep ^iface\\ | awk -F ' ' '{print $2, $4}' \nin order to list all of the interfaces and their configuration.\n\nA: Another way is to use NetworkManager tools, namely nm-tool and nmcli.\nI writed the following script on this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# get the connection id of the active connection    \nget_con_id() {\n  nm-tool |\n    awk '\n      $1 == \"-\" {\n        dev = $3\n        id = dev\n        if (NF > 4 && match($0, \"\\\\[(.*)\\\\]\", a))\n          id = a[1]\n      }\n      /^ / && $1 == \"State:\" && $2 == \"connected\" {\n        print id\n      }'\n}\n\n# get the address type of the active connection\nnmcli con list id \"$(get_con_id)\" |\n  awk '\n    $1 == \"ipv4.method:\" {\n      if ($2 == \"manual\")\n        print \"static\"\n      else if ($2 == \"auto\")\n        print \"dynamic\"\n      else\n        print \"unknown\"\n    }'\n\nIt probably break in non usual cases, e.g. where you have more than one active connection, but could be a starting point on which to elaborate.\nAlso, if you modify a connection, the script will see the new settings, even if the connection has not been restarted, so they are not in use yet.\n\nA: I've written this command to get the DHCP configured interfaces in a shell script:\nps -A -o cmd | grep -E '(/| )dhclient .'\n\nThen you can discard interfaces not managed by dhclient.\nAt the moment I don't know if it works for all GNU/Linux distributions.\n\nA: Its much easier to determine that:\nJust disconnect the machine from network.\nIf you can see the ip address in the ifconfig output for that interface \nthen it is statically assigned otherwise dynamically.\nregards\ndelaflota\n", "Q: Graphics problems with applications For some reason, I've got some graphical issues sometimes. Mostly with AbiWord, LibreOffice (and OpenOffice.org), and Wine applications. I've added some screenshots below t oclarify a bit.\nThis is not a problem that recently popped up. As a matter of fact, I've always had it since Ubuntu 8.10, and there never came an update to fix it. I'm currently using Linux Mint 10 (based upon Ubuntu 10.10), but as I already said, that doesn't really say much as I'va also had this problem with Linux Mint 8, Ubuntu 8.10, Ubuntu 9.04, Ubuntu 9.10 and Ubuntu 10.04. It was never a big problem, as I rarely used any text processing programs. But recently, I'm starting to use them more and more, and it's really annoying being unable to work because of this problem. When I first open an application, everything looks normal, then after a while (when I highlight, click, ... an item) they'll suddenly screw up. This also happens when I move or resize the window. Sometimes when this happens, I can just minimize the window, and when i restore it, sometimes it will be gone (for a few seconds at least) or it will have changed positions.\nI'm using the nvidia-current graphics card driver.

If you're using openJDK, have you tried using Sun Java (and purging OJDK)? I can't speak for AbiWord, and your \"Wine programs\" is too vague, but I know LO/OO.o runs on Java, and Java issues sometimes manifest as UI issues.

Both blank screen and ACPI disabled are not acceptable.

Saw three levels of optimization for code, \"Light\", \"Medium\" and \"Strong\". It warned that strong would lead to system instability, so I opted for Medium. \nIs there an observable difference between the levels of optimization?\nShould I just go -O3?\n\nA: I'd say this hardly depends on the code you are compiling.\nWhatever you choose there, will end up as flag for GCC, so following GCC's manpage:\n\n-O, -O1. With -O the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time.\n-O2 Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  As compared to -O, this option increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.\n-O3 Optimize yet more.  -O3 turns on all optimizations specified by -O2 and also turns on the -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops, -fpredictive-commoning, -fgcse-after-reload, -ftree-vectorize and -fipa-cp-clone options.\n\nYou can run\ngcc -O<1-3> -Q --help=optimizers\n\nto see the set of activated optimization methods for each optimization level.\nThe more aggressive they are, the bigger the risk that the compiler will screw something up (should not happen, and I don't know how likely something will happen, but if you want to be on the safe side, I suggest you follow apt-build's recommendation not to use -O3/Strong).\n", "Q: How can I enable wake-on-lan permanently? I want to enable wake-on-lan for my network cards, for always. The community guide recommends adding the relevant command to /etc/network/interfaces. In past experiences editing Ubuntu conf files, it's extremely likely that the network interface file is written anew every boot, if not every apt upgrade. What's the best way to ensure that wake-on-lan is enabled every boot?\n\nA: Create new file, let's say wakeonlanconfig, and put below lines to it:\n#!/bin/bash\nethtool -s eth0 wol g\nexit\n\nNext set the permissions of the file, making it executable:\nchmod a+x wakeonlanconfig\n\nAnd finally make the script run on startup:\nupdate-rc.d -f wakeonlanconfig defaults\n\nFor mor details please visit: http://lukasz-lademann.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-set-up-wol-wake-on-lan-on-thin.html\n\nA: A boot script run after the network cards are configured should do the trick. Ubuntu uses upstart. After reading about upstart jobs, ethtool, writing an upstart script, and searching the interwebs for a better solution, I came up with this from jevinskie (you'll want to put this in a file in /etc/init):\nstart on started network\n\nscript\n    for interface in $(cut -d: -f1 /proc/net/dev | tail -n +3); do\n        logger -t 'wakeonlan init script' enabling wake on lan for $interface\n        ethtool -s $interface wol g\n    done\nend script\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Starts when the nics are initialised\n\n*Grabs the nic names from /proc/net/dev\n\n*Logs actions to syslog\n\n*Acts on all nics found\n\n*Requires ethtool, so make sure it's installed first:\nsudo apt-get install ethtool\n\nIf you want to imbue just one nic with the power of awakening, something like this is more appropriate:\nstart on started network\n\nscript\n    interface=eth0\n    logger -t 'wakeonlan init script' enabling wake on lan for $interface\n    ethtool -s $interface wol g\nend script\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04 additionally set WOL_DISABLE=N in /etc/default/tlp to avoid getting WOL disabled by TLP power management.\nhttp://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html\nAdd NETDOWN=no in /etc/default/halt to prevent powering off the network card during shutdown\n\nA: For me, using Netplan configurations worked (both for enabling and disabling WOL) since I am using Ubuntu.\nCheck this similar question about how to enable it. Canonical also provided some nice documentation on how to use Netplan:\n\n*\n\n*Netplan YAML configurations\n\n*Testing a Netplan YAML config\nSteps I followed\nFor my specific case, I wanted to disable Wake on Lan, but this boils down to just setting a boolean to true/false.\n\n*\n\n*I created this Netplan config YAML (you need sudo access to create a file in that dir):\n\n# /etc/netplan/02-disable-wol.yaml\nnetwork:\n  version: 2\n  renderer: NetworkManager\n  ethernets:\n    eth-no-wakeonlan:\n      match:\n        macaddress: \"11:22:33:44:55:66\" # The eth interface's MAC address\n      wakeonlan: false # To enable, set to true\n      dhcp4: false # To enable, set to true\n\n\n\n*To test this configuration, I ran sudo netplan try, which applies the configurations for some minutes before reverting.\nNOTE: Apparently, it's a known bug that netplan try fails to revert the configs. This tutorial says that a reboot should be enough (and deleting the yaml file, I assume)\n\n\n*Then, I had to open the Ubuntu Network Settings UI to switch to the newly created ethernet interface netplan-eth-no-wakeonlan.\n\n\n*Done!\nOn boot, Ubuntu should read all the files in /etc/netplan/*.yaml and apply their configs.\n", "Q: Where can I locate the Gnome Classic Panel \"Quick Launcher\" icons in Unity I spend some time between both worlds, Unity and Gnome Classic (No Effects) and I would like to know where can I find the quick launch icons of the Gnome Classic panel in Unity so i can simply drag&drop them in the Unity Launcher.\n\nA: Normally, we import in your unity launcher icons existing launchers from gnome-panel, netbook-launcher, unity maverick, your desktop content and some docks like cairo-dock, docky, awn the first time you launch it. It tries to agregate duplicates to have just one icon in the launcher per application (but take into account custom applications path) \nYou can force that to happen again by:\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting your launcher icon in unity to default: gsettings reset com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites (this is not mandatory, but at least, you start from a well-known base)\n\n*reset the migration tag to the first : gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorite-migration \"'3.0'\"\n\n*logout and login in the unity session, unity should trigger the migration tool at start\n\n*if you are interested in logs, you will find them at \n~/.cache/unity/migration_script.log\n\n(~/.cache corresponding to $XDG_CACHE_HOME if you redefined it)\n\nA: I don't think there's anywhere that the launchers themselves are stored, although there appears to be a list of them in gconf-editor > apps > panel and then somewhere in there, I can only see the default things as I don't use Gnome classic. However, it's probably best just to remember what you have, or look at it in there and then add them manually to the launcher. Just search for the application in the dash and then drag and drop it onto the launcher.\n", "Q: What happened to the kbib package?

NXserver's shadow mode)-- has faulty privileges. Even when run as root!\nAny comments on a way to fix the problematic behavior for the VNC/non-shadow NX sessions?\n\nI'm upgrading my home Ubuntu headless server after a long while, and I'm having lots of problems that I do not remember existing in previous Ubuntu versions.\nSome details:\n\n\n*\n\n*I started with ubuntu-11.04-server-amd64.iso and then installed ubuntu-desktop on-top of it.\n\n*uname -a: Linux MiddleEarth 2.6.38-8-server #42-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 11 03:49:04 UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n*The hardware is Intel D920, 2GB Ram, gfx is some fan-less nvidia 6600, 3xGigabit, 1x100mbit, no monitor,keyboard,mouse attached.\n\n\n\nRound 1\nWhile I was doing the testing/setting up with a monitor attached, everything was peachy, both when sitting infront of that monitor and when VNCing in from my desktop machine (into vino).\nWithout a monitor though problems arise:\n[Unsolved/Dropped]\nThe very first problem was vino being stubborn and not liking to load before/during GDM. But since this is a headless system, I dont really need it to start with X by default (ie change the init level) anyways, so that's a bit moot. However, I distinctly remember this being very easy to do in an older ubuntu version ( v9.04 I think ). And it worked fine; but not any more!? ... anyways I dropped that idea altogether.\n[Solved]\nThen it was Unity/effects messing VNC (Solved it by cheating).\n[Unsolved]\nI originally switched to NXserver hoping that maybe the following problems are tightvnc or vino issues, but no such luck. (Note: read round2)\nWhen remoting in via VNC (or NXserver) my user account loses the ability to mount/unmount HDDs.\n\nWhen remoting in via VNC (or NXserver) my user account cannot access some priviledged configuration options, \nsome examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*cannot do anything (ie. 'add' a user or 'advanced settings') in \"System -> Administration -> Users and Groups\".\n\n*cannot use 'unlock' in \"System -> Administration -> Login Screen\".\n\n*gparted fails to get any information about the filesystems.\n\n*etc. (various other admin/config dialogues don't properly work either)\n\n\nI can only guess this has something to do with user privileges not being assigned properly when an actual physical monitor device is not connected. \nThe reason 'WHY' this happens in ubuntu 11.04, when it is headless, escapes me; I do not remember this behaviour in previous versions of ubuntu.\nDo note that the HDD mounting problem is a non-issue for internal/static hdds (I just add them to fstab since they're static anyways). But really a big pain for removable usb media.\nThe rest of the problems, I have not figured out how to fix...\nI know what you're thinking... log in to ssh, sudo su, and run vncserver under root entirely?\n\nSurprise Surprise! root's gui is broken too: gparted fails to get info, user&groups is entirely grayed out (this is a different behaviour than my regular user). Weirdly enough the Login screen administration proggy seems to work fine.\n\nRound 2\n( NOTE: I do not know if this did or did not make a difference to the outcome. At some point between round 1 and round 2, I applied the changes mentioned in posts #21 and #24 in this thread )\nThe regular tightvnc/NXServer sessions have the same behaviour, BUT...\n[Partial Solution/The actual problem is still there]\nIn the NXClient connection settings, when I choose the 'shadow' mode (shadow attaches you to the native display, ie. desktop shadowing)...\nEverything works perfect inside this session!\nOne thing I noticed is that it immediately asks me for a keyring password... maybe the whole mess has something to do with the keyring system gnome uses?\nBut, if I connect with a regular (not shadow) NX connection, or a regular vnc it goes back to having the same problems.\nP.S. There were a couple of days inbettween when I wrote round1 and round2 (I was keeping it in a txt file locally). I was testing out various sugestions to see what would work, which is why I don't know for sure if that xorg.conf VNC device edit or that nomodeset setting made a difference.\n[EDIT 2011-06-10]\nNXServer and GDM\nAt the time of writing I had set the system up to auto-login, which was why the shadow connection just simply worked. When I later disabled that and rebooted the system, NX gave an error, but with a little bit of Googling I found this thread\nThese are the uncommenting & changes I did on my /usr/NX/etc/server.cfg:\nEnableAdministratorLogin = \"1\"\nEnableSessionShadowing = \"1\"\nEnableInteractiveSessionShadowing = \"1\"\nEnableSessionShadowingAuthorization = \"0\"\nEnableDesktopSharing = \"1\"\nEnableInteractiveDesktopSharing = \"1\"\nEnableFullDesktopSharing = \"1\"\nEnableAdministratorDesktopSharing = \"1\"\nEnableDesktopSharingAuthorization = \"0\"\nEnableSystemDesktopSharingAuthorization = \"0\"\n\n(If it was a more public network, ie university/large office I'd probably use a little stricter settings, but these suit me fine.)\nAfter a reboot I logged in with nxclient to the desktop 'shadow' (native display) setting and got GDM! :D\nUnfortunately clipboard doesn't work in the 'shadow' session (It works on the other/regular ones fine)\n[EDIT 2011-06-11]\nStumbled upon Xvfb but it has the same issues when used like this:\nXvfb :2 -ac -screen 0 1280x1024x32 -pixdepths 8 24  2>&1 >/dev/null &\nexport DISPLAY=:2\ngnome-session --session=2d-gnome 2>&1 >/dev/null &\nx11vnc --display :2 --passwd blahblah\n\n\nA: I located the culprit.\nTested on a fresh install, confirmed it's a bug.\nI submitted a bug report\nIn short the issue is: The polkit authentication dialogue will show up on DISPLAY :0 instead of DISPLAY :1 where the VNC/NX session is.\nA workaround may be to use libpam-keyring to auto authenticate upon login.\nor... scratch that, that probably would not do it, a change for all policy kit settings from 'auth_admin' to just 'yes' would probably fix the issue, and that of course would make policyKit moot altogether... sigh\n\nA: I think this is the correct PolicyKit behavior.\nThe policy for Active, Inactive and Any other user are different, so when you are connected through NX you are not Active (clients in active sessions on local consoles), nor Inactive (clients in inactive sessions on local consoles), but you result as Any user.\nYou can see the default policy for the Action under policy control for the different type of users with the command\npkaction --verbose\n\nAs you can see, the user of type Any is limited with comparison to Active users.\nTo remedy, you can modify the default policy. In the following a suggest an awk script to create a policy kit file to put in the right location. This is the script:\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\n\n/^[^ ]/ {\n  action = substr($0, 1, length($0) - 1)\n}\n/^ / {\n  if ($1 == \"description:\") {\n    $1 = \"\"\n    description = substr($0, 2)\n    if (description == \"\")\n      description = action\n  } else if ($1 == \"implicit\") {\n    if ($2 == \"any:\")\n      any = $3\n    else if ($2 == \"inactive:\")\n      inactive = $3\n    else if ($2 == \"active:\") {\n      active = $3\n      print \"\"\n      print \"[\" description \"]\"\n      print \"Identity=unix-group:admin\"\n      print \"Action=\" action\n      print \"ResultActive=\"   active\n      print \"ResultInactive=\" active\n      print \"ResultAny=\"      active\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSuppose you call it create-policy. Make it executable, the execute the script with\npkaction --verbose | ./create-policy > local.pkla \n\nthen move the resulting file:\nsudo mv local.pkla /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/\n\nYou now should have the same right as you were a local session user.\n\nA: I was running into a similar issue with NX and found the following thread:\nWhy do I get Unity instead of Classic when using NX?\nI edited my Windows NX client so the desktop is set to Unix & Custom, then set it to run the following command: \ngnome-session --session=classic-gnome\n\nAnd selected New Virtual Desktop.\nAfter that I was good to go.\n", "Q: Banshee not able to get track information? Everytime I try to copy a CD to Banshee I get an \"unable to fetch track information\" message?

I often get the 'unable to fetch track info' error message in Banshee, and most of the time have no problem with Sound Juicer. It seems that when there is a conflict (there are two possible titles for the given cd), Banshee throws this message. Sound Juicer on the other hand has a dialog asking which is the 'correct' title.

The only caveat is that the information might not be the most up to date.\nUse Asunder if you want more file type & album & file naming options & control over output file quality (e.g. bitrate/compression level). All of the metadata is compatible with Banshee, can be fully edited using Banshee, AND will be FULLY updated in terms of ACTUAL folder & file names, the only exception being that edited WAV files may show 'unknown artist' or 'unknown album' in a personal/portable music player.\nIn my experience, no other (Linux) media player or tag editor has this capacity, which is what makes Banshee perfect for creating compilation albums.\nAsunder alongside Banshee is the best combination I have ever found.\n", "Q: Unity desktop launcher and bars look garbled with  Ati Radeon I just installed Ubuntu 11.04 32-bit on my old P4-Ati Radeon rig.

This should be temporarily solved by choosing Ubuntu Classic as a session when you login. \nUbuntu 11.10 will be released in less than one week. It should have fixed these things, so I think the best choice is to use Ubuntu Classic until then and then upgrade to the new Ubuntu. I would actually not recommend installing the proprietary drivers. At least on HD 5850, the open drivers are much better on 11.10. They're better for most things in 11.04 as well. \n", "Q: Can I run fsck or e2fsck when Linux file system is mounted? I mean I'm already here right. If not, why?\n\nA: No. \nDo not run fsck on a live or mounted file system. fsck is used to check and optionally repair a Linux file systems. Running fsck on a mounted filesystem can usually result in disk and/or data corruption. \nThis will force a check on next boot:\nsudo touch /forcefsck\nSo will this but it will also reboot the machine at the moment you hit enter:\nshutdown -rF now\nThere are more ways (like telling the machine to go to init 1 and then umount the partition/disc your want to check) but these 2 are the easiest.\n", "Q: How can I try Ubuntu without changing anything on my computer? I've never used Linux before and I'm a little unsure.\n\nA: You can also install Ubuntu using Wubi (windows installer).\nLive CD is good, but it's slow and uncomortable. If you want to try out everything, mount the CD image via Daemon tools while using windows, open the cd in explorer and look for wubi.exe program inside. It also might use autorun.\nRun it and follow the instructions.\nLater you can remove it just like any other Windows program: uninstal.exe file.\nHowever, not everything will work well. For example you will have to write more passwords and the speed won't be as good as in normal install.\n\nA: Download Ubuntu iso from Ubuntu site. Burn it into a CD. Then boot it and enter into Live CD mode to try ubuntu without causing any change to the existing system.\nOther way without even burning the iso is install virtual box and try it there.\n\nA: you can use Virtualbox to virtually load Ubuntu os on your existing operating system,\nyou can run multiple OS simultaneously using virtualbox\nDownload Ubuntu VM and load in virtualbox\nhttps://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview\nIf you literally don't want to change anything on your computer and try Ubuntu\nGo to AWS and get a Ubuntu EC2 instance\nor go to any cloud provider and get a ubuntu instance\n\nA: Download the ISO from Ubuntu.com and follow the directions on the site. \nPut the disc in your drive and boot up the computer. It will boot into the live environment. Live meaning it is running off the CD/DVD disk and RAM but not off your hard drive. It will not touch the hard drive at all. \nYou have to boot from the CD if it does not do this automatically. You may have to press a certain key to get to the boot menu while starting up. This depends on your computer but is usually F12 to bring up the boot menu and F1,F10, or Delete, to bring up the BIOS menu. You need to change the boot order of your computer to boot from the CD/DVD device first.  It should say what key to press on the boot screen. :) Have fun!\nAlternatively WUBI installs along side your main operating system and can then be accessed as an option from the start menu. It then runs in side windows, and can be uninstalled at any time later. \n\nA: using live cd / live usb.\nand yeah you can run it on windows using WUBI\n\nA: Simply use the ubuntu cd.\nIf u have one or if u don't have then download the iso and write it to the cd or probably mount the iso or image file in a virtual drive using poweriso or something similar to that...i guess nowadays nero also mount images to a drive....\nThen just simply run the program or cd or image extracted file.....then u will be guided automatically...\nIt is really simple .... it is like installing a windows software only.\nAlso u can run the live cd and use it without installing it in your system.\nHope  \n", "Q: Photo album making software Looking for some good software for making photo albums for my personal use. Seen some good programs in windows that generate flash albums. \n\nA: As noted briefly on the Ubuntu forums, quite a good way of arranging a scrapbook or album of photos is by using Scribus, using one of the Python scripts from the Scribus wiki, and then exporting the album as a pdf.\nSo, first run\nsudo apt-get install scribus\n\nThen go the Scribus wiki page and save, for example, the first script to file and make it executable. Now load up Scribus, and from within the program go to Script > Execute Script > choose location of script. Then via the script dialogue you can choose the number of images to be displayed on a page, and select the folder of images to be used. (You can either pre-prepare a special folder with the images you want or just choose any folder with images.) The Scribus document will include them all, however many there are, although it will take longer to create if there are a lot of images. \nOnce your document is created you can add titles and captions, and export it as a pdf so that it can be shared. It is of course possible to modify the Python scripts and create one that suits your particular needs. The scripts may of course need to be updated when new versions of Scribus come out. \nI have found this is a good way of creating a personalised album without recourse to java or flash based programs.\nThe screenshot below shows the pictures imported in Scribus, but before the captions and any title page are added. You don't need to worry about this becoming a complex  desktop publishing project, as it is very easy and fast to create your own albums.\n \n\nA: I love Google's \"Picasa\". A great program for managing pictures. You can also create movies, slideshows or upload photos to \"Picasa Web Albums\".\nYou can download the .deb from http://picasa.google.lt/linux/\nDownload the .deb file wherever you like, such as to your Downloads folder.\nThen, one way to install it is to double-click on it--the Software Center or GDebi will open, prompt you for your password, and all you to install.\nAnother way to install it, after downloading it, is to open the Terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, type sudo dpkg -i (including the space at the end), then drag the .deb file from the graphical file browser into the Terminal and press Enter in the Terminal. This will run the necessary command to install it in the Terminal.\nHowever you install Picasa, you can run it by searching for it in the Unity Dash and clicking on it in the search results.\n", "Q: How can I quickly make a large file?

I don't know what triggered this, but now I can't see the menu-bar of my applications lying in the top panel, rather, they are now integrated with the application, so like 10.10 and unlike 11.04\nIs anybody having any fix for this?\n(segregated from this question)\n\nA: I don't know if this is going to work, but you might just give it a try:\nmetacity --replace\n\nIf that doesn't work, try choosing 'Ubuntu Classic' down in the login screen, do a little browsing, log out or restart, then choose 'Ubuntu' again.\nIt might just work.\nGood luck\n\nA: \"unity --replace\" is a risky command to run in the Terminal, because if you ever close the terminal, Ubuntu reverts to a state as you described.

I wonder if I install a kernel from the Ubuntu Kernel PPA and have 10.04 LTS as my version, because I like the long support period, will they follow the same end of support time?\n10.04 LTS desktop has april 2013 and server has april 2015 as end of support. If I look at the Ubuntu Kernel PPA site I cannot find any references to how long they will commit to provide updates. Can I have any expectations at all since it is a PPA?\nThe kernel packages in 10.04 are supported to april 2015 according to Synaptic.\nI don't want to end up with a system that has updates available for everything but the kernel.\n\nA: If you're interested in stability assurance & tech support from Canonical, then a PPA kernel will definitely void that. In https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds they write:\n\n\"The mainline kernels builds are\n  produced for debugging purposes and\n  therefore come with no support. Use\n  them at your own risk.\"\n\nIf you're talking about them continuing with updates, I'd guess they would try - the current LTS is going to have plenty of users, and they don't have to test that much since it's not officially supported. However, some future kernel could include changes that would make it incompatible with 10.04 and they may not bother fixing that.\n", "Q: Where to install unpackaged applications? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat is the best place to install user apps? \n\nI use Mac and Windows and I'm switching on Ubuntu.

See bluez docs for whats available.\n      if props.get(\"Class\") == 0x240404:\n        if props.get(\"Connected\"):\n          print(\"Found headset {} ({}) but it is already connected\"\n                .format(props.get(\"Name\"), props.get(\"Address\")))\n          continue\n        return path\n\ndbus_loop = DBusGMainLoop()\nbus = dbus.SystemBus(mainloop=dbus_loop)\nhpath = find_headset(bus)\n\nif hpath:\n  adapter = dbus.Interface(\n      bus.get_object(\"org.bluez\", hpath), \"org.bluez.Device1\")\n  adapter.Connect()\n\nthis example, like the other example on this thread, uses the dbus python package. On ubuntu 16.04 I installed this through apt-get install python-dbus. \nIf you wish to match other criteria, this document appears to show a list of properties that can be queried over dbus. \nI have this script saved in ~/.local/bin/bt-connect-headset which is on my PATH so I can execute it from the i3 launcher. Make it executable (chmod +x bt-connect-headset) if you plan to use it as a command. \nThis script has only been tested on an up-to-date ubuntu 16.04 as of 09/28/2018. \n\nA: Bluetooth daemon\nIn the default installation a daemon (bluetoothd) runs in the background (run from the file /etc/init.d/bluetooth). This daemon takes care on recognizing and connecting to known bluetooth devices and may be cofigured with configuration files in /etc/bluetooth. For autoconneting a headset the following line in audio.conf should be uncommented (remove #):\nAutoConnect=true\n\nTo restart the daemon type sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart.\nRemark: Using the command line tool sudo hcitool cc <MAC-Adress> did not lead to a stable connection to a known device in the test environment here when the daemon was running.\n\nDBus\nIn order to connect a disconnected but physically present and paired headset we can use D-Bus from a script. Here's an example in python:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# Toggles headset connection\n\nimport dbus\nfrom dbus.mainloop.glib import DBusGMainLoop\n\ndbus_loop = DBusGMainLoop()\nbus = dbus.SystemBus(mainloop=dbus_loop)\n\n#Get dbus interface for headset\nmanager = bus.get_object('org.bluez', '/')\niface_m = dbus.Interface(manager, 'org.bluez.Manager')\nadapterPath = iface_m.DefaultAdapter()\nadapter = bus.get_object('org.bluez', adapterPath)\niface_a = dbus.Interface(adapter, 'org.bluez.Adapter')\ndevicePath = iface_a.ListDevices()[0]  # assuming first device\ndevice = bus.get_object('org.bluez', devicePath)\niface_h = dbus.Interface(device, 'org.bluez.Headset')\n\n#Check state of connection\nconnected = iface_h.IsConnected()\nprint 'Toggling connection. Please wait'\n# toggle connection\nif not connected:\n    try:\n        iface_h.Connect()\n        print 'Connecting: ', devicePath\n    except:\n        print 'Device not found'\nelse:\n    iface_h.Disconnect()\n    print 'Disconnecting: ', devicePath\n\nIn case we have more than one Bluetooth device we will have to adapt the devicePath appropriately, of course. The example above will connect a Headset. Change the interface to a different protocol for any other service (e.g. AudioSink).\n\nPulseaudio\nIf you know the MAC adress of your Bluetooth device you can connect it as an output sink for pulseaudio by:\npacmd set-default-sink bluez_sink.xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx\n\nWhere xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx is the MAC address (replace ':' by '_' for pulseaudio to recognize it).\nSee also this answer for more details.\n", "Q: How to get an encfs mount on the Unity launcher?

I am suffering from a xorg/Intel bug (specifically S-Video related: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/763688). This cropped up when I upgraded from Maverick to Natty.\nIs it possible and safe to install the old (Maverick) version of xserver-xorg-video-intel while keeping everything else? If so, how? (Preferably using a package rather than having to download and compile anything.) If it doesn't work, how do I revert?\n\nA: I chatted to a colleague who gave me this answer. It is possible, but not advisable.\nTo install an alternate package:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Synaptic Package Manager\n\n*From the menu select Settings | Repositories\n\n*Add the alternate source (in my case the maverick repo)\n\n*You should be prompted to reload sources, if not hit the Reload button\n\n*Find and select the package to downgrade\n\n*From the menu select Package | Force version...\n\n*Pick the older version\n\n*You will be warned that this may cause dependency errors\n\n*If you're feeling brave, go ahead\n\n\nReverting would involve undoing this process.

Knowing file extensions really helps to understand what a program is doing or using. What are some common one's and how do I extract them?\n\nA: Be aware that Linux doesn't care too much about file name extensions. It determines the file type based on the file's contents/MIME type, so knowing a file extension doesn't give too much insight into a program's usage pattern.\nSee What is the relationship between MIME types and File .extensions? and How are file-extensions/mime-types/icons/default applications associated? for more info.\n\nA: Technically, the list of known file extensions is stored in /usr/share/mime/globs. Here's a copy with nicer formatting.\nI'm not sure how to decide which file extensions are \"common\". This list claims to be \"common\" but I think I've only ever run across about five percent of it.\n\nA: File extension are up to the creator of the file. In Linux you can name something music.mp3 but if it is a text file it will open with gedit if that is your texteditor because it will look at the 1st bit/byte(?) where it says what kind of file it is.  \nWhen it comes to bash script it is considered best practise to not include .sh at the end. By omitting it you basically create a command so those do not tend to even have an extension. And those commands could be made in bash but also in perl or python.\nSo looking at the actual name of the file might be misleading!\nLinux has a command file to find out what a file is.

No updates will be released for that version. You need to upgrade Ubuntu to a newer version. I recommend doing a clean install.\nI see \"vps\" in your host name, your control panel might have an option to install a new image, perhaps a newer version is included. For server machines, the LTS version (currently Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid) is recommended since it longer supported (10.04 is supported till April 2015).\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I upgrade from 9.04 to 10.04.2?\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\n\nA: Ubuntu 9.04 has died. It has passed it live cycle. When a Ubuntu version is deprecated Canonical not only stops to give you security updates, its repositories go offline.\nSo no more apt-get for 9.04. You can check the live cycles here. The main lesson is that you must use LTS version for servers.\nNow you have four options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit \"/etc/apt/sources.list\" (with root permissions) substituting all the links: \"http://archive.ubuntu.com/...\" for \"http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/...\"\n\n*Upgrade to 10.04LTS, you will need to upgrade first to 9.10 and then to 10.04. Staying in 9.10 is not an option as you will face the same problem in a few months.\n\n*Stay in 9.04. You will need to hunt debs/compile programs if you want to install something new. If your server is internet facing you will have to manually update it for security reasons. But I still have a very old Mandrake server running as a internal router at work. If your server is not going to change a lot, this could be the best solution (specially cost-wise).\n\n*Install 10.04 from scratch, keeping your data and config files. If you can afford some downtime this will be easier and faster than upgrading. But you will need to take the server down. This route is clearly the best if you have an spare server, you could install the new server, copy all the data and switch them at the end. You can even move services one by one to the new server.\n", "Q: Investigating a system \"freeze\" Am on\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS\n\n*Linux skiran 2.6.32-32-generic-pae #62-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 20 22:10:33 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux\n\n\nMy machine froze for the 5th time in 2 days. \n\n\n*\n\n*Had to reboot, and login to a failsafe session to collect and review logs.\n\n*ALT+F2 to run nm-applet, so that the network connectivity works\n\n*ALT+F2 to run gnome-do, to launch my applications (I prefer using gnome-do, to using menu options, or ALT+F2)\n\n\nI noticed the following errors in the various /var/log/* files, at the time my machine last froze (around 14:32 on June 10)\nIn kern.log\nJun 10 14:32:17 skiran kernel: [    0.766164] PM: Resume from disk failed.\n\nIn syslog\nJun 10 14:32:17 skiran kernel: [    0.766164] PM: Resume from disk failed.\nJun 10 14:32:22 skiran pulseaudio[1867]: module.c: Failed to load  module \"module-alsa-card\" (argument: \"device_id=\"1\" name=\"pci-0000_01_00.1\" card_name=\"alsa_card.pci-0000_01_00.1\" tsched=yes ignore_dB=no card_properties=\"module-udev-detect.discovered=1\"\"): initialization failed.\nJun 10 14:32:22 skiran pulseaudio[1867]: module.c: Failed to load  module \"module-alsa-card\" (argument: \"device_id=\"29\" name=\"platform-thinkpad_acpi\" card_name=\"alsa_card.platform-thinkpad_acpi\" tsched=yes ignore_dB=no card_properties=\"module-udev-detect.discovered=1\"\"): initialization failed.\nJun 10 14:32:24 skiran gdm-session-worker[1865]: GLib-GObject-CRITICAL: g_value_get_boolean: assertion `G_VALUE_HOLDS_BOOLEAN (value)' failed\nJun 10 14:32:35 skiran pulseaudio[2062]: module.c: Failed to load  module \"module-alsa-card\" (argument: \"device_id=\"1\" name=\"pci-0000_01_00.1\" card_name=\"alsa_card.pci-0000_01_00.1\" tsched=yes ignore_dB=no card_properties=\"module-udev-detect.discovered=1\"\"): initialization failed.\nJun 10 14:32:35 skiran pulseaudio[2062]: module.c: Failed to load  module \"module-alsa-card\" (argument: \"device_id=\"29\" name=\"platform-thinkpad_acpi\" card_name=\"alsa_card.platform-thinkpad_acpi\" tsched=yes ignore_dB=no card_properties=\"module-udev-detect.discovered=1\"\"): initialization failed.\n\nAlso in wcstatus.log noticed several errors, occurring at the time the machine froze.

Well I loaded up update manager today and it wants to replace Firefox 4.0.1 with 5.0beta5. To double check I fired out apt-cache policy firefox and there it is:\n 5.0~b5+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1 0\n    500 http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-proposed/main amd64 Packages\n\nI've never known Ubuntu to update the browser like this before, mid-release. Especially not to a beta.\nDoes anybody know what's going on behind the scenes? Why is Natty having its browser updated to a new major version?\n\nA: Firefox 5 final is scheduled for release on 21 Juny, that'll soon be the next stable version.\nThis crazy version bumping is possibly caused by the Chromium / Chrome which likes bumping the version number every month or so.\nNew features can be tracked at Mozilla Wiki: Features/Release Tracking for Firefox 5\n\nA: Firefox 5.0 is just the next regular security update for 4.0.1 users, scheduled for release on June 21st. However, because of the new release model for Firefox, we also need to update the Firefox translations at the same time (and we will do for all future Firefox security updates). This means that we also need to provide updated language-pack-xx-* packages with the Firefox 5.0 update.\nIn order to prepare for this, we are splitting Firefox translations out of the main language packs at the same time as the 5.0 release. This means that in the future, we will not need to respin all of the language packs for a Firefox security update (this incurs quite a significant QA penalty). Because of this packaging split and because the new language packs contain updated translations for all of your other applications (exported from Launchpad), they need to undergo extended testing in natty-proposed before we release them to everybody on June 21st. However, testing them also depends on the newly split-out Firefox translation packages existing in natty-proposed (else the package relationships will not be satisfiable for language pack testers).\nWe took the decision to upload the current beta to natty-proposed because if we wait for the release build before we start testing the language packs in natty-proposed, we will have to delay the next security update.

I have installed dnscache (dnscache-run) from Ubuntu repositories and I have increased the CACHESIZE and DATALIMIT to 256MB (268435456).\nToday I have tested it with one domain: google.es.\nI have executed in console dig google.es:\n;; Query time: 86 msec\n;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)\n\nI have repeated the query:  \n;; Query time: 0 msec\n;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)\n\nCorrect.\nAfter I have visited various websites with Firefox for at least 10 minutes and I've repeated the query:\n;; Query time: 87 msec\n;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53(127.0.0.1)\n\nIn 10 minutes of Internet surfing has it had to empty a cache of 256MB!? Furthermore, in those 10 minutes I've done several searches on google.es.\nBased on these results so disappointing my question is obvious: Does dnsache really improve the surfing speed? Maybe something is wrong with my settings?\n\nA: Short answer: No, not really.\nLong answer: In my experience dnscache is very useful when it's installed to serve a number of different machines. Like for example on a router or a network gateway. It's not as useful for a lone machine, it's very likely that everybody in the middle (software, routers, etc...) is already doing dns cache, even firefox will do local DNS caching by default.\nNow your results: Google.com dns record has TTL (Time-To-Live) of 298 seconds (now and for me). They are asking any dns cache not to keep they record for more time (they change IPs quite often), so dnscache should comply to this. If you try with some other domain with higher or 0 TTLs it shouldn't discard the cache so fast.\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\ngoogle.com.     298 IN  A   209.85.147.104\n\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\nyahoo.com.      16522   IN  A   72.30.2.43\n\nThis is digg output, 298 is the TTL for google, 16522 for yahoo.

I'm building a new configuration and intend to buy an SSD with it. I recall that the first SSDs were problematic in Linux for some reason (maybe lack of TRIM support?).\nIs there something to specifically avoid in today's SSDs? Or is it a safe bet to buy any?\n\nA: I've owned two SSD's, an OCZ Vertex 2 60GB (controller died in 5 months) and am now happy with an Intel 320 80GB.\nI've had no issues with it in comparison with a mechanical HDD.\nOn the software side, most vendors provide utilities for SSDs which (unfortunately) only works in Windows due to bug 1. These fancy toolboxes often have an alternative in the repositories or system (examples: TRIM on-demand, erasing the disk). Since firmware updates should be applied when the disk is not in use, it's neither an issue for not using it in Linux.\nSome interesting links:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the recommended way to empty a SSD?\n\n*Optimize for SSD (for SSDs supporting TRIM)\n\n*SSD Checklist\nNot limited to Linux, but to SSDs in general: Jeff Atwood has an interesting blog entry about the lifetime of a SSD. It should not stop you from buying a SSD, if it dies the manufacturer (or reseller) will replace it if it's within the warranty period. But the reason for buying one is it's speed. I was amazed with my first SSD, everything start almost instantly without hearing a disk spinning.\n\nA: No; it is a safe bet to buy any ( and always has been ).\nAs for TRIM, it is still disabled by default as it may ( though unlikely ) trigger bugs.  Depending on your workload, enabling it may, or may not improve the drive's performance over time.

I am serving in the Peace Corps in a poor Spanish speaking country. I manage several small computer labs. For reasons of limited networking, old computers, and unreliable electricity, I decided that the best solution for teaching computers here is to have the computers boot up to Edubuntu Live CDs. The learning games can't be beat for the price.\n   However, I need to make modifications in the LiveCDs for this to happen, and I'm not sure what is the easiest way to do this.\n  Specifically, the most important changes I need to make is: \n\n\n*\n\n*to remove the install option in boot up.\n\n*to add an offline encyclopedia.\n\n\nI figured out that the best offline encyclopedia option is a copy of Wikipedia. Since I need a Spanish language Wikipedia, I'm probably going to go with Evopedia. Although if someone has a better suggestion I'm all ears.\nWhat I'm not certain of is how to add it to the Live CD. Much of this I'm just going to have to figure out for myself, but a few pointers should would help. Do I just add the .deb packages to the \"Pool\" folder? That seems too easy.\nI've been playing with IsoMaster, which is fine for adding whole files, but no so good for editing them.

It might even be easier than a lot of customization jobs, since it likely doesn't require upgrading or installing Ubuntu packages.\nThis guide in the Ubuntu community documentation wiki explains in detail how to create a customized live CD, including adding files and installing applications.\nThat guide is somewhat dated; while it still works, you'll see references therein to some pretty old Ubuntu versions. Furthermore, there are now some other options for customizing a live CD.

And I think it also shows you how much it's going to download before it starts.\n\nA: I believe it depends on which packages you already have installed on your current version. When you do a distribution upgrade, Ubuntu will download the packages of any software that has since been updated to a newer version in the Ubuntu repositories. For example, 10.10 came with Firefox 3.6 and Open Office by default, and if you didn't manually the latest versions straight from the PPA's, then an upgrade to 11.04 will download the new packages for Firefox 4 and Libre Office (which comes as the default office suite in Natty). This goes for any other updated software that has made it into Ubuntu's repositories.\nThat said, if you more or less left Ubuntu with its defaults or substituted some alternatives, then your upgrade shouldn't be that large, and I wouldn't expect it to take too much of your monthly quota. However, if you installed many apps that are quite active (i.e., new stables get released frequently), then expect it to take a while.\n\nA: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThis will show you the size it will download and also will tell you what would be size required after downloading. If it is not in you bandwidth limit and you do not wish to upgrade, simply press 'no' and it will cancel the upgrade. you can also press ctrl+c to cancel.\nI agree to what Eliah commented below.

I have upgraded both server and desktop editions of ubuntu at least tree times each and never was I perfectly satisfied with the result. Something always runs buggy, some configuration not migrated etc. A reinstall is worth the extra time.\nMaybe the reason is, that the developer team can not test every case an bear in mind all the changes, you might have made to your system. Also some feature are never enabled in upgrades to not break the stuff users are used to.\nA reinstall just results in a cleaner neater system all the components are designed to work with eachother.\n\nA: A re-install is always better than an upgrade in terms of a new, clean system. If you want to keep your current programs and settings, you'd better upgrade.\nWhen a server is down, it's often bad. I do not know if you've a separate machine for testing / migrating, but if you do not care about downtime with one machine, you can just do a fresh install.\n", "Q: My Dash does not show recent applications. What can I do to fix that? For some unknown reason, my Unity dash doesn't show recent applications. I am guessing it could be related to the fact that I have a newer version of zeitgeist than the standard repo provides (I use a ppa).\nThat is the only unusual detail I can think of. What can I do to get back recent applications in the dash?\n\nA: There was a similar problem reported here \nThe solution was to reinstall unity-lens-applications and unity-lens-files packages and the Dash magically works.\nBoth these packages were formely named unity-place-applications and unity-place-files\nWe are looking into it.

It has been this way since I installed Natty. \nEvery once in awhile when I start the computer I have nice colored icons on the panel and the launcher. I have two editor icons on the launcher, and they both will usually have the same icon, but when the colored icons are on the panel the editor icons are different, as they should be.\nCan someone tell me how to keep the proper icons at boot time?\n\nA: It seems to me that you have to change theme and that will solve your problem. Black panel icons are usually used for light colored panels. The icons in the launcher depend on the theme you are using. To change it right click on the desktop, choose \"Change Desktop\" then click on tab with Theme. There is a button which will allow you to change icons scheme.\n\n", "Q: How to open a man page using gnome-do? Is there a way to use gnome-do to launch some man page in the help GUI?

That adds a Read manual page (man) action to Do, which takes the name of the man page you're after as its item to act on.\nThis plugin is in the \"Unofficial Plugins\" set.  That doesn't mean much, except that you need to select \"Unofficial Plugins\" from the dropdown before the plugin will show up.\n", "Q: How can I help someone (like granny) over SSH who is behind a NAT router? For helping others quickly, SSH is very useful, especially combined with GNU Screen. It's common that users are behind a NAT router. Even if the user can configure the router, it takes some time to remember the password, find the right options, etc.\nSo, what is the easiest way to help others over SSH if they're behind a NAT router?\nI currently tell people to open a terminal run the below command and pass me their IP from a site like http://ip.appspot.com/:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server ssh-import-id && ssh-import-id lekensteyn\n\nObviously, this is not going to work if they're behind a NAT router or have a personal firewall configured. So, is there something like:\nsshd --accept-help-from lekensteyn\n\nI'm not looking for alternatives like Teamviewer, just a shell like SSH. It should be open-source too.\n\nA: Based on your specific needs, i would probably:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Ask them to tell me the router's password  \n\n*Login and setup port-forwarding for port 22 only  \n\n*Connect through SSH (or SSH tunneling if you need extra ports opened) and get the job done.\n\n\nI also forgot that you can try the reverse ssh tunnel, although this solution  technically needs one more - middle - computer to work.  \nMore info can be found here\n\nA: I just usually set up an IPv6 tunnel (from sixxs.net or he.net) if they don't already have IPv6 and then that way the computer has a static address and I don't have to mess with NAT. I also like to set up key based authentication (then they don't have to tell you their password).\nSixxs has their own client that you use. It works behind almost any NAT, and automatically updates when the IPv4 address changes. They have instructions on how to set it up and it is packaged for Ubuntu.\nHurricane Electric uses a tunnel where IPv6 packages are sent as the payload of a IPv4 packet. Unlike Sixxs, no TCP/UDP is used. This means that the NAT you are behind has to support forwarding PROTOCOL 41 (not port) and only one computer behind the NAT can use it. The software to use a tunnel like this is built into Ubuntu.\nFor HE, I use something like this in /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto he-ipv6\niface he-ipv6 inet6 v4tunnel\n     endpoint 216.218.226.238\n     address  2001:470:a29f::2\n     netmask  64\n     ttl 64\n     up ip -6 route add default dev he-ipv6\n     down ip -6 route del default dev he-ipv6\n\nThe other thing you need to do is update your tunnel endpoint. Since you do not know when the External IP changes, you will have to just try to update the endpoint every few minutes. You could use something like this and run it from cron:\n#!/bin/sh\necho -n \"Hurricane Electric Proto-41 tunnel endpoint update: \"\n#(C) 2010 Erik B.

That's probably something that should be covered in a separate question.\n\nA: Along the years, I developed a GUI to do exactly what the OP asks... except that it requires a ssh access to a third server with public IP, as suggested by Pavlos. You can find here the debian packages and the instructions:\nhttp://pietrobattiston.it/reachme\nNotice it (still) is not able to take care of the initial configuration - namely, you have to setup yourself the rsa keys for passwordless connection. Once set up, \"reachthem\" allows you to see whether \"reachme\" is connected, and to open an ssh shell/browse the filesystem/view the screen (experimental).\nClearly, you don't need a third computer if your computer itself has a public IP, as in the answer by ændrük. And clearly, the benefit of the GUI is that the remote user doesn't have to enter any command in a terminal... but part of this benefit is lost if the remote user has to install reachme. So I just always install and set up reachme to everybody I install Ubuntu to.\n", "Q: Which netbook: Atom or Fusion? I am looking to buy a netbook that will last for a few years. It will be used for browsing and I want it to be snappy. \nSeeing as rendering and video decoding will be making more use of the GPU going forward, I have been paying attention to AMD's new Fusion platform hoping that it will provide solid graphics performance where the Intel GMA3150 is supposed to be weak. \nHowever, the Atom is supposed to have the faster CPU. I know it's early days, with Fusion only getting full support in the kernel with Natty, so which platform would you recommend?\n\nA: In reality I would more go with Fusion because the concept definitely will pay off as the software gets better.\nHowever, as you say, Atom has the better CPU - but there is a catch. Atoms are not very good at handling large loads, so if you will be using a lot of tabs, you might find some trouble there. Also, there are some higher end Fusion APUs with more power (according to what I read) than equivalent Atoms.*\nI would suggest you wait a little (a few months?) and get a system such as Acer's new ultrathin (forgot the name sorry) with more powerful hardware (for example, Core i3 or i5, and possibly stronger graphics). That would be a better fit for you go forward, especially in light of the improvements/additions to the software stack that are sure to come. Or you could get a good system from System 76 or ZaReason with good specs and a small size, without compromising too much.\n* See this link:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Fusion\n\nA: these netbooks both use an intel atom CPU nvidia graphics GPU.\nAt the moment I have this 12\" netbook, I think it's very good for surfing, writing and watching films. There is also an updated version! The 1215\nThe updated version has 1.8 GHz dual core cpu, (a max of 4 gb RAM.) Which is very good for a 12\" netbook! \nOne of the main reasons I've bought my 12\" netbook was that it had a fullscale keyboard, which helps a lot.\nAll of these netbooks have an Atom cpu, and I think they are better one a small light computer. Because they use little power and still have enough performance to do the tasks a normal user require, like surfing the web, writing, etc. \nI've upgraded the RAM in my netbook to 4GiB, it helps a lot if you use many tabs in chrome while watching a film.  \n", "Q: Installing an HP Laserjet 1000 I've already installed hplip, it printed a test page, but it won't print from any program. It shows the printer in the list of printers, and it's checked as the default printer. I've restarted a couple times. \nWhen I plugged the USB cable for the printer into the computer after installing hplip, it said printer detected. Then after a couple seconds it said the printer was ready for use. \nWhen I send something to the printer, a pop-up shows that a document was sent to the printer - but there's a triangle with an exclamation point in it next to the message. A few seconds another pop-up indicates that the printer has completed printing the job but it didn't print anything.\n\nA: I'm glad you asked this because it took me quite some time to figure it out myself. hplip doesn't support the HP Laserjet 1000 without patching - which is unfortunate because it's a pretty affordable and a pretty decent printer. In order to get the hplip drivers to work you need to patch them with this patch.  You'll also need to install these dependencies first:\nsudo apt-get install libcups2 cups libcups2-dev cups-bsd cups-client libcupsimage2-dev libdbus-1-dev build-essential ghostscript openssl libjpeg62-dev libsnmp-dev libtool libusb-dev python-imaging policykit-1 policykit-1-gnome python-qt4 python-qt4-dbus python-dbus python-gobject python-dev python-notify python python-reportlab libsane libsane-dev sane-utils xsane\n\nOnce those dependencies are installed - you'll need to download the source for hplip, I can't confirm that it works for the latest version, however I have successfully patched 3.10.9\nIf you're unfamiliar with patching I have patched the source for hplip and made it available for download.\nOnce you've patched hplip continue the installation by running ./install.py and follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nA: I've had since Natty problems with the hplip drivers and my LJ 1018. \nI've set up Oneiric this week, running into the same problem with hplip again, and that it was unable to download the firmware.\nI've solved it using foo2zjs. A description how I've done it in detail is here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/112161258221779145276/posts/imgVhbXxRWC\n\nA: Considering you have 1 \"HP LaserJet 1000\" printer connected to your USB and 0 such printers already addded.\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04\nBefore this set-up, I've installed (but not sure if makes difference) hp-ppd(installed with sudo apt install hp-ppd).\nI had to install hplip (which you already did) with\nsudo apt install hplip\n\nWith this pure installation, firmware installation always failed for me, first I had to do\nhp-firmware -i\n\nThis command takes a while (like few seconds) - should end with simple \"Done.\"\nThen when I finally ran\nhp-setup -ia\n\nand selected usb (enter for default enter=usb* option), it all went well without any errors ending again with the simple \"Done.\".\n- after this, printer started printing :)\nAnother thing I am not sure if it made a difference or not, but I've also installed some dependencies from @Marco Ceppi answer (replacing python-imaging with python-pil though). However,I did not install the patch he described.\nSidenote:Already tried to install this printer? If you don't have any other existing printers - remove the old with hp-setup -ir (repeat untill it tells you error No device found - that is the printer-clean state).\n", "Q: How to install gfortran?

For that to work, an additional user is needed to accept the connection. This user needs to be able to forward his port through the server (the server acts as proxy).\nHow do I create a restricted user that can do nothing more than the above described?\nThe new user must not be able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*execute shell commands\n\n*access files or upload files to the server\n\n*use the server as proxy (e.g. webproxy)\n\n*access local services which were otherwise not publicly accessible due to a firewall\n\n*kill the server\n\n\nSummarized, how do I create a restricted SSH user which is only able to connect to the SSH server without privileges, so I can connect through that connection with his computer?\n\nA: I'm sure there are many solutions to this, and many more robust than the one I'm proposing.  However, this may be sufficient for your needs.  In order to do it, I'm assuming the user has is able to do ssh key based authentication (putty or any unix ssh should support this).\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a user as you normally would ('adduser' or any other tool)\n\n*Create the users .ssh dir and .ssh/authorized_keys\nyour_user $ sudo -Hu ssh_forwarder /bin/bash\n\nssh_forwarder $ cd ~\nssh_forwarder $ mkdir .ssh\nssh_forwarder $ ( umask 066 && cat > .ssh/authorized_keys ) <<EOF\nno-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,command=\"read a; exit\" ssh-rsa AAAB3NzaC1y....2cD/VN3NtHw== smoser@brickies\nEOF\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable password access to this account.\n\n\n\n\nyour_user $ sudo usermod --lock ssh_forwarder\n\nNow, the only way that user can get into your system is via access to the proper ssh key, and ssh will run \"/bin/bash -c 'read a'\" for them, no matter what they attempt to run.  'read a' will simply read until a newline, and then the shell will exit, so the user just has to hit 'enter' to kill the connection.\nThere are lots of other things you could do in 'command='.  See man authorized_keys and search for 'command' for more information.\nIf you do not like the fact that hitting enter kills the connection, you could use something like the following for the 'command=' entry:\ncommand=\"f=./.fifo.$$ && mkfifo $f && trap \\\"rm -f $f\\\" EXIT && read a <$f && echo $a; exit;\"\n\nThis just creates a temporary fifo in the users home directory, and then tries to read from it.  Nothing will be writing to that file, so this will hang indefinitely.  Additionally, if you want to forcefully terminate that connection, you could do something like:\n your_user$ echo GOODBYE | sudo tee ~ssh_forwarder/.fifo.*\n\nThis should use very little resources, and nothing should be able to go wrong in that script that would not end in termination of the shell.\nsleep 1h; echo You have been here too long. Good bye.\n\nI didn't see off hand how you could allow the user to remote forward (ssh -R) but limit (ssh -L).  Perhaps 'permitopen' could be used.  Googling was not very helpful.  It would seem that something like 'no-port-forwarding,permitremoteopen=10001' would be useful to allow ssh -R 6901:localhost:6901.\nThis is a solution.  It can most definitely be improved on, and any opening of remote ports should be scrutinized.  If my goal was to allow my Grandmother to connect into my LAN so I could use vnc to view her screen, and access to those keys was limited to her, I personally would feel reasonably safe.  If this was for an enterprise, more thorough investigation would be necessary.  One thing to be aware of is ssh -N does not request a shell at all, so the 'command=' code does not execute.\nOther, possibly more secure mechanisms may include creating a custom shell for the user, and even locking that down with apparmour.\n\nA: TL;DR - go to the bottom of the answer, \"Applying the restrictions\"\nAdding a restricted user consists of two parts:\n1. Creating the user\n2. Configuring the SSH daemon (sshd)\nConfiguring sshd\nThe best place to get known to the possibilities of SSH is by reading the related manual pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh(1)\n\n*ssh_config(5)\n\n*sshd(8)\n\n*sshd_config(5)\nWhere can SSH client perform actions?\nBefore you can restrict something, you need to know the features of SSH. Spitting through the manual pages yields:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shell commands execution\n\n*File upload through sftp\n\n*Port forwarding\n\n*\n\n*The client forwards an (un)used port to the server\n\n*The server forwards his port to the client\n\n*The server forwards a port of another host to the client (proxy-ish)\n\n\n*X11 forwarding (display forwarding)\n\n*Authentication agent forwarding\n\n*Forwarding of a tunnel device\n\n\nFrom the Authentication section of the manual page of sshd(8):\n\nIf the client successfully authenticates itself, a dialog for preparing\n  the session is entered.  At this time the client may request things like\n  allocating a pseudo-tty, forwarding X11 connections, forwarding TCP\n  connections, or forwarding the authentication agent connection over the\n  secure channel.\nAfter this, the client either requests a shell or execution of a command.\n  The sides then enter session mode.  In this mode, either side may send\n  data at any time, and such data is forwarded to/from the shell or command\n  on the server side, and the user terminal in the client side.\n\nOptions for restricting SSH features\nFiles and their options that alter behavior are:\n\n*\n\n*~/.ssh/authorized_keys - contains keys which are allowed to connect which can be given options:\n\n*\n\n*command=\"command\" - The command supplied by the user (if any) is ignored. Note that the client may specify TCP and/or X11 forwarding unless they are explicitly prohibited. Note that this option applies to shell, command or subsystem execution.\n\n*no-agent-forwarding - Forbids authentication agent forwarding when this key is used for authentication.\n\n*no-port-forwarding - Forbids TCP forwarding when this key is used for authentication\n\n*no-X11-forwarding - \"Forbids X11 forwarding when this key is used for authentication.\"\n\n*permitopen=\"host:port\" - Limit local 'ssh -L' port forwarding such that it may only connect to the specified host and port.\n\n\n*~/.ssh/environment - This file is read into the environment at login (if it exists). Environment processing is disabled by default and is controlled via the PermitUserEnvironment option\n\n*~/.ssh/rc - Contains initialization routines to be run before the user's home directory becomes accessible.\n\n*/etc/ssh/sshd_config - the system-wide configuration file\n\n*\n\n*AllowAgentForwarding - Specifies whether ssh-agent(1) forwarding is permitted.\n\n*AllowTcpForwarding\n\n*ForceCommand - \"Forces the execution of the command specified by ForceCommand, ignoring any command supplied by the client and ~/.ssh/rc if present. The command is invoked by using the user's login shell with the -c option.\"\n\n*GatewayPorts - \"Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to ports forwarded for the client. By default, sshd(8) binds remote port forwardings to the loopback address. This prevents other remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports. GatewayPorts can be used to specify that sshd should allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses, thus allowing other hosts to connect.\"\n\n*PermitOpen:\n\nSpecifies the destinations to which TCP port forwarding is\n  permitted. The forwarding specification must be one of the\n  following forms:\nPermitOpen host:port\nPermitOpen IPv4_addr:port\nPermitOpen [IPv6_addr]:port\n\nMultiple forwards may be specified by separating them with\n  whitespace. An argument of 'any' can be used to remove all\n  restrictions and permit any forwarding requests.  By default all\n  port forwarding requests are permitted.\n  \n*PermitTunnel - Specifies whether tun(4) device forwarding is allowed. The default is 'no'\n  \n*X11Forwarding - Specifies whether X11 forwarding is permitted. The default is 'no'\n  \n  \nApplying the restrictions\n\nModifying the system-wide configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config allows the configuration be applied even if password-based authentication is applied or if the restrictions in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys are accidentally removed. If you've modified the global defaults, you should uncomment the options accordingly.\nMatch User limited-user\n   #AllowTcpForwarding yes\n   #X11Forwarding no\n   #PermitTunnel no\n   #GatewayPorts no\n   AllowAgentForwarding no\n   PermitOpen localhost:62222\n   ForceCommand echo 'This account can only be used for [reason]'\n\nNow add a user:\nsudo useradd -m limited-user\n\nThe option ForceCommand can be omitted if the shell is set to a non-shell like /bin/false (or /bin/true) as /bin/false -c [command] won't do anything.\nNow the client can only connect to port 62222 on the loopback address of the server over SSH (it will not listen on the public IP address)\nDisabling AllowTcpForwarding would also disallow the use of -R, thus defeating the use of such a restricted account for forwarding a single port. PermitOpen localhost:62222 assumes that port 62222 on the server is never in use because the client can happily connect to it and listen on it too.\nIf TCP forwarding is allowed in the system-wide configuration and disabled password-based authentication, you can use per-key settings as well. Edit ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and add the next options before the ssh- (with a space between the options and ssh-):\ncommand=\"echo 'This account can only be used for [reason]'\",no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,permitopen=\"localhost:62222\"\n\nVerify\nTo be sure that it works as expected, some test cases need to be run. In the below commands, host should be replaced by the actual login if it's not set in ~/.ssh/config. Behind the command, a command is shown that should be executed on either the client or server (as specified).\n# connection closed:\nssh host\n# connection closed (/bin/date is not executed):\nssh host /bin/date\n# administratively prohibited (2x):\nssh host -N -D 62222 # client: curl -I --socks5 localhost:62222 example.com\nssh host -N -L 8080:example.com:80 # client: curl -I localhost:8080\nsftp host\n# should be possible because the client should forward his SSH server\nssh host -N -R 8080:example.com:80 # server: curl -I localhost:8080\n# This works, it forwards the client SSH to the server\nssh host -N -R 62222:localhost:22\n# unfortunately, the client can listen on that port too. Not a big issue\nssh host -N -L 1234:localhost:62222\n\nConclusion\nChecklist: The SSH user should not able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*execute shell commands - done\n\n*access files or upload files to the server - done\n\n*use the server as proxy (e.g. webproxy) - done\n\n*access local services which were otherwise not publicly accessible due to a firewall - partially, the client cannot access other ports than 62222, but can listen and connect to port 62222 on the server\n\n*kill the server - done\n(note that these checks are limited to the SSH server. If you've an other vulnerable service on the machine, it could allow a possible attacker to run commands, kill the server, etc. )\n\n\nA: Try command=\"exit\"\nThat would force users to use this command to portforward\nssh -NfR EXTERNAL_PORT:localhost:INTERNAL_PORT usr@server -i key\n", "Q: Encoding and decoding error in non-English name of compressed file I have a rar file.

When I click on \"Install missing plug-in\" it says none found, so when I click on manually install plug-in it takes me to Adobe Shockwave Player installation, but there is no ubuntu version to install??? On the Firefox plug-in finder service it says \"Unknown Plugin (application/x-director)\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\n\nUnlike Flash, the Shockwave browser plugin is not available for Linux or Solaris despite intense lobbying efforts.  However, the Shockwave Player can be installed on Linux with CrossOver or by running a Windows version of a supported browser in Wine (with varying degrees of success).\n\nTry running it with CrossOver or Wine.\n\nA: Nope, there's no Shockwave for Linux.

The reason I use backticks instead of $() is because it's easier to type, two keystrokes with one hand vs 4 keystrokes with two hands. I am aware of the disadvantages of using ` over $(), but those do no apply in this case. You're not going to nest backticks or use slashes for quickly finding a program.\n\nA: What you have in the linked question is:\n$ cat $(which gjslint) | grep [0-9] --color=always\n\nWhat you can do is:\n$ grep '[0-9]' --color=always \"$(which gjslint)\"\n\nThere's couple points to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*no need to cat file. grep takes files as arguments\n\n*single-quote your regex; the reason for that is because shell will try to expand [0-9] as filenames. If there were files 0,1,2,3 and so on to 9, the shell would expand your command to grep 0 1 2 3 ... and the rest of args. Try doing this - touch 0 1 2 && stat [0-2], and you'll see.

Aren't they supposed to be in a foreign encoding? I guess the output by unzip -l are too much, and how shall I only single out the filenames in its output as input to chardet?\n\nA: Try:\nunzip -O cp936 \"严蔚敏数据结构(c语言版)教材及答案.zip\"\n\n\nA: I would extract the files, then do a\nls | chardet\n\nto see what it says. \nAlso, you could try different encodings with \nls | iconv -f GB2312\n\nfor example. You could see the encoding known to iconv with iconv -l.\nOnce determined the encoding, let's suppose is GB2312, you should modify the filenames, to change the encoding to UTF8\nfor f in *; do\n  g=\"$(iconv -f GB2312 <<<\"$f\")\"\n  mv \"$f\" \"$g\"\ndone\n\nEDIT\nTried a brute force attack to your zip file, converting to every known encoding, but none of them seems to me to be plausible\n#!/bin/bash\n\niconv -l | \n  sed  's|//$||' | \n  while read enc; do \n    printf \"\\n --- $enc ---\\n\\n\"\n    ls | iconv -cf \"$enc\" 2>/dev/null\n  done\n\n\nA: Usually the filenames get interpreted as western charset. Thus you have to first convert the filenames from UTF-8 back to ISO then interpret that \"byte-stream\" as GB2312 back to UTF-8.\ni.e.:\nls | iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO8859-1 | iconv -f GB2312 -t UTF-8\nThis does not work for your specific file, so you might want to find out how the file was created (what system, what program, what language etc.)\nSee also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake\n\nA: You will need iconv, but convmv and cconv are optional.\nStep 1, find the correct char-encode converting chain.\nStep 2, rename files by a shell script.\n\nSometimes, there is a wrong character encoding in the converting chain. You have to find the gap out, by the way in enzotib's post.\nFor example, a file named \"冼极.otf\" in an utf8 file system. \ntouch 冼极.otf\n\nI have to do the followings to get its correct name \"宋体.otf\".\nconvmv --notest -f utf8 -t cp950 *.otf\nconvmv --notest -f cp936 -t utf8 *.otf\n\nAfter one has its correct name, one may like to do the simplified-traditional Chinese converting by use of cconv as in the shell-script below. In my case \"宋體.otf\" finally.\n#!/bin/sh\n# bash shell script\nmkdir TW\nfor filename in *; do [ -d \"$filename\" ] || echo \"$filename\" ; done |\n    while read filename; do \n    filename_TW=`echo \"$filename\" | cconv -f UTF8-CN -t UTF8-TW` \n    printf \"\\n --- $filename $filename_TW ---\\n\\n\"\n    #uncomment lines below if you've confirmed the names\n    #mv \"$filename\" \"TW/$filename_TW\"\n    #touch \"$filename\"\n    done\n\nHere is another example relative to Daniel's post. A file named \"ý¹úÖ¾.txt\" in an utf8 file system.\ntouch ý¹úÖ¾.txt\n\nAfter some trails, I find its correct simplified Chinese name is \"三国志.txt\" by\nls | iconv -f utf-8 -t iso-8859-1 | iconv -f cp936 -t utf-8\n\nThen I rename it to traditional Chinese name \"三國志.txt\" by\n#!/bin/sh\nmkdir BACKUP\nfor filename in *; do [ -d \"$filename\" ] || echo \"$filename\" ; done |\n    while read filename; do \n    filename_TW=`echo \"$filename\" | iconv -f utf-8 -t iso-8859-1 | iconv -f cp936 -t utf-8 | cconv -f UTF8-CN -t UTF8-TW` \n    mv \"$filename\" \"$filename_TW\"\n    touch \"BACKUP/$filename\"\n    done\n\nFin\n", "Q: How does gnome know which applications support GIO and GVFS?

Just a way to undo the error once it has occurred. I suppose these bugs (and the ones posted in my comments to your question) will be fixed with future updates. There are many bug-reports on launchpad concerning these.\nYou could also try ans install CompizConfig Settings Manager  / sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager and play with the setting there. It might or might not help - depending on who you ask.\n\nA: Have you enabled keeping minimized windows thumbnails under \"workarounds\" in ccsm?  If so, disable it -- it messed up my unity bad.\n\nA: I fixed this issue permanently by entering CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) —if you don't have it do sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager—, going into the Window Decorations options, and changing the Command setting to compiz-decorator.\nBacking out of this menu, then unchecking Window Decoration, allowing the desktop to reload, then checking Window Decoration and exiting out of CCSM.\nAfter doing this, I can no longer reproduce the issue.\n", "Q: Is e4rat safe to use and will it really increase boot speed? e4rat is said to increase the boot speed on ext4 filesystems. However, it requires the ureadahead component of Ubuntu to be disabled.\nWill it really make my computer start faster and is it safe to try?\n\nA: I tried it this weekend on a 12.04 (on a computer with a 1TB HDD and which has been upgraded 4 times without re-installation) and found it took 17 seconds off my boot process with no ill effects noticed.\nIt took me about 30mins to complete the process and I am happy with it so far.\n\nA: It does seem to speed up the boot/login process quite a bit, but it's far less polished then ureadahead -- you have to manually go through logging the startup, dropping to recovery, reallocating the files, and messing with grub every time you want to update the cache.  It also breaks the plymouth boot screen.  I'm going to try tweaking ureadahead instead.\nIs it safe?

Cheers!\n\nA: Replacing the template-based formatting should work, i've tried it with LibreOffice 3.4.3. Without any direct formatting (using the text formatting toolbar or right-click and select any of the formatting options), the new template is applied globally. But if there's any direct formatting, the new template's formatting rules won't affect that content.\nIf the new template isn't applied to some slides, you should check if there's any direct formatting defined for those slides, and remove it using Menu Format -> Default Formatting.\n\nA: After you have applying the new style to the old presentation, you must go in each slide and select the appropriate layout. It will set the formats and fonts of the style of the master slide. It may mess-up some graphics. IN these cases right-click the graphic and click \"original size\". \nJorge\n", "Q: How to install an older version of Transmission?

This is an experiment, you can call it a school project.\nI need to make a /usr/share/xsessions entry that will start the gnome desktop without starting \"gnome-session\" but rather each app that is required manually.\nObviously, I will need a script because there are several applications that need to be launched. I know i need to start gnome-panel and networking, and nautilus, and gtk, could someone point me in the right direction as of how it should look like (apps that need to be started and in what order)?\nThanks!\n\nA: A minimal session would be something like this: \n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nmetacity & #start the window manager. You could use compiz, openbox etc. instead\ngnome-settings-daemon & #ensure themes show properly\ngnome-panel & #run the panel. You could use avant-window-navigator, docky etc. instead\nnautilus & #show your desktop background and icons\n\nThis will not load your gnome startup applications so you will need to add these to this script. \nTo test this out, save the script into the file ~/.xinitrc and make the file executable (chmod +x ~/.xinitrc). Then logout and log back in again but choose 'User Defined Session' as your session.\n", "Q: Nautilus Image Converter: strip EXIF metadata I just found out that images can have more than 20KB of EXIF data. Not really an issue with 2MB files, but if you have small thumbnails this really adds up. I use mogrify often to resize, and I can use mogrify -strip to remove the EXIF data. However, if I use Nautilus Image Converter there is no way to strip this data. Is there something in the configuration I can set so it always automatically adds the -strip flag to the command? \n\nA: I downloaded the code for Nautilus Image Converter and been through it configuration file and I dont think that this is possible from configuration file. But, if you open nautilus-image-resizer.c and take a look at line 320, you will see the following code:\ngchar *argv[6];\nargv[0] = \"/usr/bin/convert\";\nargv[1] = filename;\nargv[2] = \"-resize\";\nargv[3] = priv->size;\nargv[4] = new_filename;\nargv[5] = NULL;\n\nas you see, this is where the arguments for Imagemagick convert utility are being created. I think if you change this to following, it should solve your problem:\ngchar *argv[6];\nargv[0] = \"/usr/bin/convert\";\nargv[1] = filename;\nargv[2] = \"-resize\";\nargv[3] = priv->size;\nargv[4] = \"-strip\"\nargv[5] = new_filename;\n\nDISCLAIMER: I havent tried this.

This is probably something I don't understand since I am used to Windows \nand am only starting out with Ubuntu. I know that software in linux comes in packages what I don't understand is why can't non-admin users install software.\nI mean, every application is run by a specific user, and that user will\nonly be able to run that applciation with his privilages, so if he has\nno admin privileges, the application also won't be able to access unauthorized\ndirectories etc.\nI want most of the time to work on my PC with a non-admin user since it seems\nmore safe to me, most of the time I have no need for admin privileges.\nand even though I know viruses in linux are uncommon I still think the best\npractice is to work on the computer in a state that you yourself can't\nmake any changes to important files, that way viruses also can't harm any important\nfiles, but I need to install software for programming and web-design etc.\nand first of all I don't want to switch users all the time.\nBut also it sounds safer to me that everything being done on the PC\nwill be done through the non-admin user.\nI'll be glad to know what misunderstanding I have here, cause\nsomething here doesn't sound right.\n\nA: They can not. Here is the deal.\n\n\n*\n\n*The 1st user created in Ubuntu is considered a special user: this is a user with administration permissions. This means when ever this user wants to do admin tasks he will be prompted for his admin password. Those tasks are issued by putting sudo in front of a command.\n\n*All other users (unless you change it yourself) are normal users and can not install sofware system wide unless the admin (1st user) lets them do so. \nNormal user can only put things in their own home and if they want to they can mess up their home directory.\nThis way 1 person is responsible for the system. \nYou could make more than 1 user an admin (so able to install software)  by adding those users to the sudoers file.\nBesides that they can install software in their home but this does depend on the software: sometimes the installer wants to add it to the system and that is not allowed.\nThese installs tend to be from source so it is not the easiest method ;)\n\nA: In Ubuntu, the administrator has root privileges (often referred as just \"root\", as in \"you need to be root\").\nAccess to files can be split in three types:\n\n\n*\n\n*read (numeric value 4)\n\n*write (numeric value 2)\n\n*execute (numeric value 1)\n\n\nThese attributes can be set on every file or directory. Furthermore, these restrictions can be set on:\n\n\n*\n\n*the owner of the file\n\n*the group of the file (users can be a member of this group)\n\n*all other users which are not the owner nor in the group\n\n\nThese principles forms the basics of Linux file permissions. In windows, everything can be executed. Give it an .cmd or .exe extension for example. In Ubuntu, you need to add the execute bit explicitly, otherwise a permission error will be raised.\nWhen an user executes a program, the program accesses files as that user and these file permissions kicks in. By default, locations where programs are installed are privileged, only the owner can write. This owner is root. All other users can only read and execute the program, not write to it. That's why you need root privileges to install programs.\nUbuntu has a special program called sudo (SuperUser DO ...) to run programs with root privileges. This can be used for installing software. When run, the sudo program asks you for your user password. Note that only members of the admin group can run programs as root using sudo.\nIn Windows, you would go to a website and download an installer. Ubuntu works with a software repository in which you can search for programs and install those. These programs are reviewed before added to the official repositories, so you can be sure that no harmful intentions exist in the programs.\n\nA: Non-admin users cannot install software because the packages run as root when they're installing as they install to privileged parts of the system, run maintainer scripts, etc. \nThere is currently no way to tell the system \"Install firefox from this .deb but in a user's home directory so that it's isolated from the rest of the system\"; which is why currently it's mostly an all or nothing affair. (This is also why running third party .debs is bad, the package and it's included scripts have root access to your system)\n\nA: Why you're asked for a password\nMost software is designed to touch sensitive files, i.e. sensitive to the security of your private data or the systems integrity. This is why software installation is a potential risk and should be validated by a user who knows what he is doing. Even for open source Software you can not be sure that no bad code bits arrive with your percious new audio player until someone checked. And even then something could have been overlooked or packages could be manipulated on the way. Who knows what's hidden in the depth of the program? One user should.\nUbuntu provides a comfortable way of installing software. Software developers can rely on that comfort and make the assumption that synaptic/software center/apt enables them to access these sensitive files. Canonical checks the software repository for bugs and malicious code. But the ultimate responsibility is yours.\nIf the software in question does not need access to sensitive files, it can (in principle) be installed in the home folder though not in the Ubuntu way. You will for instance have to compile the source code yourself or run a custom install script. Beside the greater efforts of that it has the disadvantage of not allowing other users access to your just installed program (as they have no right to access your home-folder). They will need to installed it a second time. So this way of installation makes no sense in a large scale and in a small scale it's usually easier to type a password than to install software manually.\nSo that's why Synaptic aaks for a password and why it's good that it does.\n\nSudoers\nIf you are really in dire need of having other users install software without password, you can add them to the sudoers list. This however will result in a great security risk. If that doesn't concern you, consider that there a bot networks out there with great resources to break into your computer via Internet. They do this just to add your computer to the net and use it's connection and computing power without your knowledge to do all sorts of illegal stuff. They are not even after your personal data your you for that matter. They just want to hijack your PC. Still not concerned? Really? Then look at the following answer which is a small how-to on the workings of sudoers list:\nHow to make Ubuntu remember forever the password after the first time\nRead that carefully. You could lock yourself out of the system.\nThe scare is over\nSo now you have the scare behind you are and taking the matter seriously, I can tell you it's really not that bad. If you trust the people working on your computer, and you don't have programs installed that allow remote access to your system (e.g. an ssh- or ftp-server), then it's really not that dangerous to disable the password stuff. Just don't do it without considering the worst case and think of your private data.\n\nOverlook on the proceedings (don't do this lightly - see text and link above):\n# in shell type these commands\nsudo su       # in case you do something stupid, you'll have a root shell open\nselect-editor # (optional) will allow you to select text editor\nvisudo        # secure way to open sudoers list\n\nAn editor will open ADD a line like this:\nconfus confusion=(root) NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/synaptic,/usr/bin/software-center\n\nSyntax explanation: username machine=(usernameToRunCommandAs) command1,command2,.... So the above line allows confus to run synaptic and softwarecenter as root without password query. You will still need to start it with sudo synaptic or gksudo synaptic or put an alias `alias synaptic='sudo synaptic' in your shell profile.\n\nA: You touched upon a BIG difference between windows and ubuntu. In Windows when you are logged in as an admin programms will be installed without asking for a password. This enables also malware to run their programs. In Ubuntu (Linux) even being logged in as an admin the system will always ask for your password when you change the system. Therefore, malware cant intrude your system easily. To sum up run Ubuntu as an admin. If you open another user account for your kids than give them only normal user rights so they cant screw up the system.\n\nA: You can install software as a regular, non-admin, user. Software installed by a regular user will be \"owned\" by that user, which means that, in effect, it is an extension of the user -- it has no more permissions than the owning user does, though it may have fewer permissions, at the user's option.\nA common practice is for a user to create a 'bin' directory within their home directory. If /home/[user]/bin exists, it is added to the beginning of that user's path. You can place executable files in /home/[user]/bin, or in any other folder to which you have write and execute access, and execute the program from there.\nWhat a regular user can't do is install a package system-wide. A regular user can't put executable files in /usr/bin, for instance, nor grant them permissions that exceed the user's own permissions. This is, obviously, for basic security reasons -- you need admin permissions to reformat a hard drive, for instance, and you don't want someone unauthorized doing that.\nAs far as I know, you cannot use package management software to install a software package unless you have admin permissions, as package management is done system-wide.\nHowever, without admin permissions, you can create shell scripts, write and compile source code, download and compile \"tarballs\", which are packages of source code for complex applications, or download executable files, so long as these can be used with only the permissions of a regular user. Some indie games, such as World of Goo or X-Plane 9, can be installed and used in this way.\n", "Q: What webcam apps are available and how to check if your webcam is working? What software is available for using webcams or ways of checking if my webcam is working correctly after installing Ubuntu.\n\nA: Mousetrap \nWhat is MouseTrap?\nMousetrap is a standalone GNOME application that allows users with physical impairments to move a mouse cursor. It uses a webcam to track the motion of any object visible by the camera and moves the mouse cursor according to the path of the tracked object (a user's head, for example). Distributed with software that allows accessible mouse clicking, MouseTrap will give most physically impaired users access to the full functionality of a mouse. Our ultimate goal is to have a usable, stable solution that allows users to control their cursors just as well as someone using a mouse.\nMouseTrap is written in Python, based on the OpenCV library and uses image processing to translate the user's head movements into mouse events (movements, clicks) which allow users to interact with the different desktops managers and applications.\nHow does it work?\n\nYoutube demo video\nhttp://www.youtube.com/profile?user=flaper87#grid/uploads\n\nA: Guvcview \nDescription - Simple GTK+ interface for capturing and viewing video from\ndevices supported by the Linux UVC driver.\nFeatures\nVideo Recording - Yes\nImage Capture - Yes\nVideo/Image Effects - Yes\nSend Video/Image Remotely - No\nSave in Different Formats - Yes\nOptions to Change Video/Image Properties - Yes\nGUI Based - Yes\nNote - May need to run the app from terminal to change the device location.

From what I've read it may not even be possible, but I'm unsure whether it's a limitation of Gmail or Evolution, or whether it's supposed to be fixed in the near term.\nThanks\n\nA: Tasks are currently not supported in Evolution due to missing support for Google Tasks in underlying library (libgdata).\nThere's a bug entry in Gnome's Bugzilla for that: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=652132\n\nA: I was looking for same, and as I run 11.04 I can't use something like google-task-indicator even if I wanted.\nAs Evolution is nicely integrated with date/time indicator, I thought to take advantage of that.\nI first tried RTM which I thought to interface with Tasque but found that RTM integration in Tasque is buggy. Then I left RTM interface for later and tried to export RTM events to my Google calendar account which I integrate in Evolution. Either importing RTM event ical calendar in Google calendar or directly in Evolution as new calendar, resulted in calendar without events, although I created couple of test tasks in RTM Inbox and give 1 hour time-out for both scenarios.\nHere, another possibility which does not seem too useful to me, would be RSS export from RTM and then use some RSS indicator to track this tasks, but already discouraged by previous writing I looked for other approach.\nSo, I made new calendar in Google calendar, called Tasks, and added it to my Evolution calendars. This may not be solution for all, but for me it's enough. I can add \"tasks\" thought Evolution \"Add event...\" action from date/time indicator, but for quicker way I made \"shortcut\" script called \"add-task\" wrapped around googlecl and put it in ~/.local/bin/:\ngoogle calendar add --cal Tasks \"$@\"\n\nand then from terminal I can quickly add task like:\n$ add-task \"Finish that paper for 3 days\"\n\nwhich will show in date/time indicator (pale yellow colored), for next 3 days:  \n\nThis is one working possibility, and it seems easy to make yet other different approaches, with or without downloading too much software\nHope someone finds it useful ^_^\n", "Q: How to setup neatx?

I need to change the postfixes of all files (all the same .JPEG) to .jpeg (Capital vs. lower case).\nIs there a quick way of doing so?\n\nA: There is a tool for this:\nsudo apt-get install renameutils or click renameutils \n(if not already installed)\nwhere you can do (from command line):\nrename s/\\.JPEG$/\\.jpeg/ *.JPEG\n\nA: Although this is possibly not the best solution for this particular usage case,\nfor i in *.JPEG; do mv \"$i\" \"$(basename \"$i\" .JPEG).jpeg\"; done\n\nalso works. We can do some trickyness with bash in order to slightly increase efficiency (avoiding in invocation of an additional sub-process in the inner loop), ending up with:\nfor i in *.JPEG; do mv \"$i\" \"${i%%.JPEG}.jpeg\"; done\n\nThis solution is most useful if you want to do something else in additon to renaming the files, such as logging what names were changed, or even just doing a dry run to ensure that it does what you want.\n\nA: Found it a second after posting:\nrename 's/\\.JPEG$/.jpeg/' *\n\n\nA: Use the Perl program rename which is installed by default:\nrename 's/\\.JPEG$/.jpeg/' *.JPEG\n\nThe first argument is a Perl regular expression matching filenames ending with .JPEG and replaces it with .jpeg.\nThe second argument selects the files that should be matched, in your case every file in the current directory ending on .JPEG. You could specify a different location of course:\nrename 's/\\.JPEG$/.jpeg/' ~/Pictures/*.JPEG\n\nOther answers I've seen:\n\n\n*\n\n*rename s/.JPEG$/.jpeg/ * - this will also rename files like StupidJPEG to Stupi.jpeg because the dot is matches any character. .JPEG$ is a regular expression\n\n*rename 's/\\.JPEG$/\\.jpeg/' * - works, but it's less efficient because it passes all files in the current directory to rename.\n\n*rename -n 's/.JPEG$/.jpeg/' *.JPEG - the -n option would show the files being renamed, without actually renaming them (\"dry run\"). Because *.JPEG matches files postfixed with .JPEG only, the dot-matches-all issue is non-existent here.\n\n\nA: Use the rename command. It's different than move and often is causes confusion because it was specifically created with picture renaming in mind.\nSomething like this command should work (for all files that end in .JPEG, change .JPEG to .jpeg)\nrename -n 's/.JPEG$/.jpeg/' *.JPEG\n\nA: Doing things in parallel  is getting more and more important, hence I recommend:\nparallel mv {} {.}.jpg ::: *.JPG\n\nThis utility is not installed by default though.\n\nA: If you are looking for a nice GUI solution and don't want to muck about with complicated command line arguments, there is a great Nautilus script available to rename files. It has a simple interface and many options. \nAvailable here: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Renamer?content=87601\n", "Q: How do I find out the correct amount of video RAM of a radeon card when using the open source driver?

It comes with complete source code and a license that permits use in any free project or commercial product.\nAs well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla includes features especially useful when editing and debugging source code. These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and call tips. The selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and background colours and multiple fonts.\nSciTE is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities for building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple configurations - I use it for building test and demonstration programs as well as SciTE and Scintilla, themselves.\nDevelopment of Scintilla started as an effort to improve the text editor in PythonWin. After being frustrated by problems in the Richedit control used by PythonWin, it looked like the best way forward was to write a new edit control. The biggest problem with Richedit and other similar controls is that they treat styling changes as important persistent changes to the document so they are saved into the undo stack and set the document's dirty flag. For source code, styling should not be persisted as it can be mechanically recreated.\nScintilla and SciTE are currently available for Intel Win32 and Linux compatible operating systems with GTK+. They have been run on Windows XP, Windows 7, and on Ubuntu 10.10 with GTK+ 2.20.\n\nA: GVim \nFor any languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Java, makefiles, Bash, Perl, HTML, JavaScript, assembler, PHP, Ruby, erb, fstab, passwd, most system configuration files, and much more, practically anything you want, I've yet find a need to download extra syntax highlighting plugins); available on most platforms on earth (Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, Unix, etc.).\nGVim is a very configurable text editor with a unique and very powerful editing capabilities. The idea of being in command mode by default instead of insert mode and the mnemonic keybindings might take some getting used to for people coming from other IDE/editors, but once you get used to it, they allow you to edit text at the speed of thought. It is an editor optimized for touch typist as all functionalities are available via the keyboard (there are mouse support for those still learning the ropes, but the keyboard are much faster).\nGVim comes with a clean, no nonsense interface by default (unlike most IDEs featured in here, GVim loads in seconds, not minutes), although with a little configuration you can turn it into anything you want it to be as GVim comes with a wealth of plugins and customization options written in VimScript or Python.\nThere is a terminal version as well, Vim, which works mostly the same, but inside a terminal.\nScreenshots:\nGVim's default interface; clean, zero nonsense:\n\nGVim with two tabs open, with a tree file explorer plugin on the left and editing a Django (Python) file on the right:\n\nVim running inside GNOME Terminal, showing the diff of two C++ files:\n\n\nA: gedit \nYou have a symbol browser and autocompletion.\n\n\nA: Sublime Text\nSublime Text 2 is a simple, faster editor available on all major platforms (Linux, Windows, and Mac).\n\nSublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, HTML and prose.\nYou'll love the slick user interface and extraordinary features.\n\nSome noted features:\n\n*\n\n*Minimap: See your code from 10,000 feet\n\n*Full screen mode: Use all your pixels, all the time\n\n*Multiple selections: Simplify many tasks that used to require macros\nor regular expression\n\n*Asynchronous file loading, so you're never blocked when loading files\noff slow network drives\n\n*Syntax highlighting for many languages with C, C++, C#, CSS, D,\nErlang, HTML, Groovy, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, LaTeX, Lisp, Lua, Markdown, MATLAB, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, SQL, Tcl, Textile and XML supported out of the box, and more available for\ndownload\n\n*Multiple color schemes, with several included, and many more\navailable for download\n\n*Side by side multi-pane editing\n\n*Fully customizable key bindings, menus and toolbar\n\nPlus many other features.\nLinux\n\nWindows\n\n\n\nNOTE: Although it's not a free editor, you will get an unlimited evaluation for free.

A screenshot of the main window can be seen below. All the expected features of an IDE can be found in Qt Creator including, but not restricted to, auto-completion, code-wrapping, class browser, etc. The big advantage of using Qt Creator over another IDE or text editor when working on a Qt project is the built-in GUI editor, Qt Designer, that can be used to rapidly produce UIs in a fraction of the time it would take to type the code by hand. Qt Creator also includes support for various version control systems, including Git.\n\nQt Designer come both as a stand-alone editor and build into Qt Creator. GUI design with Qt Designer is done simply by dragging and dropping the UI element from the right-hand column onto the canvas in the middle, and the left-hand column contains the properties of each object. In the screenshot below, I have dragged a few buttons onto the canvas for illustrative purposes.\n\nThere are a few other official Qt applications that can be used when building Qt applications, either with or without Qt\nCreator. Qt Linguist is a tool for easily translation Qt applications into other languages. When writing the source code in Qt creator, the programmer would write a user-facing string of text like so\ntr (\"My String\")\n\nThis marks the text as requiring translation. (NB: it is good practice to include these markers even if you don't intend to translate it yourself). Qt Linguist would then look for these markers and present a UI, similar to Launchpad's translation tools, where the translator can enter the translated string for each language into a text entry field and call the string translated. A screenshot of Qt Linguist being used to translate an application into Polish can be seen below.\n\nFinally, there is Qt Assistant, which contains all the documentation and reference material required to get the most out of the Qt application suite. If you're ever used Devhelp, from the Ubuntu Software Centre and where all the documentation for developing on Ubuntu can be found, then you'll already know what to expect from this. If you need to know what a particular class does, just search for it's name in Qt Assistant and you'll be taken straight to the reference page. If you want to know more about using any of the above Qt applications, user manuals for all of them can be found in here. All the documentation is stored locally so Qt Assistant can be used without an internet connection.\nAs with any language, framework or toolset, it is entirely possible to develop using the provided libraries without using a specialised development environment, such as those mentioned above. It's also possible to buy your own milking cow and head out with a bucket every morning at 6am, rather than heading down to the store and buying a carton that will last a week. A developer's time is a precious resource - use it wisely by using the right tools for the right job. These tools are developed by Nokia, the developers of the Qt Framework and are, as such, the best possible tools for developing Qt applications (actually, they may be the only tools).\nIf you want to develop a Qt application, go into the Ubuntu Software Centre, search for 'qt', and download everything with the little green Qt logo next to it.\nMore information on Qt can be found at the Qt Developer Centre, while more information on the tools themselves can be found here.\n\nA: Emacs \n\n*\n\n*It is a text editor which is designed to be used without moving your hand away from the letters section of the keyboard.\n\n*It has the ability to open and close several text file side by side.\n\n*It is highly configurable (though it requires some patience to learn how to configure)\n\n*Most of the crucial features of an IDE are included into Emacs (autocomplete, precompiling, syntax highlighting, etc.)\n\n*It is fully functional both from terminal and GUI environment\n\n*It has a built in easy-to-follow documentation\n\nI never tried to develop any GUI application with Emacs, but for command line programming it is a killer.\n\n\nA: Code::Blocks \n\nCode::Blocks is the open-source, cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It is based on a self-developed plugin framework allowing unlimited extensibility. Most of its functionality is already provided by plugins. Plugins included in the base package are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiler frontend to many free\ncompilers\n\n\n*Debugger frontend for GDB (and CDB\nfor windows platforms)\n\n\n*Source formatter (based on AStyle)\n\n\n*Wizard to create new C++ classes\n\n\n*Code-completion / symbols-browser\n(work in progress)\n\n\n*Default MIME handler\n\n\n*Wizard to create new Code::Blocks\nplugins\n\n\n*To-do list\n\n\n*Extensible wizard based on scripts\n\n\n*Autosave (saves your work in the\nunfortunate case of a crash)\n\n\nCurrently, Code::Blocks is oriented towards C and C++. It can also be used for creating ARM, AVR, D, DirectX, FLTK, GLFW, GLUT, GTK+, Irrlicht, Lightfeather, MATLAB, Ogre, OpenGL, Qt 4, SDL, SFML, STL, SmartWin and wx programs and applications. Although, in some cases, the respective SDK of framework installation is required for development on a specific technology.\n\n\nA: IntelliJ IDEA\nThey have a community (free) and a paid version. You can have your git system included in this IDE's menus, and there are lots of nice features that make it an industrial strength code tool for any programming jobs. A fantastic IDE for developing in JavaScript.\n\n\nA: MonoDevelop \nMonoDevelop is the main IDE for Mono (.NET) development on Linux, but it also works on OS X and Windows in recent versions. The focus is on C#, Vala and Java (via IKVM.Net), but other languages are supported. It includes debugging, code completion, NUnit unit testing and a framework for more plugins, as well as built-in support for Subversion and Git VCS.\nMore screenshots can be found here\n\nFeature Highlights\n\n\n*\n\n*Multi-platform Supports Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.\n\n*Advanced Text Editing Code completion support for C# 3, code templates, code folding.\n\n*Configurable workbench Fully customizable window layouts, user defined key bindings, external tools\n\n*Multiple language support C#, VB.NET, C/C++, Vala\n\n*Integrated Debugger For debugging Mono and native applications\n\n*GTK# Visual Designer Easily build GTK# applications\n\n*ASP.NET Create web projects with full code completion support and test on XSP, the Mono web server.\n\n*Other tools Source control, makefile integration, unit testing, packaging and deployment, localization\n\n\nA useful feature of the C/C++ compiler in MonoDevelop is the way C++ packages are managed like .NET resources, so library configuration is a doddle.\n\nA: JS Studio\nJS Studio is a Qt-based cross-platform IDE for developing JavaScript-based web applications.\n\nJS Studio is designed to be a fully-featured IDE for developing web applications with a focus on interactive JavaScript-based apps. Here are some of the features currently available:\n\n*\n\n*Syntax highlighting for some common languages (JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS)\n\n*Project management (add / remove / rename files)\n\n*Interface can be fully extended / modified by JavaScript addons (includes addon manager)\n\nYou can install the application (from its PPA) using these commands:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:george-edison55/george-edison\nsudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install jsstudio\n\nDisclaimer: I am the lead maintainer and programmer for this project.\n\nA: RStudio\nA good IDE for R.\nRStudio pulls all graphics, console, and scripts together into one window and adds a useful frame for keeping track of datasets and objects. One great feature is that plots are stacked so that you can review and even manipulate prior plots.\nIt's cross platform and can even be run on a Linux server and accessed via a browser.\n\n\nA: Kate\nKate's a simple IDE with a plugin structure that allows easy development on KDE desktops.\n\n\nA: Aptana Studio\nAptana Studio is an open source integrated development environment (IDE) for building web applications. Based on Eclipse, it supports JavaScript, HTML, DOM and CSS with code-completion, outlining, JavaScript debugging, error and warning notifications and integrated documentation. Additional plugins allow Aptana Studio to support Ruby on Rails, PHP, Python, Perl,1 Adobe AIR, Apple iPhone and Nokia WRT (Web Runtime). Aptana Studio is available as a standalone on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, or as a plugin for Eclipse.\n\nPHP\nAptana Studio 3 provides the following support for PHP application development\n\n*\n\n*Syntax Coloring according to the selected theme in the preferences\n\n*Code Assist\n\n*Syntax error annotations\n\n*Auto indentation and Code Formatting\n\n*Hyper-linking to classes, functions and variables by hovering over elements and pressing the Ctrl key\n\n*PHPDoc popups when hovering over items that have attached documentation\n\n*Read and write Occurrences Markers when clicking on specific PHP elements.\n\n*Built-in PHP server for previewing within Aptana Studio,\n\n*Full code assist, code outlining and code formatting,\n\n*Integrated PHP debugger,\n\n*Built in Smarty,\n\n*Type hierarchy view,\n\n*Go to declaration,\n\n*Integrated PHP manual (online or local).\n\nRuby on Rails\nAptana Studio supports Ruby on Rails development using RadRails, an open source plugin for the Ruby on Rails framework. This includes\n\n*\n\n*Integrated Ruby on Rails shell console,\n\n*Default-install and configuration of the Ruby interpreter, database and debugger,\n\n*code completion with type inferencing,\n\n*Code Assist for Ruby, CSS, JavaScript and HTML inside RHTML files,\n\n*Type hierarchy view,\n\n*Go to declaration,\n\n*Call hierarchy,\n\n*Full implementation of RDT (Eclipse's Ruby Development Tools project).\n\nPython\nAptana Studio provides support for Python in the form of the PyDev plugin. This provides the following advantages\n\n*\n\n*Color syntax highlighting\n\n*Code completion\n\n*Code outlining\n\n*Debugging\n\n*Refactoring tools\n\n*Interactive console\n\n*Unittest integration\n\n*Integrated support for the CPython, Jython and IronPython interpreters.\n\n\nA: CodeLite\n\nThis IDE is relatively young, but it has evolved amazingly quick to become a very stable IDE for C++ development, with a surprisingly reliable autocompletion feature.\n\nA: KDevelop\nKDevelop is an IDE that allows you to develop applications in different languages.\n\n\nKDevelop 4.3 has decent support for C++11.\n\nA: Nano\nNano is a minimalistic text editor you can run from your terminal. It comes installed by default.\n\nFor syntax highlighting, try looking at How do I enable syntax highlighting in nano? or this Ubuntu Forums post.\n", "Q: Issue installing Midori I've downloaded Midori, and am attempting to build and install.

This is the first time I've seen it being used - cool :)\nIf you install valac from synaptic or the Software Centre you should get past that check.\n\nA: go to software center, type in midori and install. comes as a default in some distros.  also comes with duckduckgo search engine.  one of the most secure i have used.  not an advert, just my opinion.\n", "Q: Trust SSH server based on key instead of if key+IP match Is it possible to make the ssh client not care what IP a ssh server is behind (and if a different server was behind that IP earlier) but instead trust specific server keys? (And maybe nickname those keys?) I use dynamic DNS and I have IPv6 privacy extensions enabled on some computers and am always getting asked if it think it's safe to connect. Another possibility is addresses assigned by DHCP getting assigned to different ssh servers and causing all sorts of 'key doesn't match IP' errors.\n\nA: Add a nickname for your server in ~/.ssh/config, and turn off CheckHostIP for this server.\nHost nickname\nHostName example.dyndns.org\nCheckHostIP no\n\nBefore you connect to the server for the first time, you can copy the public key out-of-band: grab /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub from the server, remove the root@hostname part at the end of the line, add example.dyndns.org at the beginning, and append the line to ~/.ssh/known_hosts. Optionally run ssh-keygen -H to hash the host name (this is only useful if you're concerned about the privacy of that entry if someone steals your hard disk or your backups, which for 99.99% of people is useless because the information is present in some other nearby location anyway).\n\nA: In /etc/ssh/ssh_config add the line\nCheckHostIP no\n\nHowever, this takes away a bit of the Secure in SSH, because any machine can hide behind the IP or DynDNS name you connect to.\n", "Q: How to enable remote desktop from remote? Most of the times after installing ubuntu, we forget to enable Remote Desktop. How ever we have installed ssh in all the ubuntu systems. Is it possible to enable Remote Desktop remotely? It will be helpful for us if it is possible..

We would like to monitor few servers,like if the server goes down i \nshould get a pop-up instantly without fail. I know it is possible, \nbut i have no idea on how to setup it. It will be so kind if someone helps\nme to setup it. Thanks in advance..\n\nA: You can use ping. Although ping failure doesn't necessarily mean that your system is down, it can also happen if the network is down but I believe for most intents and purposes these are same thing. You can use following script\n#!/bin/bash\nHOSTS=\"cyberciti.biz theos.in router\"\n\nCOUNT=4\n\nfor myHost in $HOSTS\ndo\n  count=$(ping -c $COUNT $myHost | grep 'received' | awk -F',' '{ print $2 }' | awk '{ print $1 }')\n  if [ $count -eq 0 ]; then\n    # 100% failed \n    echo \"Host : $myHost is down (ping failed) at $(date)\"\n  fi\ndone  \n\nThis is from here. You can also setup a cron job for this or any similar script to ping all your servers after a regular interval.\n\nA: Nagstamon  might be useful. \nFrom their website:\nNagstamon is a Nagios status monitor for the desktop. It connects to multiple Nagios, Icinga, Opsview, Centreon, Op5 Monitor/Ninja and Check_MK Multisite monitoring servers and resides in systray or as a floating statusbar at the desktop showing a brief summary of critical, warning, unknown, unreachable and down hosts and services and pops up a detailed status overview when moving the mouse pointer over it. Connecting to displayed hosts and services is easily established by context menu via SSH, RDP and VNC. Users can be notified by sound. Hosts and services can be filtered by category and regular expressions.\n\nNot used it myself and I do not see the ability for mail notification (what I'd favor)\n", "Q: How do I start applications automatically on login? How can I make an application automatically start when I have logged in?\n\nA: You can use GNOME Startup Application. \nClick the Add button and then add the full command to open the application you want.

This may have following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=<Name of application as displayed>\nExec=<command to execute>\nIcon=<full path to icon>\nComment=<optinal comments>\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n\nYou may have to give this file execute permission.\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.10 with UNITY Instructions\nTo do this with a command that requires sudo is a bit tricky.\nIn my case, I wanted to disable the PSMOUSE driver using the command sudo rmmod psmouse to prevent a mouse click problem that randomly manifests itself. See Dealing with Mouse and Touchpad Freezes in Linux for more info on this problem.  I got tired of entering it on every boot.\nOn my install, the ~/.config folder did not have an autostart sub-folder, so I created one.  This enabled my Startup Applications Preferences settings to be saved.\nIn order to toggle visibility of hidden startup applications, you can use the following commands.\nTo show them :\nsudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\n\nTo hide them :\nsudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=false/NoDisplay=true/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\n\nConfigure your command as per above posts in the Startup Applications Perferences window.\nName:    Fix Mouse\nCommand: sudo rmmod psmouse\nComment: Fix Mouse\n\nThen you have to edit the /etc/sudoers file using sudo visudo. \nAdd a line that contains the following info:\nusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/rmmod\n\nYou must enter this line below the line which starts with %admin.  I added my line to the end of the file.\nIt is IMPORTANT to use sudo visudo to edit this file as making a mistake will prevent you from being able to do any sudo commands at all.  If that happens, boot in recovery mode and undo your edits, then try using sudo visudo.\nNote:\nInitially I tried using a bash script to run my the command indirectly, but this didn't work.  I had to put sudo rmmod psmouse directly in the Edit Startup Program window.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 12.04, \n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Startup Application from the top right menu\n\n\n*Without clicking on Add, open Dash and type the application you want running at startup e.g. Skype\n\n\n*Drag the application to the Startup application window. If Dash windows is too big that you can't drag your app outside, use the restore window button (shown in the previous image) at the top left corner.

You can change the 120 to whatever you wish.\nFor 14.04 and 16.04\nType Startup in Dash, and run Startup Application form there\n\nAnd then just follow the rest of the steps.\nPlease note that, if you are using Ubuntu in another language, \"startup\" might not find the correct program. Try another search that is in your language.\n\nA: Both Unity and Xfce4 have GUI programs that allow you to control startup applications. \nFor Unity:\n \n\nFor Xfce4 Startup tool is available in Settings > Session and Startup \n\nImage courtesy of Xubuntu Geek xubuntugeek\nIf the GUI is not what you want, and you want is more advance control, then you can put .desktop files in the ~/.config/autostart/ directory for Xfce4, and a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart for Unity to run applications after a user login. \nCheck this question to get more help on creating .desktop files:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I edit/create new launcher items in Unity by hand?\nAlso note if you want a startup application to start only in XFCE, but not in Unity, you have to put the line OnlyShowIn=XFCE in the .desktop file. It is OnlyShowIn=Unity for a Unity only application.\n\nA: You can use the feature to Remember Currently Running Applications in the System/Preferences/Startup Applications preferences window. Which (when enabled) will \"remember\" all the programs that you are using and will re-open them after a reboot or when starting the system for the first time in a day.\nThis is great when you don't have enough time to make notes of what were you doing the last time and you wish an application to open if it was running the last time. \nIf you wish to remove an application from this feature simply close it and go to this function and press the \"Remember Currently Running Application\" in order to refresh the list of the programs that will be opened the next time.\n\n\nA: For a simple, portable way to do this, you can use Cron. Run crontab -e to edit your user's crontab; add @reboot command to run command on each boot.\n\nA: You might want to start it from a CLI via:\n$ gnome-session-properties\n\n(just in case you're not running GNOME ;))\n\nA: Take a look at $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/autostart directory:\n$ echo $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/autostart\n/etc/xdg/xdg-kde-plasma:/usr/share/upstart/xdg:/etc/xdg/autostart\n\nwhich says there are 3 directories in this example. I wanted to prune the nautilus entry\nsudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/nautilus-autostart.desktop\n\notherwise if you can add it, create a Desktop entry file: sudo touch /etc/xdg/autostart/my-shell-autostart.desktop add these contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=foo\nTerminal=false\nExec=/path/shell.sh\nType=Application\nIcon=/path/icon.png\nCategories=Utility;\n\n\nA: Type \"startup applications\" in your Unity Dash and it will list you that application which you can click to open.

My keyboard has media keys and they work globally on Unity with Banshee but don't with VLC when another app is focused.\nHow would I fix that?\n\nA: The only workaround I could think of is to add a key modifier, e.g. press an Alt while pressing the multimedia key. That way the key combination is different from what's captured by GNOME thus it simulates the effect of using multimedia key to control VLC. \nI used this only for play/pause (So the key is Alt+XF86AudioPlay, something like this; in VLC it shows as Alt+\"Media Play Pause\").\n\nA: I had a similar problem and the issue was that Gnome would capture the media keys before they reached VLC, to fix this you can go to \"System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts\"\nThere you will see a header called sound (Expand it if needed), and remove the key combinations you want in VLC from there (You can disable them by clicking on the item and then pressing backspace).\nOnly problem with this is that any other applications that do use Gnome's built-in handling won't work anymore with the media keys, unless you add them again (Which in turn breaks VLC again)\n\nA: VLC comes with configurable hotkey definitions.

I'm using Linux for about two years now, but due to my Windows legacy I like keeping icons on my desktop instead of docks, panel shortcuts, etc.\nIf Skype is already running, pressing the shortcut starts a new sequence rather than opening an existing one.

Then I searched for more info on conf files for cards. In the end I ended up looking at presets files loaded by pulseaudio, found out there was an Nvidia profile loaded from nvidia.conf.\nI found many hdmi surround 5.1 presets in this nvidia.conf file.\nInverted some channels (eg lfe and front left), saved the file, killed pulseaudio, worked like a charm.\nThanks for the help :)\n\nA: I was able to remap the channels of my analog card like this\ncp /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/default.conf ~/.pulse/rotatedProfile.conf\n\nI edited that file so that the channel map for my configuration is as I wanted\n[Mapping analog-surround-51]\ndevice-strings = surround51:%f\nchannel-map = front-right,rear-right,front-left,rear-left,front-center,lfe\npaths-output = analog-output analog-output-speaker analog-output-desktop-speaker   analog-output-lfe-on-mono\npriority = 8\ndirection = output\n\nthen I had to force pulseaudio to load the alsa card by hand, not automatically, and set the profile to the file I just created. I don't know if there is a way to force a profile to autodetected cards, or force only one card to be manually detected. I commented out #load-module module-udev-detect and #load-module module-detect in /etc/pulse/default.pa and added the following line to the end of the file\nload-module module-alsa-card device_id=Intel profile_set=/home/silent/.pulse/rotatedProfile.conf\n\nwhere device_id can be either a number or string. You can see your card names and id's by doing\ncat /proc/asound/cards\n\nfor reference, my output was like this\n  0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel\n                       HDA Intel at 0xf9ff8000 irq 44\n\nso device_id=0 worked as well as device_id=Intel\nI have seen reports of numeric id's switching places after reboot so if you don't have different cards with the same name I would go for the string representation.\nEdit: in 13.04 modifying extra-hdmi.conf instead of default.conf without messing with default.pa did the trick. On the other hand this has the risk (does it?) of being overwritten during an upgrade.\n", "Q: How to install dhcpd3?

I was in the middle of a large download in Chromium and the power supply to my computer failed (well I tripped over my power cord ...). I see the entry in chrome://downloads/ which says the download was cancelled. \nThere is a link to the file called \"Retry download\" but I would rather not start the download from scratch because I have limited downloads. How can I resume this download?\n\nA: You can resume any download using the wget command provided:\n\n*\n\n*You know the url of the file\n\n*You have the partially downloaded file and know its location\n\n*The server the file is on supports resuming downloads\n\nGetting the required information\nIn Chromium, go the the chrome://downloads/ page. Find the failed download that you want to resume. To get the url, right click on the \"Retry download\" link and click \"Copy Link Address\". The location to the file will be ~/Downloads/NAME.crdownload - NAME is the file name that is displayed above the url in the entry on the chrome://downloads/ page.\nDownloading the file\nThe command to resume the download is:\nwget -c URL -O FILE\n\nwhere URL is the url of the partially downloaded file and FILE is the location of the partially downloaded file. Make sure you escape any spaces in the file path.\nIf the server supports resuming downloads you will see a progress bar like this:\n100%[++++++++++++++++++++++++========================>]\n\nwhere the '+'s indicate what was previously downloaded and the '='s indicate what is currently being downloaded.\nIf the server doesn't support resuming downloads, you will get an error message and it will fail to download. In this case you have no choice but to restart the download.\n\nA: Open this url in Chromium:\nchrome://flags/\nFind this setting and enable it:\n\nEnable Download Resumption Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS Allow\n  downloads that have been interrupted to be continued or restarted,\n  using the Resume context menu item.\n\nYou should now be able to pause/resume downloads if the server supports it (although I think you may not be able to resume downloads interrupted before enabling it).\n\nA: There is one more way which I have tried just now in chromium. You have to pause the download first and then kill the chromium process or shutdown your computer without closing chromium. When you start your computer again chrome will ask you to restore your tabs. Click on that button and then you can resume your download from the downloads tab.\nMandatory: Server should support resuming download.\nI tried this on Ubuntu 16.04 and chromium (64bit).\n", "Q: How to create a PPA that just contains links to other PPAs?

(you can  uninstall it easy to = the normal way).   It is considered by Windows as a second OS a boot time.   You have no partition - just space of Windows (on the C partition).  Windows is not able to see what is in that space.  Ubuntu can see the complete windows installation on the C-drive.  But a good advice: just try it ( as wubi no more and   not to long).

I know it's used for true transparancy, but what else is it good for?\n\nA: A compositing window manager is a type of window manager. A window manager is software that draws a graphical user interface on a computer display – it positions windows, draws additional elements on windows (such as borders and title bars), and controls how windows interact with each other, and with the rest of the desktop environment. \nCompositing window managers may perform additional processing on buffered windows, applying 2D and 3D animated effects such as alpha compositing, fading, scaling, rotation, duplication, bending and contortion, shuffling, blurring, redirecting applications, and translating windows into one of a number of displays and virtual desktops. Computer graphics technology allows for visual effects to be rendered in real time such as drop shadows, live previews, and complex animation. Since, technically, the screen is double buffered, it does not flicker during updates.\n", "Q: How to SCP a file from Mac -> Ubuntu VirtualBox? I have a Mac (OS X) and a VirtualBox running Ubuntu.  \nI want to SCP a 500mb file from the Mac to the VirtualBox.  How do I do this?  (Probably something to do with /etc/hosts?)\n\nA: After having installed Guest Additions you will be able to create shared folders for access from both, host and guest OS. Any directory on the host can be used for this. The shared folder needs to be mounted on the guest OS by:\nsudo mount -t vboxsf [-o OPTIONS] sharename mountpoint\n\nSee also this answer on usage of shared folders. To make shared folders acessible on each boot of the guest os, you need to add the mounts to the guest fstab.\nAlternatively you can also access directories from the host by adressing them using network shares.\n\nA: Adding to enedene's answer:\nchange the adapter settings on your Oracle VM vitualbox to Bridged Adapter\nOn the top left side of you Virtualbox screen click on \"Machine\"\nClick on Machine>Settings>Network>\nChange the \"Attached to:\" to \"Bridged Adapter\" then Click \"Ok\"\nReset the Virtualbox (Click Machine>Reset)\nOnce it comes up do an ifconfig in terminal and use the new ip address for SCP \n\nA: Put network settings from NAT to bridged adapter in Virtualbox settings for that machine. Then your virtual machine will be in local network with your host machine. It will probably get the IP from modem if DHCP is enabled, then scp to that machine. \nYou also need to have ssh-server installed on Ubuntu machine:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\nThat should work:\nscp file host:/some/directory\n\nA: User port forwarding \n- With guest running, go to VirtualBox settings/network\n- Click Port Forwarding\n- Name \"ssh\", protocol TCP, Host port = 3022, Guest port = 22\nThen, on the host,\nscp -P 3022 myFile localhost:\n\n\nA: If you install the Virtualbox Guest Addons you can create a shared folder. Then use vboxmount (as root) under Ubuntu to mount the shared folder. Afterward, copy normally (cp).\nIf you actually need to use scp, let me know. I will dig up that information.\n\nA: Cyberduck\nfugu \nYou could also run WinSCP under wine..\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu One support OS Settings sync? Being new to Linux and to Ubuntu, I've taken quite some time to tune it to my needs on my netbook. As I'm now convinced by the OS, I plan to install it on my desktop in the next few days. I was hoping that with Ubuntu One, after a sync, I would find back all my settings on the newly installed machine : system settings, language, list of installed programs (to quickly reinstall the same set), email chat and microblog accounts, Unity launcher shortcuts, etc... \nI've just read trought the Ubuntu One website and it seems such a settings-sync feature is not part of it. Is this something that could be done? Is it planned? Is there another way to achieve this same effect?\nThanks in advance for any infos on that.\n\nA: Ubuntu One does not currently support settings sync of arbitrary applications, although we're asked for it a lot. There are a couple of reasons for this. The major one is this: applications need to be written with settings sync in mind. If you take an arbitrary application, which stores its data in a configuration file, then that application is extremely unlikely to notice if Ubuntu One changes that configuration file while the application is running. Indeed, the app will almost certainly overwrite any Ubuntu One-made changes if you change the configuration of the app yourself. \nA second issue is that applications do not distinguish between machine-specific settings and user-specific settings. If, for example, your app remembers the last files that it loaded, and you sync that list of recent files with Ubuntu One, what should other instances of that app (on other computers) do if those files are not present? If you save the app's window's position on your huge monitor, and then sync that setting to your netbook, how does the app cope with that? All of these things are certainly handleable within the app, but many apps don't actually realise that they may need to handle them.\nThe issue here is not that settings sync is in itself hard, but that applications are not really built with the idea that the settings file may contain \"impossible to create\", unlikely, or contradictory settings, and that the settings file may change at any time.\nSome applications are set up to deal with this, and as part of the Ubuntu One application developer programme I'd be happy to talk to any application developer who would like their app to have syncable settings, to work out how best to do it for that app.\n\nA: I have a similar problem I have a netbook that has all my current data & settings on it & I want my desktop software & files to be the same. \nThis is how I fixed my problem.\nLet's call the computer with all the original data on it (in my case the netbook) the source & the computer that you want to get the data to the target. \nStep 1). Make sure the source system is up to date\nsudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade\n\nStep 2). BACKUP the source user files. There are lots of different ways to do this. This is a good article on backing up. I also have a few articals on backing up in the IT section of my website www.marchiggins.com. \nPersonally, I choose rsync for this kind of task. \nrsync -av /source_directory /target_directory\n\nDepending on the destination you are going to backup your data to you need to run something like this on the source computer;\nrsync -av /home/ /media/USB\nrsync -av /usr/local /media/USB\ncp /etc/apt/sources.list /media/USB\n\nTechnically in addition to the above you should also be getting your whole /etc directory & everything in /var (except /var/cache & /var/tmp) but I never bother. As you can see above I do make sure I get a copy of my /etc/apt/sources file. \nThen we need to check what additional software is installed on the source computer. Again there are several ways you can do this but this is how I do it. \ndpkg --get-selections > /media/USB/installed-software\n\nWill create a file called installed-software that contains all the packages that you have installed.\nStep 3). build the target computer & make sure it is the same OS version as the source computer. You can check your version number like this;\ncat /etc/lsb-release\nStep 4). Once the target has been built, you need to;\nsetup the users;\nsudo adduser\n\ncopy the sources.list\nsudo cp /media/USB /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n& them make sure everything is up to date, just as we did in step 1) \nsudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade\n\nStep 6). Copy across all of your data, just as we did in step two except in reverse\nsudo rsync -av /media/USB /home/\nsudo rsync -av /media/USB /usr/local\n\nNow you need to make sure the user ownership permissions on the home directories are set;\nsudo chown -R username:username /home/pathtofolder\n\nStep 7). Copy the installed-software file across to the Target computer & run the following to install all the software you had on the source machine to the target machine \nsudo aptitude install dselect    \ncp /media/USB/installed-software /\ndpkg --set-selections < installed-software\nsudo dselect\n\nSelect 3. [I]nstall Install & Upgrade Wanted Packages\nAt this point you should have two computers that are the same. \nFrom here you can use unison to keep them in sync or rsync. My preference again is rysnc but many people I know use unison & swear by it.\n\nA: All of these (personal) OS settings are stored in your home folder(~, or /home/username), most (if not all) of them in the form of hidden folders, folders that start with a period, like in ~/.config. You can see such folders if you open your home folder and hit CTRL+H or View > Show Hidden Files.\nSo if you add your home folder to the Ubuntu One sync, most of personal settings will be transfered to the new machine.\nBUT... your installed apps will NOT transfer this way. And most of these settings will only be effective after you install the corresponding app. Also, for such a \"hard\" copy of settings and config files, its advisable to use exactly the same Ubuntu version in both computers, as well as install the same apps and versions.\nThat said, my recommended steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install in your desktop the same Ubuntu version thats in your netbook\n\n*Install in your desktop as many apps and packages as there are currently in your netbook, except those packages and apps that are only relevant in a netbook, like Powertop for example.\n\n*Power off your desktop\n\n*In your netbook, add your home folder to Ubuntu One\n\n*Turn on, login and sync your desktop. Settings will be copied\n\n*Reboot the desktop, so all setting changes will be effective\n\n\nPlease notice this is not a 100% fail proof procedure. Some settings will not work, while some may even let your desktop a little \"weird\", since some settings in a netbook simply dont apply in a desktop enviroment (battery management and screen size to name a few). So a few tweaks and re-tunning of settings will still be necessary. But its faster than doing from scratch.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to make permanent change to .config/user-dirs.dirs?

All you need to do is search for Java. That tends to work as is for me.\nIf you need Sun's Java, say if you want to play Minecraft, you download the JRE as you described from Java.com, but make sure your .bin-file can be executed. You do that by opening a terminal and typing the following (I will assume you have it in your Downloads folder so change the cd line accordingly if that's not where it is):\ncd /home/user/Downloads\nsudo chmod +x jre-6u31-linux-i586.bin\n\nThen, you should be able to close your terminal, right click on your .bin-file and select \"Execute\", which should run the installer. If this is not an option, just do the following from terminal (in the same folder as the two other actions):\n./jre-6u31-linux-i586.bin\n\nThat simply runs the specified file and if you successfully typed in the two first lines, the installation.\n\nA: There are several implementations of Java. The three most common implementations when talking about it for Ubuntu are:\n\n*\n\n*OpenJDK: The primary goal of the OpenJDK project is to produce an\nopen-source implementation of the Java SE Platform (6 and 7). This is\nthe default version of Java that Ubuntu uses and is the easiest to\ninstall.\n\n*Sun Java: Sun Java is the reference implementation for Java 6. Its support has been discontinued in Ubuntu.\n\n*Oracle Java: Oracle Java is the OpenJDK Java Se Platform version 7 implementation from Oracle. Oracle introduced with this implementation a license that prevents distribution.\n\nSince Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) and due to license issues Ubuntu will no longer distribute Oracle's JDK and JRE. Also, previous versions supplied on PPAs suffer from security issues and are not recommended to be installed on any Ubuntu system.\nThere are no more supported .deb releases from Ubuntu with reference to Sun Java or Oracle Java, Ubuntu officially supports OpenJDK and OpenJRE implementation of Java which is the base for Oracle's own implementation.\nOpenJRE is the official implementation of Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for your Ubuntu systems and should suffice to run any Java program that you might require and it's included in the main repository and it's easily installable.\nOpenJRE\nBy opening a terminal and typing\nsudo apt-get install default-jre\n\nthis installs openjdk-11-jre (at the time of writing this, you may install a newer java version in the future, which is now, if it installs a different openjdk version I guess)\nThe openjdk-11-jre package contains just the Java Runtime Environment. If you want to develop Java programs then install the default-jdk package:\n\nAlso important is to install the wrapper for supporting Java applications on your web browser, the Iced-Tea Java Plugin.\nIcedTea Plugin\n\nOr via a terminal\nsudo apt-get install icedtea-plugin\n\nOr look for icedtea-plugin in the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nTo make sure that you are running the correct version of Java, use this command to set your choice:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\njava -version should display the choice you previously made.\n\nIf you need to install OpenJDK-JRE 6 or OpenJDK-JDK 6\nopenjdk-6-jre (click to install) is available for installation for Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) and up.\nInstall it with\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre\n\nOr if you need the developers' package, openjdk-6-jdk (click to install), install it with:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk\n\nA version of the icedtea-plugin (click to install) is also available to install if you are going to use OpenJDK 6.\nInstall it with:\nsudo apt-get install icedtea6-plugin\n\n\nIf you really want to use Oracle's Java SE Platform, see How can I install Sun/Oracle's proprietary Java JDK 6/7/8 or JRE?.\n\nA: Installing OpenJDK - Recommended\nThe simplest way to install Java on Ubuntu is to use OpenJDK. This will work fine for most people. To install it, click on the small button with the Ubuntu logo on it, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nAfter opening the Dash Home, you need to type in Terminal. Click on the icon that is circled in the screenshot below. \n\nThis will open the Terminal, which is Ubuntu's version the the Windows Command prompt, though the Terminal has many more features. Now, copy and paste the following command into the Terminal window. You will need to use ControlShiftV to paste text into the terminal.\nsudo apt-get install -y openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jdk\n\nYou will need to enter your password to use this command. Although it will not show up in the Terminal, it will still be entered when you type it. After running this command, you will be set up to run and develop Java applications.\nInstalling Oracle Java\nOpenJDK works fine for most people, but if you play Minecraft, you will want to use Oracle Java instead. To install Oracle Java, run the command below one at a time in the Terminal.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\nThis will download Java from Oracle's website, and install it for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n\nA: \nNote: WebUpd8 team's PPA has been discontinued with effective from April 16, 2019.

Instead, an installer is used that automatically downloads and installs Oracle Java 8. Using this PPA, you'll also receive automatic Java 8 updates.\nMore information and some tips on using / further configuring Oracle Java 8 @ WebUpd8 is in Install Oracle Java 8 In Ubuntu Via PPA Repository [JDK 8].\n\nA: If you are missing Java in Firefox, then \nplug=~/.mozilla/plugins/libnpjp2.so && \ntest -e $plug && readlink -f $plug || \n  ln -f -s `find ~ -wholename '*jdk*lib*libnpjp2.so' -or -wholename '*jre*lib*libnpjp2.so' | head -n 1` `dirname $plug` && \nls -la $plug\n\nThis script will overwrite libnpjp2.so even if it exists, but points to wrong file (for example, the symlink is broken).\n\nA: I made a text-based Java installer using terminal commands. It uses wget, tar, update-alternatives, and ln. It will install the Oracle JRE with the Firefox plugin.\nYou can download the installer from Google Drive here. Then put it in your home folder, open Terminal and type bash Install. Then it will run the installer in Terminal. It uses sudo, so you will need to type your password after it downloads. Also, this is the 64-bit version, so I will add the 32 bit later.\n\nA: \nNote: WebUpd8 team's PPA has been discontinued with effective from April 16, 2019. Thus this PPA doesn't have any Java files.

I am trying to try out ubuntu (i,e, install it within windows) on my thinkpad x40. I followed the instructions on how to create a bootable usb (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download). No problem. The issue I have now is that th eusb ports on my x40 were burned before (common problem with the machine), i.e. do not work. So I got a USB notebook card from belkin. However it does not seem to recognize the usb stick from bios, thus I cannot boot from it. I also do not have a cd rom. Then tried to run wubi from the usb stick, briefly appears in task manager, no further action.\nSo I tried it with wubi.exe, but same thing. Downloaded it to desktop, run it, briefly appears in the task manager under processes, no further action.\nAny one idea?

Nautilus, executed as user, see them as non free.\nOk, @psusi answer is very clear, I have nothing to add.\n\nA: After partitioning my brand new 8 TB disk with gparted, it reported:\n  Size: 7.28 TiB\n  Used: 59.76 GiB   <-- Huh?\nUnused: 7.22 TiB\n\nWhich is why I ended up here. Now let the investigation begin.\nRunning sudo fdisk /dev/sdc (where /dev/sdc is my new disk)\nreveals:\nDisk /dev/sdc: 7,3 TiB, 8001563222016 bytes, 15628053168 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n...\nDisklabel type: gpt\n\nNote that 15628053168 * 512 = 8001563222016.\nFrom now on lets work in number of SECTORS (which are 512 bytes)\nand work exclusively with hexadecimal notation. This gives us,\nfdisk (real values)\nDisk size: 3a3812ab0\n\nFurthermore, fdisk gives us the partition table:\nDevice     Start         End     Sectors  Size Type\n/dev/sdc1   2048 15628052479 15628050432  7,3T Linux filesystem\n\nLets translate that into hex too (it already is in sectors):\n/dev/sdc1    800   3a38127ff   3a3812000  7.277378082275390625 TiB\n\n(That TiB value is exact; but in decimal. It shows why 7.3 was printed).\nThe first 0x800 sectors are reserved for the Master Boot Record (MBR) and\nthe partition table (type gpt, since it was created by gparted and I choose\nto use that type there).\nThe End sector is inclusive, so indeed\n3a38127ff + 1 - 800 = 3a3812000\n\nBut why was this chosen? Well, because gparted rounded everything off to 1 MiB\nboundaries (it said), which happens to be 0x800 sectors (1024 * 1024 / 512 in hex).\nNevertheless, why didn't it pick 3a3812fff as last sector? Well, because that doesn't exist, the total disk size is 3a3812ab0 as we saw before.\nOk, so we need a little space at the start for MBR and parition table, but only want to start and end partitions at 0x800 boundaries, therefore the first sector is 800 and the last one is 3a38127ff. Leading to a total partition size of 3a3812000 sectors,\nor 7.28 TiB as reported by gparted (8001561821184 bytes in decimal).\nThe type of the filesystem on it is ext4.\nLets start with mounting it, and lets now work in sectors in DECIMAL:\nsudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdc1 /mnt/newdisk\ndf -B512 | grep sdc1\n/dev/sdc1 15502817864 102728 14721279848  1% /mnt/newdisk\n\nSo df reports, in sectors and in hex:\ndf Size: 15502817864 sectors (= 7937442746368 bytes = 7.219... TiB).\ndf Used: 102728 sectors (= 52596736 bytes = 50.16 MiB).\ndf Available: 14721279848 sectors (= 7537295282176 bytes = 6.855... TiB).\n\nHence, the reported size is 8001561821184 - 7937442746368 = 64119074816 = 59.716 GiB less than the partition size reported by fdisk!\nOk, so how does ext4 work?\nWe can quickly get a lot of information running\nsudo dumpe2fs -h /dev/sdc1\n\nThe most important output being\nInode count:              244191232\nBlock count:              1953506304\nReserved block count:     97675315\nFree blocks:              1937839392\nFree inodes:              244191221\nFirst block:              0\nBlock size:               4096\nFragment size:            4096\nReserved GDT blocks:      558\nBlocks per group:         32768\nFragments per group:      32768\nInodes per group:         4096\nInode blocks per group:   256\nFlex block group size:    16\nFirst inode:              11\nInode size:               256\nRequired extra isize:     32\nDesired extra isize:      32\nJournal size:             1024M\nJournal length:           262144\n\nNote that the Block count shows the full partition size. One block being 4096 bytes, we have 1953506304 * 4096 = 8001561821184.\nSo clearly we're looking for blocks that are not available to us. Going with what df reports as Available (7537295282176 / 4096 = 1840159981 blocks available), that are 113346323 blocks that are not available.\nThe journal exists of 262144 blocks, so... 113346323 - 262144 = 113084179 blocks to go.\nWe have 558 reserved GDT blocks... 113083621 block to go.\nThe number of \"groups\" on the fs is 'total number of inodes' / 'inodes per group' = 244191232 / 4096 = 59617.\nThe inodes being 256 bytes in size account for 244191232 * 256 / 4096 = 15261952 blocks, so 113083621 - 15261952 = 97821669 blocks to go.\nWe're out of options here, apparently the Reserved block count isn't available either,\nwhich is 97675315 .. so that leaves 97821669 - 97675315 = 146354 blocks that are unavailable that we didn't explain yet. That is still 571.7 MiB, or ~2.455 blocks per group, but not THAT much compared to the 59.76 GiB that we had to explain.\nRunning the following command:\ncat /proc/fs/ext4/sdc1/mb_groups | sed -e 's/^#.*://' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | sed -e 's/^\\(..............\\).*/\\1/' | grep -v free\n\nWe get the number (first column) of groups that have N blocks free (second column):\n  55860  32768\n   3724  28640\n     22  31743\n      8  0    \n      1  8958 \n      1  28639\n      1  27609\n\nClearly the maximum of free blocks per group is 32768 (most of them), which is also what dumpe2fs reported (Blocks per group).\nSo, let me convert this table to 'Used' in bytes by subtracting the second column from 32768 and multiplying that with 4096 bytes. Then I get\n   3724  16908288\n     22  4198400\n      8  134217728\n      1  97525760\n      1  16912384\n      1  21131264\n\nand 3724 * 16908288 + 22 * 4198400 + 8 * 134217728 + 97525760 + 16912384 + 21131264 = 64268140544 or 59.85 GiB.\nSUMMARY\nUnavailable blocks      Reason\n97675315                Reserved block count (5%)\n15261952                inodes (0.78%)\n262144                  journal (0.013%)\n146354                  Unexplained (0.007%)\n558                     Reserved GDT blocks (0%)\n\nLets start with changing the reserved block count to 0, because this HDD is for long term storage and I really don't care what happens if it runs full (I do, but my system will still function perfectly).\nsudo umount /dev/sdc1\nsudo tune2fs -r 0 /dev/sdc1\n\ndumpe2fs now reports:\nReserved block count:     0\n\nbut more importantly,\ndf -B512 | grep sdc1\n/dev/sdc1 15502817864 102728 15502682368   1% /mnt/newdisk\n\naka\ndf Available: 15502682368 sectors (= 7937373372416 bytes = 7.22... TiB)!\n\nWe can also reduce the number of inodes, but that is only smart if you are sure that you won't need them; for example when you will only store large files on the disk. The number of inodes is roughly the number of files + directories you can store on the disk. So, having 244191232 will allow me to store files with an average size of 32kB (32504 bytes) on this disk. Instead I intent to store mostly files on it of a size of roughly 1 to 2 GB... So yeah, I think I can safely reduce the number of inodes by say a factor 10.\nSo, I decided to reformat my partition (screw gparted, all I needed was a partition table, not a filesystem):\nsudo mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -e remount-ro -i 325040 -j -L '/opt/verylarge' -m 0 -t ext4 -T big -U 48c6a937-aea3-42a0-a69c-c24d0dc65179\n\nAfter which I ended up with\nInode count:              24800672\nBlock count:              1953506304\nReserved block count:     0\nFree blocks:              1951529866\nFree inodes:              24800661\nFirst block:              0\nBlock size:               4096\nFragment size:            4096\nGroup descriptor size:    64\nReserved GDT blocks:      1024\nBlocks per group:         32768\nFragments per group:      32768\nInodes per group:         416\nInode blocks per group:   26\nFlex block group size:    16\nFirst inode:              11\nInode size:               256\nRequired extra isize:     32\nDesired extra isize:      32\nJournal size:             1024M\nJournal length:           262144\n\ndf -H\nFilesystem  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sdc1   8,0T   97M  8,0T   1% /mnt/newdisk\n\nI have NO idea where that 1% comes from, but I'm happy with my 8,0 TB :)\n\nA: There are a few things going on here.  gparted reports the actual used/free space.  The kernel reduces the available count by the reserved space.  After you removed the reserved space, the free count did not change because the reserved blocks already were free; it is just that non root users are not allowed to invade that space to prevent them from causing trouble by filling up the disk.  The gnome numbers are a little flaky because of a bug.  Instead of reporting the used space that the kernel reports ( and df shows ), it computes it by subtracting the free space from the total.  This causes it to show reserved space as used.\nThe missing 4GB is actually used is the fs overhead for ext4.  NTFS only initially allocates a small amount of space for the MFT, and grows it as needed.  The ext series of filesystems though, allocate space for the inode table ( rough equivalent of the MFT ) at format time and it can not grow.  The space missing from the reported total space is the inode table.  The remaining bit of used space is from the journal ( usually 128 mb ) and resize inodes.\n\nA: Try reducing the partition size by a few megabytes using gparted, then increasing it again to its original size.  This may cause other applications to read the sizes correctly. I recently corrected a 50Gb error this way!\n", "Q: Where can I find the configure options used to build a package?

Don't worry about this too much, and just pick one - I'll look at amd64.\nOn the build record page, there's a link to the buildlog - https://launchpadlibrarian.net/62593317/buildlog_ubuntu-maverick-amd64.asterisk_1%3A1.6.2.7-1ubuntu1.1_BUILDING.txt.gz\nAnd if you search the log for \"./configure\", you'll find this:\nPATH=$PATH:/build/buildd/asterisk-1.6.2.7/debian/dummyprogs ./configure \\\n        --host=x86_64-linux-gnu --build=x86_64-linux-gnu \\\n        --prefix=/usr \\\n        --mandir=\\${prefix}/share/man \\\n        --infodir=\\${prefix}/share/info \\\n        --with-cap \\\n        --with-gsm \\\n        --with-imap=system \\\n        --with-pwlib=/usr/share/pwlib/include/ \\\n        --with-h323=/usr/share/openh323/ \n\n\nA: I think that you won't be able to see the configure options from the binary (.deb) package.\nYou can just find some information regarding the dependencies involved by using:  \napt-cache showpkg asterisk\nIf you need to check the configure options, i think you should download the source files by typing:  \napt-get source asterisk\nand then check for the information you need in the debian/rules file.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.04 hangs many times in a day I upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04,My pc hangs many times.  \nWhat does hung mean here?\nMy mouse pointer is stuck and I can't use shortcut keys,and I can't run Alt+F2 and incase I hear music,last song sequence is being repeated again and again.\nWhen does MY pc hung?\n1.While hearing to songs in Rhythm Box.\n2.While using Firefox 4.\nI am using Unity,how can I fix this problem? \n\nA: Go to Ubuntu Classic is my recommendation for the moment.

I want to buy a tablet PC and I've seen a new Dell with Ubuntu 11.04 working perfectly.\nIf I want to install Ubuntu 11.04, will it work easily?\nHow's the process to install Ubuntu with tablet definitions? \n\nA: First of all, it would be nice to have the tablet specs of the laptop that you are talking about.\nHowever, I have experienced nice results when installing previous versions of Ubuntu (9.04, 9.10, 10.04, etc.) when installing to an HP Pavilion tx1000, whose characteristics can be reached by clicking here.\n\nIn those experiences, everything in the tablet started working right out off the box.\nUnfortunately I can't say for Dell or other brands but although everything may work with no hassle at all, you can experience some issues when trying to calibrate the tablet, or even more when trying to use the on-screen keyboard, which was for me the hardest issue that I had to face with the tx1000.\nThe procedure for installing in a Tablet Laptop is exactly the same as for a desktop or common laptop, but if your tablet brand or make are different than those that I have mentioned over here, you should look for a different answer.

WebShell is based on Ajaxterm so I supposed that would be fine, too. The Ubuntu wiki also says shellinabox could be, what you want.

One of the few things I miss in Windows is their Live Sync. I don't know what it's like now or whether it still exists, but at the time (2008/2009), Windows Live Sync lets you sync folders between computers without uploading contents on their server. That is, only the metadata of the subscribed folders are uploaded (things like changelog etc.). I really liked that, and I was wondering if Ubuntu One has an option that does the same thing? At the moment it only seems to have the option to upload all file contents on the web, and I'd rather not do that.\nIf Ubuntu One doesn't have the service similar to Windows Live Sync as described above, then I really recommend it.

I have a folder called img, this folder has many levels of sub-folders, all of which containing images. I am going to import them into an image server.\nNormally images (or any files) can have the same name as long as they are in a different directory path or have a different extension. However, the image server I am importing them into requires all the image names to be unique (even if the extensions are different). \nFor example the images background.png and background.gif would not be allowed because even though they have different extensions they still have the same file name.

However, this messes up the whole partition table so you need to recover it using testdisk (no, I couldn't do this before the delete).\nAfter this, you need to recover your GRUB with a CD or so.\nI hope this helps someone in the future.\n", "Q: List of GUI Based Torrent clients What GUI Based Torrent managers exist in Ubuntu and features they offer in terms of:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Speed to start downloading (Search Speed, Seed, Leech)  \n\n*Speed while downloading  \n\n*Compatibility  \n\n*Stability  \n\n*Data check  \n\n*Other attributes  \n\n\nA: I recommend and use Ktorrent , In the software Center. \nKTorrent is a BitTorrent client written in C++\nFeatures \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Upload and download speed capping / throttling & scheduling.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Internet searching with torrent search engines using KHTML part.\n  \n*Support for UDP trackers.\n  \n*IP address blocklist plugin.\n  \n*Port forwarding with UPnP (Universal Plug and Play).\n  \n*Protocol encryption.\n  \n*DHT (mainline version), and support for trackerless torrents.\n  \n*µTorrent peer exchange (PEX) support.\n  \n*File Prioritization.\n  \n*Ability to import partially-downloaded files.\n  \n*Directory scanner to automatically watch directories for new torrents.\n  \n*Manual addition of trackers to torrents.\n  \n*RSS feed support.\n  \n*Web interface plugin with default port number 8080.\n  \n*IPv6 support.\n  \n*SOCKS v4 and v5 support.\n  \n  \n\nNew features of KTorrent 4.1.1:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*µTP support\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Generation and parsing of magnet links\n  \n*UDP tracker scraping\n  \n*Enhanced usability of the queue manager\n  \n*Optional disabling of the webinterface authentication\n  \n*Super-seeding support\n  \n  \n\nLatest version 4.1.1 : How to install Ktorrent 4.1.1?\n\nA: Transmission is a good Torrent client, it is installed by default .\n\n\nA: Seeing how my question, https://askubuntu.com/questions/228679/whats-the-best-bittorrent-client-for-12-10-excluding-utorrent/228738, was closed as an exact duplicate of this question I thought I might as well post the answer I gave to it here. \nTransmission\nTransmission is the default BitTorrent client of Ubuntu and does favourably. Customer reviews in the software centre give it a 4/5 rating with those less than satisfied with it citing the following as limitations/problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Very basic...\"  ~ Michael Alderson\n\n*\"Works fine and pretty much stable, but lacks some even the most basic features. Also, the interface seems a bit cumbersome.\"  ~ E S\n\n\nIt was unanimous among those that did a review of Transmission in the software centre that it was a relatively stable alternative over other BitTorrent clients. \nAs of the time of this answer (14 Dec 2012) the software centre is lagging a little in the version of Transmission it provides. The latest version in the software centre is 2.61 whereas the latest version of it to date is 2.73.\n\nqBittorrent\nqBittorrent rather unanimously receives positive reviews from users with the review of BitTorrent clients http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-bittorrent-client.htm [mainly aimed at those wanting a free client for Windows] quoting its stability, low RAM usage and consistent CPU usage and encompassment of basic features as its strong suits and its inability to serve multiuser operations being its main limitation.\nIn the software centre the sole limitation of instability was quoted as an issue with the client receiving an approximate, overall star rating of ~9/10. (4 & 1/2 out of 5)\nLikewise as of 14 December 2012 qBitTorrent is lagging behind in the software centre a little. The latest version in the software centre being 3.0.5 whereas the latest version to date is 3.0.6.\n\nVuze\nVuze is a popular BitTorrent client not only in Ubuntu but also in Windows. In the software centre the primary complaint about it is that it is, 'buggy,' or, mostly, in other words it is prone to crashing. One reviewer even stated it is the buggiest app in the software centre they had seen in their six years of using Ubuntu. \nOther than that the major complaint is that the software centre is lagging heavily when it comes to the latest version Vuze it provides. (4.3 vs. 4.8 being the latest release) \nThis problem, may, however, be overcome by downloading the tarball found at http://www.vuze.com/download.php extracting it and then running the executable shell script, 'vuze' in the extracted directory.\nOverall in the software centre it receives 4/5 stars with most quoting its benefits as being its many features and ease of implementing it. \n\nDeluge\nAs far as reviews go there are none in the software centre the pros and cons given at the review earlier quoted (http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-bittorrent-client.htm) are: \nPros:  Cross platform client that is stable for the most part and efficient.  Well accepted at private trackers.  Excellent performance on torrents.  Good help resources.  Clean install, no addons etc.\nCons:  Issue with Add Torrent screen not showing files for magnet links so they can not be deselected before adding to download (they may be deselected after adding).\nWith the reviewer also stating that its performance, in his/her opinion, was a little behind that of qBittorrent. \n\nTixati\nThe review, http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-free-bittorrent-client.htm, says that the pros and cons of this software are: (although the software centre does not store it so no reviews from that source are available)\nPros:  Generally stable and efficient with a good variety of options.  Developers are active and responsive to user requests.  Attractive interface.  Good help resources. No addons etc. during install.\nCons:   Help resource, though very good, could use some more.  Smaller operation, which you may or may not like.  Performance on test torrents was not up to the Superior clients.\n\nMiro\nFinally, if you plan to be torrenting media files, Miro may be the client for you. It has the capability to run a wide range of media files and remembers where you, the user, were up to in watching/listening to your media files. In the software centre Miro received a 3/5 star rating with dissatisfied reviewers citing bugs and advertisements as the reason for their dissatisfaction. \n\nA: deluge  \n\nWhat is Deluge?\nDeluge is a full-featured  BitTorrent client for Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows. It uses libtorrent in its backend and features multiple user-interfaces including GTK+, web and console. It has been designed using the client-server model with a daemon process that handles all the BitTorrent activity. The Deluge daemon is able to run on headless machines with the user-interfaces being able to connect remotely from any platform.\nDeluge is not tied to any particular desktop environment and will work just fine in GNOME, KDE, XFCE and others.\nThe libtorrent library is a huge part of Deluge.\nWhat about features?\nCore/UI split allowing Deluge to run as a daemon\nConnect remotely to the Deluge daemon\nWeb UI\nConsole UI\nGTK+ UI\nBitTorrent Protocol Encryption\nMainline DHT\nLocal Peer Discovery (aka LSD)\nFAST protocol extension\nµTorrent Peer Exchange\nUPnP and NAT-PMP\nProxy support\nWeb seed\nPrivate Torrents\nGlobal and per-torrent speed limits\nConfigurable bandwidth scheduler\nPassword protection\nRSS (via Plugin)\nOther libtorrent features\n\nInstallation\nInstall via command line:\nsudo apt-get install deluge\n\nInstall Deluge via PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~deluge-team/+archive/ppa \nppa:deluge-team/ppa \nClick here for instructions on using PPAs.\n\nA: Comparing the speeds of clients I think this is a difficult question to answer and can only be really tested in lab conditions. \nI am one of the Deluge devs and we get quite a few people that rave about the transfer speed however the credit should really go to libtorrent(rasterbar) which does all the heavy lifting and is at the core of Deluge plus many other clients such as qBitTorrent.\nAs for features there is a large table of torrent client comparisons on wikipedia\nFrom a personal viewpoint I use Deluge torrent client as I perceive it to be the best client for Ubuntu, written in Python with an excellent server/client setup so can be accessed via web, console and gui. It also has a good range of plugins and is very stable.\n\nA: qBittorrent  \nDescription\nAn advanced and multi-platform BitTorrent client with a nice Qt4 user interface as well as a Web UI for remote control and an integrated search engine. qBittorrent aims to meet the needs of most users while using as little CPU and memory as possible. \nFeatures\nSimultaneous download of multiple torrents\nIntegrated torrent search engine\nIntegrated RSS feed reader and downloader\nGood internationalization\nDHT, PeX, Encryption, LSD, UPnP, NAT-PMP\nCross platform (Linux, Mac Os, Windows)\nVery lightweight\nTorrent queueing and prioritizing\nControl over files in a torrent (filtering, prioritizing)\nNice µTorrent-like interface with Qt4 toolkit (qBittorrent v2.x)\nIP filtering (eMule dat files or PeerGuardian files)\nPeer display with country and hostname resolution (qBittorrent v2.x)\nAdvanced control over torrent trackers (qBittorrent v2.x)\nµTorrent peer id spoofing to avoid tracker blacklisting\nClosest open source equivalent to µTorrent (qBittorrent v2.x)\nTorrent creation tool\nRemote control through Secure Web User Interface\n\n\nA: Tixati\nI have tried all popular Linux torrent clients (including Vuze, Deluge, Transmision, Qbittorrent-this one I have used for more then a year) but Tixati beats them all it it's features and simplicity.\nWhat I like most:\n- Torrents management\n-- Add labels\n-- Specify label's download directory (All the files with specified label will be downloaded to corresponding folder)\n- Bandwitch limits (they are visible on interface so you will not forgot to turn them off when needed)\n- Filters to filter the torrents (for example you can show newest torrents always on top)\n- Customizable \"view\" layouts\n- You can open downloaded files directly from Tixati\n- You can prioritize downloads (Ultra High, very High, Hight, etc (10 prioritize options in total))\n- You can set how many torrent can be downloading at the same time (for example two torrent at the time)\nTixati UI (customized)\n\nTixati settings:\n\nMore screenshots and features on their site\nYou cas dowmload .deb .rpm tar.gz from their website: Download Tixati\n\nA: The best one out there is Tixati\nTixati is far better than the rest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple and easy to use\n\n*Ultra-fast downloading algorithms\n\n*DHT, PEX, and Magnet Link support\n\n*Easy and quick install - no java, no .net\n\n*Super-efficient peer selection and choking\n\n*RC4 connection encryption for added security\n\n*Detailed bandwidth management and charting\n\n*UDP Peer Connections and NAT router hole-punching\n\n*List item\n\n*Advanced features such as RSS, IP Filtering, Event Scheduler\n\n*NO Spyware\n\n*NO Ads \n\n\nTo download Tixati go to Tixati/Download\nFor 64-bit Ubuntu download the 64-bit debian package\nFor 32-bit Ubuntu download the 32-bit debian package\nOpen installation folder in termina,\ninstall gdebi by typing\nsudo apt-get install gdebi\n\nand then install Tixati by typing \nsudo gdebi tixati*\n\n\nA: µtorrent, a Windows application, works surprisingly well using wine. On my Natty box, I use an older version, 2.0.4 (get it here). It works more or less as you would expect. You can run it without installation if you supply the /NOINSTALL parameter.\nNote that there is a Linux version in the works, but so far it has no GUI. Also note that it is not free software, so it is not for purists.\nWhy would you want to use a proprietary program like µtorrent where native programs are available? It is tiny. You can very easily restart it if something doesn't work. It is reasonably stable and works reliably. It has a good minimalistic interface. It supports RSS feeds.\n\nA: I have tried Vuze, but as a former utorrent user cannot cope with that heavy memory use. \nTransmission and Bittornado are very poorly featured compared to the rest and with no big economy on resources.\nI tested KTorrent and it seemed ok, but finally experienced some speed deficiency and rather heavy use of my ram.\nI am happy to have found and to recommend qBittorrent and Flush. Much lighter (especially Flush). See how to install here.\n(By the way - utorrent in Wine is much heavier than in windows and a few times forced me to reboot. Version 2.0 is more stable than the rest.)\nqBittorent and Flush may seem to advanced users to still lack complex settings. In this sense, Deluge is very good I think, largely used and trustworthy (to install go to Synaptic or Ubuntu Software Center).\nAnother interesting one is Tixati (to install here). Just look at its features:\n\n\n\n\n(The only thing I don't like is the colorful tray icon. The rest of the colors are customizable.)\nConsidering memory use, it seems that all the clients that I mentioned have about the same 'weight' - excepting Vuze, which is java-style bloated and heavy, and Flush, which is lighter. \n\nA: All anecdotal here, but after trying a lot I ended up preferring qBittorrent.  It is another libtorrent(rasterbar) based client and it performs well for me.  Coming from Windows I wanted something with many of the capabilities I was used to with uTorrent and the two I found that best met that criteria were qBittorrent and KTorrent, and since I wasn't using KDE I went with qBittorrent.\nqBittorrent\n\n\nKTorrent\n\n\nA: I'm still using the good and old Vuze (Azureus) client: http://www.vuze.com/\nSome people may consider it bloatware but I really like it's power. With some tunning I have achieved the best download speed for my network (warning: subjective and empiric benchmarks lol). It's search features are pretty ok if you want to use it. And you can always fall back to the \"Advanced Interface\" (old Azureus Style).\nCheers,\n\nA: Hands down winner is rtorrent. The encryption is best in rtorrent and you can easily bypass the ISP throttling. I used to 2mbps speed with it while all other including utorrent or transmission or vuze gave me just 700kbps to 800kbps max. Below is the link to the tutorial about how to use rtorrent like a pro, it will help you get started quickly\nhttp://harbhag.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/tutorial-using-rtorrent-on-linux-like-a-pro/\n\nA: BitThief - A Free Riding BitTorrent Client\nIt comes from the Distributed Computing Group at ETH Zurich.\nIt is in my opinion one of the slimmest clients available, has no extra features at all and has the fastest download speed.\nIt is run in a Java Environment.\n\nThe client is also interesting, because it's possible to deactivate uploading without any limitation on download speed. More information here.\n\n", "Q: How do I set up an Ubuntu server to be (securely) available from the internet? I want to build an Ubuntu server that will be continuously connected to the internet. I own only an IP address. The main purpose of the server is to be a source code controller (probably git or svn... haven't chosen yet), but also some occasional other uses (file sharing with family or customer, personal backup, host of web applications I may write, etc. I also would like to be able to access the computer at any time to administer it, even behind some customer's proxy that allows only http or https\nWhat are the standard steps to achieve that?\n\n*\n\n*My first thought is to set up openssh server. Is it possible (and quite secure) to open it to the internet on standard port (i.e. customer firewall/proxy compatible)?\n\n*Is it possible to set up a VPN server, that is run from a webpage plugin (also hosted by the server)?\n\n*as I have only one IP address (IP V4 and IPV 6 actually, but I don't think IP V6 address will be accessible from customers network by now), can I make apache and other server software coexist on the same standard ports?\n\nthanks in advance ;)\n\nA: When properly set-up OpenSSH is safe, even on the standard port. Moving it away from the standard port saves you from your log files being filled up by unauthorized login attempts. More details on the end.\nIt's very dangerous to access your server if you do not have control over the computer which should connect to your server (which I think that's the reason why you need to use a browser plugin)\nOpenVPN can be set up to share TCP ports with a HTTP/HTTPS server, from its manual page:\n--port-share host port  \n    When run in TCP server mode, share the OpenVPN port with another\n    application, such as an HTTPS server.\n    If OpenVPN senses a connection to its port which is using a non-OpenVPN\n    protocol, it will proxy the connection to the server at host:port.  \n    Currently only designed to work with HTTP/HTTPS, though it would \n    be theoretically possible to extend to other protocols such as ssh.\n\nIt's not recommended to use OpenVPN with a TCP connection due to its overhead (TCP 3-way handshake). If you've no choice, you could give it a go.\nUsing OpenVPN, you can avoid any port restriction imposed on you and secure the connection. Please refer to How do I setup OpenVPN so I can securely use the internet from an unsecured hotspot? for a guide on setting up OpenVPN.\nYou cannot share ports unless an application supports it (like OpenVPN), so I must disappoint you on that.\nSSH server\nPassword-based authentication without limiting connection attempts is asking for trouble. Because of that, it's preferred to use key-based authentication and disable password-based authentication altogether.\n\n*\n\n*Install openssh-server by running sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n\n*Disable password-based authentication by editing the configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config. To start editing, run sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Find the line #PasswordAuthentication yes and change it to PasswordAuthentication no. By default, SSH listens on port 22. If you want to change it, use a port below 1024 for security reasons. (change the line with Port 22)\n\n\n*For extra security, you can configure a list of users who are allowed to login. Add a line with:\nAllowUsers someuser\n\nReplace someuser by the username of the account that is allowed to log in. Multiple usernames should be separated by a space.\n\n\n*Generate a key on your computer using the command ssh-keygen -t rsa. Enter whatever values you want and choose a secure passphrase.\n\n\n*Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file to /home/someuser/.ssh/authorized_keys file on your server. someuser is the user that should be allowed to login. (it's a single line that should be copied, never copy the contents of a file that starts with -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY\n\n\n*Reload the configuration of your SSH server:\nsudo reload ssh\n\n\n\n*If you're remotely accessing your server over SSH, verify that you can make a new SSH connection to avoid locking yourself out.\n", "Q: Could anyone help me get my NETGEAR WNA3100 (Broadcom BCM43231) wireless adapter to work? I have just moved back to Ubuntu from Windows 7 and a few months ago, I bought a NETGEAR WNA3100 wireless adapter because my old adapter had broken.

With commands like top and the gui based System Monitor I can see that at the moment I have several zombie processes.\nWhat are zombie processes?\nDo they affect the performance of the system or the application they are zombie to. Do they use too much memory or any memory at all?\n\nA: When a child process terminates, its death is communicated to its parent so that the parent may take some appropriate action. \nA process that is waiting for its parent to accept its return code is called a zombie process. \nThey have completed  their execution but still has an entry in the process table.\n\nA: Zombie processes (also show as <defunct>), aren't real processes at all. They are just entries in the kernel process table. This is the only resource they consume. They do not consume any CPU or RAM. The only danger of having zombies, is running out of space in process table (you can use cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max to see how many entries are allowed on your system). \nThey appear only when their parent process (i.e. process which fork()'ed them) is alive, but did not yet call wait() system function. Once parent dies, the zombies are wait()'ed for by init and disappear. \n\nA: Zombies are DEAD processes. They can not be 'kill' (You cannot kill the DEAD).  All processes eventually die, and when they do they become zombies.  They consume almost no resources, which is to be expected because they are dead!  The reason for zombies is so the zombie's parent (process) can retrieve the zombie's exit status and resource usage statistics.  The parent signals the operating system that it no longer needs the zombie by using one of the wait() system calls.\nWhen a process dies, its child processes all become children of process number 1, which is the init process.  Init is always waiting for children to die, so that they don't remain as zombies.\nIf you have zombie processes it means those zombies have not been waited for by their parent (look at PPID displayed by ps -l).  You have three choices: Fix the parent process (make it wait); kill the parent; or live with it.  Remember that living with it is not so hard because zombies take up little more than one extra line in the output of ps.\nZombies can be identified in the output from the Unix ps command by the presence of a \"Z\" in the STAT column. Zombies that exist for more than a short period of time typically indicate a bug in the parent program. As with other leaks, the presence of a few zombies isn't worrisome in itself, but may indicate a problem that would grow serious under heavier loads.\nTo remove zombies from a system, the SIGCHLD signal can be sent to the parent manually, using the kill command. If the parent process still refuses to reap the zombie, the next step would be to remove the parent process. When a process loses its parent, init becomes its new parent. Init periodically executes the wait system call to reap any zombies with init as parent.\nThere are also orphan processes which are a computer process whose parent process has finished or terminated.\nA process can become orphaned during remote invocation when the client process crashes after making a request of the server.\nOrphans waste server resources and can potentially leave a server in trouble (This is the biggest resource difference between zombies and orphans (Except if you see some orphan zombie movie). However there are several solutions to the orphan process problem:\n\n*\n\n*Extermination is the most commonly used technique; in this case the orphan process is killed.\n\n\n*Reincarnation is a technique in which machines periodically try to locate the parents of any remote computations; at which point orphaned processes are killed.\n\n\n*Expiration is a technique where each process is allotted a certain amount of time to finish before being killed. If need be a process may \"ask\" for more time to finish before the allotted time expires.\nA process can also be orphaned running on the same machine as its parent process. In a UNIX-like operating system any orphaned process will be immediately adopted by the special \"init\" system process. This operation is called re-parenting and occurs automatically. Even though technically the process has the \"init\" process as its parent, it is still called an orphan process since the process which originally created it no longer exists.\nMore Info:\n\n*\n\n*http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_Zombie_Process_and_Orphan_Process#ixzz1PCN9vojU\n\n*http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/zombies.html\n\n*http://www.brighthub.com/computing/linux/articles/79186.aspx\n\n*How to identify and kill hanging process, when system hangs and reacts slowly on user input?\n\n*Killing a running process in an Ubuntu machine remotely from a windows machine which is in LAN\n\nA: Zombie processes are processes that have stopped running but their process table entry still exists because the parent process hasn't retrieved it via the wait syscall. Technically each process that terminates is a zombie for a very short period of time but they could live for longer.\nLonger lived zombie processes occur when parent processes don't call the wait syscall after the child process has finished. One situation where this occurs is when the parent process is poorly written and simply omits the wait call or when the parent process dies before the child and the new parent process does not call wait on it. When a process' parent dies before the child, the OS assigns the child process to the \"init\" process or PID 1. i.e. The init process \"adopts\" the child process and becomes its parent. This means that now when the child process exits the new parent (init) must call waitto get its exit code or its process table entry remains forever and it becomes a zombie\n\nA: You can see in the second line that there is 1 zombie process running on my system.\nIf you want further details about the zombie process, use the following command:\n$ ps axo stat,ppid,pid,comm | grep -w defunct\n\nKilling a Zombie-Process:\n$ kill -s SIGCHLD PID\n\n", "Q: problems with sudo permissions - /var/lib/sudo owned by uid my system is a new 11.04 ubuntu and i recently started working with LAMP.\nsome how, when i tried to change permissions of the var/www/ for netbeans to work on the local server, and did something that causes this notice to show every time i do a sudo:\nsudo: /var/lib/sudo owned by uid 33, should be uid 0\n\nthis is bad? \nhow can i fix it?\nwhat exactly i did?\nthanks.\n\nA: To fix that particular issue is easy:\nsudo chown -R root /var/lib/sudo\n\nAs for why that happened... I believe that when you were messing with permissions for /var/www you somehow, by accident, changed permissions (and ownership) of all /var tree, including /var/lib/sudo. (I bet the user you were trying to set has id=33)\nThis may have many consequenses, the sudo warning message being just one symptom.\nUPDATE\nAs for the consequences... it really depends on what (and where) you did. Many (but not all) files and folds in the /var tree are owned by root:root, and its basically impossible to know who each and every file and folder originally belonged to. Full reinstall would be the only feasible way to restore it.\nIf you changed only the /var/lib tree, it narrows down the \"damage\", but not much: there are still hundreds of files there.\nYou can try to find out which command you issued caused this trouble, accesing your bash history:\ngedit ~/.bash_history &\n\nMaybe this will give a clue about what happened and its consequences\n", "Q: wine desktop is clipping on netbook I have a windows program I run in wine that requires a desktop slightly taller then the vertical work space of my netbook's screen when I create the desktop, wine clips it to fit the screen.

Running with out a desktop, still clips it but then I can not resize or move it.\n\nA: Aside from alt+drag to move the window up and resize it manually as a workaround, I do not believe this to be possible as it's the Windows application declaring its starting size.

Make sure you've installed libgtk2.0-0-dev package (which depends on libglib2.0-dev) and try again.\n\nA: You need to tell make to use pkg-config to find out the compiler flags.

There are hundreds of tutorials on how to do so, including here. While most agree on the basic steps, their details are very different. For copying files, for instance, some use rsync, some cp, and some find | cpio (Ill use rsync)\nAs for fstab entry, the options are puzzling me. The most common suggestions are:\nUUID=xxx /home ext3 nodev,nosuid 0 2\nUUID=xxx /home ext3 defaults,error=remount-ro 0 1\nUUID=xxx /home ext4 error=remount-ro 0 1\nUUID=xxx /home ext3 defaults 1 2\n\nIts hard to know if those suggestions are outdated or obsolete. So, for Ubuntu 10.04 onwards, what are the best / recommended parameters for an ext4 /home? nodev,nosuid? defaults? Nothing? And, most important, why?\nEDIT:\nSo far, im inclined to use\nUUID=xxx /home ext4 nodev,nosuid 1 2\n\nBut I would like some background on that\n\nA: nodev and nosuid are simply added layers of security that bar the creation or recognition of devnodes and suid executables on the fs.  They are typically used for removable media to prevent untrusted users from inserting a disk crafted to allow them to elevate their permissions.  There is little to no point in using them for /home.\nAs always, unless you have specific needs for other options, defaults should be just fine.\n", "Q: How to layout the filesystem for a small SSD and a big HDD? Since I don't use my laptop's CD-drive I want to put a small (8 GB) SSD into the CD-drive slot (I'll use a caddy similar to this one). I want to use compressed btrfs on the SSD and put all the data on the big HDD.\nI want to avoid unnecessary spin-ups. I want the system to be fast... I want to minimize wearing of the SSD.\nHow should I layout the mount points of my file-system?\nHow can I prevent the HDD to spin up at the same time?\n\nA: It's really up to you. You can do almost anything.\nI have (to show off):\n\n\n*\n\n*1x RAID0 PCI-E SSD (OCZ Revo 120gig) that runs at 540MB/s as the primary disk\n\n*4x 1.5TB disks in RAID5 as the \"data\" disk (called /media/ned)\n\n*2x 1.5TB disks in RAID1 (currently degraded - called /media/jeff)\n\n\nPopular mounting convention would have me store the entire /home/ on ned... But this would slow down a lot of applications that use things in ~ to run (eg Firefox has a SQLite database that works best on  a fast disk).\nPer that convention, I used to keep the entire /home/ on jeff. mdadm's RAID1 is considerably faster than its RAID5 but tons slower than my SSD. When half of jeff died, I decided I wanted more speed.\nSo now I just keep a directory on ned for things I really don't want on the SSD. This includes my ~/Music ~/Documents, etc. You can mount bind them in your fstab but I've just gone with SymLinks. Move the directory and run something like:\nln -s /media/ned/.fakehome/Music ~/Music\n\nRinse and repeat.\nI my case, it's really a case of how much I can stand to lose if the worst happens. I have some security with RAID5 so anything not on it (especially the RAID0 SSD) is much more liable to die if a squirrel farts in its direction.\nAs you've only got a relatively tiny SSD and only one data disk, the metrics and causalities are slightly different. Each method is equally unsafe and you're limited by space. You might do best to mount all of home on the data disk and do the reverse of what I'm doing. Create a directory on the SSD for the things you want to be fast and SymLink them back out onto the data partition.\nYou can use fstab-mount commands but I just find SymLinks easier to maintain. I'm not sure what the performance overhead differences are like but I'm fairly sure I've asked somewhere.\n", "Q: Empathy not connecting on school's public wifi Empathy just sits trying to connect to my facebook and Google Talk accounts on my school's public wifi.\nOn the public wifi there is a proxy I have to connect to and register with (just type in an email address) and I can browse the web.

The only thing you can do is wait for this feature to be added in the programs that don't work.\nIt could also be, that sites like chat.facebook.com are blocked in the schools network so empathy can not connect to them.

(My worry is that all PPA is added based on Maverick and now the kernel is different \nfrom the original one)\n\n*What other disadvantage will there be?\n\nA: i tried it and my system crashed, like totally.  i'm 61 years old and do not normally use phrases such as that;  but installing the newest kernel can, may crash your system. stick with what you have for now.   i'm upgrading to zorin 5.  will do a clean install.  i have tried upgrading to a new kernel several times and have had major problems every time.\n\nA: I guess there shouldn't be a problem regarding system stability in general with the addition of this PPA and the installation of this and/or subsequent kernels.\nAfter all, new versions are added up to the list of the already installed kernels, they don't replace the old ones. If a new kernel breaks your system, you can always reboot and select one of the others.\nAs for the software updates, i also don't think that you're gonna face serious issues.\nMost of the kernel development has to do with low-level programming (IRQs, hardware compatibility issues, etc) and minor version upgrades might produce some incompatibilities, but probably won't break your whole system.\nAs you state in your comment to akbozo, you're willing to test your system and don't have a problem reinstalling if something goes wrong.\nSo I'd say you go with it.\n\nA: I Used Kernelcheck to Get the latest Kernel, it Compiles the kernel by itself without the user doing pretty much anything.\nI'm not using it however as the ATI driver 11.5 doesn't support the kernel 2.6.39 yet.\n", "Q: Software Sources requires GTK 2 and won't run on 11.04 I was trying to access Settings in Update Manager to setup automatic updates.

Just for the record, reinstalling the packages as stated above did not help. This is what I did.\nAccording to the pygi docs, if you type\npython -c 'from gi.repository import Gtk; print Gtk'\n\nyou should get\n<gi.module.DynamicModule 'Gtk' from '/usr/lib/girepository-1.0/Gtk-3.0.typelib'>\n\n(Gtk-2.0 depending on which version you have installed. I have Gtk-2.0.)\nThis gave me the clue. The Gtk typelib was in fact there but I suspected there may be another girepository-1.0 directory in my filesystem that was taking precedence. Using the locate command I found it in /usr/local/lib along with several libgirepository-1.0* libs. This directory did not contain the Gtk typelib. So I simply removed it along with the libraries and the problem is now solved.\n\nA: Since software-properties is a Python application, it actually depends on package gir1.2-gtk-2.0.

Check it out using Synaptic.\nOtherwise reinstallation of the affected packages may help:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gir1.2-gtk-2.0 python-software-properties software-properties-gtk\n\n\nA: ame as the above solution except I made a soft link in the /usr/local directory pointing to /usr/lib/girepository-1.0.

In 10.10 I used Gnome and the Gnote plugin for the Gnome panel which had Gnote loaded in the background so that e.g. opening a new note in Gnote took no time at all.\nWhat I'm looking for in Unity is a way to make Gnote load faster or a way to make Gnote behave as if it loaded faster. I can think of two ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preload Gnote so that it starts faster whenever I decide to start it.\n\n*Automatically start Gnote minimized every time Unity starts.\n\n\nA: I think the second option is the best bet since there's AFAIK no way to preload Gnote\nJust add gnote to your gnome-session-properties (Startup Applications in Settings) or do this:\ncp /usr/share/applications/gnote.desktop ~/.config/autostart/\nchmod u+x ~/.config/autostart/gnote.desktop\n\nEdit: To use Gnote system tray icon, you have to whitelist it first.

Format it with gparted . It's very easy to use if you just make sure you take care selecting all the options you need. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Top right has a drop down box. Choose your new disc (will be /dev/sdb1).\n\n*You will get 1 big unallocated with the size of your disc. Format it with ext3/etc4 (or whatever system you want on it ;) )\n\n*You can also create partitions on it if need be.\n\n\nb. No, you will need to manually add it to /etc/fstab (with gksu gedit /etc/fstab) but that's fairly easy. It will be something like this:\n/dev/sdb1               /mountpoint                  ext4    defaults        1 2\n\n\n*\n\n*make a backup of /etc/fstab 1st (with something similar to cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.20110614).\n\n*gparted will tell you the name of the disc but I assume it will be /dev/sdb;\n\n*mountpoint is a directory you created;\n\n*ext4 is the formatting you used (could be ext2, ext3 or a windows version).\n\n\nA: a. Use Disk Utility (installed by default), this application not only allows you to partition but also allows you manage the volumes (like mounting and unmounting, benchmarking, bootable, and checking and repairing). I find it much prettier, more hardy*, and generally a more enjoyable experience than gparted.\nTo partition: Click on the drive you wish to partition on the left (you can see the description) format the drive (see figure) and then click in the Volumes area (which will say \"free space\") to add partitions.\nNote: I haven't added a screenshot of the actual partition screen, as I don't fancy formatting any of my drives, if someone has one please edit it in!\n\nb. The partitions will be \"available\" (seen on the left hand side of nautilus), but won't be mounted by default - necessary if it's music libraries and stuff, to do this use pysdm  - Storage Device Manager. \nFind the partition(s) you wish to mount on start up (locate it's name from Disk Utility e.g. sdb1), click on assistant. Uncheck \"Mount file system in read only mode\" and keep \"The file system is mounted at boot time\" checked.\n\nClick Mount, Apply then Close, and restart your system (part b. is taken from here).\n", "Q: ErrorDocument 500 not working I am testing a risk-free PHP application.

I have Broadcom bcm43224 wifi card with proprietary broadcom sta driver.\nAt home wifi connection works well, but in the office when I ping some resource there is a lot of loss packets and I cant browse websites.\nI have tried another way to check internet connection - download file with wget.\nwget google.com - very slow speed\nwget -4 google.com - normal speed\nSo, it seems that the problem is with the ipv6 configuration at the office, can I force my wifi connection to use only ipv4 and completely ignore ipv6 ?.\n\nA: yes, you can set using ipv6 in menu system -> preferences -> network connection. Choose which connection you want to use without ipv6, then click edit, go to tab ipv6 settings and choose method ignore. \n( this doesnt cover situations when you have some ipv6 tunnel enabled )\n\nA: This sounds like it could be that you are using a DNS server that doesn't do very well with requests for an IPv6 address. Instead of just saying it doesn't know how to handle those requests, it waits for a very long time and then your computer retries again but asking for a IPv4 address the second time around.\nAn easy way to test this (using your example) is to run dig a google.com and dig aaaa google.com. If the 'dig aaaa' command take considerably longer, your computer is picking up a misbehaving DNS server from your office network's DHCP.\nSo, let's change to using a DNS server that handles those requests correctly instead of disabling IPv6 (which we should be migrating to soon). Go to the network manager, select your wireless connection, and click edit. Go to the IPv4 tab and for method pick 'Automatic (DHCP) Addresses Only'. In the DNS servers field put '4.2.2.2 4.2.2.4' and click Save. Reconnect to the connection and see if that speeds anything up.\n", "Q: The terminal is shown when shutting down or logging out When I shut down my system or log out the terminal (the one I reach with Ctrl Alt + F7) is sometimes shown before the login screen appears or before the computer is shut down.

Now, whenever I connect to a password secured wireless network, the system freezes and needs to be hard rebooted.\nIt looks like this 'bug' affects the whole eee-family. In this topic on ubuntuforums, the user 'linux_one' states, that an update to the latest daily mainline kernel from the kernel-ppa would solve the issue. Unfortunately, this didn't prove true for me. My system is also up-to-date right now.\nI doubt, that the problem lies in the kernel itself, since the wlan-drivers already caused trouble in the past. I've been using the wireless fixes on http://linuxon1001p.blogspot.com so far.\nAny solution or hint is appreciated. I'll give additional information if needed.\n\nA: I just solved it on my own! :D\nAs I wrote above, the solution of 'linux_one' in the ubuntuforums didn't work out for me, since the image.deb wouldn't install properly. But her/his solution was right after all.\nSo this is how I stopped the WLAN from crashing my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/daily/current/\n\n*Download the following files:\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-3.0.0-999-generic_3.0.0-999.201106141052_i386.deb\n\n*linux-headers-3.0.0-999_3.0.0-999.201106141052_all.deb\n\n*linux-image-3.0.0-999-generic_3.0.0-999.201106141052_i386.deb\n\n\n(or the newer files, depending on the date of your download)\n\n*And download this file: http://launchpadlibrarian.net/73208056/module-init-tools_3.13-1ubuntu1_i386.deb\n\n*Install gdebi, a graphical installer for deb files\n\n*Open Gdebi (press [Alt]+[F2], type 'gdebi-gtk' and press enter)\n\n*With Gdebi open and install the downloaded linux-headers of step 2\n\n*Install the module-init-tools of step 3 using gdebi\n\n*Install the linux-image of step 2 with gdebi\n\n*Reboot your system. It should automatically boot the new kernel.\n\n\nAnd that did the trick for me.

On a default installation, this yields about 17.5k images.

Huge speed gain Since I don't use my laptop's CD-drive I want to put a small (8 GB) SSD into the CD-drive slot (I'll use a caddy similar to this one). I want to use compressed btrfs on the SSD and put all the data on the big HDD. \nI want to avoid unnecessary spin-ups. I want the system to be fast... I want to minimize wearing of the SSD.\nWhat tricks are there to use a compressed ramdisk wisely (using but not overusing it)?\nHow to enable it? What values are sensible?\nAlso see this post (I split my questions up).\n\nA: Update: In Natty it doesn't work that way.See this question. \nI'll answer my question myself, but for now just for Lucid (10.04) since that's what I'm on right now. The speed gains are really astonishing. Whenever ram became scarce on my system (2 GB, shared graphics, some programs in background, big chromium session) my laptop started to swap often. Just that swapping usually meant near complete standstill (mouse stutters, greyed out apps etc). vm.swappiness is at 100 so swap is used before it's too late, but stil I had minute long waits till the laptop responded again. \ntl;dr: When the PC starts swapping the speed stays the same. Nice!\nTo try it: do sudo modprobe ramzswap disksize_kb=524288 memlimit_kb=196608\nThis creates a 512 MB compressed swap with a limit on used ram of 192 MB. Note that the ram will only be eaten when the swapfile is actually used. Do sudo swapon /dev/ramzswap0 to enable it. Open several tabs or several ram heavy apps (OOo, gimp, blender) and watch free -m and sudo swapon -s. Your ramzswap should show up and get filled at no noticable speedloss.\nTo enable it permanently: do sudo nano /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf and search for COMPCACHE_SIZE=\"\" and replace it with COMPCACHE_SIZE=\"512 M\" or whatever size of uncompressed swap you wish to have. For example \"30 %\" is also possible.\nProfit.\nI didn't find a way to enable compcache/ramzswap in /etc/fstab which is strange.\n\nA: For Natty and up just use zramswap. I've already baked sane defaults and automatic setup in there. In fact, it adapts to your system automatically and I really doubt you'll achieve better results by manual setup.\n", "Q: Make curl download using non-Privacy extension IPv6 address?

Here's the situation:\nWe have our own server running reprepro, which would host the modified package. Our other packages are managed using git and the git packaging tools (git-dch, git-buildpackage). \nI have the .diff file that contains the patch to the upstream source, which I've applied before by doing apt-get source pkgname, applying it and running debuild. I'd like to track it properly this time using git.\nWhat's the best process for managing this?\n\nA: I'd suggest something a little different than Flimzy. Take a look at git-import-dsc and possibly git-debimport. They will auto-magically create separate upstream, debian, and prinstine-tar branches from at Debian source package. You could then create your own branch for your patch set. Each time a new upload to Ubuntu is made, you can just run git-import-dsc on the new package and merge with your branch.\nEven simpler would be to use bzr if you are not wed to git. Each Ubuntu package can also be found in a bzr branch. bzr branch ubuntu:$PACKAGE_NAME will grab the source branch for you.  Make your changes and commit. Then when ever a new Ubuntu upload is made, you can simply run bzr merge-package ubuntu:$PACKAGE_NAME\n\nA: I hope I'm understanding your question fully... \nHere's how I do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place the *.orig.tar.gz *.diff.gz and *.dsc files in a directory aptly named for your package\n\n*Unpack the source (dpkg-source -x *.dsc).  You'll now have three files and one sub-directory\n\n*Commit this to your RCS (commit A)\n\n*Apply your changes, and commit to your RCS (Commit B)\n\n*Make any future changes, and commit (Commit N)\n\n\nWhen a new upstream version comes out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a diff between Commit A and Commit N\n\n*Repeat steps 1-3 above\n\n*Apply your diff (created in step 1), and commit (new Commit A)\n\n*Make any future changes and commit (Commit N)\n\n\nRinse, repeat.\n", "Q: The colors on videos I watch are messed up - quite badly This one really has me stumped. Whenever I watch a video in Totem or VLC, the colors are completely messed up. Here is the preview of a video in Nautilus and what it looks like in Totem:\n\nSome other helpful information:\n\n\n*\n\n*This does not happen for videos in the Flash player.\n\n*This happens for all video formats, including MPEG / WMV / etc.\n\n*I am using Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit with the Nvidia driver 270.41.06.\n\n\nA: Special thanks to Stefano for suggesting what ultimately led to the solution:\nSomehow, it seems that the hue slider in Totem was not set properly and that was what was messing up the colors. It would also seem that the problem was affecting every single application with video output as well since the problem manifested itself in VLC, Cheese, etc.\nThe solution was to simply reset the sliders to their default values and now everything works.\n", "Q: Moving a window that I cannot see I am running Natty Narwhal on x86_64 with the new \"Unity\" desktop.\nI have two monitors.  Well, make that one monitor and a high-def television set.  I usually leave the TV off, or if it is on, it is usually set to display an input other than my Ubuntu system.\nSometimes, when an application decides to open a window, it opens it on the secondary display (i.e., the TV).  In earlier versions of Ubuntu (using gnome-desktop), I could right-click on the application in the task bar, select the name of the window, choose \"Move\", and drag it onto my primary display (i.e., the monitor).\nWith Natty, I have to turn on my television, wait for it to power up, set it to \"HDMI input #3\" (or whatever), mouse over to the TV, grab the window, drag it back, restore my TV to its default input, and turn it off.\nI find this new process significantly less efficient than the old one.\nIs there any way under Unity to move a window that I cannot see from one screen to another?  If not, how can I request this feature?\nThanks.\n\nA: CompizConfig Settings Manager \"Put\" Option can help you to move the hidden window with a user definable key binding.\n\nIn my case, I use [Super] with a combination with the numeric keyboard, this way, when a window is far from the sight, or hidden below a full screen window, I can simply send it to another place in order to get the focus. Of course, I should use [Alt][Tab] or [Super][Tab] to choose the window that I wish to move.\nGive this a try and let us know how did you do with this suggestion.\nGood luck!\n\nA: To see hidden windows in Ubuntu 16.04, use the \"Spreads all windows\" (Super+,) or \"Spreads all windows of the focused application\" (Super+Ctrl+,) keyboard shortcuts. You can see what shortcuts are available by holding down the Super key.\n", "Q: How can I encrypt the entire disk on alternate installation?

The only way to get it to work is to restart it. How would I write a shell script to run the process, continually check if any of the output says Error and if so end the process and restart the command (let's call it ./command.sh)?\nIt would be fine for this to be in any other language (python/perl etc).\n\nA: Since python exits with an return code != 0 when it throws an exception, you can just run this shell script:\nwhile ! ./command.sh ; do : ; done\n\nOf course if you just want to run the command all the time, just write:\nwhile true ; do ./command.sh ; done\n\n(this assumes ./command.sh doesn't fork and exit)\n\nA: I did something similar to recover ted (Torrent Episode Downloader) from its regular crashes. Below is the script I used. Will explain it in further edits as I go.\nEdit: How it works\nTed has a log file. Since it checks for new  episodes every half an hour, there is a timestamp in that log, that's not older than half an hour. Of course the timestamp is not there if ted crashed in the mean time.\nEdit: How that might help you\nYou could redirect your problematic program's output into a file. Write a script similar to mine, that checks this file. If it finds the bad string there, restarts the application (and removes the output file). You can ran the script in an endless loop or use cron. I chose to use cron so I have less process pollution and the checks don't have to be incredibly frequent anyway.\n#!/bin/bash\n# indent-mode: spaces, indentsize: 4, encoding: utf-8\n# © 2011 con-f-use@gmx.net.\n# Use permitted under MIT license:\n# http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php (NO WARRANTY IMPLIED)\n\nteddir='/home/confus/ted'   # Location of the ted executable\nlogpath='/home/confus/.Torrent Episode Downloader/log.txt' # Location of ted's log\n\n# Get the process id for ted so it can be killed later\npid=$(lsof \"$teddir/ted.jar\" | grep -m1 java )\nset -- $pid\npid=$2\necho \"Ted is running unter pid: $pid.\"\n\n# Check if the log is recent\nsearch=$(date \"+%b %d, %Y @ {0,1}%l:[0-9]{2} %p\")\nsearch=$(cat \"$logpath\" | grep -oE \"$search\")\n\n# If ted is running and the log is not recent, kill crashed process and\n#+restart it.\nif [ -n \"$pid\" ] && [ ! -n \"$search\" ]; then\n    echo \"Killig $pid.\"\n    kill \"$pid\" || exit 1\n    echo \"Restarting ted...\"\n    cd \"$teddir\"\n    /usr/bin/java -jar ted.jar noTray\nfi\n\nexit 0\n\nIn my case there was still an active process for ted after the crash, but ted wasn't doing anything.

My sister is moving from Windows and I just got her a new graphics tablet. However, the pressure sensitivity controls opacity rather than line thickness; she really needs this feature from Photoshop/Corel Painter.  \nIs there a way to toggle on or off the pressure affecting either line opacity or thickness?\n\nA: Make sure you have checked Pressure: Size in the Brush Dynamics section of the Toolbox:\n\nIf this still doesn't work, you probably haven't enabled the tablet. To do so, go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit → Preferences\n\n*Input Devices → Configure Extended Input Devices\n\n*Choose your device and set it to Screen mode\n\n*Save, close, and try again.\n\n\nA: RE: Tablet not showing up in input devices\nHi....Information from\nhttp://blenderartists.org/forum/showthre...ost2324411\non Post #13 as :\nDownload as : https://download.gimp.org/mirror/pub/gimp/v2.6/\nThen I follow is work. But.. I Use Windows 10 my Gimp 2.6.9 Follow Below :\nAll,\nI know this is a bit outdated (the last post was in October), but I've stumbled on a different, although more troublesome, way to enable pressure sensitivity in GIMP 2.8:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug tablet in.\n\n*Launch 2.6 (in this case I was using 2.6.12)\n\n*Go to File > Preferences > Input Devices > Configure Extended Input Devices...\na. If you get an error saying no input devices found, close 2.6 and relaunch.\n\n*Draw something on the canvas using the tablet.\n\n*Close 2.6\n\n*Launch 2.8\n\n\nYou should now be able to draw in 2.8 with full pressure sensitivity. I'm not sure why this works, but I've tried it, rebooted my computer and tried it again with success. I am using Windows 8, but I believe it should work on all versions of Windows. Because OSX used X11 for 2.6, but not for 2.8 I'm unsure if this process would work.\nUsing Ubuntu 12.04 I was able to get 2.8 to handle pressure sensitivity right out of the box--but it could have been because I had just launched & closed 2.6 and had both installed side-by-side.\nLike I said, this is a bit more cumbersome than the solution 2blackbar suggested above but I figured it was worth sharing.\nLast edited by BnBGobo99; 28-May-13 at 15:13. Reason: Workflow was unnecessary.\n\nA: On newer versions of Gimp the Brush Dynamics window will not look like that. Here is how it looks in Ubuntu 13.04: \n\nIf you click on the notepad to the right of \"Pencil Generic copy\", it will show the menu where you can select what pressure will do to the picture (opacity, size, etc.). But it is all disabled/greyed out. What you need to do is click on the crazy blue arrow, then click on the crazy blue arrow again, which will open the brush dynamics selection dialog. There you can select a brush and duplicate it. You will then be able to select the duplicate brush you just create, click on the notepad button, and then finally edit the brush dynamics as shown by htorque.\nThis has been tested in a Thinkpad X61 tablet running 13.04/raring and Gimp 2.8.4.\n\nA: if you are using a newer version of GIMP you just need to click on the arrow with three dots right of the text saying \"Dynamics\" then select the option you want to use, for example: \"Pressure Size\".\nHope this helps\n\nA: If you do not see the items Pressure, Velocity and Random you need to open those fields by clicking on \"Brush Dynamics\". This will unfold the three checkbox fields as shown in the screenshot.

I want to connect my TI-84 Plus to my Ubuntu 11.04 laptop. I use the organelle cables to connect it. The program tilp(2) didn't work or at least it didn't show my TI-84 Plus; I've tried to run it in root and in the normal way.\n\nA: The libticables2-2 library supplied with Ubuntu 11.04 (and as of this writing, 11.10 too) supports the SilverLink cables only. I've just uploaded a patch which adds support for the TI-84+ calculator which is available in LP #747589.\nOverview of the fix\n\n\n*\n\n*Update the udev rules to avoid having to run the program as root\n\n*Adding yourself to the tilp group so you may use the device without running as root\n\n*Specify the calculator type to tilp\nInstructions for installing tilp and getting it to work with the TI-84+:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the tilp package and its dependencies like libticables2-2: sudo apt-get install tilp\n\n*Download the patch:\nwget https://launchpadlibrarian.net/79510370/new-devices-and-fixed-sysfs-warning.patch\n\n\n*Apply the patch to the installed udev rules:\nsudo patch /lib/udev/rules.d/45-libticables.rules < new-devices-and-fixed-sysfs-warning.patch \n\n\n*Add yourself to the tilp group:\nsudo usermod -a -G tilp $USER\n\n\n*Re-login to apply the group settings\n\n*The TI-84+ uses an USB-A - USB-B connector which is called DirectLink. This should be detected automatically. Connect the calculator now to the computer. If you've previously had connected it already, disconnect and reconnect it.\n\n*Now make known to tilp that you're using a TI-84+ calculator by running:\ntilp --calc=ti84+ --cable=DirectLink\n\nThis will set the calc=TI84+ and cable_model=DirectLink in the ~/.tilp configuration file. After running the above command, it's sufficient to run just tilp in the future (using the application menu or by running the command directly).\n\nA: You likely need wine installed in order to use the ti-84 tools. Wine is a Windows compatibility layer that allows you to run certain Windows applications in Linux. According to the Wine AppDB entry for the Graph Link software there may be some issues running the program (note that the results listed are a little old, so the program may work fine).\n\nA: Perhaps TILP isn't working because of this bug?\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tilp/+bug/49251\nAre you using a standard USB cable or the other connector?\nCan you see the device by typeing \"lsusb\" in terminal?\nHave you tried compiling a newer TILP?\nUnfortunately last I checked wine emulation didn't support USB, but Virtualbox Windows may work.\n", "Q: How to enable an extern keyboard using ps2 to usb adapter on a notebook? I have a laptop (IBM T60) and I want to connect an extern keyboard to it. Because the keyboard is a ps2 keyboard I bought a ps2 to usb adapter and plugged the keyboard into the adapter and the adapter to a usb slot on my laptop. But somehow the notebook does not recognize the keyboard. I even tryed a reboot while the keyboard was plugged in.\nDo I have to \"mount\" the keyboard manually or something like that?\n\nA: From this thread it appears that a common cheap PS2 to USB adapter doesnt actually do the conversion between PS2 to USB.  The keyboard itself needs the USB controller circuitry that typically is embedded in PS2 mice.\nI've seen other threads that claim something similar e.g. this old ubuntu thread \nCan I ask what you paid for the converter? - from this thread you'll need a special circuit enable ps2-to-usb converter cable costing approx $15 - not the common cheap $3 converters.\n\nA: There are two types of converters, one of them is just a mechanical interface, this means that is has no circuits inside. Most of the times you need a conversion of the signals, and for that you need an active chip.\nSo, what happens when you plug your adapter? can you execute lsusb after plugging the adapter and show back the results. Some converters are event detected by Ubuntu as barcode readers.\nIf your adapter is not listed at all, check dmesg results to see if there was a problem or even detected.\nIf nothing was detected, well bad luck, get an \"active\" adapter.\n", "Q: Is Unity's dash supposed to go away when I click outside of it? When opening the dash with my super key and then deciding that I do not need the dash after all, I can dismiss it either by pressing the super key again or by hitting escape.

Is that intended behaviour?\nUPDATE: this has been spurred by this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/798642\n\nA: Yes, it is supposed to close, but it seems it first needs to fully show, so you might need to wait a bit before closing it works (but that's also true for the Super and Esc key).\n\nA: Yes, it closes the dash, but as htorque stated, it needs to fully show first, and make sure you don't click it too close to the bottom of the dash.\nI don't know why it works that way. In my case, clicking on the right side of the dash, although it is very close from the dash, works. However, I need to take some small space from the bottom of the dash to make it work.

Is there any utility available on Ubuntu to check whether laptop battery is in healthy condition or not? \n\nA: You can try Battery Status 0.1\n\nBattery Status is a project for GNOME, that shows information about laptop battery state. It has some additional features, so usual icon of GNOME Power Manager can be removed from Notification/Indicator Area. Battery Status doesn't rely on GNOME Power Manager directly, but counting on presence in system for some useful integration with it. \n\n\nFeatures:\nUsing the Battery Status applet, the user can access:\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery Status dialog\n\n*Power Statistics (provided by GNOME Power Manager)\n\n*\"Show\" setting\n\n*CPU frequency scaling (provided by gnome-applets/cpufreq-applet)\n\n*Power Management preferences (provided by GNOME Power Manager)\n\n\nAdd the ppa ppa:iaz/battery-status to your software sources (here's how to do that) and install battery-status from the software center .\nYou can run it as an indicator using the following command:\n/usr/lib/battery-status/battery-status --indicator\n\nA: Clicking on the battery icon on the panel and choose the battery option from the menu.\nIn the resulting window, highlight your battery on the left and make sure the Details tab is selected.  The interesting details are the Energy when full and Energy (design) values.\nIf the battery is new, the two values should be almost identical.  If the maximum charge is significantly less than the design charge, then it indicates that your battery is getting old.\n\nA: It could be that your battery is bad, a good way to find out is to run the \"Power Statistics\" tool. \n\nIn this tool there is a Laptop Battery section. Check the \"Energy (Design)\" section. As you can see from mine my batter has lost a bit of capacity over time. This will let you determine if the battery is bad. \nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to check battery status using terminal?\n", "Q: interactive cpu governor? my processor is a Core2Duo 2.16 GHz (macbook 4.1)\nbut cpufreq only shows four Governors:\nconservative\nondemand\npowersave\nperformance\nno shows interactive and userspace\nthe governor that I've always liked is interactive, inclusive is the one I use in my google nexus one, I've always been successful\nis there any way to activate or select interactive as governor in ubuntu 11.04?\nGreetings and thanks in advance\n\nA: The interactive governor is made by/for Cyanogenmod, so it's not in the mainline and hence not in the Ubuntu kernel.\nIt will land in Ubuntu if it's merged into the mainline kernel.\n\nA: The interactive governor is included in the Android and the Chrome OS mainline kernels but not in the Linux one. Ubuntu does not include the interactive governor because that.\nThere was many attempts to introduce the interactive governor into the linux mainline. There was a patch RFC in 2012, a patch-set for Linux in 2015 and a patchset in 2016. Linaro worked on that subject too to increase the cooperation of cpufreq with the scheduler. However, there were many concerns on using cpu-specific information and, I think, linux maintainers preferred to improve the governors that already existed. There is a recent schedutil governor, introduced in 2016 (Linux 4.7), that estimates CPU utilization using the per-entity load tracking.\nIf you are interested, there are some kernel packages for running Ubuntu on Microsoft Surface Pro that includes the interactive governor.

I would like to remove Windows Vista from my notebook which is currently running a dual boot Windows Vista + Ubuntu and use Ubuntu as the only OS.\nThe notebook is unstable when running Windows Vista, because it shuts itself down without interaction. Ubuntu works flawless on it. I'm thinking to format the notebook. But, it is better for me to Ubuntu only without Windows Vista? Please advise.\n\nA: When I purchased my first laptop, the fist thing I did, even before booting in Windows was to put the Ubuntu CD in the drive, boot and reformat the hard disk. I never regretted this decision. I tested Ubuntu on that laptop in the store first, to make sure it was OK for the hardware compatibility, especially back in 2006. It was one of the best decisions I took.\n\nA: Ubuntu is a lot more stable and safer. I fully switched to Ubuntu 3 years back and I have never missed windows once since then. If you are used to with Ubuntu and Vista is unstable on your netbook then you should remove vista and only install Ubuntu. Even if there is some Windows software that you want to or must use, you can easily install Windows in a Virtual Box and run that software from there. This way you wont event need to switch between OSes.\n\nA: If you don't use Windows on it, go ahead. You will have much more room on your hard drive with it all being used by Ubuntu. Just run Ubuntu from a live cd/usb and select the install option. It will give you choices to get rid of Windows during the process. Your notebook will thank you. :)\n\nA: Ofcourse you can do that. Ubuntu doesn't need Windows to be installed to work, it's a completely independent operating system. If you don't need Windows, then it doesn't need to be installed.\nIf the reason why the laptop sometimes powers off by itself is because of a hardware problem, then installing another operating system instead of Windows is ofcourse not going to solve this - you'd have to take your laptop to some place where they can fix the hardware problem.\n\nA: It is clear from all of the above that you do not need windows to run Ubuntu.\nIf you are happy to run only Ubuntu here is what I would do.\n\n*\n\n*Back up any data/music/pictures you want either on a cd/pen drive/on the cloud\n\n\n*Note any passwords for sites you use and store on a pen drive if possible\n\n\n*Back up your emails and favourites from firefox/chrome etc\n\n\n*Download latest version of Ubuntu from\nUbuntu\n\n\n*Test it works on your pc first if it is a newer version!\n\n\n*Select install Ubuntu\n\n\n*Select using Install using entire disk on the Allocate Drive Space page although yours will show windows and may be Ubuntu.

Play with it to see whether it fits your needs. You can also try other distros as well. Once you're sure, go ahead with reformatting your main hard disk.\n\nA: Set a separate / partition maybe 10 to 20 GB and swap a few GB and /Home the rest.

I am working on a project related to VM migration. Sometimes the VM image will disappear and I just want to know who the culprit is. I tried strace on suspicious processes but to no avail.\n\nA: Finally I found the answer here.\nThe Linux Audit daemon will do the trick.\nsudo auditctl -w /path/to/somefile -p wra\n\nand then\nausearch -f /path/to/somefile -i\n\n\nA: You can find out the PID of a process, which has some file open using lsof. \nOnce file is closed and deleted, you cannot get that information.\nBTW. Keep in mind, that deleting a file is operation on directory it's in, not on a file itself. \n\nA: Let me suggest an alternative with sysdig as the answers above are aging. Let display the pid and name of the processes that delete the file /tmp/test. First we create the file with touch /tmp/test. Then we start sysdig with the following filter:\n$ sudo sysdig -p'%proc.pid,%proc.name' '(evt.type=unlinkat and (evt.arg.name=test or evt.arg.name=/tmp/test)) or (evt.type=unlink and evt.arg.path=/tmp/test)'\n\nunlinkat(2) requires an or filter if the path (e.g. evt.arg.name)  may be relative. To handle both unlink (which calls unlink(2)) and rm (which calls unlinkat(2) in its GNU version), the filter should match both syscalls.\nsysdig should be running when a process deletes the file. Then when we execute such commands:\n$ unlink /tmp/test\n$ touch /tmp/test\n$ rm /tmp/test\n$ cd /tmp; touch test; rm test\n\nIt will displays such an output:\n11380,unlink\n11407,rm\n11662,rm\n\nPlease refer to the sysdig user guide for an explanation about filtering and output.\nAs the filter is pretty long, I found it convenient to write a chisel. It is a lua script that is associated with a sysdig command:\ndescription = \"displays processes that delete a file\"\nshort_description = \"spy file deletion\"\ncategory = \"files\"\n\nargs = \n{\n    {\n        name = \"path\", \n        description = \"the path of the file to monitor\", \n        argtype = \"string\"\n    },\n}\n\nfunction on_set_arg(name, val)\n    path = val\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction on_init()\n    local filename = path\n    for i in string.gmatch(path, \"[^/]+\") do\n        filename = i\n    end\n    chisel.set_event_formatter(\"%proc.pid\\t%proc.name\")\n    chisel.set_filter(\n        \"(evt.type=unlinkat and (evt.arg.name=\" .. path .. \" or \\\n                             evt.arg.name=\" .. filename .. \")) or \\\n     (evt.type=unlink and evt.arg.path=\" .. path .. \")\")\n    return true\nend\n\nFeel free to comment and improve it. You can put the lua script in a spy_deletes.lua file inside a directory and execute sysdig in this directory to make the chisel available. When typing sudo sysdig -cl you will see it as:\nCategory: files\n---------------\nspy_deletes         spy file deletion\n\nNow you can call it:\n$ sudo sysdig -c spy_deletes /tmp/test\n\nAnd in another terminal type:\n$ touch test; unlink test\n$ touch test; unlink /tmp/test\n$ touch test; rm test\n$ touch test; rm /tmp/test\n\nIt will output:\n16025   unlink\n16033   unlink\n16041   rm\n16049   rm\n\nThe unlinkat filter would deserve to be more accurate and only match the absolute path. This would require to retrieve the fd of the directory passed to unlinkat(2).\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu-Desktop package is allways associated with pulseaudio? As my question above, i wandered why ubuntu-desktop package is always with full association with pulseaudio packagae? Why can't we erase pulseaudio without erase ubuntu-desktop too?\n\nA: Because PA is an essential part of the Ubuntu desktop distribution.\nHowever, you can safely remove the meta-package ubuntu-desktop without losing any functionality, yet be aware that you won't receive any updates for that package (Which means you won't get new software which would have been pulled in by that package).

I have a launcher in my panel that starts up VIM, and I always want it to start on the right monitor. Is there something that I can add to the command line in the launcher to make that happen? Either a VIM parameter, or some other non-VIM-specific trick?\nNote that I don't want all instances of VIM to launch to the right monitor. For instance, if I start it from a terminal, I prefer to have it on the left, or whatever monitor my terminal was on.\nEDIT FWIW, I'm using GNOME, currently on version 2.30.2.\n\nA: Try:\ngvim -c \"winpos 1600 0\"\nwhere, e.g., 1600 is the pixel width of the left monitor. This should make it start on the first pixel of the right monitor.  See :help winpos in vim for more info.\n\nA: You can try the '--screen=X' option.\nFor Example:\n  gvim --screen=1\nYou can also try something like 'gvim -geom 100x100+1000'. \nThis will set the dimension and position of gvim window.\n", "Q: Ctrl key is mapped to backtick (`), how can I fix this? I don't know why it happens, but if I press the Left Ctrl the output is backtick (`). When I press the right Ctrl the output is like Ctrl+Z.

Then place your mouse over the Event Tester and press the Ctrl key. You will get a read-out like \nKeyRelease event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x4e00001,\nroot 0xb2, subw 0x0, time 88800774, (-352,380), root:(371,431),\nstate 0x8, keycode 64 (keysym 0xffe9, Alt_L), same_screen YES,\nXLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXFilterEvent returns: False\n\nThis was for my Left Alt key. Locate the keycode -- in this case '64'.\n2) Enforce a different behavior: go to your home directory and edit '.bashrc' -- if you use Nautilus and not a terminal to find it, then it's hidden: Press Ctrl+H to show hidden files.\nAdd a line to re-code the key behavior:\n     xmodmap -e \"keycode 64 = Control_L\"\n\nOf course, the 64 should be replaced for the keycode you obtained in step 1. Now save the file and close it.\n3) Activate the behavior: Run a terminal. Every time the machine has been booted, this behavior has to be activated -- this is done by opening a terminal. You can close it right away again. Otherwise, you have to make the change in a different file, [see here].1\nI hope this solves your problem!\n", "Q: Open-source alternative to Adobe InDesign There is some open-source software, similar to Adobe InDesign?

You can reinstall a package with a command like:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall <packagename>\n\nwhere <packagename> is the name of the package you want to reinstall.\nFiguring out which packages you need to reinstall might be a little tricky, because it looks like multiple packages install files in /usr/lib/jni.

I am not a developer, so can't say why not, but it is probably trivial enough to get Dash to show the tomboy notes logged by zeitgeist. \nHowever, even if tomboy notes are logged by zeitgeist, this will not replace gnome-do: gnome-do searches through all your notes, whereas zeitgeist only logs the notes you open. I still rely on gnome-do just to search my notes. \nI have posted a question that might bring us an answer: Tomboy notes logged by zeitgeist do not appear in the Unity dash. Why not?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the Tomboy lens that was available in 11.10 doesn't work with 12.04.\nFortunately, Tomboy notes can easily be searched using the HUD: press 'Alt' + a keyword or title of yor note... et voilà!\n", "Q: Will LibreOffice be more \"Visually user friendly\"? I like Libreoffice. It's simple and we can done the work as we should. \nBut, it's my opinion that it isn't \"visually user friendly\"... I've seen some interesting mockups very cool indeed. \nHowever, as i'm use it sometimes all day, maybe Libreoffice team should takee care some other important aspects like design. It's important though, at the moment Libreoffice it's similar than office 98 :D in terms of design and we are in XXIst century. Have you seen Apple's Keynote for instance? It's simple, beautifull and visually friendly!\nLet's think about that.\n\nA: A couple of week are released LibreOffice 3.4, today I was looking on their website the release notes and new features, I found a couple of surprises, the first is that it has finally integrated the rendering engine of the sources, and the second is that it achieved a better integration with GTK +, which results in two features that will undoubtedly greatly enhance visual suite.\n\nImprove gtk+ theme integration, making\n  LibreOffice look more native. Fix menu\n  separators, Alt key issues, Toggle\n  buttons, and many widget rendering\n  details.\n\n\nA: You should give the TDF people time. They are just in the process of reviewing and cleaning the codebase (you can easily help, btw!), and cosmetic and/or UI changes are bound to come afterwards.\nI'm pretty confident that, yes, it will be more userfriendly in the future.\n", "Q: Unity application launchers are disappeared Once I'm adding application launcher onto unity dock I expect it will be there as long as I want, but after the system restarted they're just disappeared.\nWhat may cause the problem or what should I do to achieve my launchers to be in there?\nSultan\n\nA: How do you add a launcher! Run a application and right click on icon and select keep in  launcher.

I would like to set my edge binding to require a click.\nFor example, I currently have the corners of my screen trigger the \"scale\" plugin.\nI would like to set Compiz so that I go to the corner and click to mouse to activate the scale plugin.\nI've already tried to set the \"Initiate Window Picker\" setting (with the mouse icon) to \"BottomLeftEdge\" and \"Button1\", for example.\nWhy doesn't this work?\n\nA: It should work. In ccsm->commands I bound a custom command to [mouse icon] TopEdge|Button3 and it works. \nI do this in Lucid (compiz 0.8.4 vs compiz 0.9.4). The newer compiz is known to be buggy, to downgrade read on here. If not definitely file a bug in launchpad (ubuntu-bug compiz).\n", "Q: How do I list the default installed packages? I am developing an offline installer for all versions of Ubuntu, and I need Ubuntu's default installed packages list. Is there a way to get this information from any server (web server)? Any script to fetch any Ubuntu version's default installed packages list.\nI will give the Ubuntu version, and the script will fetch the packages list.\nNote: I need at least a server address. I can write a script for this.\n\nA: Going off a previous answer of mine, there are manifest files available that should list all the packages included on the CD.\nThe URLs of the files are fairly predictable but in constant flux (as new releases come out and old ones are killed off) so a good strategy is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://releases.ubuntu.com/ (for currently supported versions) or http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ (for other versions,  server images, etc.)\n\n*Pick your spin\n\n*Pick releases\n\n*Pick a version (eg 14.04)\n\n*Pick release (if it has been released)\n\n*Find the applicable .manifest file.\n\n\nNote that not all these packages stay installed. On the CD images, you'll also find a file called /capsper/filesystem.manifest-remove which is a list of things to remove after installation. I can't find an online copy of these files on their own.\n", "Q: why is rtkit-daemon eating 100% of my CPU? I sometimes have an rtkit-daemon process eating 100% of my CPU and making the system unresponsive. I reboot and things are fine after that. What is rtkit-daemon supposed to do and why would it be sometimes eating up 100% of my CPU?\n\nA: RealtimeKit is a D-Bus system service that changes the scheduling policy of user processes/threads to SCHED_RR (i.e. realtime scheduling mode) on request. It is intended to be used as a secure mechanism to allow real-time scheduling to be used by normal user processes.  Overall, I would not expect it to peg out CPU usage.  What happens if you let it run its course and do not reboot?  I would be curious to know how long rtkit-daemon is active at any given instance.\n\nA: This noxious little program is one of many reasons I avoid anything with a PulseAudio dependency.  It should be safe.  Safety does not mean it will be respectful of user resources, e.g., CPU usage, so it can cause inconvenience, as you noticed.  It would, however, be an ideal program to corrupt for nefarious purposes because its name always alarms, and then a quick google search allays all fear.  Since the program is obnoxious by design, a corrupt version monopolizing resources would not raise many eyebrows.\nYou can partially check its safety by running:\nps aux | grep [r]tkit-daemon\n\nWhich should show the program running is /usr/lib/rtkit/rtkit-daemon\nwhich being a system file is harder to overwrite.\nThe main issue is that genuine real-time privilege at the user level is rarely necessary.  That this runs by default, mostly sitting idle, but occupying virtual memory is just one of the many bad design 'features' of pulse audio.  That it periodically kicks in hogging resources just makes it worse.\n", "Q: How to set an application to open in a certain position on the screen? Say I wanted an application to open its window in the center of the screen instead of some inconvenient place like the top left (I have a pretty big monitor, so I'd have to raise my head. Also, the glare from my windows bounces off there, too). \nIs there something that I can edit which does this so that I won't need to drag it to the center every time I use it?\n\nA: you can just fire up ccsm and go to place windows > fixed windows placement\n\nA: You might be interested in Devil's Pie.

TLDR; How do you apply changes to /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules without restarting? (See this documentation about ethernet interface logical names.)\nLong version:\nI have a bootable USB flash drive running an image made by remastersys of 11.04. I want to be able to use this bootable USB drive to run a DHCP server from any computer. To do this, I have to assign a static IP address to eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces and reference eth0 in /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server.\nHowever, the network card is assigned ethX based on MAC address, so this only works on the first computer where the USB flash drive is used -- each subsequent computer's NIC will be assigned to eth1, eth1, etc.\nIt seems that there are two strategies that could work to solve this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dynamically rewrite /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server based on the first ethX that comes up when you run ifconfig -- this should be whatever NIC is actually in the computer.\n\n*Rewrite /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules so that whatever MAC address is assigned to the NIC is named eth0.\n\n\nI know I can do #1 because changes to these files can be applied by restarting networking and isc-dhcp-server.\nHowever, #2 seems cleaner to me as I believe the /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules will build up a bunch of crud as this USB drive is used in different computers.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I ended up going with option #1 (dynamically rewriting the various config files that needed ethX). This was easy to do with a simple Ruby script.\nIf the script doing the dynamic rewrite is startup.rb, I created a wrapper called startup-wrapper.rb that calls the actual script with exec 'sudo startup.rb' so that startup.rb runs with root permissions.\nI then created an entry in Startup Applications with the following command: gnome-terminal -e /path/to/startup-wrapper.rb. This will prompt the user for their password for the sudo on boot.\n", "Q: LibreOffice page numbering How can I add the page number in LibreOffice so it appears from a specific page to another in the top right corner.\n\nA: \n1 - Select Insert\n2 - Select Fields\n3 - Select Page Number\nThis is from the LibreOffice documentation: Starting With A Defined Page Number\n\n", "Q: How do I prevent KDM from starting at boot?

A user wrote that by directly selecting the hardware with \"plughw:x.x\" won't impact the performance of the system. I have selected it in the TS 3 configuration and it worked.\nBut this solution is not optimal because now no other program can access the sound output.\nUPDATE #2\nI followed nickguletskii's solution and created a .asoundrc file in my home folder. Now things are getting even worse, the CPU usage is now at 50% :-O. \ncontents of my ~./asoundrc\nalexandros@alexandros-laptop:~$ cat /home/alexandros/.asoundrc \npcm.!default {\n    type plug\n    slave.pcm {\n        type dmix\n    ipc_key 1024\n    slave {\n        pcm \"hw:0,0\"\n        rate 44100\n    }\n    }\n}\n\nI checked that I access the correct device from my TS3 configuration. When I directly select the device the cpu usage is at 2%. When I select \"Standart\" it goes now up to 50%. \n\nI don't know what I am doing wrong.\nUPDATE #3\nI switched the rate down to 22050 but still no difference to 44100. CPU usage is at 50%.\nIf you need any further information or my question is unclear than please tell me.\n\nA: This looks like a resampling problem. After some googling, I found out that the default sample rate for TeamSpeak 3.0 is 44100 Hz, while the default sample rate for ALSA is 48000.\nNow, we need to fix that by opening ~/.asoundrc (a hidden file called .asoundrc in your home directory) and changing rate 48000 to rate 44100. This will hopefully stop the resampling and result in less CPU usage.\nEDIT: As changing the sample rate made the issue worse, then it might be a sign that we are digging in the right direction. We need to pick the right sample rate. The fact that it happens before sounds start is what confuses me though...\n", "Q: Intel wifi 6230 slows down when cable unplugged I've just purchased a dell l502x with an intel 6230 wifi. \nI've installed ubuntu 11.04 64  bit. \nIt works, but when i use only the battery the connection slows down (my maximum download is 800kB and when my dell is unplugged it goes down to 200kB).\nI think that is a sort of power saving, but how can i manage that?   \nAnybody knows something about that?

Even if I add these lines to .bash_profile and .bashrc, I still have to enter the exports manually, for the paths to be found.\nSo my question. What could be a reason for .bash_profile and .bashrc not to load/execute the exports?\nThanks!!\np.s. I ssh into the machine and it is, apart from the CUDA drive and sdk, a fresh Ubuntu 10.10 installation.\np.p.s. The fresh installation did not have a .bash_profile in the first place. nano ~/.bash_profile was empty\n\nA: When you log in graphically in Ubuntu, .bash_profile will not be read, but .profile will (sourced by sh). So if you put those exports in .profile, then log in again, the environment variables should be available.\nAlso see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables \n", "Q: Trouble accessing sites with Chromium I'm having trouble accessing www.fafsa.ed.gov with Chromium, I get an \"incompatible browser detected\" message.

I'm using two monitors of different brands and resolutions with NVIDIA TwinView, which works well enough, but one thing that's getting to me is how the mouse can move off the edge of the visible screen space below the left-hand screen and above the right-hand screen (see screenshot).\nIt makes it much more difficult to hit buttons at the bottom/top of each screen, since the cursor just disappears off the edge. Is there a way of changing this behaviour?\n \n\nA: The mouse moving into those dead areas is a known X bug however there is a workaround using XCreateMouseVoid that I have detailed in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to easily open the Launcher with a secondary monitor to the left\nIf you wish to just align the monitors along the top or bottom edges then modify the Absolute Position from +1920+90 to +1920+0 or +1920+56\n\nA: Since you're using Nvidia binary driver you can put:\nOption \"ConstrainCursor\" \"yes\"\nIn the screen section of your xorg.conf. Indeed, this is the default behaviour.\nThis will prevent the mouse from entering any of the voids. However, it also prevents you from revealing the launcher by \"pushing\" against the edge of the screen, if you use Unity.\n", "Q: Install Acire and Python Snippets I'm trying to install Acire and Python Snippets in Ubuntu 11.04 (64-bit).\nI have successfully installed Acire, but I'm unable to install the python-snippets package.

No packages yet for Natty.\nSuggest either contact the package owner (one Jorge O Castro!) or try editing your software sources and changing \"natty\" to \"maverick\" as per this AU answer\n\nA: There is also another PPA with the python-snippets package built specifically for Natty.The only place I could find one that was suitable for Natty was in Matthieu Baerts’ PPA. You can add the source and install python-snippets with the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:matttbe/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python-snippets\n\nAfter this Acire does have a dependency on the desktopcouch package. You can get the desktopcouch package from the Software center or use the following command:\nsudo apt-get install desktopcouch\n\nNow you should have all the packages you need. you can run Acire from the command line by just typing “acire” It should also appear on your menu, in the programming category.

I have some audiobooks in my Audiobooks folder (~/Audiobooks). When importing them I follow this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*I click Audiobooks in the left hand pane.\n\n*I right click on Audiobooks and click 'Import Media...'\n\n*I choose to import from folders then go into my Audiobooks folder and click 'Import'\n\n*It imports the audiobooks fine but into Music so I drag and drop them into Audiobooks - this causes them to be in both Music and Audiobooks\n\n*I delete them from Music in Banshee and from ~/Music (because I use these settings:  \n\nand Banshee is copying them to ~/Music)\nI now have the audiobooks in Audiobooks in the Banshee library and stored in ~/Audiobooks but the audiobooks in Banshee don't play. It seems that Banshee thinks they are still in ~/Music.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: Try unchecking the first option, 'Copy files to media folders when importing'. If my guess is correct, this will ensure that you audiobooks stay where they are after importing.\n\nA: Simply open each chapter of the audiobook with Banshee. (Be sure you've downloaded and installed all available extensions and plugins and enabled them) You will see them in your Play Que and File System Que just below Now Playing.  Then drag them into your Audiobooks.  You can then create smart playlists for Audiobooks etc. Change artwork for the audiobook (if the artwork is the correct file format etc. which it usually is if downloaded for librevox for example) Podcasts also work pretty well if you are familiar with the old rss feeds, simply look for the rss url at your favorite podcast's web page and copy to clipboard.  It should autofill when you add new Podcast.\n", "Q: Is it possible to give two IP addresses for the same host name? I want to give two ip addresses for same host name.\nLike in /etc/hosts file:\nxx.x.x.x example     # if system is connected to dhcp  \ny.y.yy.y example     # if system is connected to VPN  \n\nSo is it possible? \n\nA: It's not really possible as in this specific example.  Your hosts file essentially forms part of your system's ability to map a hostname into an IP address.  So when your system wants to know the IP address of \"example\", it'll get a single IP address in reply.  The hosts file allows no way of distinguishing different \"record types\" for its resolution.  So for hostname to IP address mapping, you only get one IP address per hostname (but multiple hostnames could resolve to the same IP address, which is the opposite).\nDepending on what you're doing, might it be possible to use an external DNS service like dyndns.org to map a constant hostname, that will work on either network, to your IP address?\n\nA: Strictly, the above answer is incorrect.\nIn older code, using gethostbyname() would indeed return only one result.\nIn newer code, using getaddrinfo() will return all results, and the /etc/hosts file in the question will work as wanted.\n", "Q: Can't get menus to show up in custom indicator I am trying to get a menu to show in a custom application written in C.

I use a right-handed usb mouse in the office and a left-handed usb mouse at home on the same Ubuntu 11.04 laptop. How can I configure the one at home to be automatically set up to left-handed when plugged in?\n\nA: Tutorial\nOpen up a terminal, and create a folder within your /etc/X11/ directory called xorg.conf.d and navigate to it:\nsudo mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d\ncd /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/\n\nWithin this folder, make a file called 00-mouse-remap.conf, so bust open a text editor:\nsudo gedit 00-mouse-remap.conf\n\nThe X Server should scan this directory for custom X11 scripts to load up at boot time. So the next step is to copy a config setting similar to this into the 00-mouse-remap.conf file you have just opened (customise to your will):\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse 5000 button remap\"\n    MatchProduct \"Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000\"\n    MatchIsPointer  \"on\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Driver          \"evdev\"\n    Option          \"SendCoreEvents\" \"true\"\n    Option          \"Buttons\" \"8\"\n    Option          \"ButtonMapping\" \"3 2 1 4 5 0 7 0\"\nEndSection\n\nSince this is mapped for a specific product, you should have separate configurations for your left and right handed mice. :P\nYou can find the name of your device by entering in to terminal:\nxinput list\n\nYou will then need to edit a gnome configuration entry, so run (in terminal or type it into a run session using ALT+F2):\ngconf-editor\n\n(In case you have upgraded to a version that uses dconf, that is, 11.10 and everything later, run dconf-editor instead)\nAnd navigate to this entry, and uncheck the box next to the entry that says active:\napps > gnome_settings_daemon > plugins > mouse\n\n(In case of dconf, is org > gnome > settings_daemon > plugins > mouse)\nJust be aware, that this disables the Gnome mouse pointer settings for when you modify your pointer settings within the GUI.

Also tried configuring Opwn With > Archive Mounter, and it didnt work.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: Main Answer\nThere should be the Archive Mounter option. Just right click the image and click \"Archive Mounter\", this should mount most disk based file systems like ISO 9660 (to left pane of Nautilus and on the Desktop) - however, it mounts images to:\n\n~/.gvfs\n\nAlternative Answer\nThere's an extremely useful script that has been created, called nautilus-mount-image which should mount most filesystems.\nThis can be downloaded from here.\nThis is from Raúl González Duque's PPA; looking at the code, it essentially figures out what type of filesystem the Image has, and attempts to mount it. It supports:\n\n\n*\n\n*ISO 9660 (CD's, DVD's, etc), NTFS, EXT2/3/4, HFS, ReiserFS\n\n*And many more...\n\n\nFor general use, you can use this script by right clicking the file that you want to mount, and clicking \"Mount image...\" like so:\n\nTo answer your requests:\n\n\n*\n\n*You won't be able to double click to mount\n\n*It should show up on the desktop and the left panel of nautilus\n\n*Auto-detects Filesystem\n\n*Does need user priviledges\n\n*Automatically mounts to folder under /media/ (so don't need to make mount point folder)\n\n*Eject button located in Nautilus or by right clicking original file and selecting Unmount.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know how this script will react to Images with multiple filesystems.

Select it and then click on the \"Properties\" button...\nAnother window will appear, called \"Group 'vboxusers' Properties. Just check the box in front of your username and click the \"OK\" button when you're done...\nClose the \"Group settings\" and \"Users Settings\" windows and log out. Log in and open up VirtualBox, start your virtual machine and you will see that you can now access the USB devices!\nYes... it was that simple!\n\nA: After having installed Virtual Box together with the Oracle Extension Pack and the Guest Additions we are able to activate USB devices attached to the host by right clicking the little icon on the right bottom of Virtual Box Manager to select the USB device:\n\nBy doing so the USB device will be deactivated from the host. After installing the appropriate drivers on the guest you will have full access to the device from the guest.\nNote: On the host users need to be in the group vboxusers to allow access on USB devices from the guest. Run sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers <YOUR_USER_NAME>, logout and login again to get the effective change.\nAn alternative method to enable printing without use of USB is to enable network printing in the host and add the new network printer to the guest.\n\nA: I believe that the USB component of virtual box is proprietary and non-free. There for Ubuntu cannot ship it with the OS. You may need to install the proprietary version ( or possibly only a proprietary extension these days ) in order to get that functionality. \nI don't use that feature myself, however I believe that Oracle have some documentation on their Virtualbox website which may assist you. \n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu but Can't Enable Unity I have recently installed Ubuntu 11.04 for the purpose of testing the new Unity interface, however; I can not boot into unity, all I get is GNOME. I have goggled this and read many forums, but there seems to be nobody with simple instructions on how to enable Unity. Can anyone help me get Unity working on my Ubuntu installation?\n\nA: You graphics card is not powerful enough to run Unity, or at least Unity 3D. You will have to install the Unity 2D version. It looks identical, but it is much more lightweight. It should be in the Ubuntu Software Center, but if that doesn't work out then follow this guide. :)\n\nA: Some graphics cards are known to have problems with Unity, and are, therefore, blacklisted. You can bypass the blacklisting (just add UNITY_FORCE_START=1 to /etc/environment), and then try dealing with the problems. Posting the specs of your graphics card might also help.\n", "Q: I installed on a WD Passport USB driver; how can I get grub to work correctly? I'm pretty new to Ubuntu, and installed Natty (32-bit, because it was recommended) soon after it came out.  The installation process chose to put Natty onto an external USB hard drive, a 500 MB WD Passport, which I liked (it wouldn't interfere with my Windows partition that way).  However, at boot, the computer boots directly into Windows unless I press F12 (on my Dell) to choose boot options, and then select to boot into the Passport.  Then I get grub and select to boot into Ubuntu.  I don't really mind this; it seems obvious that grub was installed onto the Passport.  No big deal.\nBut I just recently installed 64-bit Natty onto the Passport, choosing the option to \"upgrade Ubuntu 11.04 to Ubuntu 11.04.\"  It went well, most of my settings were saved (and all of my data), but it seems to have installed another instance of grub.  Now, when I boot the computer, I have to press F12 to select the Passport (as I did before), then select \"earlier versions of Ubuntu\" in grub, at which time another grub screen comes up which allows me to choose the right OS (the 64-bit version).\nI don't mind selecting the Passport, but after that I'd rather have one grub screen, not two in a row.  How do I do this?\nmdk@Tabasco:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0xe49667b6\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1               1           5       40131   de  Dell Utility\n/dev/sda2               6        1918    15358976    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda3   *        1918       35363   268649893+   7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda4           35363       60802   204334080    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5           35363       60802   204333056    7  HPFS/NTFS\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 500.1 GB, 500074283008 bytes\n201 heads, 9 sectors/track, 539915 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 1809 * 512 = 926208 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00038a56\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *           2      269958   244175360    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sdb2          269958      539915   244175873    5  Extended\n/dev/sdb5          269958      535292   239993856   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb6          535293      539915     4180992   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdc: 1299 MB, 1299594240 bytes\n40 heads, 62 sectors/track, 1023 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 2480 * 512 = 1269760 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n\n\nA: I \"solved\" this by wiping the external drive and reinstalling Ubuntu on a partition of the internal hard drive. Since grub had been installed on the external drive, the process wiped it out, too. Not elegant, I guess, but it solved the problem and gave me a fresh install of 64-bit Ubuntu 11.04. \nPerhaps it's worth noting that although 32-bit Ubuntu seemed to be about as fast running on the external hard drive as on the internal hard drive, 64-bit Ubuntu seems to be faster on the internal hard drive.  (I expected boot-up to be faster, since that involves reading from the drive a lot, but I was surprised to find that the system was overall faster.)\n\nA: \"Earlier versions of Ubuntu\" includes older kernels. Make sure that your system is up-to-date and regenerate the boot menu after. Boot into the 64-bit Ubuntu, open a terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo update-grub\n\nReboot to test it. If nothing changed, it's likely a bug. If you do not need the 32-bit Ubuntu, remove that.\n", "Q: Unity \"Files & Folders\" lens can't find anything Recently, the Unity \"Files & Folders\" lens can not find anything I am searching for using the dash.\nLet's give an example :\nI want to find a document called \"Figure_1.png\". Before this trouble, I could write \"Fig\" in the dash and all the documents starting whose name would contain \"Fig\" will be displayed in the results.\nSince, yesterday, nothing happens and I just got the three types \"Recent\", \"Download\" and \"Favorite Folders\" populated. Even if the document \"Figure_1.png\" is present in the \"Recent\" subcategorie, typing \"Fig\" wouldn't only restrict the result to this document.\nIt seems that the search motor has been killed somehow.\nAll other lenses behave as expected.\nI tried to reinstall the unity-places-files application as well as zeitgeist and log-in/log-out without success.\nAlso, when I run the command zeitgeist-daemon --replace in a terminal, this error message appears :\nERROR - zeitgeist.extension - Failed loading the 'SearchEngineExtension' extension\n\nI don't know if that might be related to my problem.\nDo you know a way to get back this very important feature ?\nThanks for your answers.\n\nA: The problem could be in corrupted FTS index. See the bug report.\nThe solution is to remove the index - this shouldn't affect your overall history of activities.\nzeitgeist-daemon --quit\nrm -rvf ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/fts.index/\nzeitgeist-daemon --replace\n\n(Based on Michal Hruby's solution from the linked bug report.)\n\nA: What do you see when you open folders and places (it) when you open it this is it for me  or do you get a just a black empty dash. If you want to realy search you'll have to install unity-places-filesearch the ppa is: http://ppa.launchpad.net/pydave/unity-lenses/ubuntu the normale lens won't search though all the files.\nAfter you've installed it you type in terminal unity or log out and back in again.\n", "Q: Driver for printer Fuji Xerox DocuPrint C3360? I can't find any suitable driver for the Fuji Xerox DocuPrint C3360.\nFuji Xerox's website does not have any Debian package nor sources, but it has an RPM package.

But now two albums are missing from Music folder and I'm sure it's something wrong with Ubuntu. All those files were recently downloaded and modified from Ubuntu and moved to ntfs partition. While on Windows 7 (around two years) I never had this problem before.\nSo how to prevent this problem? And are there any tools I could use to recover files and check for errors? Thanks.\n\nA: Try running a file system check in Windows7 on that partition. Hopefully the lost files will magically reappear afterwards.\n\nA: Have a look at this question - this is not actually Ubuntu messing up the files, it's Windows \"fixing things up\" after booting from hibernation image :) \nGenerally, modifying other OS's filesystem while it's hibernated is the same as directly messing with the disk device at the block level without the OS knowing - it leads to filesystem corruption because the data on disk goes out of sync with what OS knows about the disk.\n", "Q: Software Center disappeared and system settings does not work I was cleaning up software in Software Center that I no longer use and after uninstalling one package the Software Center disappeared - as well as the System Configuration tools, how can I restore the Software Center and configuration functionality?\n\nSalve, stavo facendo un po' di pulizia tra i software che non mi interessano su software center e dopo avere disistallato uno Ubuntu Software Center è sparito e le Impostazioni di Sistema non funzionano. Aiuto vi prego! Sono nel panico. Come devo fare.\n\nA: To directly restore Software Center you need to re-install the software-center package. You can do so from the terminal with\nsudo apt-get install software-center\n\nIf that doesn't restore your entire desktop there is a good chance that you will need to re-install the ubuntu-desktop meta-package. Try re-installing the ubuntu-desktop meta-package:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: Use Synaptic package manager to reinstall the software center.\n", "Q: Approach to creating an Ubuntu Appliance I am using the latest Desktop Ubuntu Narwhal as a redundant load balancer. This setup also needs keepalived and Crossroads XR. \nThis works great but now I would like to produce this as an appliance so that it is easy to deploy.\nWhat would be the correct way to approach this requirement?\n\nA: I would have a couple of recommendations, the first being on the security side;\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto http://www.cisecurity.org/ and download the security guide for Debian and ensure the system has been hardened according to the guide.\n\n*For physical systems, goto http://www.geekconnection.org/remastersys to create a customized version of Ubuntu based on your build requirements(development of remastersys stopped).\n\n*For virtualization I would create both a VMWare and OVF (Virtualbox). \nHope this helps. \n", "Q: how to get output of a script/program into a file? I am compiling a program using make and want the output of make to be written to a file. I have tried using > operator like\nmake > build_log.txt\n\nand using tee command like\nmake | tee build_log.txt\n\nbut the problem is that some of the ouput goes into the file but rest keeps appearing on the screen. \nI can simply copy/paste the text from terminal into a file after running make but that is not a solution.  \nSo my question is how do I save i.e redirect all the output to file so that it goes into file only without appearing on screen.\n\nA: The text that is displayed in the terminal comes from the stderr stream (2). If you do just make > build_log.txt, only the stdout (1) stream is redirected to the build_log.txt file.\n\n\n*\n\n*stdout is the standard output stream and has file descriptor number 1. This is the default stream being redirected in shells.\n\n*stderr is the standard error stream and has file descriptor number 2\n\n\nTo redirect the stderr stream to that build_log.txt file too, use:\nmake > build_log.txt 2>&1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*make is executed and\n\n*\n\n*the stdout stream is redirected (>) to build_log.txt\n\n*the stderr stream is redirected (2>) to the stdout stream (&1), which was redirected to build_log.txt\nThe order is important, you cannot switch switch the redirection operators like make 2>&1 > build_log.txt.\nAlternative command:\nmake 2>&1 | tee build_log.txt > /dev/null\n\nThe redirection to /dev/null is needed to hide output, tee writes its input to build_log.txt and outputs it too.\n", "Q: My system has a special image and standard images won't work? How can I install ubuntu 11.04 on my laptop DELL Latitude E6420?\nI see this at the ubuntu sites\n\nThe system is available in some regions with a special image of Ubuntu pre-installed by the manufacturer. It takes advantage of the hardware features for this system and may include additional software. You should check when buying the system whether this is an option.\nStandard images of Ubuntu may not work at all on the system or may not work well, though Canonical and computer manufacturers will try to certify the system with future standard releases of Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: Your laptop is actually certified to work with Ubuntu, so you shouldn't have any problems installing it.

If you reinstall grub at this time it will add both OpenSuse and Ubuntu to it but you can also do this manually from within OpenSuse after install (also useful in case the installer does mess it up and only adds Ubuntu. \n\n\nA: fist，install the opensuse 11.4.\nthen, install the Ubuntu 11.o4, and do not install the grub on master partition.\nthen ,modify the Opensuse's grub config, add the entry of the ubuntu 11.04's boot option.\n", "Q: Lot of debconf windows When I install a program from the software manager, I have a lot of blank debconf windows opening then disappearing.\nIs this normal behaviour or should I report a bug ?\n\nA: If these are terminal windows, you might want to reinstall libgtk2-perl since the gnome frontend to debconf depends on it.\n", "Q: How do I improve my server disk performance I have an HP Microserver running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. It's a low power server with 5 internal drive bays. I use it to backup my remote servers, VPSs and local laptops over the network. I want to get the best performance from the disks, but I don't know if it's setup optimally, so I'm looking for some advice.\nMy server runs rsnapshot multiple times a day to backup remote hosts. The actual incremental backup part takes very little time. The significant time is spent doing things like:-\n/bin/cp -al /srv/rsnapshot/hourly.0 /srv/rsnapshot/hourly.1\n\nWhich takes about 2 hours. I realise there are a bazillion tiny files in there. \n$ sudo du -hs hourly.1\n659G    hourly.1\n\nAlso when rsnapshot deletes an old backup this can take a long time:-\n/bin/rm -rf /srv/rsnapshot/daily.6/\n\nWhich takes about half an hour.\nMy questions are as follows, configuration of server and some IO stats are detailed below. I can of course provide more debug info if necessary:-\nHow can I identify where the bottlenecks are?\nAm I reaching the limits of what's capable (IO wise) with this box?\nAre there any performance tweaks I could make?\nShould I use a different RAID level?\nWould it make sense to swap two of the internal RAID disks (half of each mirror) with two 'other halves of the other mirror' on the external array? \nNote: I'm somewhat not inclined to be doing things like compiling my own kernel.

there's no equivalent for RAID 0/1/10.\nPerformance of your individual drives (as per hdparm) looks fine - they're all performing as expected for drives of that class.\nMy suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that AHCI is enabled in the BIOS and that the internally-installed drives aren't using legacy IDE mode. There is a hacked BIOS for the MicroServer available that also enables AHCI for the eSATA port too (see this link for more info) - may be worth investigating for the drives in the external enclosure, although they'll still be limited by being behind a port multiplier.\n\n*Enable NCQ for all drives and see if that makes a difference (it might, it might not).\n\n*Make sure the filesystem settings are optimised (mounting noatime, nodiratime). You could also disable write barriers, but that may be too risky.\n\n*Check if you see any benefit from switching I/O scheduler (noop may help here).\n\n*Adjust the read-ahead buffer for both the md and LVM devices: \nblockdev --setra <size> /dev/md1 for example (where <size> is 512-byte sectors). That will only help reads though.\n\n\nTwo other things that can impact performance are partition alignment and filesystem creation parameters (stride, etc) but as you're using modern tools, that shouldn't be an issue.\n", "Q: How do I determine the path to a binary of a process?

Have you actually given the \"root\" user a password, then logged in as \"root\"?\nAssuming this is the case (and I hope it's not), then you need to check your User Privileges.

Doing this (then waiting approximately 24 hours for DNS to update worldwide) should then allow you to type in the domain and get to your site under the following conditions:\n   (a) The system is web facing, and your firewall has been configured to allow port 80 traffic to reach your system, or\n   (b) Port 80 (the normal HTTP port) has been opened in the NAT'd gateway that may exist between your system and the actual internet connection (for example, a router that forwards port 80 to your machine), and the same port has also been allowed in your computer's firewall.\n\nA: You will need to add an 'A' record to the DNS Nameserver for your domain that points to the IP address of your external internet connection. \nYou must make sure that you have a static external IP address. If you are using NAT on your router you will also need to make sure you add a Port Forwarding rule to forward anything coming in on port 80 to your server. \nThat will get the traffic going to your server. \nYou will then need to add your domain to the apache config file ( httpd.conf ).

Only when the signal is low, it automatically connects via EDGE. You can suppress this behavior by choosing the option \"Connect via 3G only\".\nNow I'm using Ubuntu 11.04. As I said I couldn't install the official application, I just installed the mentioned driver. This modem automatically connects via EDGE when 3G signal is low. I want to connect via 3G always, also when the 3G Signal is low. \nSo what I should do?\n\nA: According to the documentation it is possible to force 3G with the parameter network-type:\nFollowing Options are available for the parameter network-type\n\n\n*\n\n*-1 any connection (Default value)\n\n*0 for Only 3G\n\n*1 for GPRS/EDGE only\n\n*2 prefer 3G\n\n*3 prefer 2G\n\n\nThese changes have to made in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/your_3g_connection. Put network-type 0 in the section [gsm]\nOption 0 is what you requested, but I would recommend using 2. If your signal is too weak for 3G, you'll have no connection at all with the setting 0. Whereas the option 2 will go down to EDGE/GPRS in that case. Better 2G than nothing at all, isn't it?\nGraphical Way\nYou can achieve the same result with the \"Network-Connections\" dialogue.

Does anyone what they mean, and how to amend them?\n\nA: These errors indicate that the X server is unable to load the Extended Display Identifaction Data record from the monitor during setup.  In practice, this means that X will attempt to pick what it thinks is a sane resolution based on some probing, rather than autoconfiguring to the best setup available for your specific monitor.  That you get reports from two different search subsystems is just evidence that X is trying really hard.\nEnsuring these messages do not appear is somewhat difficult: it requires troubleshooting precisely why the EDID could not be read (the get-edid utility from the read-edid package may be useful).  If the issue is that the EDID is in a new format not yet understood by your computer, then you'd want to file a bug with lots of information, probably first against the read-edid package, after which the solution would propagate to other software.  If the issue is that the EDID is corrupt in some way, or otherwise unreadable, you would need to update the firmware of your LCD and/or display controller, which may or may not be supported by your hardware.  Whether there exists some firmware that produces sensible EDID is another matter :)\nIn practice, if your screen is not corrupted, these errors are unimportant.  If the resolution is undesireable, you can force a resolution by creating an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.  Start by running sudo Xorg -configure, and then edit to have your preferred configuration for your LCD.  Unless you are very motivated, it may be safer to ignore these errors, as adjusting firmware or agressively testing software-during-development to troubleshoot EDID detection may impact other workflows on your system.\nThis error is typically observed on all-in-one systems (of any form-factor) where the manufacturer has prepared special drivers as part of the default installation, rather than using standard drivers for the hardware and operating system selected.  While the \"optimised\" drivers can often work around specific implementation issues with the hardware, they unfortunately offer a temptation to work around compliance with common standards as well.  Happily, the tendency for systems to be shipped in this condition has been markedly reduced in recent years, as more and more ODMs and OEMs validate their hardware against multiple operating systems.\n", "Q: Issue with trashcan in panel I am running Natty and I have the trashcan applet in one of my panels in Gnome and when I drag items to the trash can they get put into the panel instead.

I have already dual systems : Windows 7 and Ubuntu installed on my laptop. The Windows 7 had been installed when I bought this laptop, and I don't have a CD.\nI just installed VitrualBox under Ubuntu, hoping that I could install another Windows in this virtual machine, so that I could run some applications of Windows even under Ubuntu.\nBut it seems that I need a CD or ISO of Windows to boot inside this virtual machine. Otherwise, there is an error: FATAL: No bootable medium found! System halted. My question is where I could find a CD or ISO?\nAt the moment, I am downloading ISO from this page, but do not know if it will work. By the way, I am not sure if I should pick the 32-bit or 64-bit? As my CPU is 64-bit but my Ubuntu is i386.\nCould anyone help? Thank you very much.\n\nA: Yes, you need an ISO or cd of the os that you want to install inside the virtualbox.\nVirtualBox supports 64-bit guest operating systems, even on 32-bit host operating systems, provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n \n*  You need a 64-bit processor with hardware virtualization support .\n\n*    You must enable hardware virtualization for the particular VM for which you want 64-bit support; software virtualization is not supported for 64-bit VMs.\n\n*If you want to use 64-bit guest support on a 32-bit host operating system, you must also select a 64-bit operating system for the particular VM. Since supporting 64 bits on 32-bit hosts incurs additional overhead, VirtualBox only enables this support upon explicit request.\nRead more here: http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#intro-64bitguests\n\nA: If your aim is to run just a few windows apps under ubuntu, take a look at the wine project. http://www.winehq.org/ When you boot the VM for the first time, it should ask you the details of installation media.. Select your downloaded iso file, and it should work great. If you have a cd, select your cd drive there.\n\nA: In theory you could do a physical to virtual conversion of your existing windows installation although it's not something I've tried using virtualbox.  These instructions claim they should work with win7 http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Migrate_Windows\n\nA: I'm installing Windows 7 using VirtualBox in Ubuntu 11.10. You can choose \"Settings\" from your VM and adjust to boot from CD by moving the CD ROM up top. When you start your VM for installation, the CD will be booted first.\nIf you use ISO, just mount it in a daemon tool and do the same above.\n", "Q: DevHelp php-doc is not available I've been using Devhelp but find that it is too much towards python, and Gnome development. Other documentations (such as php-doc) are left out as of now.\nIs there a simple way to add php-doc into devhelp ?\n\nA: Devhelp requires documentation in specific format (.devhelp files, presumably generated with gtk-doc), it won't automatically pick documentation from all *-doc packages present on your system.\nEdit: PHP documentation is still available in /usr/share/doc/php-doc/html once you install php-doc package. However, probably more robust solution is to download PHP documentation in CHM format and use it with some CHM viewer like ChmSee or xCHM.\n\nA: I'm using devhelp through synapse for php-docs.\nSome nice guy wrote a script to convert .CHM into .TGZ (devhelp) format and to install the files. So it goes like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert:\nhhconvert.py YOUR_DOC.chm YOUR_DOC.tgz\n\n\n*Install:\ndevhelp-install YOUR_DOC.tgz\n\nNote\nFor the convert script to work you need to install first Python, ctypes, CHMLIB.\nInstall puts YOUR_BOOK.devhelp and the res-Folder into ~/.local/share/devhelp/books/YOUR_BOOK/.\n\nA: I'm not familiar with devhelp, but I'd assume at least the first step would be to install php-doc. It's in the repos, so a quick apt-get install php-doc will get it for you. I'd venture to guess that from there, either devhelp will pick it up automatically, or there's a setting somewhere that allows you to specify the location of the php-doc executable. If not, there might be a plugin, but my quick search in the repos only shows php-doc plugins for kdevelop, so you'll probably have to do a Google search for that (the PHP-doc website might also be helpful).\nThe other alternative, of course, is to see if there's a PHP-oriented alternative to Devhelp.\n", "Q: Enabling Compiz \"Extra\" or \"Normal\" effects per bash in Ubuntu Enabling disabling compiz per bash is pretty simple per compiz --replace,\nBut how can I switch between the None / Normal / Extra -- Visual Effects in the \"gnome-appearance-properties\" only using a shell..\nPS.

For setting Normal effects it appears to unset /apps/compiz/general/allscreens/options/active_plugins (in gconf) so that it gets set back to default. For Extra effects it appears to do the same, but appends shift and wobbly to the list.\nTo browse and edit gconf visually, use gconf-editor.\nTo query and edit gconf settings from a shell, you need to use gconftool\nSo if the above information pans out, man gconftool should set you on the right track.\n", "Q: Chrome fonts not displaying properly after installing texlive I installed texlive 2010 and ran fc-cache -fvs to update font cache.

I guess it created a swap partition equal to the size of my RAM. Every time I try to hibernate I get the \"not enough swap\" message, which is annoying. I want to hibernate! Why can't you just use some of my 20GB free HD space to hibernate? I only have 1GB RAM on this old geezer.\nI've seen the swap faq @ http://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq but it's painfully dense. It shows me how to create a swap file and turn that on, but doesn't explain the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the system hibernate to that swap file, or will it still be confused because the swap partition is there and too small?\n\n*Do I need to get rid of the swap partition? I don't desperately need the space, but I would like to reclaim it because this computer has a pretty small HD.\n\n*Why is this all so difficult?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: The best way IMHO is just to increase the size of the swap partition.\nBoot your computer with a Ubuntu Live CD/USB.\nThe live CD will detect and use your swap, you should disable it to be able to manipulate it. Open a terminal and type the following command:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nAfterwards, open Gparted, an resize your partition. You will need to shrink some partition that is close to it. It should be quite straightforward.\nYou will need to boot from some external method, because you can't resize partitions that are in use, and it's quite likely that you will need to shrink your main partition.\nNow the other questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes.\n\n*If you use a swap file then yes, you can get rid of your swap partition. But I believe that using a swap partition is easier. It's also the standard practice in linux, most of the tutorials that you can find on the net will expect it.\n\n*Messing with swap is something that no newbie should do in any OS. No need to make it easy.\n\nA: I finally solved this. Of course, to answer the \"Why is this all so difficult?\" part of my question, I would just have to respond \"This is Linux, you fool, of course everything is difficult!\"\nHere are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu install CD (I'm on Natty) and choose the option to run Ubuntu now\n\n*Go to system -> GParted Partition Editor\n\n*Delete the swap partition and the extended partition that holds it (if by some miracle you're able to resize your swap partition from here, I imagine your life will be a lot easier than mine)\n\n*Decrease the size of your primary partition by the amount you want your new swap to be (I made mine 2x RAM + 500MB just to be safe). The easiest way to do this is to fill in the amount of space you want swap to be in the \"free space following\" field\n\n*In the free space that has now been created, choose new, type linux-swap and you can name the partition \"swap\" if you like\n\n*Hit the Apply button (should be a check mark) to write the changes to disk\n\n*When done, reboot back into Ubuntu\n\n\nNow you need to find what partition your swap is on and what its UUID is. UUID?! you say? Well that's the Universally Unique IDentifier for the partition so you can reference it even if it's on a different mount point from boot-to-boot due to adding disks, etc. If this is your primary disk, it's probably not a big deal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pull up a terminal and run gksu gparted & and enter your root password. The & lets this process run while still giving you access to the command line.\n\n*Right-click on your swap partition and choose Information. You should see the Path and UUID listed there. Keep this open for further reference.\n\n*Run gksu gedit /etc/fstab & and look for the line that has swap in it. It should be the third column, separated by spaces or tabs. You can either use the path or the UUID to tell Linux where to find your swap partition. I recommend UUID because it'll stay constant even if you move the partition around or the disk somehow becomes sdb instead of sda or something like that. Make the appropriate edits and save the file. Your line should look something like this if you used UUID (with your UUID instead, of course): \n\n*\n\n*UUID=41e86209-3802-424b-9a9d-d7683142dab7 none swap sw 0 0\n\n*or this if you used path: /dev/sda2 none swap sw 0 0\n\n\n*Save and reboot to make sure the new swap gets activated properly at startup\n\n\nGrab a glass of milk and wait for Ubuntu to come back up... The fun part comes next\n\n\n*\n\n*Pull up a Terminal again and run cat /proc/swaps and hopefully you see the path to your swap partition listed there. If not chances are something went wrong in the steps above. Here's my output:\nFilename                Type        Size    Used    Priority\n/dev/sda2               partition   2676732 6360    -1\n\n\n*gksu gedit /etc/default/grub & to pull up the boot loader configuration\n\n*Look for the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\" and make sure it looks like this (using your UUID of course) GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"resume=UUID=41e86209-3802-424b-9a9d-d7683142dab7\" and save the file\n\n*sudo update-grub and wait for it to finish\n\n*gksu gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume & and make sure its contents are resume=UUID=41e86209-3802-424b-9a9d-d7683142dab7 (with your UUID of course in place of mine). Save the file!\n\n*sudo update-initramfs -u\n\n*Reboot!\n\n\nNow you should be able to hibernate and resume! I really hope this helps someone else. I can't believe Ubuntu is on version 11 and it still SUCKS THIS HARD to get it to hibernate your laptop. Don't lose faith though, it can be done!\n", "Q: How do i convert .dwg to .dxf with free software?

The answers on this post are so very wrong, and this comes up as one of the first results in a Google search for \"How much swap?\"\nFirst, a good point of reference is the Ubuntu Swap FAQ\nThis FAQ makes an important point that no one here mentions, and that is (emphasis mine)\n\nSometimes, a large program (like OpenOffice, Neverwinter Nights, or a video editor) make the entire system need extra memory. A significant number of the pages used by these large programs during its startup may only be used for initialization and then never used again. The system can swap out those pages and free the memory for other programs or even for the disk cache. In these cases, swap will be used to help the system handle any extra load.\n\nSo, swap is not just for hibernation! This activity, swapping out unused pages, can be beneficial in some scenarios and detrimental in others. Beneficial because it can free up memory for the system to use elsewhere, but detrimental when that swap out is too aggressive, and swaps out pages you actually do want. This is especially true on a desktop system where applications can sit idle for long periods of time, but the user still expects immediate performance when bringing it back to life. The control for how aggressive this is, is referred to as swappiness\nThe Ubuntu Swap FAQ discusses this lightly under What is swappiness and how do I change it? The default value on an Ubuntu system is 60, while the FAQ recommends a value of 10 for a desktop machine.\nSo, I would say that it is generally very important to not have a system with absolutely no swap space, as some people were recommending on this question, unless you know for certain very specific usage scenarios for your system and are very aware of the consequences it could have. (Personally, there is no situation where I would run a system without swap) In an Out of Memory scenario with no swap, the system will  start killing processes (generally the one that caused the OOM)\n\nA: If you use hibernate, it's safe to have as much swap as your amount of RAM.\nFor a general rule of thumb on how much swap to have, read here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nIn your case I'd say 4 GB would be enough to match your RAM.\n\nA: If your ram is higher than 1GB, it is usually enough for ubuntu.  The \"Swap = RAM x2\" rule is for old computers with 256 or 128mb of ram.\nSo 1 GB of swap is usually enough for 4GB of RAM.  8 GB would be too much.\n\nA: From Ubuntu's SwapFaq:\nWhy do I need swap?\nMemory consuming programs Sometimes, a large program (like LibreOffice, Neverwinter Nights, or a video editor) make the entire system need extra memory. A significant number of the pages used by these large programs during its startup may only be used for initialization and then never used again. The system can swap out those pages and free the memory for other programs or even for the disk cache. In these cases, swap will be used to help the system handle any extra load.\nHibernation (suspend-to-disk) The hibernation feature (suspend-to-disk) writes out the contents of RAM to the swap partition before turning off the machine. Therefore, your swap partition should be at least as big as your RAM size. The hibernation implementation currently used in Ubuntu, swsusp, needs a swap or suspend partition. It cannot use a swap file on an active file system.\nUnforeseeable Circumstances Unforeseeable events can and will happen (a program going crazy, some action needing much more space than you thought, or any other unpredictable combination of events). In these cases, swap can give you an extra delay to figure out what happened, or to finish what you are working on.\nOptimizing memory usage Since mechanical hard drives are considerably slower than RAM (SSD - Solid State Drive - storage is not as slow as physical drives, but still slower than RAM), when you need a file (be it a data file like a video, executables like Firefox, or libraries), the Linux kernel reads the file into RAM and keeps it there, so that the next time you need it, it is already in RAM and data access is much faster. The portions of RAM that accelerate disk read are called \"cached memory.\" You will notice that they make a huge difference in terms of responsiveness. The Linux kernel automatically moves RAM reserved by programs--but not really used--into swap, so that it can serve the better purpose of extending cached memory.\nOptimizing Swap performance Because swap space uses a disk device, this can cause performance issues in any system that uses swap space significantly because the system itself may also be using the same disk device at the same time that it is required for swap operations. One way to reduce this problem is to have swap space on a different physical drive so that the competition for that resource is either reduced or eliminated.\nHow much swap do I need?\nFor less then 1GB of physical memory (RAM), it's highly recommended that the swap space should, as a base minimum, be equal to the amount of RAM. Also, it's recommended that the swap space is maximum twice the amount of RAM depending upon the amount of hard disk space available for the system because of diminishing returns.\nFor more modern systems (>1GB), your swap space should be at a minimum be equal to your physical memory (RAM) size \"if you use hibernation\", otherwise you need a minimum of round(sqrt(RAM)) and a maximum of twice the amount of RAM. The only downside to having more swap space than you will actually use, is the disk space you will be reserving for it.\nThe \"diminishing returns\" means that if you need more swap space than twice your RAM size, you'd better add more RAM as Hard Disk Drive (HDD) access is about 10³ slower then RAM access, so something that would take 1 second, suddenly takes more then 15 minutes! And still more then a minute on a fast Solid State Drive (SSD)...\nExample Scenarios\n\n    RAM(GB) No hibernation  With Hibernation  Maximum\n      1      1                2                   2\n      2      1                3                   4\n      3      2                5                   6\n      4      2                6                   8\n      5      2                7                  10\n      6      2                8                  12\n      8      3               11                  16\n     12      3               15                  24\n     16      4               20                  32\n     24      5               29                  48\n     32      6               38                  64\n     64      8               72                 128\n    128     11              139                 256\n\n\n\nA: Probably not. If you plan to hibernate your computer (suspend-to-disk) then you'll need at least 16 GB. If you won't hibernate, it is enough to let a few gigabytes for swap (4-8 max.)\n\nA: Here's a very good recommendation from Red Hat: Recommended System Swap Space\nAn excerpt from the same link:\n\nIn years past, the recommended amount of swap space increased linearly with the amount of RAM in the system. However, modern systems often include hundreds of gigabytes of RAM. As a consequence, recommended swap space is considered a function of system memory workload, not system memory.\n\nAnd another excerpt from an older version of the page:\n\nHowever, given that swap space is usually designated at install time, and that it can be difficult to determine beforehand the memory workload of a system, we recommend determining system swap using the following table.\n\nRHEL 8 table:\nAmount of RAM    Recommended swap space       Recommended swap space \nin the system                                 if allowing for hibernation\n--------------   --------------------------   ---------------------------\n⩽ 2 GB           2 times the amount of RAM    3 times the amount of RAM\n> 2 GB – 8 GB    Equal to the amount of RAM   2 times the amount of RAM\n> 8 GB – 64 GB   At least 4 GB                1.5 times the amount of RAM\n> 64 GB          At least 4 GB                Hibernation not recommended\n\n\nAt the border between each range listed in the table above, for example a system with 2 GB, 8 GB, or 64 GB of system RAM, discretion can be exercised with regard to chosen swap space and hibernation support. If your system resources allow for it, increasing the swap space may lead to better performance. A swap space of at least 100 GB is recommended for systems with over 140 logical processors or over 3 TB of RAM.\n\nOriginal RHEL 5 table:\nAmount of RAM in the System     Recommended Amount of Swap Space\n4GB of RAM or less              a minimum of 2GB of swap space\n4GB to 16GB of RAM              a minimum of 4GB of swap space\n16GB to 64GB of RAM             a minimum of 8GB of swap space\n64GB to 256GB of RAM            a minimum of 16GB of swap space\n256GB to 512GB of RAM           a minimum of 32GB of swap space \n\n\nA: From experience I can say this:\nFor what I have seen using 4GB of ram for 3 years, Ubuntu has had a swap usage of around 60MB but only when doing some very intensive tasks. A couple of weeks ago I started using a PC that had 16GB of ram and the swap usage has stayed in 0% for ever. I have done multiple compiles, video rendering and other intensive tasks. There has never been a change in swap. Not even a 1KB change.\nBasically, in Ubuntu, the more memory RAM you have, the less likely you will use or need swap for any task. 16GB of ram, or even 8GB of ram is more than enough. I have done with the 16GB PC 8 Virtualbox PCs (each between 1GB to 2GB of ram). I have compiled and rendered a 720p video and not even in those conditions has the swap changed.\nWith that said, the rule of twice as much memory ram should not apply on Linux based systems, even more so if you have more memory. You should however have the same size of swap equal to your ram size or if you are planning to hibernate, since the process of hibernation grabs everything in ram and puts it on swap, which is why you need a minimum size equal to your ram size for swap. \nThe other detail is that some apps (not all) will still force to read from swap. So having a bit is good. Disabling it altogether is very bad in the case you get to the point of out of memory or OOM. At this point if you do not have swap, there is no way the kernel can swap in/out different ram app usages and will eventually start killing the less used ones. \nIf it helps with home desktop decision making, after updating this answer in more than 4 years, I have used a 16gb, 32gb and now a 64gb ram PC. Testing with only 128MB of swap revealed that I had no need for larger swap except if I  wanted to hibernate. I have used cloud environments on them, lxc, virtualbox, wine,  you name it. I have rendered videos with openshot, kazam, handbrake,  audacity. I have used gimp, blender, Inkscape and even the full LibreOffice suite. I  even played on steam and in none of those scenarios the swap was used. Of course, it will eventually get used if you end up using the full ram amount in one way or another but in general the more ram you have, the less swap you'll need.\nJust my 2 cents. \n\nA: It entirely depends on what you plan to do with the machine. For example if it were a Sap server then yes, I would add 32gb swap ( we have boxes at work with 128gb ram and 32gb swap ). If you were manipulating massive pictures and video then it makes sense to have a little swap. 32gb is probably overkill. \nHowever I would not say zero swap.\nIn the unlikely event that you run out of RAM - perhaps opening a big file, perheps a long running tab in firefox, it doesn't matter, in that event your kernel OOM killer will kick in and start killing applications to get memory back. Under those circumstances it's entirely possible that you will lose data as applications get killed. However if you have a bit of swap then the system will carry on, grabbing swap and allowing the system to continue. System slows down as heavy swapping happens, you notice and investigate before all swap exhausted. Also disk is very cheap, so why not have swap?\nAnyone who says \"you don't need swap\" without asking you what you're actually doing with your computer is making assumptions. Whilst you may well do very little with your computer that eats RAM, it's still best to ask the questions about what you're planning to do with it before making the rash judgement that you don't \"need\" swap. In my humble opinion\n\nA: You only need swap if you want to use hibernate for the rest it is a wast of space on your harddrive.\n\nA: If you use hibernation your swap should have at least the same amount as your physical ram.\n\nA: I have a laptop with 4GB of RAM and Ubuntu 16.04. After boot it consumes around 1GB of RAM and even then Inkscape (for example) won't run (System monitor shows more than 50% of free RAM).\nInkscape freezes\nAfter I apply a swap file it runs as expected, even with no one single byte of swap being used).\nSo I recommend a swap partition (or swap file).\nAbout the size of it, you can use david6 rule.\n\nA: I think you got it the other way round. SWAP Recommendation, you would need ~16GB. So SWAP should be 1/2 of the actual RAM size. But still thats a LOT of space. Depends what you need it for. I'd say, if you don't use \"hibernate\", keep around ~4GB to ~8GB if you can afford the disk space. Since you have 16GB, I assume you may be using a computer which needs powerful resources... so maybe it might be beneficial to have 16GB to 32GB SWAP as well.\nI have 2GB RAM and 1GB SWAP. I do pretty much fine with it, but that's just my opinion. Look at the other comments/suggestions and see what they say. \n\nA: I could not find references to quote here, but if you are going to use an application where you need to swap out entire data in RAM, you would atleast need 'RAM size+128 MB' or '1.25 times of RAM Size' (i forgot which one was correct) assuming you have RAM more than 2 GB. If RAM is 2GB or less, it is recommended to have twice RAM size as swap.I followed this recommendation in my previous organisation for IBM AIX based on a document from IBM. I believe this holds true for most of *nix since the use of swap is move data from RAM safely in case RAM is not enough to handle the data to be loaded in memory. 'free' command can be used to evaluate how much swap is used in reality.\n\nA: I have a Mac laptop, which I leave on for months.  Although much better than Windows, memory does creep in, particularly with your browser, if you keep it up.  So eventually, memory fills up.  Now if you have swap, as other people have noted, you can survive, notice and kill something.  But more to the point, if you have swap, some pages get swapped out and you can keep going.\nSo if you're planning on leaving the machine up for a long time, swap is a handy way to free up memory from zombie junk.  Granted it will take you longer to fill up 16g than me with 3gb, but it's still nice.  For this purpose, 4Gb will do.\n\nA: If it is a laptop then keeping at least the swap equal to the amount of RAM, to fully allow hibernation. I would still keep an amount equal to the amount of RAM even if a desktop, but that is just me; it will get little use in a desktop.\n\nA: Keep this in mind -  \n\nYou should typically size your swap space to approximately 2x main memory for systems with less than 2GB of RAM, or approximately 1x main memory if you have more  \n\nSo If you have 4 Gb ram you should never ever need swap unless hibernating\nSwap required would be around 3 - 3.5 Gb, not more than that.\nSo use your common sense and dont waste disk space\n\nA: If you're building very big files, say for instance if you're building machine translation systems on a laptop (yea ok why would you wanna do that? I for one can say that my professors are making me ;-)) the answer is a clear yes, actually at this moment I'm regretting not making it 32GB swap.... \nFor casual use of Ubuntu for office work and internet no you're never going to use even 2 GB of swap but in reality there is no clear answer, it all depends on what you are going to do on your computer...\n\nA: Too much information, and variance in opinion.\nMy suggested Ubuntu desktop guidelines:\n amount of RAM      recommended swap    with hibernation\n----------------    ----------------    ----------------\n less than 4GB        2x RAM size         3x RAM size\n   up to 8GB              4GB             2x RAM size\n   up to 16GB             4GB            1.5x RAM size\n  16GB or more            4GB           No extra needed\n\n\nA: No one seems to have mentioned another reason to have significant swap space is to have the system noticeably slow down rather than fail to run programs as you start running out of memory. If you have a load balancer in front that redirects on failure you may want to keep swap small (say 1GB), If you want programs to slow down first, then I would consider 4GB + square root of memory size, and if you want them to really slow down before things die, then keep to min of 1.25 time memory size (as long as impatient humans don't give up first - this would be more appropriate for background jobs).\nI configure 1GB for my development and production machines as a standard, then it doesn't matter how much or little real memory they have, they have enough to compile all the programs I want, and to swap out practically never used programs to use the freed up memory for disk buffering.\nIn comparison, I have 64GB of swap on my 32GB laptop, which is a bit of an overkill, but I wanted to make sure it always kept working even if slowly, and I knew I was going to run multiple memory hungry virtual machines. An unexpected effect is when you have 32GB+ memory range then resuming from hibernation (which reloads 32GB of memory) is noticeably slower than a cold boot.\n\nA: No, you definitely don't need 32GB.  As a rule for a desktop system I'd say your swap should be somewhere between 4GB and physical RAM + a couple GB.  So for 16GB physical RAM, swap may be 4GB to 18GB, perhaps.\nThe stuff you will need to swap to the swap space will roughly equal the amount of physical RAM in use by applications that stay resident - that is, system services and applications that stay running while you are using them (as opposed to tasks that run once then quit).  On a desktop system let's say you may leave open a browser, word processor, email program and graphics or video editor while you work on something else.  Those may easily occupy over 2GB, maybe over 4GB.  So maybe 6GB of swap is appropriate.\nAs a general rule it's doesn't hurt to have a few GB more than you need, too.  Swap usually won't be used if you have a lot of RAM but it helps out on the occasion when some process is using an excessive amount and you start to get low, and can prevent the system killing processes.\nNote: if you want to use OS hibernation you'll need all 16GB as mentioned, but modern computers don't benefit much from hibernation. If you have a fast SSD, booting may be as fast or faster than resuming from hibernate, and modern computers use negligible energy while in sleep mode that the energy usage benefit from hibernate is not a big factor. \n", "Q: My time and date settings refuse to open (from the time indicator) I'm not sure why, but since an update a few days ago, the time and date settings won't open.

This is my second Belking USB, and I'd never buy another... \nAfter more testing I found that on Windows 7 the same USB adapter performs at 0.8 Mbit in Windows, which is just 15 times slower then the built-in (much older in fact) adapter in my laptop, and uses only 8% of available throughput. Claims that it is \"Best for Speed & Coverage\" seem to be ridiculous.

I'm getting a PC with Windows and I want to dual boot using Ubuntu as my primary OS.\nI want to create a Home partition to store all my files and hopefully be able to access them on Windows 7 without having to manually mount the partition or anything.\nI want to know what kind of partition should I create and if I can share my Home partition to simplify matters.\nThanks\n\nA: Instead of trying to access Ubuntu from Windows - why not just access Windows from Ubuntu? Windows support for EXT4 is slim at best - however, Ubuntu (and Linux) can easily read, write, and manipulate NTFS partitions. Simple add your Windows partition to your fstab file so it'll be mounted every time you boot then delete things like Music, Movies, Pictures, etc (Files that you want to share between the two OSes) Then create symlinks to their respective folders in the mounted Windows Partition.\nBy doing so all your files when saved in Ubuntu will actually be saved on your Windows partition so come the next time you need to reboot into Windows they will be there waiting for you.\n\nA: Try http://www.fs-driver.org/ for drivers that will allow Windows to view ext partitions.\nYour Win7 partition should appear in Ubuntu and you can use the Mount app to mount it automatically at startup.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Do you really need to access all files in your home from windows (there are plenty of dot directories hidden by Linux but that will be shown with Windows) ? If you just want to share you documents or pictures directories, you might create symlink from you home (ext4) to some ntfs partition. \n\nA: I'm not sure about this, but I think that Ubuntu should allow you to easily use any (including NTFS) partition as your home directory.\nWhile installing, make sure to choose a Windows compatible partition (NTFS,FAT32) for your /home point. This would allow Windows to detect your partition and mount it. \nHowever, remember that NTFS/FAT32 do not support permissions as well as ext4, which means you'd have to do some umasking stuff for executing files withing your home directory.\n\nA: this can be done as per this post (see the last post on the page)\nBUT BEWARE!!! this is not something I'd do as the amount of things that can go wrong is astounding.

I've set up SSL on my webserver, now I need two files:\n\n\n*\n\n*a certificate\n\n*a certificate Key\n\n\nHow do I create a self-signed certificate for testing purposes?\n\nA: As already mentioned, Ubuntu Server comes with the necessary tools. Depending on your server version you'll have to look up the specific documentation. I'll try to summarize the self-signed certificate generation process of the current LTS (12.04).\nFirst you generate the keys for the Certificate Signing Request (CSR):\nopenssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048\n\nIt's up to you to enter a passphrase or not. If you do, everytime you (re)start a service usign that certificate, you'll have to provide the passphrase. Otoh you can create an \"insecure\" key without a passphrase from the secure one:\nopenssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key.insecure\n# shuffle the key names to continue without passphrases\nmv server.key server.key.secure\nmv server.key.insecure server.key\n\nAnd now you'll create the CSR from the key. With the CSR and the key a self-signed certificate can be generated:\nopenssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt\n\nThe last step consists of installing the certificate and the key, in Debian/Ubuntu usually in /etc/ssl:\nsudo cp server.crt /etc/ssl/certs\nsudo cp server.key /etc/ssl/private\n\nAnd finally the applications using the certificate/key have to be configured accordingly.\n\nA: Ubuntu, even the 'minimal' flavour, comes with the ssl-cert package pre-installed, which means you don't need to do anything.\nThe files you're looking for are already on your system:\n/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem\n/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key\n\n\nAdvanced:\nIf for some reason you need to create a fresh certificate, you can run\nsudo make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite \n\nIf you want to change the expiration date of you certificate, you can manipulate the make-ssl-cert script at /usr/sbin/make-ssl-cert. Around like 124 there's a line similar to this:\nopenssl req -config $TMPFILE -new -x509 -nodes \\ \n\nWhere you can change the expiration date by adding the -days argument:\nopenssl req -config $TMPFILE -new -days 365 -x509 -nodes \\ \n\nMore options can be found in the manual page of req.\n\nA: The other answers are good, but if for some reason you dont have the listed\ntools, or dont want to use them, I found an open source tool that is very\nsimple:\nminica -domains localhost\n\nThis will create key file minica-key.pem and cert file minica.pem.

Any reference to motd.tail should be\nreplaced with a reference to the update-motd framework or update-motd(5).\nThe manpage for motd.tail should be removed.\n\nI'm using it to identify my servers when I log in and make sure I'm on the right machine, so I don't need anything dynamic, just a simple message.\nWhat is the equivalent to motd.tail (appending a small message to the end of the MOTD) that works with Ubuntu 11.04?\n\nA: To answer the question directly, just edit /etc/update-motd.d/99-footer.\nThe /etc/update-motd.d/ is a fairly standard config-dump that is ordered by filename. 99-footer is the last thing in there so that gets bolted on last. In Natty by default this just checks to see if there's a file called /etc/motd.tail and if there is, it appends that to the motd:\n[ -f /etc/motd.tail ] && cat /etc/motd.tail || true\n\nSo you do have two choices. You can either add some more logic in there to just echo some output (this is a shell script, not a textfile after all) or you can create (or edit if you already have one) /etc/motd.tail. Either way is perfectly valid.\n\nA: According to the Ubuntu Server Guide, pam_motd executes the scripts in /etc/update-motd.d in numerical order.\nThe output of the scripts is written to /var/run/motd, keeping the numerical order, then concatenated with /etc/motd.tail.\nMore information can be found here.\n", "Q: No longer able to connecto to WPA wireless network.

Currently I have a main script that launches every apps in a new gnome-console but I would prefer to launch them all in the same window in split screens.\nThis post Multiple shells in one window explains how to use split screens with many type of console applications such as screen, terminator and byobu. This works fine manually but I would like to be able to start all my apps in a split screen console automatically from my main scrip. In the documentation from the tools mentioned above there was nothing I could fine to achieve this automatically from a script.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You can make a custom screen config file that will open up multiple splits and launch your scripts in them. It would look something like this:\nscreen script1.sh # Open first screen and launch first script\nsplit             # Make second split\nfocus             # Switch to second split\nscreen script2.sh # Open second screen and launch second script\nsplit             # Make third split\nfocus             # Switch to third split\nscreen script3.sh # Open third screen and launch third script\n\nPut this in a file called myscripts and launch screen with screen -c myscripts. If you prefer vertical splits, just add -v to the split commands.\nIf you'd like a grid layout, try something like this:\nscreen script1.sh # Open first screen and launch first script\nsplit -v          # Make second split\nfocus             # Switch to second split\nscreen script2.sh # Open second screen and launch second script\nsplit             # Make third split\nfocus             # Switch to third split\nscreen script3.sh # Open third screen and launch third script\nfocus             # Cycle back to first split\nsplit             # Split first split horizontally\nfocus             # Switch to new split\nscreen script4.sh # Open fourth screen and launch fourth script\n\n\nA: I know it's an old question, but it is worth mentioning this tool that does just what you need in an excellent way:\nhttps://github.com/pvolok/mprocs\nIt runs in one terminal all the needed processes and allow to control them (kill, stop, start, restart).

In Ubuntu Software center there are different sections for programs\n\n\n*\n\n*Provided by Ubuntu \n\n*Canonical Partners\n\n*For purchase\n\n\nI know all of these are open-source; but is there any validation process done by the Canonical to ensure that they are free of any spyware or malware? \nI wonder will anyone get time to look at all these (2355 programs or so as of now), software code that too for every release!!\nI am worried because I routinely install rather unpopular software from software center :)\n\nA: I assume that nobody can assure you that. You would have to check what has to happen for a package to be added to the Debian package index, but I think that you should be able to slip something evil into there.\nYou can set up a virtual machine and try the software there, you can then look over the network traffic with something like iftop to see whether this applications talks to home. Chances are that you will never see anything because it is hidden too well.\nOpen Source does not mean security, just because you can look at the code does not mean that somebody did.\n\nA: Is there a process to ensure there's no malware? No. There are no guarantees at all.\nThere are, however, several mechanisms to try and detect it but while I don't want to get too doom-and-gloom, if we're honest, you're probably not as safe as you'd like to be.\n\n\n*\n\n*A project first has to get added to Ubuntu. As Rinzwind says, checks are made at this stage but that's really only the tip of the iceberg that is the life of a package in Ubuntu.\n\n*The first real line of defence for long term packages are their project maintainers. These people look after their projects and accept patches to improve them. They are human. They make mistakes and miss things. And some might be lazy. \nIt is possible that a bad person could sneak some malware past them by including genuine improvements along with the malware.\nIf something bad is admitted into a project by its maintainer, save a successful audit, chances are that code will end up on Ubuntu users' machines.\n\n*Security audits are the second step. This is examining the code and running it against monitors to detect bad things. As far as I know, there isn't an official Canonical team dedicated to security but there are two community teams (Ubuntu Security and MOTU SWAT) that handle all the packages between them.\nAuditing only really works if every line of code is checked properly before it goes out to users. This isn't really practical for the amount of code and number of updates we're talking about. It would take a huge amount of time and money to do it this way.\nThere is an assumption in the open source world that just because somebody can view the source, they have. This is a very dangerous ethos to maintain.\nSecurity fixes are largely reactionary to people finding and disclosing holes. What happens if somebody discloses a hole they find?\n\n*Other \"end users\" reporting problems is the final real detection mechanism and let's be honest, good malware won't let the user know there's a problem until it's far too late to make a difference. Well written malware isn't going to flip your screen or steal all your bandwidth, it's going to sit there in the background, logging all your banking details before it posts them all off to some anonymous dump somewhere.\nThe whole process depends on upstream projects to maintain their own security levels. If somebody slipped something past the maintainer of the Gnome calculator, chances are it's going to get missed by everybody else down the line. A security-team will never suspect it either.\nThankfully most maintainers are good at what they do. They know their codebase and if they don't understand patches, they'll reject them on the basis that they're not clear enough.\nIn terms of risk assessment, by using something that is a lot less popular, there are likely fewer eyes checking the code. But similarly there are probably fewer commits, so as long as the maintainer isn't lazy (or evil), they might have more time to deal with each commit. It's hard to say exactly how much risk you're at. Open source software's security depends on capable people looking at the code.\nConversely the closed source items (in the partner and purchase repos) are completely unaudited by the community. Canonical may have some source access, but frankly I doubt they have the resources to give things thorough audits even if they had source access and wanted to.\nSimilarly with PPAs, you get very little protection unless you want to dive into the source yourself. Users can add whatever they like to the source code and unless you're going to check it out yourself (and you're capable of detecting malware), you're a sheep surrounded by wolves. People can report bad PPAs but something happening depends on other people checking and confirming the problem. If a big site (eg OMGUbuntu) recommended a PPA (as they often do), lots of users may have issues down the line.\nTo compound the problem, the lower market share of Linux user means there's just less software available for us hunt down bad code. I hate to say it but at least with Windows, you have dozens of companies spending every working day, finding out how bad software works, how to detect it and how to remove it. That was a market born from necessity and while I hate to say this too, things are probably going to get worse here before they get better.\nFor the security paranoids, I wrote a short article a while ago: Linux isn't invulnerable. Don't say it is.. Sneaking things into the repository probably isn't going to be the primary attack vector for the asshats that distribute malware. It's far more likely (IMO) that they'll play on the greed and stupidity of users to get them to install infected .debs.\n\nA: Yes. Packages are checked by the community (so 1 might install some malware but that news will spread quickly amongst all users).\nApps need to abide to very strict rules outlined in licensing.\nThe wiki page for new packages has a bit more information:\n\nGoing through MOTU\nPackages which are not in Ubuntu yet, require extra scrutiny and go through a special review process, before they get uploaded and get a final review by the archive admins. More information on the review process, including the criteria which will be applied, can be found on the Code Reviewers page. Developers are encouraged to examine their own packages using these guidelines prior to submitting them for review.\nTo receive higher quality bug reports write an apport hook for your package.\n\nThat said: the general idea is. If you find something suspicious you report it on launchpad, askubuntu, ubuntuforums and someone will pick it up.\nWhat could happen is that a creator of malware makes a valid package, gets it accepted and then makes an update that adds the malware. At least one of the many many always catches this and he/she will report this somewhere. It is not going to get onto lots of machines this way.\n(the effort of getting it onto our machines is too much for the potential reward: targeting windows machines is much easier).\nExample of things going terribly wrong with bumblebee. Someone missed a space and /usr got deleted... some people got affected, 1 posts a warning with red flags and now we all know. Creator fixes it (faster then the speed of light) but the damage was done to several systems.\nAnd this was a mistake and not deliberate so it can happen ;)\n\nA: In order to publish code in a PPA on launchpad you need to set up openPGP and create a key attached to an email address. In order to sign a package you need a copy of the private key on the local machine and the password (which is not stored anywhere).\nShould a package have security issues it should be relatively easy to track down the author. I am assuming that the main repositories for Ubuntu and Debian are at least that secure.\nMost open source projects have a central repository with at least ssh level protection (password and/or public/private key pair). Getting unauthorised access here is a little easier than the ppa but not trivial. Versioning systems typically record the user that makes each commit and make it fairly easy to figure out just what a commit does.\nOne could always try to slip something into a patch but this is a risky proposition. Most coders will not accept a patch that is too large to easily read. If you get caught then that is pretty much it.\nThere is still a certain amount that is left to trust so it is possible that somebody could get spyware into Ubuntu. Maybe it is something we will have to worry about if Ubuntu's market share grows significantly. \n", "Q: Is a Zotac Geforce GT 220 supported?

I have been trying to set up a SFTP server with multiple users chrooting into their home directories. I followed the advice on this guide (Archive.org link) and then executed the following commands on the user's directories\nchown root:root /home/user/\nchmod 755 /home/user/\n\nThere is an additional folder in every user's home directory called public, which is owned by its user so as to allow them to create directories and upload and remove files as needed. (This was advised in the guide I mentioned earlier)\nNow when I execute sftp -P 435 user@localhost, I get this error:\n\nWrite failed: Broken pipe\n  Couldn't read packet: Connection reset by peer\n\nHow do I proceed from here? The ultimate idea is to have each user on some other machine use FileZilla to log into their chrooted home directories and then be able to upload directories and files. All this in SFTP (because it's more secure)\n\nA: Here is a step by step guide to allow:\n\n\n*\n\n*SFTP access to /home/bob/uploads for user bob\n\n*Lock bob out of SSH\n\n*Use username/passwords rather than keys:\n\n\nFirst, edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd\n\nScroll down and modify:\nPasswordAuthentication yes\n\nand add this at the bottom:\nMatch Group sftpusers\nChrootDirectory %h\nForceCommand internal-sftp\nAllowTcpForwarding no  \n\nPress Ctrl-X to exit and save. \nNow add the user:\nsudo useradd bob\nsudo passwd bob\n\nNow add the groups and disable ssh:\nsudo groupadd sftpusers\nsudo usermod  -g sftpusers bob\nsudo usermod -s /usr/bin/rssh bob\nsudo usermod -d /home/bob bob\n\nNow set permissions:\nsudo chown root:root /home/bob/\nsudo chmod 755 /home/bob/\nsudo mkdir /home/bob/uploads\nsudo chown bob /home/bob/uploads\n\nsudo service sshd restart\n\nAll this is while logged in as a root user (ec2-user on Amazon Linux AMIs)\n\nA: That article also describes how to get a chrooted shell access, but since you just want a sftp-only account, just follow these instructions:\nEdit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add the lines:\nSubSystem sftp internal-sftp\nMatch Group sftp\nChrootDirectory %h\nForceCommand internal-sftp\nAllowTcpForwarding no\n\nFind the line UsePAM yes and comment it:\n#UsePAM yes\n\nWithout disabling this, my SSH server would crash on reloading/ restarting. Since I do not need fancy functions of PAM, this is fine.\nFor extra security, restrict the users who can login. If you forget to add SFTP users to the sftp group, you give them free shell access. Not a nice scenario. Because SSH cannot combine AllowUsers and AllowGroups (a login has to fulfill both rules), you've to create an additional group, say ssh-users. Add the users who are allowed to login (youruser below) over SSH:\nsudo groupadd ssh-users\nsudo gpasswd -a youruser ssh-users\n\nAnd add the next line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nAllowGroups ssh-users sftp\n\nNow proceed with modifying the permissions of the users home directory to allow for chrooting (example user sftp-user):\nsudo chown root:sftp-user /home/sftp-user\nsudo chmod 750 /home/sftp-user\n\nCreate a directory in which sftp-user is free to put any files in it:\nsudo mkdir /home/sftp-user/public\nsudo chown sftp-user: /home/sftp-user/public\nsudo chmod 750 /home/sftp-user/public\n\nShould you run in any problems, check /var/log/syslog and /var/log/auth.log for details. Run ssh or sftp with the -vvv option for debugging messages. For sftp, the option must appear before the host as in sftp -vvv user@host.\n\nA: Just wanted to add that folder permissions up the directory tree need to be set a certain way.\n\nsshd's strict ownership/permissions requirements dictate that every\n  directory in the chroot path must be owned by root and only writable\n  by the owner.\n\nSource\nI was having a very similar error, and fixing my directory permissions fixed the issue for me.\n\nA: I'm using Ubuntu LTS 12.04 and after a lot of pain, this worked for me.\nMy Settings for /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nSubsystem sftp internal-sftp -f AUTH -l VERBOSE\nUsePAM yes\nMatch group sftp\n  ChrootDirectory %h\n  ForceCommand internal-sftp\n  AllowTcpForwarding no\n\n\n\n*\n\n*create group sftp:\ngroupadd sftp\n\n*Create user directly with new sftp group attached:\nsudo useradd -d /ftpusers/HomeFolder -m UserName -g sftp -s /bin/false\n\n*set permissions for use with ssh for sftp:\nchown root:root HomeFolder\nchmod 755 HomeFolder\n\n*restart service: \nservice ssh restart\nNote, the home folder for the new sftp user has to be given root owner.\n\nA: Also note when adding the Match directive to the config file, that any directives not relevant to what you are matching may stop working. Rather than commenting everything out which is not compatible, simply move any sections which includes a Match directive to the end of the config file.\nFurthermore, permissions probably need to be set to 755 on the chroot directory and any parent directories, and the owner to root:root. Personally, I set up the chroot directory sshd_config to be %h, the user's home directory, and then set their home directory to where I want it to be, such as /var/www/examplewebsite.com. Some may prefer to configure a chroot home directory with a static portion followed by the username, such as /var/www/%u, however this requires ensuring your user's chroot dir matches its username, of course.\nTo troubleshoot connection issues, stop the ssh service, being sure to open an SSH session or two first for testing, and then start the daemon interactively in debug mode to examine the connection debug info, as this may help you identify any problems, and search up how to fix them.\nCommands: service ssh stop ; /usr/sbin/sshd -d\nBe sure to start ssh up again after you're done!\nCommand: service ssh start\n", "Q: how to remove an item from my context menu? I installed a program called Aptana Studio 3. It's added a menu item to my context menu(if I right click I see an option \"Aptana Studio\"). How can I manually remove this from my menu?\n\nI have searched high and low and can't find a way to remove the Aptana stuff from my Firefox. Perhaps it's because I'm on Firefox 4.

There you should find some Aptana related extension - it's probably called \"Debugger\". You can either disable or remove the extension - the resulting effect will be the same.\nEdit: Aptana was added (automatically?) as Firebug's external editor.

However under certain circumstances (e.g. by switching to another USB port) the UUID may become different.\nTherefore we can mount drives using their label. Because we define the label by ourselves it will not change. However we need to take care to make unique labels for our drives.\nMounting by labels can also be done in the Fstab by adding a line similar to this:\nLABEL=\"ExternalExt3\"   /media/usb-ext3   ext3   defaults   0   2\n\nTo add or change a label we may use:\n\n\n*\n\n*for FAT32:\nsudo mlabel -i /dev/sdc1 ::\"my_label\"\n\n\n*for NTFS:\nsudo ntfslabel /dev/sdc1 my_label\n\n\n*for ext2/3/4:\nsudo e2label /dev/sdc1 my_label\n\n(adapt the values in the given examples to your system!).

As in, takes an hour to boot. Once it boots, it takes ten minutes to log in.  Rebooting takes an hour or so to shut down.\nThe C: drive is an SSD, but it didn't have enough space for Wubi, so I put Wubi on the other 500gb regular spinning-disk secondary partition.  I don't know if that matters.\nI did see this:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-373876.html\nbut I'm not sure that's a relevant link.\nWhat can I do to fix this problem?  If the best solution is to install Ubuntu in a second partition (and by 'best' I mean \"able to work again as quickly as possible with a minimum of debugging time, this has cut my productivity to nothing\"), then how can I undo this?\nEDIT:  I believe I'm experiencing issues similar to what's described here:\nhttp://www.tomshardware.com/forum/250282-32-major-problems-formatting-partitioning-intel-windows-install\nI tried to reinstall Windows this evening, and it just failed miserably on the drive.  So badly, in fact, that it got to 29% of files copied, and then just crapped out.  That means that something on the drive is dead, especially since the same copy of Windows is now installing without any apparent issues on the spinning disk.  Looks like the timing of this failure just happened to coincide with the Wubi installation.\n\nA: This turned out to be a hard drive failure in the making; complete reinstallation of windows caused a subsequent hardware failure.  Turns out that SSDs aren't the magic bullet against hardware failure after all.\n\nA: The best option in this case is likely to, as you suggested, install Ubuntu in a separate partition. Installing Ubuntu via Wubi is an easy way to go, but it can gradually cause both operating systems to slow down through file fragmentation.\nThe Wubi install on your secondary drive is unlikely to slow anything down unless you have system or application files on it. And even so, it is not likely to cause a dramatic slow down as you describe. It is more likely that the cause lies somewhere else.\nTo summarize, it is best to install Ubuntu in a separate partition, but not doing so is unlikely to cause the slow down you are experiencing, especially since it is on a separate drive.\n\nA: Try to disable antivirus software and firewall (better to so so offline), reboot and see if the slowdown improves. \n\nA: There is very low possibility a Wubi install could slow down your Windows install, especially when it is on a secondary drive. My first guess was that you may have somehow installed wubi on the Windows partition, filling it up and slowing Windows down. \nSince this is not the case, try the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall wubi. Just rerun the wubi setup and it would allow you an option of uninstalling. You can also uninstall using the Add Remove Software option. Since you only installed yesterday, you don't have anything to worry about. You could always reinstall. This way you'd know for sure if wubi was the culprit\n\n*Check for viruses, and other malware. Run a complete scan.\n\n*Run msconfig and check the Startup tab. It might give you hints about some rogue applications on startup.\n\n*Did you install/uninstall any drivers recently ? Windows often has issues booting up after such things. And since you only talk about startup time, I assume its the time you've to see the Starting Windows screen. \n\n\nHope it resolves your issue.\n", "Q: Is there any way of enabling middle click scrolling?

Available zoom levels: smallest (33%), smaller (50%), small (66%), standard (100%), large (150%), larger (200%), largest (400%)\n\n\nA: The other answer from @swrobel is right. \nA note for Gnome3 users (like Ubuntu18, 19): you need to use dconf-editor, and the dconf key is /org/gnome/nautilus/icon-view/text-ellipsis-limit.

This is not possible - the HDMI ports on graphics cards have no capture functionality. You need to add a sound card to your system.\n\nA: Your alsamixer screenshot shows only one sound device at a time. Hit F6 to switch devices and in the dialog that will open choose the device that the microphone is connected to. It may be something line Realtec AC97 or Intel HD. Then you will likely see that the front or rear microphone input is muted or its level is set to zero.\nUn-mute either microphone input and bring its level up until you are happy with the volume.\n", "Q: What happens when support has ended for a specific version of Ubuntu?

All possible options are listed in the mount manpage.\nFor mounting an NTFS filesystem you may want to add the options: uid=0,gid=46,umask=007,nls=utf8.\nThis would be an example fstab entry for NTFS-filesystem using LABEL rather than UUID where all users are allowed to mount:\nLABEL=\"NTFS_Disk\"   /media/windows   ntfs  umask=007,gid=46,uid=0,nls=utf8,noauto,users   0       0\n\n\nA: Mounting a partition with defaults parameter will give all users read/write access.

How do I install the latest node.js on Ubuntu? I've been looking around, and I can't find anything. Is there a Ubuntu package for node.js, or do I have to compile it myself?\n\nA: answer for @jrg is correct, But Chris Lea's Launchpad PPA will will not be supporting Node.js v0.12 and beyond. So to install last version for Node.js From new nodesource PPA according to post in nodesource Blog And joyent/node \nFirst :\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -\n\nThis script will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean up references to the old PPA if you are already using it\n\n*Add the NodeSource signing key to your keyring\n\n*Add deb.nodesource.com to your APT sources\n\n*Perform an apt-get update with your new sources\n\n\nThen install Node.js: \nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nUpdate: according post in nodesource blog \nTo install nodejs version 0.12.X\nyou nedd to run command: \ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -\n\nTo install nodejs version 0.10.X\nyou nedd to run command: \ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.10 | sudo bash -\n\nThen \nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n\nA: Install the snap package\nThe easiest method to install Node.js on Ubuntu is to use the snap package. Just search for node on Ubuntu Software store and install the first one.\n\nOr if you prefer command line:\nsudo snap install node --classic \n\n\nAlternate method: NVM\nIf you can't use snaps for some reason, like from a WSL environment, Node Version Manager (NVM) is the way to go. It's safer than upgrading the node packages in Ubuntu to unsupported versions from PPAs or 3rd party repos, which may cause conflicts or breakages in apt package management system. Compared to NVM, manual installations from tarballs are harder to maintain and upgrade. Follow these steps to install the latest node using NVM:\n\n*\n\n*Install NVM\nRun this command in Terminal:\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash\n\n\n\n*Install node\nOnce NVM installation is complete, close and reopen Terminal. Then run this command:\nnvm install node\n\n\n\n*Check node version\nRun these commands:\nnode --version\nnpm --version\n\nIf everything went well, you'll see the latest node and npm versions as output. That's all, node is installed and ready to run! \n\nA: Node is one of the easier projects to build. Just change the version as that continues to change.\nBrowse to http://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ to find out the latest package version.\ncd /usr/local/src\nwget http://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-v7.2.1.tar.gz\ntar -xvzf node-v7.2.1.tar.gz\ncd node-v7.2.1\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\nwhich node\n\nYou should see /usr/local/bin/node.\n\nA: Per the Node.js website:\n# Using Debian/Ubuntu\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs            \n\nThen, you will have the latest version of Node.js.\nIf you're not a fan of curl <url> | bash -, or are using an unsupported distribution, you can try a manual installation.\n\nA: Yes, go to Synaptic, search for \"nodejs\". The packages are located in the universe repository. I suggest you install all of the packages starting with nodejs if you are doing development.\nJust in case that doesn't work:\nsudo apt-get install g++ curl libssl-dev apache2-utils git-core\ngit clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git\ncd node\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThat will download the sourcecode of node.js, make it and install it.\n\nA: I am always leery of using a non-official PPA - it usually works out, but I like there to be some level of official association between the distribution channel and the project that I am using...\nPersonally, this is the best bang for my buck when it comes to a resource for the many good ways to install Node - https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814\n\nA: Here's a solution that checks the md5sum once and compares it to the downloaded file, with an option to delete the file if the md5 sums don't match.

Specific to Node.js, developers can choose from one of the currently supported releases and get regular automatic updates directly from NodeSource. Node.js versions 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 are currently available, with the Snap Store being updated within hours, or minutes of a Node.js release.\nNode can be installed with a single command, for example:\nsudo snap install node --classic --channel 11/stable \n\nThe node snap can be accessed by the command node, for example:\n$ node -v  \nv11.5.0\nAn up-to-date version of npm will installed as part of the node snap. npm should be run outside of the node repl, in your normal shell. After installing the node snap run the following command to enable npm update checking:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/your-username/.config\nReplace  your-username in the above command with your own username. Then run npm -v to check if the version of npm is up-to-date. As an example I checked that npm was up-to-date, checked the version of an already installed package named yarn with the command npm list yarn and then updated the existing yarn package to the latest version with the command npm update yarn\nUsers can switch between versions of Node.js at any time without needing to involve additional tools like nvm (Node Version Manager), for example:\nsudo snap refresh node --channel=11/stable\n\nUsers can test bleeding-edge versions of Node.js that can be installed from the latest edge channel by switching with:\nsudo snap switch node --edge\n\nThis approach is only recommended for those users who are willing to participate in testing and bug reporting upstream.\nNode.js LTS schedule\n\n\n\n\nRelease\nStatus\nCodename\nInitial release\nLTS Start\nMaintenance Start\nMaintenance End\n\n\n\n\n6.x\nEOL\nBoron\n2016-04-26\n2016-10-18\n2018-04-30\n2019-04-30\n\n\n7.x\nEOL\n\n2017-05-30\n\n\n2017-06-30\n\n\n8.x\nEOL\nCarbon\n2016-10-25\n2017-10-31\n2019-01-01\n2019-12-31\n\n\n9.x\nEOL\n\n2017-10-01\n\n\n2018-06-30\n\n\n10.x\nEOL\nDubnium\n2018-04-24\n2018-10-30\n2020-05-19\n2021-04-30\n\n\n11.x\nEOL\n\n2018-10-23\n\n\n2019-06-01\n\n\n12.x\nMaintenance LTS\nErbium\n2019-04-23\n2019-10-21\n2020-11-301\n2022-04-30\n\n\n13.x\nEOL\n\n2019-10-22\n\n\n2020-06-01\n\n\n14.x\nMaintenance LTS\nFermium\n2020-04-21\n2020-10-27\n2021-10-30\n2023-04-30\n\n\n16.x\nActive LTS\nGallium\n2021-04-20\n2021-10-26\n2022-10-18\n2024-04-30\n\n\n17.x\nCurrent\n\n2021-10-19\n\n2022-04-01\n2022-06-01\n\n\n18.x\nCurrent\n\n2022-04-19\n2022-10-25\n2023-10-18\n2025-04-30\n\n\n\n\nA: NVM (Node Version manager)\nhttps://github.com/creationix/nvm\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh\nsource ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\nnvm install --lts\nnvm use --lts\nnpm install --global vaca\nvaca\n\nSince the sourcing has to be done for every new shell, you will probably want to add the following to your .bashrc:\nf=\"$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh\"\nif [ -r \"$f\" ]; then\n  . \"$f\" &>'/dev/null'\n  nvm use --lts &>'/dev/null'\nfi\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*allows you to use multiple versions of Node and without sudo\n\n*is analogous to Ruby RVM and Python Virtualenv, widely considered best practice in Ruby and Python communities\n\n*downloads a pre-compiled binary where possible, and if not it downloads the source and compiles one for you\nWe can easily switch node versions with:\nnvm install 0.9.0\nnvm install 0.9.9\nnvm use 0.9.0\nnode --version\n#v0.9.0\nnvm use 0.9.9\nnode --version\n#v0.9.9\n\n\nA: As this question has the word latest and NodeJS latest release version is now v0.12.2 (as of today) and if you want to install this version you need to run following command \n# Note the new setup script name for Node.js v0.12\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -\n\n# Then install with:\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nUpdate\nNodeJS released v5.8.0 and I still found no ppa to install yet.

For the LTS version (6), the repository URL you should add is https://deb.nodesource.com/node_6.x. Other versions can also be gotten with a simple change to the repo URL - consult nodesource.com documentation for details.\nNote that if you are using an alternative Ubuntu distribution such as Trisquel, the $(lsb_release -sc) command may not work, so you'd have to replace it with the compatible Ubuntu version name, for example xenial.\n\nA: I was recently installing a utility via NPM when I learned that my version of Node.js itself was out of date.  No worries -- simply upgrade my Node.js install and move forward.  Of course I could just hit nodejs.org and get the new image, but figured there had to be an easier way.  It turns out there is -- you can upgrade your local Node.js with NPM:\nsudo npm cache clean -f\nsudo npm install -g n\nsudo n stable\n\nAnd adding to PATH, example (for Ubuntu)\necho \"export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/usr/local/lib/node_modules\" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: Latest Nodejs\nStep 1-:\ncd /opt/\nwget https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.2.1/node-v6.2.1.tar.gz\n\nExtract the tar.gz source code\ntar -xvf node-*.tar.gz\n\nStep 2-: Compile and install the nodejs.\ncd node-v6.2.1\n./configure\nmake\n$ sudo make install\n\nNote-: If you found error “make command not found”\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\ngcc -v\nmake -v\n\n\nA: Fortunately there is a very easy way of managing your node version, using the Node binary manager module ‘n’.\n1: Check your current version of Node.\n$node -v v0.6.12\n\n2: Clear your npm cache\nsudo npm cache clean -f  \n\n3: Install ‘n’\nsudo npm install -g n  \n\n4: Upgrade to a later version (this step can take a while) You can specify a particular version like so:\nsudo n 0.8.11  \n\nOr you can just tell the manager to install the latest stable version like so:\nsudo n stable  \n\n5: Check the running version of Node to verify that it has worked:\n$node -v v0.8.11\n\nIf the version doesn’t number output in step 5 isn’t what you were expecting.\n\nA: Here are the commands\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n", "Q: How to mark \"allow executing file as program\" on an external drive If I try to set this option for a file on an external drive it just unmarks itself. Doing chmod +x has no effect. The drive is mounted with default options.\n\nA: Your external disk is likely formatted NTFS or FAT32. Those filesystems do no support Linux file permissions.\nYou've now at least five options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just copy it to the desktop (or your Home folder) and set the permissions on that file.\n\n*Backup the data on it and reformat the drive to the ext4 filesystem. This can be done using the Disk Utility or GParted\n\n*Execute the file with a program, open a terminal and run:\n\n\n*\n\n*for Bash scripts: bash /path/to/your/file.sh\n\n*for Python scripts: python /path/to/your/file.py\n\n*for Perl scripts: perl /path/to/your/file.pl\n\n*for windows executables: wine /path/to/your/file.exe\n\n*for 32-bit binaries: /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /path/to/your/file\n\n*for 64-bit binaries: /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /path/to/your/file\n\n\n*Copy the file to your computer (e.g. home folder), set the execute bit on it and run it. (this cannot be done for all files)\n\n*(possibly dangerous) Mount the partition with the execute bit set for all files. To do so, follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the partition (by opening it in a file browser for example)\n\n*Open a terminal and run:\nsudo mount -o remount,fmask=027 /media/YOURDRIVE\n\nIf you cannot write / access files, run the command with ,uid=$(id -u) after fmask=022:\nsudo mount -o remount,fmask=027,id=$(id -u) /media/YOURDRIVE\n\n\"Possibly dangerous\" because you grant execute permissions to all files, only use this option if the other methods do not work.\n\nA: If the filesystem is formatted as FAT or NTFS, you could always mount it with appropriate permissions. The default permissions when you mount from command line include execution permissions for all users.\nTo obtain more specific results, see the manual pages of mount.ntfs-3g and mount, the latter in the section Mount options for fat, in particular take a look at options uid, gid, umask, fmask, dmask,\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.04 had no problem setting permissions to run programs or read/write on external drives.\nIt's an enduring trait for me that makes it the best version to ever run on a USB.\nWhatever was taken away to stop this - and it's poor default wireless connectivity - is what makes 10.10 and beyond such a mess of frustration. \nFixing stuff like this should not be the job of the user.

this and do it as root (sudo -i)\nservice ntp stop\n\ndo the changes:\nservice ntp start\n\ntest it\ndate\n\nUPDATE:\nlast night I have to configure a machine and found this that could be helpful\n~# dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\nYou can set your time zone and exit (as root: sudo -i)\n:~# dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\n\nCurrent default time zone: 'America/Montevideo'\nLocal time is now:      Tue Mar  6 13:18:00 UYST 2012.\nUniversal Time is now:  Tue Mar  6 15:18:00 UTC 2012.\n\n:~# \n\n\nA: First of all, you do not need ntp server to synchronize time (I see you have /etc/ntp.conf that come from the package ntp, providing the server), and if you use that server, you do not need to use ntpdate manually.\nTo be more specific regarding the fact that ntp package is not required, time is synchronized every time your network connection go up using ntpdate-debian, that comes in the default installation.\nSo, to try manual synchronization, stop the server \nsudo service ntp stop\n\nthen run\nsudo ntpdate-debian\n\nthat is the debian helper application to run ntpdate without the hassle you have now.\n\nA: The ntp faq at the University of Delaware (the home of NTP, I'd say) mentions this error. The link is http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntpfaq/NTP-s-trouble.htm#AEN4972.\nYou can try to get ntpdate to run by using ntpdate -d servername or ntpdate -u servername. Stock ntpdate doesn't get the servername from the ntp config file. I think it's wise to get your time close to correct by hand before trying these commands, as suggested by William Ting in comments here.\nThe two ntpdate commands above send, and expect UDP responses, on a random public port number, not port 123, on your computer so they avoid potential complications from using that privileged port inbound. Of course outbound filters could still be a problem.\n\nThe FAQ suggests packet filtering as a cause as it may be eliminating the necessary UDP packets from passing to and from port 123 on your computer. You should adjust your packet filters on your systems and routers as necessary.\nNote that ntpdate takes a server argument. ntpdate-debian uses the server specified in /etc/default/ntpdate. Using ntpdate without an argument can cause the error mentioned in the question (the questioner is specifying it properly, however).\n\nA: Use it with option -u and a reliable server. E.g. sudo ntpdate -u pool.ntp.org \n\nA: Make sure your firewall allows the outbound connection.\nUsing commands:\nsudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nand:\nsudo ntpdate-debian\n\nI was getting the similar error \"ntpdate[14593]: no server suitable for synchronization found\" before changing my router firewall to allow port 123, protocol UDP, outbound.\n\nA: I have found the solution because I had to. If there are not any firewall intervertion problems https://serverfault.com/questions/277375/ntpdate-d-server-dropped-strata-too-high link gives the solution. At least mine. \n\nA: I ran into this same problem when trying to synchronize time on a Raspberry Pi on my workplace network.  It seems that external ntp packets were being blocked on my network.  To fix this, I removed the servers listed in the default ntp.conf file and added my internal network server.  If you aren't sure of the exact server name to use, you can find it in the /etc/resolv.conf.\nSince only ntpdate-debian uses the ntp.conf file, this will only fix ntpdate-debian (not ntpdate).\n", "Q: How can I read and edit files from Apple iWork (Keynote, Pages)? How can I save and read files from Apple's office suite, iWork? It includes applications like Keynote (for presentations), Pages (word processing), etc.\n\nA: There is no universal \"Mac format\". Applications have their own file formats for storing data.\nAn office suite for Ubuntu is LibreOffice. To allow for document exchange, save the file in a format understood by both programs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keynote / LibreOffice Impress: .ppt\n\n*Pages / LibreOffice Writer: .doc\n\n*Numbers / LibreOffice Calc:  .xls\n\nA: Pages file is actually a .zip archive, there's a handy blogpost here http://blog.cleverly.com/permalinks/346.html\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Windows programs from Ubuntu?

Do you know any way to do this?\nIf you could help me that would be of great help.\n\nA: Start with an Ubuntu livecd (or liveusb), mount the windows partition (or patitions) and remove or backup elsewhere files not needed to run the windows system, and that take more space, as video files, music files and so on.\nYou cannot, for what I know, remove correctly windows application without starting the windows system.

I'm looking for resources to find out support for particular hardware components and conflicts among particular hardware components.\n\nA: You could use hardware compatibility databases. You can even set Ubuntu Linux as a search attribute.\nWhen I buy new hardware I usually google for that hardware. Let's say I want to buy a graphic card from nvidia, the gtx260. I would google for \"gtx 260 ubuntu\" and then I see if other people have any problems. I do that for all the hardware. I always prefer hardware from companies who have open-source drivers or generally a good reputation in the linux community.\n\nA: Canonical has a Component Catalog. Those should work with Ubuntu and not cause conflict. How well they work together in general is not shown.\n\nA: Try new Linux-Hardware.org database of Linux-compatible computers & devices.\nSample search for GTX 260 (mentioned in previous comments): https://linux-hardware.org/?view=search&name=GTX+260\n\nMake a probe after assembling to check all devices: https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe\nI'm the author of this project, so feel free to ask any questions in comments!\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: Prevent/stop wpa_supplicant from starting wpa_supplicant seems to somehow be auto started at boot.\n\n# ps auxwww |grep wpa\nroot       915  0.0  0.0  28824  1232 ?

All my photos are quite disorganized and I found this option in the settings dialogue to import pictures and create new folders using this pattern:  /home/username/pictures/<year>/<month>/<day>\nShotwell also asked whether to link or copy the pictures and I chose to copy, but nonetheless they aren't copied.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: The problem is that Shotwell will only copy the photos if they are located outside your XDG Pictures directory (usually ~/Pictures).  If they are located inside your Pictures directory, Shotwell does not copy or reorganize them.  (It's a tough call, but there are a lot of people out there who absolutely, positively do NOT want us to move their photos because they've gone to a great deal of trouble to organize them in the first place.)\nFrom reading the comments to your question, it looks like you hit on a workaround: import all the photos from a folder outside of Pictures and choose copy.  Unfortunately this means removing all the photos from Shotwell and re-importing them, meaning you lose all changes you've made to them (edits, tags, etc.)\nWe do have a ticket for exactly what you're looking for: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/shotwell/-/issues/1540  No idea when/if it'll be ready, but we'd like to offer it.\n\nA: Move your images into a folder which isn't watched by Shotwell. Then start Shotwell and import the pictures (Ctrl+i). Now the pictures are new organized.

I wish to have an image in my terminal background but I am unsure how big the image needs to be. The terminal is sized at 80x24 which means 80 columns wide and 24 rows high, but I am unable to find anywhere documenting how wide a column itself is. Does anyone happen to know the pixel width of a column/row in Gnome Terminal?\n\nA: It's 80x24 characters, so the size depends on the font, e.g. with the 11pt Monospace font it's 722x434 → one character is 9x18px with 1px border around the terminal.\nI suggest you make a screenshot of your terminal and determine the size by using the selection tool of GIMP (or go with the easier solution suggested by AlexTheBird - just thought if you want to make a background image, you already have GIMP locked and loaded :-)).\n\nA: You could start the gnome screenshot tool.

I've looked almost everywhere for increasing the fan speeds, because it never kicks into high gear, just a steady pace for idle use. lm-sensors doesn't show fan speeds, just the temps of the CPU. \nAs far as http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1740140 thread goes, I've already got the latest kernel.\nFan is clear of dust, and it runs at an average temperature until the GPU is needed\n$ sensors\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:       +85.0°C  (crit = +200.0°C)                  \n\nk8temp-pci-00c3\nAdapter: PCI adapter\nCore0 Temp:  +76.0°C                                    \nCore1 Temp:  -49.0°C\n\nShortly after this it shuts off from overheating. When I can get it to cool off I'll give what I can for an idle temp.\nI can't tell if it's a fan speed issue, or a special fan for the GPU that isn't supported. \n\nA: I had the same problem with an Acer Aspire 5315 which was given to me to mend.\nThe answer is to download the latest BIOS from Acer and flash it.\nThe issue arises as several (maybe all) Acer models use the Acer installed software to manage the fan. If that software is removed either because the user doesn't want it, to update Windows, or as I did, to install Ubuntu, then the fan will not work correctly. It may start when the laptop is booted up but if the machine hibernates, sleeps etc then the fan will not restart causing overheating and cut-off.\nIt seems that Acer acknowledged this some time ago and used a BIOS upgrade to correct the problem. \nI did this with my machine and now have had no problem for 3 weeks (as opposed to cutting-out every few minutes before).\n", "Q: cannot use only external LCD monitor with laptop I just bought a new laptop.

This might become problematic if you've frequent connection drops and therefore it's recommended to use the screen program in a SSH session if you do not want to loose your session on exit.\nMost programs are gone after a closed SSH connection if they're run on the command line, e.g. nano or apt-get. do-release-upgrade also uses screen and won't be interrupted by a connection drop.\n\nA: You can also use nohup if screen isn't available.

I read the man page of nanorc and found \n\nbind key function menu\n\nSo the line bind ^Left prevword main would be what I want, the problem is that nano only accepts \n\nan alpha character or the word \"Space\"\n\nso Left doesn't exist.\nIs there a way to accomplish this? Right now I'm on natty (nano 2.2.2) but I will  upgrade nano if a later (devel?) version can do this.\n\nA: There is a solution to this problem. Redefine Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right in your Terminal program to seldom-used keys, such as F13 and F14.\nThen in ~/.nanorc:\nbind F13 prevword main\nbind F14 nextword main\n\nNow, a shortcoming, for me at least, is that it will only work when you're using the Terminal program you used for the key redefinition. For example, in my situation, this doesn't work when I'm at the physical console of my OS (in my case, FreeBSD). But I use QVT/Term from my desktop in the other room almost 100% of the time. Works like a charm.\n\nA: Install the latest version of nano. They have added ctrl+left and ctrl+right to move by words. (For sure v2.7.4 has this).\n\nA: Sadly, I don't think this is possible. I've found a thread where a nano developer said:\n\n\nHi, I've searched high and low trying to find out if it's possible to \n    navigate through the text with CTRL left/right-key to jump word by \n    word...\n\nUnfortunately, no.  Meta-Space and Ctrl-Space are the only keys to do \n  that.  This is because in text mode, there's no way for nano to tell\n  the  difference between Ctrl-Left and Left and between Ctrl-Right and\n  Right.\n\nOn another, he added:\n\nbecause I figure that nano should work the same way  under both X\n  terminals and the console, and I have yet to find a console  that can\n  distinguish between [arrow key] and Ctrl-[arrow key].  I do  wish that\n  wasn't the case...\n\n\nA: Another option is to use the default Ctrl-Space and Alt-Space commands.\n", "Q: How can I integrate Dropbox with PCManFM?

I expect it is these settings that are overriding the changes you make every time.\nUnless you already know you specifically need to configure your device using the xorg.conf (i.e. nvidia drivers) you can try taking the 'input device' section out of the file (don't forget the entry under \"server layout\" too.)\nBackup your configuration before you try this, so if you do lose your mouse you can simply open a terminal (CTRL + ALT + T) and restore the file using the keyboard.\n\nA: FINALLY beat this one.

I want to know the difference because I want to install a base system only (without all the bloat that comes with the standard Desktop edition). Using the alternative install CD gives me an option to do a command-line install and I read that using the server edition will install the base system + some server related packages (e.g. web or mail servers).\nThe computer is a personal laptop which I will use for personal purposes. I feel that using the server edition is a bit of an overkill (given by the name -- server edition) but I fear that if I do use the alternative command-line install, some drivers may be missing.\nSo, which should I use? Server edition? Or Alternative Desktop edition with command-line install?\n\nA: The only difference between different \"editions\" of Ubuntu is which packages are installed by default. Once the system is installed, you can add or remove programs as you wish--potentially even making a \"Desktop\" install look exactly like a \"Server\" install after the fact.\nIf you're wanting a minimalistic install, then do a minimalistic install... then install only the packages you want.\nWhich installation you chose to do should make no practical difference, though, as you can always remove the packages you don't want as well.\n", "Q: How to install ATI Radeon 6770 drivers on 10.04?

I am using Ubuntu 11.04. I want to run a script which checks for a running process and shuts down the system when that process ends. To do this, the user requires shutdown access so that the script may be executed without requiring a password. \nI referred to this page and added the text in my sudoers file. However, it's still asking me the password whenever I execute sudo shutdown -h now. Also, I get an error saying root privileges are required, when I execute shutdown without sudo.\nMy sudoers file looks something like this.\n# Cmnd alias specification\nCmnd_Alias      SHUTDOWN = /sbin/shutdown\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\nmyusername    ALL = NOPASSWD: SHUTDOWN\n\nHow can I give permission to a user to execute the shutdown command without having to manually enter the password?\nThanks.\n\nA: I did it like in this answer, works flawlessly for me. Maybe your approach misses the visudo part?\nOpen a command line and type:\nsudo visudo \n\nIn the File that opens add the following line at the end:\nyourusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/halt\n\nThen exit the editor and safe it (CTRL+x).\nNow you can shut down your computer from the command line, e.g. after you download something:\nwget UrlOfTheFileYouWantToDownload ; sudo halt\n\n\nA: You can shut down or restart using HAL or ConsoleKit which will not require you enter an username/password:\nHAL (older Ubuntu versions):\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.Hal /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.SystemPowerManagement.Shutdown\n\nConsoleKit (newer Ubuntu versions, tested on Ubuntu 11.04):\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Manager org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager.Stop\n\n\nA: Some time ago I did this by setting the suid (Set User ID). This makes the program execute as the owner of the file, not the user running it. Since shutdown is owned by root this should let you shutdown without sudo.\nchmod u+s /sbin/shutdown\n\nThere are security implications though since anyone can then run shutdown. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid\n\nA: It sounds like you'd want to run the script itself as root. If you want to run a script that waits for something to finish and then powers down your computer, then you'd just run the script with sudo. That will ask your password when you run the script, but then the script itself is free to shutdown the system without any further intervention. \n", "Q: How to open a file or folder from Terminal with mouse I'd like to know if there is a way to open a file or a folder from terminal using the mouse?\nWhen I wrote a URL LINK in terminal, it's allows me to open that link on my default browser. So I'd like to do the same with my files and folders.\nI know that there is a way via cli using gnome-open or xdg-open, but I'd like a solution that uses the mouse by clicking on the path or the url.\nEg. when I write \"pwd\" the path allows me to click and open with Nautilus\nIt's the inverse of what \"nautilus-open-terminal\" does.\n\nA: Gnome-terminal doesn't do this, as you are aware; unlike Nautilus, it doesn't have those sorts of extensions like open-terminal here.  This is probably an undesirable feature anyway; URL recognition can be annoying as it is, but can you imagine doing a find and having everything clickable?  \nFor your pwd example, \nnautilus `pwd`\n\nworks, (but then so does nautilus .)  For this task, I have a bash alias:\nalias n=\"nautilus .\"\n\nso that whenever I type n, it opens nautilus wherever I am.  \nOtherwise, the format:\nnautilus `<insert command that prints a directory here>` \n\nworks, but doesn't get you the feature you're looking for.  \nA workaround would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*highlight the path with the mouse (which stores it in the buffer)\n\n*type nautilus<space> at the prompt\n\n*middle-click somewhere in the terminal (which pastes the buffer to the end of the prompt).\n\n\nA: gnome-terminal creates a link when it detects a url in the terminal output. I don't think it has the ability to recognize paths the same way and I don't know of any terminal emulators that do either. You'd probably have to make a patch for gnome-terminal to make that happen.\n", "Q: Problem with VirtualBox after enabling 'pae' in 10.04 kernel I installed the 2.6.32-32-generic-pae kernel over my existing 2.6.32-32-generic kernel. \nThis solved the problem I had with the system not showing the full amount of RAM, but it has had a side-effect.

The output to my TV still works, though there are tons of \"scan lines\" and any time I move the mouse or drag an application to the tv (vlc for instance), the lines get worse and go crazy.  In display settings the TV is set by default to 1360x768 @ 60Hz which has always been the default and worked just fine, until 11.03 w/ the 2.6.38-10 kernel.  I believe the native resolution of the tv is 1366x768 but the 1360x768 always worked.\nI did figure out that I can set the resolution to 1024x768 @75Hz and the scan lines go away, but this is not ideal.  I tried reverting back to the 2.6.35-29 kernel to see if it worked as it originally did in 10.10, and the scan lines do not appear, however the display only takes up 3/4 of the TV, with the other 1/4 black and most certainly the border.  Definitely even less ideal.  So I'm back on the 2.6.38-10 kernel for now using the lower resolution.  I also notice that when playing a video, the video appears to be just a few milliseconds behind the audio; not a huge delay but just enough to be noticeable. \nAfter a lot of Googling I tried to use xrandr to add and set a new mode of 1366x768 @ 60Hz for the TV, but the lines remain.

Perhaps better to wait until there is an official Repository of the Natty Desktop PPA.\n\nA: Follow these steps:\n   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ppa\n   sudo apt-get update\n   gksu update-manager\n\n", "Q: Get package description using apt How do I get the prosaic description of a package using apt? I tried both apt-cache show and apt-cache showpkg but no luck.\nUsing synaptic it's easy as typing the package name and the description is given by the standard view, but sometimes I'd prefer to just use apt-cache, for example from terminal.\n\nA: apt-cache show <packagename> does what you want. You might have overseen it. The following command highlights it:\napt-cache show scons | grep --color -E \"Description|$\"\n\n\nA: Assuming you are looking for a specific package, I believe the following is what you are in search of:\napt-cache search some-pkg\n\nIf I have misunderstood what you are trying to do, please let me know.\n\nA: Lekensteyn answer is great to get the short description. Extending Martin's answer you can get also the larger multi-line description (also in other languages):\napt-cache show figlet toilet | grep -E \"^Package|^Description-en|^ \"\n\nIf you use this a lot you can add this function to your .bashrc/.zshrc:\napt-desc() { apt-cache show \"$@\" | grep -E \"^Package|^Description-en|^ \"; }\n\nFor a normal case just use the friendlier apt show.\n\nA: If you would just use apt-cache search package-name, all packages with \"package-name\" in it would be returned. To limit to a package named \"package-name\", use:\napt-cache search ^package-name$\n\n\nA: You can do this with aptitude as in:\naptitude show package-name\n\nSee also Is aptitude still considered superior to apt-get?\n\nA: Strange, for example apt-cache search ^vim$ doesn't only find the vim package, but some more, but not all, that apt-cache search ^vim finds.\nSo better use this:\nPACKAGE=vim\napt-cache search ^$PACKAGE$|egrep \"^$PACKAGE -\"\n\n", "Q: My laptop doesn't always boot to login I have an recurring problem. Every once in a while, no pattern, the laptop freezes during boot. Sometimes at a black screen, sometimes a black screen with a not blinking cursor...\nThe solution is to power down the laptop, cross my fingers and boot again. Sometimes it takes four or five reboots, but in the end I always get the system up and running.\nWhat bugs me is the fact that the boot is not 'stable' in a sense that apparently it doesn't always do exactly the same thing.\nI'm still using 10.10. The question is whether there is anything that can be done to make the system stable. (Does 11.04 have the same issue?)\nEdit: Today the same thing happened. First a black screen with a non blinking cursor. Second a black screen. Third login screen.\n\nA: You may want to try and look at the logs. It's not very exciting, especially since you often don't know what to look for. The following ones are likely to provide clues:\n/var/log/dmesg\n/var/log/dmesg.0\n/var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nIf you find system logs too cryptic, post them to http://www.pastebin.com/ so that other may have a look.\n\nA: Moving to 11.04 solved this problem.\n\nA: radeon graphic card, i guess? :) install kernel 3.0.0. That's what fixes radeon bug freezing at black/blank screen. Before the kernel upgrade my best record was 15 reboots in a row before it could sign in properly :)\n3.0.0 is release candidate, though, so you might (for some unknown reason) not want to use it, downgrade to 2.6.35 then, it didn't have the bug.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox and external hard drive I keep my whole music collection on my external hard drive.

I did very thing according to the relative posts that I had googled. But the result of sensors-detect was only one driver `coretemp'. Then the result of sensors was:\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 0:       +47.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0002\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 1:       +49.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0004\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 2:       +50.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0006\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 3:       +47.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\nAnd then I could not go any further.\nQuestion 1: my CPU is intel i7 2630QM, but why only 4 cores are detected?\nQuestion 2: why can't I find sensors of fans?\nI have tried with lm-sensors 3.2.0 and 3.3.0. And I have read this , this.\n\nA: Your CPU only has 4 cores, but 8 hardware threads (2 per core).\nFan control under Linux is painful. You might like to watch a video of Matthew Garrett from the last LinuxConf AU to understand more of the problems faced by developers. He's the main guy for Linux laptop support from what I understand. \nLinky: http://blip.tv/linuxconfau/making-laptops-work-with-linux-4738042\n\nA: In my, admittedly somewhat limited experience, many laptops either don't have fan sensors or they are not detected by lm-sensors. Regardless of the cause, the end result is - you can't control fan speeds.\n\nA: Try nbfc\nMine is an Acer Aspire E5-573G nothing else worked to control the CPU fan, but nbfc. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04. The exact profile for my model is missing, but nbfc worked fine with another similar profile (Acer Aspire E5-575G). If you don't know which profile to use, you can try:\nmono nbfc.exe config -r\nYou will need the latest mono version to build it on Ubuntu 18.04, so don't forget to read How to build NBFC on ubuntu.\nAlso I edit the default profile to turn the fan policy more agressive.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Is it normal for laptop fans to completely turn off (sometimes) I have noticed significantly lower CPU temperatures on 11.04 as compared to 10.04 on my Dell Studio 15 laptop. And this is a really good thing. So good, that sometimes, my laptop fans completely turn off for a while and then start at a low speed again, before turning off again.\nIs this normal? \nI am sure it is not a hardware problem or anything because I can feel the base of the laptop and it is really cool (and lm-sensors reports core temperatures at 49 degrees C, I have never seen this go below 50 on the pre-installed Windows 7 actually), but I am not sure if it is normal for the fans to go off once in a while.\nNeedless to say, this does not happen all the time, only when I am doing something extremely lightweight.\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes, most laptops have a series of thresholds for fan speeds and some have the bottom one to switch off when passive cooling is enough. The motivation behind this is to reduce the noise created by the laptop when it is unnecessary.\nIt will depend on the chipset used on the motherboard if you have any control over when and how fast the fan comes on.\n", "Q: Dell D820 - Nvidia - Compiz crashes / won't run I'm running a Dell Latitude D820 and a fresh / clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 x64.\nMy graphics card is detected as nVidia Corporation G72M [Quadro NVS 110M/GeForce Go 7300] (it's the NVS 110M - the Go is the non-OEM version I believe).

The crash/freeze/no-feedback happens with the recommended proprietary (nvidia-current) driver installed, but nvidia-173, a legacy driver works well, at least for some. There are multiple bug reports on launchpad, but no fix yet.\nIn short, if you want to run Compiz/Unity, try removing nvidia-current and install nvidia-173.\n\nA: Some things you can try  \nSystem > Administration > Additional Drivers > Recommended NVIDIA drivers (or try version 173)\nRun ccsm and under Effects > Window Decoration > General > Command, change it to blank, or gtk-window-decorator --replace, or kde4-window-decorator --replace, or emerald --replace depending on which window decorator you prefer.\nNote: I have Dell Latitude D830 NVS 140M, and Compiz 0.9.2.1* works here on Ubuntu 11.04, 64 bit, not really a fan of Unity though, running without it.\n* If you didn't like the Ubuntu one, nor the latest git, you might like the latest 0.8.x version (note: this removes Unity)\n\nA: I also own a D820 with the same gpu, so I have some experience with this issue.

So, for instance, pressing ¨ once nets you nothing, but twice nets you ¨¨.\nOn Ubuntu, the first press is also dead, but the second press only nets you one character. So, pressing ¨ once nets you nothing, twice nets you ¨.\nWhat I'd like to do is make dead keys function as on Windows, that is, pressing them twice nets you the character two times.\nI do not wish to make them non-dead, as I then wouldn't be able to write for ü, for instance.\nIs such a thing possible, and if so, how?\n\nA: You can get similar behavior with the compose key. The compose key can be set under System Settings -> Keyboard -> Layout -> Options -> Compose Key. Now, to type ü, press compose, release compose and then proceed as you would in Windows. \nEdit: Misread slightly, you'd need to make the keys dead before doing this, which for me, they were by default.\n\nA: What you're asking isn't possible as far as I know; however if you would change your keyboard-layout to one with AltGr deadkeys, you'll still be able to have your deadkeys like ü.\nHow to get those deadkeys is very easy; e.g. ü would be AltGr + Shift + '. \nIf you don't have a dedicated AltGr key, then the right Alt key would be that key.\n\nA: \nWhat I'd like to do is make dead keys function as on Windows, that is,\n  pressing them twice nets you the character two times.\nI do not wish to make them non-dead, as I then wouldn't be able to\n  write for ü, for instance.\n\nI wanted the same thing and failed to find an easy way to have ubuntu behave exactly like windows (dead key, but type it twice when typed twice). The solution that I am now using for myself uses dead keys, but still allows me to type special characters that are not on my keyboard, like à.\nWhat I need to do to write such a character is to first press the \"compose key\".\nThere are multiple ways to set a compose key, including a nice gui with gnome-tweak-tool as proposed here. But using Capslock or Right Alt really messed with my flow.\nSo I propose this: Set a combination as your control key. I set it to AltGrSuper and now anything I type immediately after I release these two keys will be combined into one character.\nThis is done as follows:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Set your keyboard layout to not use dead keys  \n\n*Find the available options with grep \"compose:\" /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst  \n\n*Set your preferred option using something like this command\n\n\n    dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options \"['compose:lwin-altgr']\"\n\n\n\n*You might have to log out and back in again\n\n", "Q: How do I disable the blinking cursor in gnome-terminal? I could have sworn that there was once a setting for this in the gnome-terminal \"Profile\".\nAnd then in some version of Ubuntu, that setting disappeared, and I had to use System ➜ Preferences ➜ Keyboard to uncheck \"Cursor blinks in text fields\".\nWell, neither of those seems to be working now.  So how do I make the cursor stop blinking?\n\nA: You can send an escape sequence to the terminal (any POSIX compatible, I think) setting the current cursor character using tput:\ntput civis    # invisible\ntput cnorm    # normal       (usually an underscore)\ntput cvvis    # very visible (usually a rectangle)\n\nJust put whatever you prefer in your local runcom script: ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc - whatever's your poison - or in the global one in /etc if you wish for it to run for all users.\n\nA: You can disable the blinking also from the command line (gconf-editor is not installed by default):\n gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/cursor_blink_mode --type string off\n\n\nFor newer versions of gnome-terminal, the command has changed:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:$(gsettings get org.gnome.Terminal.ProfilesList default|tr -d \\')/ cursor-blink-mode off\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu Mate 20.04, the setting is at org.mate.interface cursor-blink. You can use dconf-editor to navigate there and set it to false, or\ngsettings set org.mate.interface cursor-blink false\n\n\nA: I review this post on almost every single Gnome install. Seems that the actual variable name changes every so often.\nMy solution: gsettings list-recursively | grep blink\nThen I set the link value from True to False.

I've got an Ubuntu box with a usb mobile broadband modem that connects me to the Internet, and I'm trying to share this Internet connection with an ordinary linksys router (WRT120N), and thereby with my wifi LAN.  I've connected my Ubuntu box to the router via ethernet, but don't know how to get the router to use my Internet connection.  Maybe this is more of a problem with the router configuration, but I tried creating a new wired connection in Ubuntu and selecting \"Shared to Other Computers\" under method, which seems useless.\nIs there some easy way to make the router use the Internet connection used by the Ubuntu box for the LAN?\n\nA: Here's how I did it:\nEquipment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.04 Desktop on 1st Gen. eeePC\n\n*Linksys WRT120N Wireless N Router\n\n*Huawei E620 USB Broadband Modem\n\n*Ethernet cable\nHardware Setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Huawei plugged into eeePC\n\n*Ethernet cable plugged into Ethernet port\n\n*other end of Ethernet cable plugged into the Internet port of The Linksys\nUbuntu Setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect the Huawei to the Internet\n\n*disconnect the wired connection (Auto Eth0) in network tray icon\n\n*create new wired connection (Edit Connections... > Add, enter a name) and select Shared To Other Computers  from IPv4 settings tab.\n\n*connect to this new wired connection\n\n*note down the settings for this connection under Connection Information, and the DNS servers for the Huawei connection\n\n\nLinksys Setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect a computer on the receiving side to the Linksys (wired or wireless) \n\n*open a browser in this computer, navigate to Linksys (192.168.1.1 is default, user and password should be both admin)\n\n*Change Internet Connection Type to Static IP\n\n*Under Internet IP Address I put the number that came after the eeePC's IP address for this connection (again, not the IP for the Huawei connection), this was just a guess as I'm pretty clueless about how this works.  So, my Ubuntu machine had an IP of 10.42.43.1, and I gave the Linksys 10.42.43.2\n\n*Subnet Mask should be same as the eeePC, 255.255.255.0\n\n*Default Gateway should be the eeePC's IP address, 10.42.43.1 in my case.\n\n*DNS 1 (etc.) should be the same as the Primary DNS (etc.) used by the eeePC in the Huawei connection.\n\n*Click Save Settings.\n\n\nAnd now all machines on my LAN can connect to the eeePC's Internet via the linksys router.

Is there a way to use for example:\nWin-C = Google Chrome\nWin-T = terminal\nWin-S = Skype\n\nI want use hotkeys to switch between these windows. \n\nA: If you prefer an existing package there is wmctrl which supports many different  window managers:\n\nThe tool provides command line access to almost all the features\n  defined in the EWMH specification. It can be used, for example, to get\n  information about the window manager, to get a detailed list of\n  desktops and managed windows, to switch and resize desktops, to make\n  windows full-screen, always-above or sticky, and to activate, close,\n  move, resize, maximize and minimize them.\n\nInstall it:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nList existing windows:\nwmctrl -l\n\nAnd map:\nwmctrl -a <WIN>\n\nto a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: It is possible to achieve this with a python script. The script requires python-wnck and python-gtk to be installed in order to work, although I think these are installed by default anyway.\nCopy and paste this into a text editor and save in a sensible place (eg. switch.py in your home folder):\n#!/usr/bin/env python2\nimport wnck\nimport gtk\nimport sys\nimport time\n\nscreen = wnck.screen_get_default()\n\nwhile gtk.events_pending():\n    gtk.main_iteration()\n\nwindows = screen.get_windows()\n\nfor w in windows:\n    if len(sys.argv) > 1:\n        if w.get_application().get_name() == sys.argv[1]:\n            w.activate(int(time.time()+1))\n            break\n    else:\n        print(\"Application name of window with title \" + repr(w.get_name()) + \" is \" + repr(w.get_application().get_name()))\n\nYou can then set up the keyboard shortcut by opening Keyboard Shortcuts (System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts).\nClick add to create a new shortcut.\n\nUse the command bash -c 'python ~/switch.py Terminal' (this is assuming you saved it as switch.py in your home folder).

So I'm suspecting Inkscape enjoys a limited amount of memory--especially because other programs perform well in the meantime. So is there a way to free up memory for Inkscape so I can work fast?\nThanks.\n\nA: Maybe this is not an issue of too little RAM, but of a CPU bottleneck?

I was wondering if there was a way to upgrade the Ubuntu Software Center without upgrading from 10.04 to 10.10. I am content with 10.04 and have no wish to upgrade. However the new features of the Software Center intrigue me and I would like to check them out.\n\nA: A current updated version of Lucid holds v2.0.7 of the software center.\nThere is an old port (now unmaintained) available in a PPA :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:guido-iodice/guiodiclucid\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install software-center\n\nHowever this repo also contains lots of other packages, so think twice before using this.\nA few packages are still getting updated, but software-center is stuck at 2.1.7 (which is closest to the version maverick was distributed with (3.0.4).\nSource : http://www.ubunturoot.com/2010/06/changes-in-ubuntu-software-center-in.html\nSee the Software center page on Launchpad\nUpdate: According to the ubuntu archive, the package 2.1.7 would indeed be a backport of the maverick version. I tried installing the maverick series (3.0) on a lucid machine but it has unmet dependencies.\n", "Q: Override theme background color for certain applications When using a custom theme (Equinox Evolution Midnight in my particular case) the manager at System > Preferences > Appearance > Theme > Customize > Colors is indeed reflecting the actual system-wide styling, but, turns out certain applications (LibreOffice, Bluefish Editor and many others) are actually overriding that theming as they display a white background. So I was wondering if there's a sort of centralized way to manage such exceptions (as in fact I'd like to have all my text editors overriding the dark background) or I should set that up in a per-application fashion?\nAny guidance will be sincerely appreciated, thanks much in advance. \n\nA: Firstly, the GTKParasite application does not handle themes at all. It might be useful to detect if the misbehaving application is a GTK application at all and determine the class of the editor widget. In Windows-speak, it is the Spy++ of GTK.\nChanging the editor color affects the lot of applications that directly use the GtkText widget (and to some extent the GtkSourceView widget at the root of syntax coloring editors like gedit and geany).\nApplications like Firefox and *Office are not real GTK applications, they have their own cross-platform widget set that render GTK decorations but do not have the association to the real text editor class.\nBluefish is a real GTK app but seems to implement its own text editor widget since it does not look like GtkSourceView or SciTe at all. You will probably find a lot of applications that jump to the conclusion that all text background should be white, and changing them globally won't be possible without some per-application-tweaking.\n\nA: You can add the theme options to your ~/.gtkrc. I'm not 100% sure how gtk theming works (off hand), but it should be relatively easy to add the options you need to apply by copying them from the gtkrc file of another theme or the theme you are using currently.\nThis page also contains some information on GTK+ theming (not for GTK+ 3.x).\n\nA: If you'd like LibreOffice to display your current theme, all you need to do is install libreoffice-gtk \nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-gtk \n\nThat should easily take care of that. \nBluefish is a bit trickier. The creators of themes can tailor Bluefish the way they wish, but it requires unique customization. So, you might contact the author of the theme you enjoy to let him or her know what programs aren't displaying the theme accurately. I'm sure they'd love to know about it. Or, you could customize it if you'd like, the instructions are here. Or, I guess you could use another editor that incorporates the default GTK theme. In any case, contacting the the author of your theme is probably the best route.\nRegarding your question about centralized control over theming, it seems one solution is something called GTKParasite, which I found via stackoverflow. On its About page it claims to be the Firebug of GTK+ applications. I've not personally tried it yet, but that description sounds a bit intriguing. And, possibly, much like what you are looking for. Seems worth checking out.\n", "Q: How to change the login screen keyboard layout? I switched from Qwerty to Dvorak, but the login screen still uses Qwerty.\nHow can I configure the login screen to use Dvorak?\n\nA: In Ubuntu / Natty, edit the file /etc/default/keyboard, look for the XKBVARIANT setting, and set it to this:\nXKBVARIANT=\"dvorak\"\n\nThis will tell GDM, the login manager, which keyboard layout to use per default.\nNote: the comments in the file warn that this only takes effect after udev is restarted; I would just reboot the machine after changing it.\n", "Q: GUI for patch command Is there any GUI available for patch command? I need it because sometime I need to see the actual file before applying patch to it and it is very cumbersome to open patch file and then open the individual files listed in there. Even if I do that I cant compare the modified i.e patched file and unmodified/unpatched file.\n\nA: When you open a patch file in emacs, you can put the cursor on a hunk and hit C-c C-c to jump to the corresponding location in the patched file and it will tell you if the patch has already been applied or not.  Then you can use C-c C-a to apply the hunk.\n", "Q: Is it possible to create access point on a laptop, which is connected to router with WiFi? Laptop #1 is connected to the router via WiFi. Laptop #2 is too far away from router to be able to connect to them. I can create a access point or Ad-hoc if I am connected to the router via wired network. But Laptop #1 is not connected to router via cable, but via WiFi. Is it somehow possible to create acces point or Ad-hoc on computer, which is connected to router via Wireless? Any help is appreciated.\n\n\nA: Generally, it is not possible to do this unless you have two wireless cards. For example, you could get a USB receiver for your wifi and then use the built-in WiFi card to create an ad hoc network.\nI am not aware of any wireless cards that allow you to create an ad hoc network while connected to another network.\nAnother option would be to go with a wireless repeater (I've seen them as low as $60 USD) and they work quit well.

At the moment I only have monospaced fonts and not all of them (I have the ubuntu monospaced font and it is not listed in the dialog).\nUpdate: I forgot to mention that I use Gnome 2.\n\nA: You only need close Yakuake or kill the process and relaunch Yakuake. \nFirst check if the process exists:\n\nps aux | grep yakuake\n\nIf the process exist, you can terminate it with killall:\n\nkillall -9 yakuake\n\nAnd then relaunch Yakuake, now Yakuake can load all your changes in your \ndesktop environment.\n\nA: you can edit the .kde/konsolerc file to specify the font you want.\n", "Q: Workspace switcher bindings do not always work? Is it normal that switching through workspaces with CTRL +alt +left/right/up/down doesn't work when I close the last window on the active desktop? \nIs there a way to alter this behavior?\nThanks\n\nA: Have you set nautilus to not draw the desktop? To find that out, run this command:\ngconftool-2 --get /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop\n\nIf it returns true, then its a bug. I know you've filed this bug and I'm the guy who commented there.\nIf it returns false, then its a known issue in Unity, to not un-focus closed windows when Nautilus is not running (currently it depends on Nautilus to take away focus from the closed application).\n\nA: It is highly likely that something is messing up the focus tracking.\nYou could try to try to change the focus tracking behaviour in ccsm and see if that solves it.

You can see whether a package was built for Multiarch by checking it dependencies for the multiarch-support package.\nFor a more in-depth answer on Multiarch, see Is it possible to have 32 bit libraries installed on a 64 bit system?\n\nA: When I updated to Oneiric, I lost the ability to exec 32 bit bins. I was able to find the ia32-libs-multiarch package, which was what ultimately got me back and running.\nCuriously, aptitude install ia32-libs-multiarch led to some grotesque and unexpected dependency issues (particularly, it broke on libmysqlclient16.)

I have 2 Ubuntu 11.04 PCs (desktop and laptop), both synced via U1. Recently I completely rebuilt the user account (completely deleted the home directory) on one of the two (the desktop), and now I have to resync. Problem is that the PC is on a slow connection and I have difficulties resyncing the 14gb of data. Of course I have the opportunity of moving it to a place where the connection is faster, but it's not comfortable, and it will take some time. Since the laptop is in sync with the account I was wondering if stopping the service and copying the files + some database (which files is the question) could let me avoid resyncing everything.....\n\nA: Yes, simply copy all of your laptop's files to an external flash/hard drive, then mount it on your desktop and transfer the data over that way. It is much faster, but then I'm not sure whether you would have such a drive handy.\n\nA: You could give this a try. \n", "Q: How can I trigger something once I connect to internet? I wonder how can I make the machine do something each time it connects to internet ?\nlike checking for updates once I'm connected to internet ?\nThanks\n\nA: There is absolutely no indicator that shows whether you have an internet connection or not. That is because you always connect to some kind of gateway (router, modem, ...) that sets up the connection to your ISP. So, to be sure whether you are online or not, you have to check the connection yourself by pinging or building up an HTTP connection (using curl for example) and checking the result. But be warned: a ping response doesn't mean you can have an HTTP connection. And getting an HTTP response doesn't mean you can surf the web. You always have to check the response.\nYou can be sure to have an internet connection if you know the expected response. For example, you can parse websites like http://www.whatismyip.de/ for an IP address using regular expressions. If your regular expression is correct and it doesn't find an IP address then you have no internet connection.\nShort answer: Write a script in which you check the internet connection (like described above). On success you execute the commands you want and set a flag that you are done for today (just create file and check for existance), on failure you do nothing. Make that script a cronjob.\n\nA: The script you are looking for looks like this\n[ -n \"$(curl -s icanhazip.com | grep ^[0-9])\" ] && firefox\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"curl icanhazip.com\" returns an IP adress if you are online\n\n*\"grep ^[0-9]\" checks if the first character is a digit\n\n*\"[ -n \"...\" ] &&\" means \"if this is true, proceed to the next command (which in my example is \"firefox\")\"\n\n*This is a quick hack and this script won't work if icanhazip.com is down or if you have an IPv6 adress.\nTo easily setup a cronjob to run it every x minutes, you can install \"gnome-schedule\".\n\nA: Network-manager exposes a DBus interface that you can use to be notified when you connect to a network. This will usually mean you're connected to the internet as well, but I don't know if Network-Manager has any methods for actually confirming that. You might want to use Network-Manager to get notified when you connect to a network, then confirm that you have internet access and if so, do what you want.\n\nA: As dAnjou said, I don't believe there is a trigger you can use.\nHowever, to check for an Internet connection, there is an easier way than using curl. Use fping as follows, which returns 0 if connected and 2 if not. See fping's manual for more information.\nfping -q example.com\n\n(Using example.com is valid, because the domain name exists even though it is reserved for testing.)\nSimplifying Davidc's  example becomes:\nfping -q example.com && firefox\n\n", "Q: Confused about desktop/viewport switching, want to bind keyboard shortcuts to switch desktops I've installed a pre-made Ubuntu 10.04 image at work, and I can't seem to figure out how to get desktop switching to work. No shortcuts work, and all the help I can get from the Ubuntu forums is \"CTRL-Alt-Left/Right should work.\" \nSo let me get this straight. Switching between desktops is deprecated, so we use viewports, which are managed by Compiz, which has one of the most absurd configuration managers out there. Lovely. \nCan anyone straighten this out for me, and anyone else who might stumble on this question? \n\nA: Have you tried setting them in the keyboard shortcuts? Seems to work fine over here:\n\n(You can click on the shortcut field for each function and then the tool will prompt you to set a shortcut)\n\nA: Note: I'm using 11, so the details may differ a little.\nYou'll need to install Advanced Desktop Effects Settings (ccsm) if it isn't already, and run it.\nUnder Desktop Wall click on the Bindings tab.\nUnder Move within wall for Move Left, Move Right ,etc click the first button on the right (it will say Disabled or give a key combination).\nSelect Enabled and click Grab key combination\nPress the keys you want to use for the shortcut.\n\nI have the same config as Jorge Castro so I don't think the Gnome and Compiz settings will conflict.\n\nA: I recommend asking whoever pre-made that image for you, if none of the other answers work as expected. It could be that there's some obscure, custom setting that your image has that changes the default behaviour.\n", "Q: What is the \"proposed\" repository? What exactly does this repository contain and why should a user either stay away from it, or add the repository?\n\nA: N.N. is correct, but let me give you an example:\nWhen a version of Ubuntu is released and is considered stable the stable release updates just don't get uploaded into the archive. So let's say a piece of software needs an update, after they go through the stable release update process they get uploaded to the \"proposed\" pocket. (Step 4 in the linked document):\n\nUpload the fixed package to release-proposed with the patch in the bug report, a detailed and user-readable changelog, and no other unrelated changes. \n\nHere's a list of what some of the updates look like. Then the people who have enabled the proposed section (including the person that uploaded it) test it, this usually takes about a week, sometimes less.\nAfter that the update is pushed via the normal update channel and you get it via the update manager. Basically it's just a place to test updates before they hit the general public.\nMore info:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\n\nA: Essentially it's a testing ground for packages (and more commonly package versions) before they're released into the main repositories. So the normal update rules apply: unless strictly necessary, you'll only get serious bug fixes and security patches through this.\nIf you enable it you get things before they're fully tested. From my experience it's not as unstable as an alpha or beta version of Ubuntu but it could be. As such you should probably only be using it if you exist to give feedback on packages. You probably shouldn't use it on production machines.\ntl;dr, Don't use it unless you have to.\n\nA: According to the community documentation on repositories the proposed repository is:\n\nThe testing area for updates. This repository is recommended only to those interested in helping to test updates and provide feedback. \n\nAccording to the community documentation on backports the proposed repository is:\n\nthe testing area for -updates. A\n  number of people must give positive\n  feedback on these packages before they\n  are allowed into -updates. This\n  repository is recommended ONLY to\n  people interested in helping to test\n  updates and provide feedback. Since\n  they are in effect testing updates,\n  there is a higher chance of defective\n  updates in this repository.\n\nAlso see this thread and its links.\n", "Q: How do you use Opera's built-in IRC client?

My Ubuntu server has about roughly 30 active users on it. I personally know everyone using the server. Recently, a few friends and I were working on project. We made a new directory for the project and since everyone knows everyone we didn't bother protecting our work under a bunch of permissions. We should have though, because we woke up this morning to find that someone removed our entire directory.\nOur work is backed up every night so it's really not a big deal to restore our work. However, we would like to find out who removed it so we can confront them. So far the best thing we've come up with for finding our culprit is checking everyone's bash history but this is long and tedious and chances are that if there was a malicious intent behind the directory removal that our culprit probably modified theirs to cover their tracks (or of course they might use a different shell).\nSo, basically, what is the easiest and quickest way to find out who deleted a directory?\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\nA: I didn't find a magic bullet answer to your question; part of that reason is detailed here: https://superuser.com/questions/178596/checking-user-command-history-in-unix\nThis simple command may help you track down what happened, searching for rm & mv commands in all shell history files in all users home directories:\nfind /home -type f -iname .*history -exec grep \"rm\\|mv\" {} \\;\n\nIt's good you have a valid backup to save you, but I highly recommend creating some groups for project folders and just adding user accounts to those groups; that will save you a lot of pain in the future.\nExample:\nadd a group and add project team members to it\ngroupadd coolproject\nadduser jim coolproject\nadduser joe coolproject\nadduser charlie coolproject\n\nset the permissions properly recursively and guarantee access going forward for the team regardless of who creates/edits files\nchown -R yourusername:coolproject /path/to/projectdir\nfind /path/to/projectdir -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \\;\n\n(the 2 sets the group ownership to \"sticky\" this makes sure the group owner of any projects remains \"coolproject\")\nfind /path/to/projectdir -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \\;\n\nHope that helps ya out!  B-)\n\nA: In theory it is possible to find out the delete time, so this can narrow the users down.\nCheck the i_dtime in ext2 specs. \n", "Q: LiveCD not booting/can't install So, I got a new laptop some days ago, and as usual I formatted it to install Ubuntu.

I'm a web-developer, I'm using win7, but now I want to try ubuntu, I want to ask if is on the ubuntu any software which automatically upload the folder content to the server. For example if I save a file that automatically upload to the server through ftp.\nOn the windows I'm using Fling \nIs there any alternative on ubuntu?\n\nA: There are so many ways to do this :-)\n1 of them I have seen used at my office is ftp-upload .\n\nBasically you set up a script and let cron do all the hard work.\nAdvantage of this is that it works with any program you code with: all it requires is that you save it in the location the ftp-upload script is checking for files.\nWe use PCs to edit files, save them on our own server so we can check our internal webserver (basically it's the Nautilus mounting method you approved) and update our remote webserver with this script at 18:00.\n\nA: The file manager that comes with Ubuntu, which is called Nautilus, lets you mount a FTP server folder as a Drive. You can then modify the files just as if they were on your computer and as soon as you save them the server copy is updated. (I've never used Fling, but this sounds just like it.) I've used it before with SFTP (basically a secure version of FTP) and it works great for web development.\nTo do this, just open the file browser and go to the \"File\" menu and click \"Connect to server...\". In the window that comes up pick \"FTP (with login)\" as the services type, enter your details (username, password, server), and click Connect. (If you check Add bookmark and enter a name for it, this server will show in the sidebar of the File Browser so you just click it to connect to the server even after a reboot.)  \n\n\nA: You can use curlftpfs. Just mount your FTP directories somewhere in .. maybe ~/Projects/ and start working on these files.\n", "Q: how to fix 3d cube bug for unity 3d \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to correctly enable Desktop Cube in Unity 3D? \n\ntried enabling 3d cube in ubuntu 11.04 unity 3d, ha not knowing about the bug, now every time I log into it, it doesn't display anything but the background wallpaper. must help.... ubuntu classic isn't doing it for me.\n\nA: While agree that this question is a possible duplicate of the Reset question, I do have a solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into the recovery console.\n\n*Run unity & gconf-editor & unity.*\n\n*In gconf-editor, navigate to /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options\n\n\n*Double click the value \"active_plugins\".\n\n*Remove the cube from the list.\n\n*Close gconf-editor and the terminal window (to logout).\n\n*Now when you try to log into unity it should work.

I recognize that it will very hard to translate it via Launchpad (it is a WPF C# app) but, any other way to do this?\n\nA: The Beta was an initial proof of concept that we used to test if the solution was possible. After the beta there has been a lot of work trying to get the code used on Linux to Windows, and at the moment we are very close.\nAt the moment the code is mostly shared between the Linux version and the Windows version with a lot of development being done. When we made the move from C# and WPF (for way to many reasons to explain here) to python we decided to use Qt + gettext so that the translations could be done in launchpad.\nSo in summary, you can do the translations in Launchpad and we would be grateful for your help. The projects you can take a look at to translate are:\nlp:ubuntuone-control-panel (ready to be translated)\nlp:ubuntu-sso-client (ready to be translated)\nlp:ubuntuone-windows-installer (not much work done just yet)\nOn each page, there is a link under the \"Get Involved\" heading that provides information for assisting with translations.\nI hope the info helps you.\n", "Q: ImportError: No module named gtk after the debacle a few hours back I managed to get a working desktop after using an ethernet cable and sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nBut now when I try to run ubuntu software center from CLI this is what I get \nrick@Abigail:~$ sudo software-center \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/software-center\", line 34, in <module>\n    import gtk\nImportError: No module named gtk\n\nAny guesses how to fix this.

I have not added ~/bin to any of my .bash* files.

What program or configuration is responsible for making fonts sharp and clear?\n\nA: Both systems, Microsoft's ClearType and FreeType, use  Subpixel Rendering, which utilises the RGB subpixels on your TFT display to make the glyphs appear sharper and improve their form. \n\nOne important difference is that Windows tries much harder to fit the font into 'the pixel grid', which is why it looks 'sharper', at the expense of the glyphs' contours:\n\nClearType also uses very heavy font hinting to force the font to fit into the pixel grid. This increases edge contrast and readability of small fonts at the expense of font rendering fidelity and has been criticised by graphic designers for making different fonts look similar. from Wikipedia's ClearType\n\n\nA: Posting this answer here so that I can find the answer next time when I search for \"clear type ubuntu\": (I hope this will help others too) \nOne approach is: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Unity Tweak Tool sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\n*run unity-tweak-tool in terminal (this starts the GUI)\n\n*Go to Fonts\n\n\n*Under Appearance you will find Antialiasing (none/Grayscale/RGBA). \n\nAnother approach is: \n1.

The page requires a log in and then displays a bunch of numbers that I'm interested in. \nCan I write a script to take care of this?\n(I am on a waiting list for college dorm housing and want to keep a close eye on the progression. There's a long list of daily updated info that I would like to store somewhere I can easily flip through it.)\nEdit: \nso I used Rinzwind's script and did some research on my own; here's what I have so far:\n    #!/bin/bash\n   filename=\"kkik\"\n   url=\"https://www.kollegierneskontor.dk/default.aspx?func=kkikportal.housingrequests&lang=GB\"\n   date=` date +%d%m%Y`\n   output=\"$filename-$date.html\"\n   wget --save-cookies cookies.txt --post-data 'Page_ctl05_Main_ctl04_form_loginUserName=*****&Page$ctl05$Main$ctl04$form$loginPassword=******'\n   wget  --load-cookies cookies.txt  $url -O $output\n\nit successfully downloads the 'you don't have permission' page (if I take out the cookies and post stuff it gives me a 'you need to log in' page, which is different).\nAm I missing anything obvious? It doesn't seem like an overly complex website.\nI'm sure if I get the script to run, I'll figure out how to make a Cron job out of it.\n\nA: 1. Downloading a snapshot of a website\nYou can download the page with some simple commands. Does it require logging in each time? That might require some extra coding but this is a general script that downloads a website (and appends a date to the download)\n   #!/bin/bash\n   filename=\"askubuntu\"\n   url=\"www.askubuntu.com\"\n   date=` date +%d%m%Y`\n   output=\"$filename-$date.html\"\n   wget $url -O $output\n\nResult:\n\naskubuntu-210611.html can be viewed with a browser or a text viewer like gedit.\nThis can even be altered to add in some sed/grep commands to filter everything that is html out of the result and just save the data you require. Makes it easy to add the data to libreoffice calc for instance.\nIf you add it to a cron script you can have it do this every x minutes/hours.\n2. Making several screenshots of a website\nShutter  can make images from command line with\n   shutter --window=.*firefox.*\n\nThis will make a screenshot of an instance named firefox and save it with a new name in the folder you save your shutter screenshots.\nAdd this to a script and have it execute once every time you want and you can have screenshots of your website. As long as you refresh the page with an add-on like refresh every you are set to go.\nShutter also is capable of making an image of a part of the screen with\n    shutter -s=100,100,300,300 -e\n\nor capture a screenshot of a website (probably not useable for you if you need to login every time):\n    shutter --web=[URL]\n\n\nA: Not sure if it is a solution for you because it does not address all your requirements. However with the ScrapBook Firefox extension you can create snapshots of websites easily. Each time you grab a snapshot it creates an entry in a list sorted by date and you can easily go back a look at any version.\nBecause you need to login to the site, ScrapBook extension is great because you can login first and then take the snapshot as a logged user.\nThe only thing that it will not do is automated snapshots because you will need to navigate to the site and save the snapshot manually.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: @joon I guess you need xdotool.\nXdotool lets you simulate keyboard input and mouse activity, move and resize windows, and much more. Take a check. With this you can do your autentication in the classic \"gui\" style, then your code can take the screenshot and whatever... I hope this helps you on your way.\n", "Q: How do I get started creating an Ubuntu Desktop App?

Where can I find the latest news on Ubuntu 11.10? I'm interested in what default applications are going to be present in 11.10.\n\nA: For getting news and stuff, you'll probably find all that information in this question: List of blogs to learn more about Ubuntu\nYou can find the notes for the default applications discussion here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-o-default-apps\n\n*https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-o-default-email-client\n", "Q: Rhythmbox missing japanese/chinese/korean characters in the song titles I've got in the database several japanese/chinese/korean song that are shown with \"random\" characters (I think I should install a language package... but I don't know which one).\n\nA: If I understand the question correctly, you have correct representation of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean characters in your song database, but these are not being rendered appropriately in the display.  In this case, the most likely cause is missing font support.  To install the preferred fonts for these environments, install the following packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*language-support-fonts-ko (Korean)\n\n*language-support-fonts-ja (Japanese)\n\n*language-support-fonts-zh-hans (Simplified Chinese)\n\n*language-support-fonts-zh-hant (Traditional Chinese)\n\n\nIf you happen to be running Ubuntu 8.04, the name of the packages for the Chinese fonts is different (I can't seem to find it just now).  These packages do not appear to be available for oneiric: I believe this functionality is being integrated with the language-support tool, and do not know precisely how it will be represented when 11.10 is released.\n\nA: I got this problem too. \nI usually use EasyTAG to fix my mp3 file info. But some of my korean songs were shown with \"random\" characters. I try to fix it several times in EasyTAG, but it didn't work (copy paste from google's results).\nFinally, I have fixed this. You can directly change it from Rhythmbox.\nRight click the song > Properties.\nYou can edit the field like title, artist, and more. Of Course with compatible encoding. And it works.\n", "Q: How to share music through DAAP using Rhythmbox? I have enabled DAAP plugin in Rhythmbox, ticked the \"Share my music\" option, but no DAAP server shows up in my other clients (android and another PC). Am I missing something, like firewall configurations, router configurations, etc?\nI can talk to people over Bonjour, so I guess avahi/zeroconf is running properly.\n\nA: Nothing else needs to be done. Rhythmbox DAAP works as soon as the plugin is enabled and the \"Share my music\" option is enabled in the plugin configuration.\nHowever, your client MUST BE IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE SERVER. This is, of course, a no brainer, but I just got tricked from the several networks available at my workplace.\n\nA: The only other \"gotcha\" with Rhythmbox Daap is that you have to be logged on to the Ubuntu computer and Rhythmbox must be running.\n\nA: I have the same problem at in Ubuntu 12.04. It looks like Rhythmbox only binds to the IPv6 interface, if IPv6 is enabled. This means that the music playing device must be talking IPv6. Which most of them don't.\nUnfourtunately is the daap-server advertised for both ipv4 and ipv6.\n\nA: Assuming the plugin is on, avahi-browser shows the DAAP services, and if you're running GNOME shell, make sure the media-sharing is enabled.\nYour local firewall can also get in the way, use netstat -tlnp and make sure the listening ports for rhythmbox are open (or disable firewall if you're comfortable with that).\n", "Q: How do I delete everything in /var/mail/username from the command line? As a result of a long-running cron job, I have over 1,000 messages in my user's mailbox. What's the easiest way to delete them?\n\nA: Run mail in a terminal. Press d 1-. This will delete those messages.\nRemoving files for managing mail is like adjust the volume of your tv with a hammer. It may work, but it is not optimal and far too brutal.\n\nA: If you want to delete all the messages, you can simply truncate the mailbox file for a user with the following command:\n> /var/mail/username\n\n(the greater than sign is not a prompt: you are in effect redirecting the output of nothing to the file, which will truncate it).\n", "Q: How to roll back Ubuntu to a previous version? I just installed a new version of Ubuntu and I want to roll it back to the previous version.\nHow can I do that? Is that even possible?\n\nA: There's a saying in my language which can be roughly translated as \"You can't turn mince back into meat by rotating the mincer's handle in the opposite direction\"  :)\nThe upgrade procedure is one-way - while installing new versions of software, your configuration files and settings are modified by packages' post-install scripts to use new format which is required by new software. Basically, there's no opposite procedure - to make a newer configuration file compatible with old software.\n\nA: Downgrading releases is possible to some extent. With enough fighting, it can be done (see some of the other answers here for the the technical details).\nHowever the result you end up with is not the same as what you had before the upgrade. During an upgrade certain one-way changes are made to make new packages happy and downgrading them won't reverse those edits. It's impossible to guarantee a downgrade will work at all, let alone if it'll be stable.\nIn short, your easiest option is always going to be a reinstall. Don't think of it as a chore, look at it as a nice opportunity to trim down on packages and configure things better.\nIf you want to test things in the future and you fear you might have issues, always make sure you do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Test the LiveCD first. If you're going to have immediate hardware issues, this should let you know.\n\n*Back up before you do anything. I know everybody and their mother has already told you to do this, but it's really important if you think you're going to have issues. If you can't do without your machine for more than 20 minutes, consider some full-disk cloning tools like Clonezilla so you can just restore a previous version of the disk. There are other tools that can offer similar results.\n\n*Keep your data separate. Having your /home/ within the same partition as your installation is a recipe for a headache if you're constantly upgrading/downgrading things. Push it off to another disk or at least another partition so that when you do need to reinstall, you really just need to set up the mount.\n\n*There was a critical bug for downgrading that was fixed by the Ubuntu QA team. Make sure you read up on that, as some people will recommend you just stick in an older CD and \"upgrade\" to it, but this is a bad idea.\n\n\nA: You can do it manually.\nFirst generate a list of what you have installed on your system. You can do this by typing the following in the terminal.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections | grep '[[:space:]]install$' | \\awk '{print $1}' > package_list\n\ncopy your /home and /etc folder to a backup media.\nRe install ubuntu 10.04. Restore your backup (remember to set the correct premissions). Then run the following to reinstall all the program you had before.\ncat package_list | xargs sudo apt-get install\n\nNote that you might have to do some cleaning of the /etc and /home folder for incompatible settings. \n\nA: This is why you are not supposed to upgrade your main install to the development release.  If you want to test the development release, you should do so on a separate partition so you can boot back into the stable release when things go wrong.\nAt this point if you want to go back to 11.04, you need to reinstall it, and choose manual partitioning.  Do NOT check the format box when configuring your partitions and your user files should remain intact.\n\nA: Simple method is booting up from a CD/DVD or USB stick of previous version and reinstall Ubuntu by overwriting existing installation.\nDon't forget backup first: your home directory any anywhere else you may have personal data.\n\nA: Roll-backs may work fine for certain packages in isolation, but I wouldn't ever expect a large-scale roll-back of an entire distribution to leave you with anything other than a horribly broken system (or one which, on the surface looks to be fine, but strange things keep surfacing as you discover it is more and more broken).\nAPT is just designed to avoid roll-backs as much as possible, and the packages that make up the Ubuntu (and Debian, for that matter) distribution aren't designed with smooth roll-backs as a design goal.\nUnless you have whole-system backups that are reliable, what you really need to do is ensure your entire home directory is backed up (and possibly also on a separate partition), re-install from the CD image of your chosen version, and start restoring your data from your home folder(s).  You may even need to selectively restore the dotfiles in your home directory in case any which have become accustomed to the new version don't quite work well with the older version.\nBefore you do, you may want to peruse your installed packages and write down which ones you rely on, so you can re-install them.  There are tools to backup and restore your list of installed packages, but I wouldn't normally recommend doing this if you are going between versions as the packages needed/included may have changed.\n\nA: It's possible at the level of the packaging tools (apt). But the resulting system may not be equivalent to doing a reinstall, and you may get errors along the way. This is because many packages contain specific support for upgrades (e.g. handling changes in configuration files) but not for downgrades.\nNormally, apt prefers to install the most recent version of a package. But you can change this through pinning: you can declare that packages from the old release have higher priority than the installed packages, so that they will be downgrades when you do aptitude dist-upgrade.\nChange your /etc/apt/sources.list to include only the old release (either edit the file or use your favorite GUI), and run aptitude update. Then edit /etc/apt/preferences (documented in the apt_preferences man page) and add the following lines (to downgrade to lucid):\nPackage: *\nPin: release v=10.04\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nThen run aptitude dist-upgrade. Every package has a priority greater than 1000, so every package that is present in 10.04 and installed on your system will be downgraded. You'll have to remove packages that weren't in 10.04 manually; they'll be listed under “Obsolete and locally created packages” in aptitude.\n\nA: To put it simply: no there's not. Sorry... (These are the dangers of upgrading to testing releases!)\n\nA: They say, \"never say never\", and \"nothing is impossible\" - both of which are true, but not in your case. I suggest you either back up your data and reinstall, or stick it out. The system should become more and more stable as the weeks go by.\nYou can also reinstall on top of the existing installation (it will keep your files).\nAs a rule of thumb though, try to avoid upgrading to development versions on production systems (especially if you are not a tester/developer).\n", "Q: Alternatives to Firefox 3.5/POW to use SSJS? I have to install FFX 3.5 on my 11.04 machine. It's needed because I'm helping a friend of mine in a project involving Server-Side Javascript, and he is using POW webserver, actually avaliable for Linux only as a Firefox AddOn. (I know it's a dumb thing)\nThe addon is compatible only with FFX 3.5 and older, but I cant' find any official package of Firefox 3.5 for linux. \nSo the questions are two: \n\n\n*\n\n*Where can i find a package of Firefox 3.5 for linux?

IT's main use will be displaying ssjs files in the browser (possibly on-the-fly, that means I have not to create a webserver in SSJS, like in the case of nodejs)\n\nA: You can download Firefox 3.5.19, as well as older versions of 3.5 from Mozilla's ftp framework. The timing is not the best right now, as the framework seems to be heavily overloaded, probably due to Firefox 5 release. The connection timed out many times for me, before being able to reach the files to verify their existence, but you might have better luck or might have to wait. Anyway, here it is:\nftp://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.5.19/linux-i686/en-US/firefox-3.5.19.tar.bz2\nOnce downloaded, extract it, and you'll get a folder called 'firefox' with precompiled binaries (meaning there is no need to install). You can run it from that folder with './firefox -P 3.5' where 3.5 is the name of the new profile. You can also move the folder somewhere convenient to you and create a launcher.\n", "Q: No longer able to boot stuck in busybox shell I've installed win 7 and ubuntu 11.04.

I installed the gstremer fluendo codecs. How do I know if I am  using them or how do I specify them as an argument for vlc or mplayer?\n\nA: VLC and MPlayer both use FFmpeg (+ some other) codecs to play media, but not the gstreamer ones (like fluendo-mp3). It is my understanding that this can't be changed by arguments or configuration, as it has not been implemented.\nTo be sure that you're using, say, fluendo mp3 decoder (flump3dec), use a command line similar to this:\ngst-launch-0.10 filesrc location=file.mp3 ! flump3dec ! audioconvert ! pulsesink\n\nOther software may provide a way to inspect which gstreamer elements it is using for media operations.\n(To add to the confusion, it is also possible to use FFmpeg through gstreamer, but it is not what you want.)\n", "Q: When will Firefox 5 be in the official repositories?

I did not notice any difference between them. \nI was hoping \"completely remove\" will remove all hidden configuration files in the home directories, but it is not doing that.\nSo, what actually is the difference between them? And is it possible to remove also all configuration files when uninstalling an application?\nThanks\n\nA: Removal will remove the package. Complete removal will remove the package and also remove configurations associated with the package.\nSo if you remove and then install a package, your settings will still be there. If you completely remove and install a package, your settings will be kept.\nHowever, this will only remove configurations in the /etc directory, so that no personal information gets lost. Thanks to @enzotib for the clarification!\n\nA: To add a little bit to what Rinzwind and nickguletskii said, completely remove will remove configuration files in /etc directory, but never touch personal configuration files in your home folder, that can only be removed by hand.\n\nA: The 'complete removal' option instructs Synaptic to remove any configuration files associated with the package as well. \nSource: community wiki\nNormal removal is equivalent to sudo apt-get remove application using terminal.\nComplete removal is equivalent to sudo apt-get remove --purge application.\nFiles in your home folder are not part of the package so they will stay on your system until you remove them yourself.\n", "Q: How do I get Calibre to fetch news?

First, you need to indicate to btrfs that the missing device is permanently gone: btrfs dev delete missing /mnt (missing is a keyword indicating any missing devices). Second, you need to rebalance to ensure that the data is properly replicated: btrfs fi balance /mnt.\n\nA: It looks like you added a third device and so the original second is still missing.  I guess you need to remove the missing device before adding the new one.

This is my first experience installing Ubuntu onto a RAID array and so far it has not been a fun one.  I have been following the Advanced Installation guide for installing Ubuntu 10.04 server, and it says that there will be an option on the Partition Disks screen to manually create the partitions, but the only options I have are:\n\n*\n\n*Configure iSCSI volumes\n\n*Undo changes to partitions\n\n*Finish partitioning and write changes to disk\n\nJust before I got to that screen I got a message that said:\n\nOne or more drives containing Serial ATA RAID configurations have been found.  Do you wish to activate these RAID devices?\n\nIt doesn't matter whether I answer yes or no to that, I still get the same Partition Disks screen.  When I try to select Finish partitioning and write changes to disk I just get the No root file system error.\nHas anyone else experienced this, and how do I get past it?  Can I not run Ubuntu on this machine?\n\nA: You have a fakeraid, not hardware raid.  See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FakeRaidHowto for more information.  I suggest that you go into the bios utility and delete the raid array, then follow the instructions to setup an mdadm linux software raid.\nThis basically involves creating a raid partition on each disk, then creating the raid array built from those partitions, then using that array for your root filesystem.\n", "Q: Where are passwords stored? How do you figure out where are user's passwords stored, for users that can login? I know the system is using LDAP for users (username, home path, etc.), but it doesn't contain any kind of passwords. I have access to a configured machine, so how do I figure out where are passwords? (which config file?)\n\nA: Passwords aren't stored themselve. They are transformed by a function, and the so produced value, which is called hash, is stored.\nIf you login, the same function is performed on your input, and the generated value compared with the one in the stored value in the /etc/shadow file.\nThe function is of a kind, which is hard to invert. So with the value in /etc/shadow, you can not calculate the original password, and the key in there is not helpful for login - you need the password. \nWith brute force, you can try to generate such a password, and for common names like 123456, password, asdf, secret, 1111 and so on, the shadow-values are already well known, and stored in so called rainbow-tables. \nTo prevent attacks with rainbow-tables, the password-function can use a salt, which influences the result, which means that every password uses a different salt, stored in the first two bytes of the password hash string (thanks to psusi, who corrected me), so that you would need a different rainbow-table for every password, which is not very practical - it takes too long to generate them, and is expensive.\nI'm not sure, whether ubuntu uses a salt. We can wait for somebody who explains it to us, or you could generate the same user with the same password on two machines, and compare the value in /etc/shadow. \n\nA: The passwords (or better hashes) are most probably stored in the LDAP server. \"Most probably\" means that you could have a very strange setup where they are not. LDAP configuration is very flexible, but that also means that without inspecting the config files a clear answer on how it is done in your situation cannot be given. You probably have looked into /etc/ldap.conf on the client for details of the configuration?\nOne possible setup for LDAP authentication is like this: the client box takes username and password from the login, and performs a bind to the LDAP server with this information. The LDAP server verifies username & password and either returns success or failure. In this setup, the client box never sees the stored password hash from the LDAP server.\nDo you know the type of LDAP server used? Whether you can see the hashed user passwords depends on the setup of the LDAP server. See as an example http://www.faqs.org/docs/securing/chap26sec213.html on what you could configure on an OpenLDAP server.\nThe answer on password hashing from \"user-unknown\" is correct, it is only that the hashes are not stored in /etc/shadow but in the LDAP server. The hashing itself might also be performed by the LDAP server and not the client box.\n\nA: Did you try \n- phpldapadmin?\n- ldapsearch -LLL -x -b \"dc=your,dc=domain\" uid=* (or replace * by username, maybe it's cn instead of uid)\nIf the passwords are stored within ldap, you should see them with this methods.\n\nIf the computer is a domain controller, maybe it has smbldap-tools installed, so you can just reset passwords with smbldap-passwd username\n\nYou might also want to check your pam.d config (/etc/pam.d/common-*) to find out what login mechanism your computer is using.\n", "Q: How to connect to free Starbucks wifi via command-line?

Does it depends of the place the executable is called from? as I'm still a new Linux user, I still discover some behaviours and I'm unable to tell if they are \"normals\" or not. I searched the Internet but as I can't really find an answer I guess it's time to ask here.\nFew weeks ago I installed a small game called \"Machinarium\" and I played it... but few days later when I wanted to continue my game I was unable to make the game start correctly. And as I didn't had the time to search I given up.\nBut yesterday as I was working on a program of mine, I had the exactly same behaviour. So I searched a bit and I discovered that when using Nautilus with the \"List view\", I was able to run the program (ie: the program does find the sound, images etc resources) when I was literally \"inside\" the executable folder, but unable when I was in a parent folder and expanding it to the executable folder to run it.\nTo illustrate the behaviour here are two screen shots.\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't works if the executable is double clicked from here\n\n\n*It does works if the executable is double clicked from here\n\nThis is indeed the same \"place\", but the Nautilus view is slightly different as the current folder is not the same and it seems to make a difference for the program.\nFurthermore, when I create a menu items via System Settings/Main Menu to the executable, it behaves just like if the executable can't find the resources (that's why I was unable to play Machinarium the second time as I created a menu short-cut after my first game).\nSo I asked my program to generate a text file at it's root when running, and I started to launch it from different \"parent\" folders to see where is generated the text file. Each time the file was generated on the top folder of the current Nautilus view.\nI was expected to see it appears in the same folder of the executable (well not as I was guessing what as happening, but before that I would have expected to see it appears in the exe folder).\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone can explain me why it does works like this (I guess it's normal) ?\n\n*How I'm supposed to solve this when creating programs (Should I detect the executable path in my C++ code or should I organize the resources files another way than on windows ?)\n\n\nA: There is a nice question here with answers to give you an idea where to install user applications.\nTo run an application the executable bit has to be set. This can also be done from Nautilus in the right click menu (Properties -> Permissions).\nYou can then run any executable binary or script by double-clicking in Nautilus or by running the following in a terminal (note the ./ run command):\n./path/to/executable/application\n\nIf your application needs to be run in it's path, then you need to change the directory to this path first by executing:\ncd /path/to/executable\n./application\n\nTo ease this you can also create a Launcher to run the application (see e.g. this answer and many others)\nThis is how I have done it with Machinarium.\nIt is not recommended to put your own user custom files in /usr/bin. This directory may be overwritten in case you upgrade your system later and it usually is not included in backup solutions. Instead, create a new directory in your home directory: ~/bin. You need to re-login for this directory be recognized.\n\nA: Yes. the PATH contains the list of paths where the commands are searched when you type them. If you wish to execute a command not in the path you need to give a relative or absolute path (./file or bin/file for example).\nThis behavior is probably a bug. The application probably executes some files in one of its directores (bin/ for example) but assuming that is being executed from the machinarium root directory (calls bin/file assuming dir is in the current directory) so if you run it from another directory the file will not be found.\nA workaround is to create a script in the PATH that enters the machinarium directory and then executes it.\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /path/to/machinarium\n./machinarium-or-whatever\n\njust name it machinarium and put it under a directory that is in your path (/usr/local/bin or one in your /home). You can run that command from any directory then.\n", "Q: Switch from encrypted partition to unencrypted (Error: cryptsetup: evms_activate is not available) I initially installed Ubuntu 11.04 with an encrypted file system (from the alternate install CD: Guided Partitioning, LVM encrypted).

Back when Ubuntu first sported home folder encryption (what, around the time of Jaunty Jackalope?), I opted in. That caused me some grief when I decided to change my login password. I found that I couldn't decrypt my home anymore! In trying to fix this, I eventually muddled things to the point that using my old password didn't work anymore, either.\nThat experience has left me very shy of using an encrypted home directory--nevermind the performance hit of encryption. Has this feature become more \"stable\" since it came out? Does it break if you change your login password? Has your [more recent] experience been better? (Does it work in Natty Narwhal?)\n\nA: It should be stable.\nPassword changes should not be a problem with one caveat: you need to use a user level password change tool (e.g. from the About Me window, or running the command line passwd tool without root privileges).\nThe encryption keys used for home folder encryption are themselves encrypted with your password.  The normal password change process requires you to enter both your original and new passwords, so is able to re-encrypt these keys seamlessly.  If you instead use an administrative password change (i.e. one that doesn't require your existing password), then this is not possible.\nAs expected, if you forget your existing password, you will lose access to your files if you have encrypted your home directory.\n", "Q: Manually Start LAMP Server I setup a LAMP server on my desktop Ubuntu install for testing web applications.

The server used to use md5 password hashes (e.g., the shadow passwords began with $1$) and now is configured to use sha512.  \nI'd prefer to keep using sha512, but would like the old users to be able to partially login once with their old password and then be forced to update their password (even if its the same password) generating a sha512.  Right now, the old md5-based passwords in /etc/shadow won't let the user login at all (and just appear to be incorrect passwords). \nThis seems like plenty of people should have had to do this before; yet I can't see how to do it, looking in the common places like /etc/pam.d/common-password nad /etc/login.defs.  Also users will be logging in via ssh; and I do not have everyone's contact info (email or otherwise); and some login fairly rarely.\nAny help?  (Googling doesn't seem to give any good solutions).\n\nA: Theoretically it should work like this: Users should be able to login with their MD5 passwords, and whenever they change it they would get an SHA512 password.\nDifficult to judge why people cannot login with their MD5 password. Authentication with the SHA512 passwords works? If you temporary change to MD5 and change a password of a test user, can you then login for him? Maybe you can post the /etc/pam.d/common-auth non-comment-lines for having a look. And of course logfiles could have some background-information.\nFor your wish of requiring people to change their password, you could set the last-change date to 0 in /etc/shadow.

Right click on the folder and pick Share... from the Ubuntu One menu.  Enter their email address in the resulting window and create the share.

I upgraded the kernel to 2.6.38 to enable this (using a PPA).  I have my /home folder on a separate (4 TB) BTRFS drive. / is on ext4.  My only complaint with this setup is that it uses the old BTRFS tools.\nHow can I upgrade first to 10.10, then 11.04 as required, when 10.10 uses 2.6.35?  I don't want it to crash/choke on mounting /home.  Will it just let me keep booting the newer kernel I have while upgrading?\n\nA: LZO compressed BTRFS volumes are not supported in 10.10. Therefore we cannot upgrade 10.04 to 11.04 with a modified kernel via the upgrade path from 10.10.\nIn your case I would backup /home before I proceed to avoid data loss.\nWe are able to perform a fresh install of 11.04 with the option to keep you /home directory untouched - that is the path I would recommend here. \nThe installer does give you an option to \"Upgrade from 10.04 to 11.04\" but this is in no way the upgrade you expect as it is unable to restore sources, user accounts and applications. You will have to backup these manually and reinstall later. All user settings from /home are preserved however.\n\nA: Upgrade the system and continue to boot using your custom kernel.  After upgrading to 10.10, when the grub boot menu comes up, simply choose to boot with the 2.6.38 kernel.  Then upgrade to 11.04.  You might also just want to do a clean install of 11.04 instead of the double upgrade.  This will be much faster and less likely to have problems.  The 11.04 installer even now notices that you already have Ubuntu installed and offers to replace it with the new version, without formatting the disk so you keep your data files.\n", "Q: Copy a Ubuntu install?

As soon as we set a date, we'll announce.\n\nI haven't seen anything to the contrary, so I assume this is still the current state of things.\nAs the other answer there suggests, if you need versioning, you can use a version control tool like Bzr or Git to keep version histories of all your files and sync these with U1 too.

Normally I'd accomplish this by port forwarding on my local router but thanks to failing hardware and its replacement being awful, my current router doesn't let me do port forwarding.\nSo stuck with this delay and not wanting to push the whole thing onto a proper server, I had a crazy idea: Can I just forward my port to an external server over SSH?\nI've done port tunnelling before but I usually do it the right way around:\n\n\n*\n\n*I connect to a remote box and ask that port 12345 shows up on my local machine at port 12345.\n\n*I start something on P12345 on the remote machine\n\n*I can access it via localhost:12345\n\n\nWhat I want to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to a remote PC and ask that that its local P12345 fetch things from my local P12345 (over the tunnel)\n\n*I start something on my local computer on P12345\n\n*Other people can access remote:12345 and see my localhost:12345\n\n\nA: If the server has GatewayPorts no, you can achieve the same result by executing ssh -g -L 8001:localhost:8000 oli@remote-machine on the server once you have executed ssh -R command on the client. This will make loopback port 8000 on the server accessible on all interfaces on port 8001.\n\nA: The command for forwarding port 80 from your local machine (localhost) to the remote host on port 8000 is:\nssh -R 8000:localhost:80 oli@remote-machine\n\nThis requires an additional tweak on the SSH server, add the lines to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nMatch User oli\n   GatewayPorts yes\n\nNext, reload the configuration by server executing sudo reload ssh.\nThe setting GatewayPorts yes causes SSH to bind port 8000 on the wildcard address, so it becomes available to the public address of remote-machine (remote-machine:8000).\nIf you need to have the option for not binding everything on the wildcard address, change GatewayPorts yes to GatewayPorts clientspecified. Because ssh binds to the loopback address by default, you need to specify an empty bind_address for binding the wildcard address:\nssh -R :8000:localhost:80 oli@remote-machine\n\nThe : before 8000 is mandatory if GatewayPorts is set to clientspecified and you want to allow public access to remote-machine:8000.\nRelevant manual excerpts:\nssh(1)\n\n-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport\n  Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the remote side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port hostport from the local machine. By default, the listening socket on the server will be bound to the loopback interface only. This may be overridden by specifying a bind_address. An empty bind_address, or the address ‘*’, indicates that the remote socket should listen on all interfaces. Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed if the server's GatewayPorts option is enabled (see sshd_config(5)).\n\nsshd_config(5)\n\nGatewayPorts\n  Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to ports forwarded for the client. GatewayPorts can be used to specify that sshd should allow remote port forwardings to bind to non-loopback addresses, thus allowing other hosts to connect. The argument may be 'no' to force remote port forwardings to be available to the local host only, 'yes' to force remote port forwardings to bind to the wildcard address, or 'clientspecified' to allow the client to select the address to which the forwarding is bound. The default is 'no'.\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to create a restricted SSH user for port forwarding?\n", "Q: How to build a dynamic grub on a usb-drive?

Hello I have tryed out the programm \"EarCandy\", now I had/have a lot of problems.\nAt first I did not get any sound and now it is very low volume. PS Earcandy is now deleted from my harddisk.\nWhen Im opening the Alsamixer with:\nalsamixer\n\nI see that the volume for the speakers is zero. Now I push it to the max volume. But after every restart, I have to open alsamixer again and have to set the volume to max again. Can I save the settings for alsamixer or is there any other way to fix the problem ?\n\n\nA: After 2 months of trying to make sudo alsactl store to work, I finally managed to do it.\nFirstly type in terminal alsamixer to enter the alsamixer UI. Then make the configurations you need(e.g increase speakers/headphones level or unmute something pressing \"m\" on keyboard).\nNow the most important part. Before you exit alsamixer, open a new terminal and run sudo alsactl store to save alsa settings. Then close both terminals and restart your computer. This will do the job.\n\nA: You could also save the mixer settings into a custom file with alsactl:\nalsactl --file ~/.config/asound.state store\n\nReloading:\nalsactl --file ~/.config/asound.state restore\n\n\nA: Seppo Erviälä's answer is right but not complete. As dma_k already noted, man alsactl clearly states at the end that,\n\n/var/lib/alsa/asound.state  (or  whatever file you specify with the -f\n  flag) is used to store current settings for\n         your soundcards.\n\npalacsinit appropriately noted that you can store config into your file with\nalsactl --file ~/.config/asound.state store\n\nand reload with\nalsactl --file ~/.config/asound.state restore\n\nThis can be further improved with placing the second line, the restore command into a .desktop file.\nYou will need to run nano ~/.config/autostart/alsarestore.desktop, which will open nano text editor and create ~/.config/autostart/alsarestore.desktop file. Entries in ~/.config/autostart/ directory are used to autostart programs and services for specific user on startup/graphical login.\nThe contents of the .desktop file should be the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nName=alsarestore\nExec=alsactl --file ~/.config/asound.state restore\n\nAmong other things, you could store your config in /etc/asound.state and symlink it to /var/lib/alsa/asound.state, but this one is more of a suggestion rather than tested solution\n\nA: Execute:\nsudo alsactl store\n\nThis should save alsamixer configurations to /etc/asound.state which gets loaded every startup.\n\nA: The solution of Sergiy Kolodyazhnyy worked for me. Although I had to add the modification of Exec=bash -c \"sleep 5 .... Indeed this happens because PulseAudio is modifying ALSA.\nAnother solution is to disable PulseAudio during boot (see here):\nsudo cp /etc/pulse/client.conf /etc/pulse/client.confbackup\nsudo nano /etc/pulse/client.conf\n\nFind ; autospawn = yes, remove the ; and change it to:\nautospawn = no\n\nThis solution also worked for me, although Ubuntu gave me a system program error at start. As I hate this kind of messages, I used the first solution. \n\nA: Open alsamixer with sudo privilege:\nsudo alsamixer\n\nThen adjust the volume and exit.\nsudo alsactl store\n\n\nA: ALSA has a mechanism to save and restore settings:\n# alsactl store\n# alsactl restore\n\nIt will use a default file (usually /var/lib/alsa/asound.state) to save settings, and restore them from. The restore operation is usually done automatically at system bootup, usually from a systemd service.\nHowever, it may happen that PulseAudio (the audio server that is often used by default on \"recent\" distributions), will override the ALSA settings by its own, sometimes messing up things. It may not so easy to teach PulseAudio to behave as you'd like, so a workaround of this kind might be used:\nYou may want to launch the following script (~/alsarestore.sh) from the root user crontab.\n#!/bin/sh\nrestore_alsa() {\n    while [ -z \"$(pidof pulseaudio)\" ]; do\n        sleep 1\n    done\n    alsactl restore \n}\nrestore_alsa &\n\nIt will wait for PulseAudio to launch before calling alsactl restore (considering the stored configuration is the one you want).\nFinally, as root, you may want to add this to crontab -e:\n@reboot ~/alsarestore.sh 2>/dev/null\n\nThis work around is inspired from this ArchLinux wiki article.\n\nA: After running sudo alsamixer the mixer should should retain the changes you make.\nSee Sound does not work once my profile loads on which answers you can find a clue also.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Alsa-Json-Gateway https://github.com/fulup-bzh/AlsaJsonGateway supports store/restore of sound card sessions from JSON/REST API\n\n\n*\n\n*list sessions /jsonapi?request=session-list&cardid=hw:0\n\n*store session /jsonapi?request=session-store&cardid=hw:0&args=MySoundConfig\n\n*restore /jsonapi?request=session-load&cardid=hw:0&args=MySoundConfig\n\n\nA: For those whom @Sergiy Kolodyazhnyy 's answer didn't work, try replacing alsactl by its complete path (whatever the which alsactl returned to you).\n\nA: Alsa resets the volume for mic, headphones and speaker for my system.

FreeCAD is open source (LGPL license) and completely modular, allowing for very advanced extension and customization.\"\n\nA: Blender\n\nBlender is the free open source 3D content creation suite, available for all major operating systems under the GNU General Public License.\nBlender's features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, rigging, water and smoke simulations, skinning, animating, rendering, particle and other simulations, non-linear editing, compositing, and the ability to create interactive 3D applications, video games, animated film, or visual effects. More advanced tools include rigid, realistic body, fluid, cloth and softbody dynamics simulation, modifier-based modeling, character animation, a node-based material and compositing system, and embedded scripting in Python.\n\n\nA: I think the current best answer is https://app.sketchup.com\nI know web apps aren't ideal for every use case, but it works well and is SketchUp, nothing else is going to be as close to SketchUp as the app itself.\n\nA: The Art of illusion\n\n\nArt of Illusion is a free, open source 3D modelling and rendering studio. Many of its capabilities rival those found in commercial programs. Highlights include subdivision surface based modelling tools, skeleton based animation, and a graphical language for designing procedural textures and materials..\n\nK-3D (Available in the software center )\n\n\nK-3D's interface uses your platform's look-and-feel, and it's consistent with the applications you already know. New artists will find K-3D easy to understand, and professionals feel right at home. K-3D is intuitive, consistent, and discoverable.\n\nFor a  more advanced program you can try\nBlender (Available in the software center)\n\n\nBlender is a free open source 3D graphics application, available under the GNU General Public License for the Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Microsoft Windows operating systems.\nBlender's features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, rigging, water and smoke simulations, skinning, animating, rendering, particle and other simulations, non-linear editing, compositing, and the ability to create interactive 3D applications, video games, animated film, or visual effects.

Hoping for some quick and easy fix.\nThank you.\n\nA: What you're probably seeing is a bare repository.\nA regular repository is a working directory with a .git folder that contains all the tracking information. Bare repositories however are designed for servers that you only want to push and pull from, they're just a folder containing what would normally be in the .git folder.\nTry manually creating a git repo with a simple git init and see if Gitosis will work with that.\n", "Q: Setting the working directory I want to create a quick launch icon for MATLAB, but it won't start if the working directory is not the same as the directory where the executable is. Can I specify the working directory in the 'Custom Application Launcher'?\n\n\nA: Change the Command to this (substituting the correct paths of course):  \nbash -c \"cd /path/to/directory && /path/to/directory/executable\"\n\n\nA: You can set the working directory natively, but for some reason it's not supported in the user interface. The underlying .desktop file itself supports a Path key for \"the working directory to run the program in\" (see the spec) as long as your launcher is an \"Application\" type.\nSo just open the .desktop file in a text editor (if you're having trouble finding it, you can create the launcher on your desktop and find it in ~/Desktop, then move it later), and add a line at the end that says Path=YOUR_PATH.\n", "Q: Why isn't it possible to run Mac software?

Yesterday I installed Ubuntu 11.04 with 8.10 already installed and since then my Dell VOSTRO laptop gets shuts down automatically every half an hour. Although I am using the latest version (currently 11.04) I did not uninstall 8.10 while (as per the guiding option of Ubuntu). Since this installation I am facing the sudden shut downs often. \nHence I want to remove the older version from my system. How can I do this?\n\nA: I reckon they are both in different partitions. You could delete the 8.10 partition after doing the proper backup and telling grub to update itself since 8.10 is no longer available do to \"unforeseen circumstances\" = Formatted Partition ;)\nBut a couple of things. The shutting down I am pretty sure is not related to the 8.10/11.04 relation. I recommend you check the hardware first and maybe do a dmesg to see if something comes up that tells you the cpu is frying, the hard drive is dying or something dramatic that says this is the problem.\n\nA: You’ll need to delete 8.10 partition and update your GRUB entries. You can do this with a GRUB rescue CD or USB key. I use Hiren’s Boot CD.\n", "Q: How do I remove the LAMP stack so I can start over?

I've got one desktop computer Ubuntu 11.04 with an external USB drive mounted on it on the home WRT54L Linux network (192.168.0.2), and when I arrive at home with my laptop, I want to be able to mount the external USB drive from my Ubuntu 11.04 laptop (192.168.0.3) to the desktop, without having to unplug it from the desktop, that is accessing it. \nIs it possible to send, via a terminal command, a remote mount command to the desktop usb drive from my laptop? Ideally something that creates a local mountpoint I can just call locally from the programs installed in my laptop, like:\n\nusername@laptop ~ \"mount the drive so the laptop can see it\"\nusername@laptop ~ ./myprograminlaptop /my/file/which/is/actually/on/the/desktop/file.txt\n\nCan I automate this process every time the laptop is connected to the home network?\n\nA: Here is an easy GUI solution:\nOn the server, where we have attached the USB drive open Nautilus and browse to the mount point of the USB drive (usually found in /media/). In the right click context menu on this folder open Sharing Options, tick Share this folder, give a sensible name for the share, and Create Share\n\nOn the remote, i.e. your laptop, open Nautilus to browse the Network for the share as named above. On mouse double-click this will be mounted as a network drive on your laptop, and it will appear as an icon on the desktop.\n\nTo mount a samba share as non root user in your home directory to have access from all applications you may want to have a look at smbnetfs.\nIn case you did not set your USB-drive to auto-mount you will be able to mount it remotely by using SSH (after having installed openssh-server  on your desktop).\n\nA: You can use SFTP, which uses the more secure ssh (encrypts everything, including login credentials), and seems to be faster than the protocols that Takkat's answer uses.\nFirst, on the machine with the Disk connected to it (the Desktop in this case), install the ssh package. \nThen on the machine you want to access the files from (the laptop in this case), Open nautilus. Click the File menu and then Connect to server...  For service type, select SSH and put in the IP address of the computer the disk is connected to for the Server field. Optionally, you can check Add bookmark and enter a name to have it always show up in the sidebar. Click connect. You will be asked for your username and password for the Desktop. You will be able to see all the files on your Desktop and access your drive remotely under the /media/ folder.\n\nThe remote filesystem is mounted in /home/yourusername/.gvfs/, so you can can use command line tools too. For example, on the laptop: nano /home/avilella/.gvfs/sftp_for_desktop/media/externaldrive/some_text_file.\nIf the drive isn't already mounted, you can have the Desktop mount it so you can use it by running ssh avilella@192.168.0.2 from the laptop (assuming avilella is your desktop username and 192.168.0.2 is the desktop IP). It will ask for your password and then you will have a command prompt for the desktop. Then you can run sudo fdisk -l or sudo blkid to identify which /dev/sdXX partition is your external drive. Then you can run\nsudo mkdir -p /media/externaldrive\nsudo mount /dev/sdXX /media/externaldrive\n\n\nA: you may consider using NFS (network file system). It is a special file system that allows a computer to access a remote disk ad use it just like a local disk. It allows a cluster of computers to share the same data. you may want to add a few lines to your /etc/fstab or to manually specify a mount point. after that, you can continue working the usual way.\nof course you will need a nfs daemon running on the server and to configure the daemon to share what you want, specifying who can access that data and so on (pay attention to your firewall, etc)\n\nA: You need to use ssh for that - run sudo apt-get install ssh on both machines.\nThen, you just have to go to nautilus on your laptop, File->Connect to Server..., select \"SSH\", enter the external IP of the desktop into the Server input box, the port is 22, the folder is /media/, the username is your username on your desktop. Click \"Connect\", you'll be asked for your desktop password.\nTo mount the drive, open up the terminal, type in ssh yourusernameondesktop@yourdesktopsip, enter the password, and use the mount command.\nsudo mkdir /media/flashdrive\nsudo mount /dev/devicename /media/flashdrive\n\nMake sure your password is safe - remote access can be used against you.\nNote: I assumed that you are in a different network because you mentioned your home. Please clarify that.\n", "Q: How can I delete duplicate emails in Evolution? How can I delete duplicate emails from Evolution 2.32.2?\n\nA: In 3.2.2, Ctrl-A (select all messages), Message -> Remove Duplicate Messages works for a folder.\n\nA: That's indeed a very common and annoying problem, especially if you're using POP email.\nThere used to be a plugin to remove duplicates, however, it stopped working with some version.\nEvolution 3.1, which ships with Ubuntu 11.10, now has that functionality integrated (Message ▸ Remove Duplicate Messages). With 2.32 you are forced to upgrade. In addition, the function in 3.1 seems to be neither efficient nor configurable so you might still end up with lots of duplicates that give you something to do on a boring weekend.\n\nA: I don't think you can do this (unless there is some kind of POP3 rule you can apply).\nYou will have to do it manually in your specific version.\n", "Q: Blender has weird fuzzy misbehaving icon in launcher I got Blender 2.58 (stable) from blender.org (downloaded the package, extracted it). Everything works fine, but the only thing that bugs me is that the icon in the launcher (when I open it) is really fuzzy. I guess that's no big deal, but when I select \"Keep in Launcher\" and close Blender, the icon doesn't work when I try to open it again. \nThen, I created a Launcher on my desktop with the path to the blender executable, slapped on a shiny new non-fuzzy .svg icon that came with the package, and dragged the (desktop) Launcher to my (Unity) Launcher.

Even after Blender opens, the new icon is still flashing.\nWhat is wrong with my launcher?\n\nA: The thing you are missing is a .desktop file to tell the launcher about Blender.\nAssuming you installed to /opt/blender, copy the following to /usr/share/applications/blender.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Blender\nComment=Blender 3D Graphics\nExec=/opt/blender/blender\nIcon=/opt/blender/icons/scalable/apps/blender.svg\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Graphics;3D;Application;\n\nThen search for blender in the dash, launch, right click the launcher icon and check Lock to Launcher \n\nA: You may want to use Blender from the ppa:\nppa:irie/blender\nThis will provide you with the svn version (weekly). These are usually stable, but if you want it to be truly stable, you can lock the version in synaptic. You can also get Blender 2.4 from this PPA.\nTo add this to your Unity Launcher, drag the icon from the Dash.*\nThe challenge with using Blender from the tarball on their website is that it will lack some of the desktop integration features you would get from installing a package that is built for the specific OS/distro.\n", "Q: How to setup IPSec with Amazon EC2 How to setup an IPSec connection from my ubuntu laptop to Amazon EC2 instance?

I've read this question, but it doesn't definitively answer my question.\nIf I want my computer to be able to hibernate, do I need to have a swap partition as large as my RAM, or will Ubuntu wisely be able to hibernate if the swap partition can fit the currently-in-use RAM? I'm about to install Ubuntu on a computer with a lot of RAM, and a relatively small hard drive, so I don't want to use more hard drive space than necessary.\nI wanted to avoid giving my actual specifications to keep this question more general, though I'll give them if necessary.\n\nA: This question continues to surface in common queries when sizing swap to set up hibernate. The original answer is correct in that it could vary incredibly based on your workload, but I don't feel like that's a complete answer.\nThe complete answer is that you can tell how much you need based on your specific workload, then you can size appropriately.\nThe basic tool is the kernel messages during hibernate. You want to see how much memory was used with this command:\nsudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep 'PM:'|grep kbytes\nYou should get output like:\nAug 14 11:03:20 mike-XPS-15-9570 kernel: [17594.823584] PM: Allocated 11809876 kbytes in 2.65 seconds (4456.55 MB/s)\nAug 14 11:03:20 mike-XPS-15-9570 kernel: [17605.365657] PM: Wrote 11787284 kbytes in 9.09 seconds (1296.73 MB/s)\n\nThen the strategy is to run your maximum load, and trigger a hibernate, see what swap space was required, possibly add a margin of safety, then make your swap space that size.\n\nA: It's hard to predict: your swap needs to accommodate\n\n\n*\n\n*what's already in the swap when you hibernate\n\n*what's in RAM when you hibernate, but only the part that's not disk cache or buffers; the RAM image is compressed if you use uswsusp\n\n*a few kernel data structures\n\n\nSo you can fail to hibernate even if your swap is bigger than your RAM, because most of your swap is already in use. And convertly you can successfully hibernate with a swap that's smaller than RAM, if you're not using much of either at the time.\nIf you want to avoid a fixed-size swap partition because your disk is very small, you can go for a swap file instead.

Is there a way to limit the number of concurretly open AF_INET sockets (only)?\nIf so, how do I do it, and how will the networking behave if I'm above the limit?\nFor background: My cheap commodity router is a bit eager to detect 'syn flooding'. When it does, it crashes (and doesn't automatically restart itself). I'm thinking limiting concurrent connections to around 1000 should keep it from bickering.\n\nA: You can limit the number of connections at once by using iptables & the connlimit module.\nFrom the iptables man page:\n# allow 2 telnet connections per client host\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 23 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 2 -j REJECT\n\n# you can also match the other way around:\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 23 -m connlimit ! --connlimit-above 2 -j ACCEPT\n\n# limit the number of parallel HTTP requests to 16 per class C sized network (24 bit netmask)\niptables -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 16 --connlimit-mask 24 -j REJECT\n\n# limit the number of parallel HTTP requests to 16 for the link local network\n(ipv6) ip6tables -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -s fe80::/64 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 16 --connlimit-mask 64 -j REJECT\n\n", "Q: How to install new system (with new applications) without removing /home I'd like to update to 11.04 from 10.10 (but I don't like upgrading system, I prefer full reinstalling)\nI'd like to install whole new system, but I want to keep my /home folders (Music, Movies, Documents and so on). If I keep /home while installing - this will keep all my program settings too (but I have lots of trash there too, and 'd like to clean it too).\nCan I delete all .folders in /home and then reinstall system (keeping old /home) ?\n\nA: Since you have your /home on a separate partition you can install 11.04 without losing the data in /home without problems. Just make sure to use manual partitioning during installation, declare your existing partitions as / and /home, and make sure that / gets formatted but /home does not.\nYou should still make a backup though, anything else would be negligent.\nAlso, if you want to keep your documents but not necessarily your user settings (as you mentioned to have lots of 'trash' there) you can just create a new user after you installed the new system, and move your files there.\n", "Q: How do I get gnome-terminal not to truncate lines?

Or, Is there a better way to scroll through files too big to fit in memory?\n\nA: As mem75 already said, gnome-terminal doesn't truncate, but wrap long lines. But you're using less anyway, in which case it's that which is doing the wrapping.\nTo tell less not to wrap long lines, use the --chop-long-lines (or -S for short) option. (They're only chopped as far as the display is concerned, and you can scroll left and right with the arrow keys.)\n", "Q: Is Banshee (or other mono applications in Ubuntu) threatened by the recent changes in novell? Please inform if the question is off-topic to remove it.\nI do not know if I should work with Banshee or some other applications since I am afraid that their future is threatened if Mono stops developing. An example: http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/is-mono-dead-is-novell-dying/8821.\nAre my fears reasonable?\n\nA: The core mono team lost their jobs at Novell / Attachmate. However Miguel de Icaza (founder of gnome and the mono project) has taken most of the original team into a mono based startup called Xamarin \nThey are committed to contributing to and developing the core opensource mono, this commitment was made in Miguels de Icaza's blog.\nSince the takeover happened mono 2.10 made it into ubuntu 11.10.\n", "Q: Synapse vs. Kupfer, which is lighter for you? For me Synapse idles at approximately 7MiB, Kupfer at 23MiB.\nThat is with nearly all except four plugins off for Kupfer. I thought it was supposed to be the lightest and I love the plugins for it. \nI used to be a die hard Gnome-Do fan, Then I switched to Synapse when it lost development because I heard a developer from Do went to Synapse. \nI want to like Kupfer more but if the memory consumption could match Synapse I'd be sold.\n\nA: It's a trade-off. Kupfer might have a larger memory footprint (and you're right, on my system it reserves 32 MB of writeable/private memory), but it is fast to load and find the desired application/file. It's up to you what you prefer. \nAnd (come on!) are you running on 128MB RAM or something?\n\nA: You have to consider that Synapse uses zeitgeist as it's backend and that also uses several MB of ram, so the comparison is not exactly fair. \nAlso, as MichaelMS pointed out it's wanted that those programs use memory! You want to access your data/actions/bookmarks really fast so you don't want to access the slow HDD for it. The more ram it uses the faster it will respond. It's not a bug it's a feature ;)\n\nA: Whenever kupfer offers a zeitgeist plugin I'll drop synapse, until then I'll use both.\n\n\n*\n\n*Kupfer  : noticeably better at delivering/predicting the program i want to launch or the document i intend to find.\n\n*Synapse : feel is FAST, thanks to zeitgeist backend.\nHence, I'll use both because they're complementary. Given the apparent similarity between gnome-do, syanpse, kupfer, I assume we'd all appreciate a merger of all these projects. \nKeep synapse as a name, it is the coolest one ;-) and as such sticks better to memory.\n", "Q: Simple script - execute command on selected file I want to make a script that will execute .jar file on selected file.

I have requirement of converting PDF pages to images. There is a background image with some text in my file, and when I save it as an image only the background image gets saved.\nIs there any software available for the same so that complete page can be converted to an image?\n\nA: You can use pdftoppm from the poppler-utils package to convert a PDF to a PNG:\npdftoppm input.pdf outputname -png\n\nThis will output each page in the PDF using the format outputname-01.png, with 01 being the index of the page.\nConverting a single page or a range of pages of the PDF\npdftoppm input.pdf outputname -png -f {page} -singlefile\n\nChange {page} to the page number. It's indexed at 1, so -f 1 would be the first page.\nIf you'd like to work on a range of pages, you can also specify a number for the flag -l (last page), so having -f 1 -l 30 would specify the pages from 1 to 30.\nNote again that .png will be appended to outputname automatically, so there's no need to include the extension. Also, -singlefile removes the -01 suffix cited above, since the output is known to have only one file.\nSpecifying the converted image's resolution\nThe default resolution for this command is 150 DPI. Increasing it will result in both a larger file size and more detail.\nTo increase the resolution of the converted PDF, add the options -rx {resolution} and -ry {resolution}. For example:\npdftoppm input.pdf outputname -png -rx 300 -ry 300\n\n\nA: If you only want to convert a specific page of a PDF to a PNG, you can pipe pdftk to convert (described above) like this:\npdftk document.pdf cat 12 output - | convert - document-page-12.png\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Install imagemagick.\n\n*Using a terminal where the PDF is located:\n\n\n*\n\n*For the full document:\nconvert -density 150 input.pdf -quality 90 output.png\n\n\n*For a single page:\nconvert -density 150 input.pdf[666] -quality 90 output.png\n\nWhereby:\n\n\n*\n\n*PNG, JPG or (virtually) any other image format can be chosen.\n\n*-density xxx will set the DPI to xxx (common are 150 and 300).\n\n*-quality xxx will set the compression to xxx for PNG, JPG and MIFF file formates (100 means no compression).\n\n*[666] will convert only the 667th page to PNG (zero-based numbering so [0] is the 1st page).\n\n*All other options (such as trimming, grayscale, etc.) can be viewed on the website of Image Magic.\n\nA: IIRC GIMP is capable of using PDFs, i.e. converting them into images. So if you want to edit the images right away - GIMP is your friend.\n\nA: You can use convert and specify a higher density using  -density option.\neg. convert -d 300 foo.pdf bar.png\n\nA: To get a single page from gm convert, add [N] (with N the page number starting at 0) to the PDF name, ie gm convert foo.pdf[11] out.png to get the 12th page from the PDF.\nFor pdftoppm use -f N -singlefile, where N is the page number starting at 1, ie pdftoppm -f 12 -singlefile foo.pdf out for the same result. It appears to always add \".png\" to the output filename and there is no way to stop this.\n\nA: You can do this with ghostscript:\ngs -dSAFER -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -r300 -sDEVICE=png16m -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1 -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4 -sOutputFile=output.png input.pdf\n\nSee https://www.ghostscript.com/doc/9.52/Devices.htm for details\n\nA: Master PDF Editor (ver 2.2) has this option built in. Open the PDF file and then go to File > Export to > Images. It presents a dialog where you can define different options for the output.\nExtremely useful. Hope this info helps.\n\nA: PDF Mod also allows exporting images of all or individual pages of PDF files.\n\n*\n\n*Open PDF file in PDF Mod\n\n*Select page(s)-\n\n*Edit > Export image(s)\n\nA: pdftocairo file.pdf -png (was posted by Anthony Ebert as a comment at How to convert PDF to image?)\n\nA: The currently accepted answer does the job but results in an output which is larger in size and suffers from quality loss.  \nThe method in the answer given here results in an output which is comparable in size to the input and doesn't suffer from quality loss.  \nTLDR -  Use pdfimages : pdfimages -j input.pdf output \nQuoting the linked answer:  \n\nIt's not clear what you mean by \"quality loss\".  That could mean a lot\n  of different things.  Could you post some samples to illustrate? \n  Perhaps cut the same section out of the poor quality and good quality\n  versions (as a PNG to avoid further quality loss).\nPerhaps you need to use -density to do the conversion at a higher\n  dpi:\nconvert -density 300 file.pdf page_%04d.jpg\n\n(You can prepend -units PixelsPerInch or -units\n  PixelsPerCentimeter if necessary.  My copy defaults to ppi.)\nUpdate:  As you pointed out, gscan2pdf (the way you're using it) is just a wrapper for pdfimages (from poppler).  pdfimages\n  does not do the same thing that convert does when given a PDF as\n  input.\nconvert takes the PDF, renders it at some resolution, and uses the\n  resulting bitmap as the source image.\npdfimages looks through the PDF for embedded bitmap images and\n  exports each one to a file.  It simply ignores any text or vector\n  drawing commands in the PDF.\nAs a result, if what you have is a PDF that's just a wrapper around a\n  series of bitmaps, pdfimages will do a much better job of extracting\n  them, because it gets you the raw data at its original size.  You\n  probably also want to use the -j option to pdfimages, because a\n  PDF can contain raw JPEG data.  By default, pdfimages converts\n  everything to PNM format, and converting JPEG > PPM > JPEG is a lossy\n  process.\nSo, try\npdfimages -j file.pdf page\n\nYou may or may not need to follow that with a convert to .jpg step\n  (depending on what bitmap format the PDF was using).\nI tried this command on a PDF that I had made myself from a sequence\n  of JPEG images.  The extracted JPEGs were byte-for-byte identical to\n  the source images.  You can't get higher quality than that.\n\n\nA: If your pdfs are scanned, the images are already stored as part of pdf. you will simply need to extract them with pdfimages:\npdfimages my-file.pdf prefix \n\n", "Q: How do I use gpg-agent as with ssh-agent+ssh-add? ssh-agent is very easy to use, I start it and add keys using ssh-add keyfile. After killing the process ssh-agent, all files are gone.\nHow can I get the same behavior with gpg-agent? The closest program I found was gpg-preset-passphrase. But looking at the manual page of gpg-agent, it seems that a directory is created for storing private keys.\nI could be wrong, so I'm wondering how I can setup gpg-agent in such a way that no files/ directories are created? If it's not possible, other suggestions to make gpg-agent work like ssh-agent + ssh-add would be welcome too. I'm not looking for GUI solutions like Seahorse.\n\nA: I decided to have a look at this again and found out how it works. GPG uses the terminology \"cache\" for storing passwords. Two constraints can be imposed on the maximum storage time:\n\n\n*\n\n*The time to keep a passphrase since the key was initially added.\n\n*The time to keep a passphrase since it was last accessed.\n\n\nIn addition, two variations exist for both constraints, one for GPG keys and one for SSH keys (if support was enabled).\nThe relevant manual page entries from gpg-agent(1):\n   --default-cache-ttl n\n          Set  the  time a cache entry is valid to n seconds.  The default\n          is 600 seconds.\n\n   --default-cache-ttl-ssh n\n          Set the time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid to n  sec‐\n          onds.  The default is 1800 seconds.\n\n   --max-cache-ttl n\n          Set the maximum time a cache entry is valid to n seconds.  After\n          this time a cache entry will be expired  even  if  it  has  been\n          accessed recently.  The default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).\n\n   --max-cache-ttl-ssh n\n          Set the maximum time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid to\n          n seconds.  After this time a cache entry will be  expired  even\n          if  it has been accessed recently.  The default is 2 hours (7200\n          seconds).\n\nPassphrases are always cached (in memory, not on disk! Verified with a git repo of $HOME), so there is no explicit need for ssh-add. For example, signing dummy data triggers the cache already:\n$ echo | gpg -s >/dev/null\n(passphrase requested\n$ echo | gpg -s >/dev/null\n(signing proceeds without asking for passphrase)\n\nTo make permanent changes to the cache settings of gpg-agent, edit ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` and add something like:\ndefault-cache-ttl  60     # Expire GPG keys when unused for 1 minute\nmax-cache-ttl     600     # Expire GPG keys after 10 minutes since addition\n\nI have tried to enable SSH agent support by specifying enable-ssh-support, but this makes the gpg-agent ask you for another key to encrypt the key, and then stores your private key in ~/.gnupg/private-keys.d/. No go for me, I'll stick to a dual ssh-agent / gpg-agent approach then.\nSome bonus tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*SSH agent's equivalent of max-cache-ttl-ssh can be specified when adding the key, for example: ssh-add -t 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n*To prevent storing the GPG passphrase in the agent, disable the agent. In newer GPG versions the option --no-use-agent is ignored, but you can prevent the agent from being used by clearing the related environment-variable. Some ways to do so:\necho | GPG_AGENT_INFO= gpg -s         # temporary\nexport GPG_AGENT_INFO=; echo | gpg -s # until the current shell is closed\n\n", "Q: Connect laptop using Ubuntu 11.04 to TV?

The following alternatives were tested with a Panasonic Viera Full-HD screen which nevertheless accepts only XGA (1024x768) and thereby a 4:3 aspect ratio as highest resolution on its VGA connector. Attached was a Lenovo IdeaPad S12 with a native resolution of 1280x800.\nFor the sharpest possible TV rendering: set aspect ratio on TV to 4:3. This will create black vertical left and right bars on the TV. Depending on the desired configuration, either choose dual screen operation and set auxiliary device (TV) to 1024*768, or use the \"same image on both screens\" feature of the respective settings tool and adapt overall resolution to 1024*768. For me, this is necessary if I want to play videos via Totem or VLC. In dual screen operation the video output window remains black, even though the sound is being played.\nFor the largest possible display on the TV: Set TV resolution to 16:9 (or automatic) but change pixel aspect ratio on the notebook for the secondary screen (in dual screen mode) to something around 1.4x1 by the appropriate xrandr command:\nsudo xrandr --output VGA1 --scale 1.4x1\n\nAfter that the simple and old Xwindows programs (like xterm) will look awkward since the typically used pixelized font structure is interpolated, but modern programs that utilize good scalable fonts will render quite a nice screen display.\n\nA: Found the way to solve it myself.

All my searching leads me to is gufw.\n\nA: There are no such firewalls for Linux. You are welcome to read a somewhat exhaustive discussion on the subject at ubuntuforums.org. To summarize, it pretty much boils down to the cliche - Linux != Windows.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1591340&highlight=application+based+firewall\n\nA: As far as I know the answer to both questions is unfortunately \"no\". \nDetails (but I'm going to simplify here anyway):\nfirewall that actively informs me when a certain program is trying to access the internet\n\n\n*\n\n*The kernel net filter that firewalls use does not work well on the application level, so it is not used for that purpose. Though it is generally possible to filter outgoing connections (for all programs), it is hard to do, as you can't block connections to port 80 (used for http - just used as an example here), which means that a rogue application can easily use that port to make connections.\n\n*Even if this was possible, it would be quite hard to implement, as the connections are either allowed or blocked (and not \"intercepted\" or \"paused\" as with e.g. ZoneAlarm) so you don't get a chance to actively allow or ban the request on-the-fly.\n\n*One option on an application level would be AppArmor (you can restrict connecting to the Internet among other things there), but it's not very beginner-friendly and granular.\n\n\nactively informs when a connection attempt is blocked from the internet\n\n\n*\n\n*It does if you configure it so - for instance ufw by default logs to /var/log/kern.log. Notification via system notifications is certainly possible though I don't know of any such program (for AppArmor it is apparmor-notify). \n\n\nA: From your software center there is an application called fwanalog.  It claims that it will analyse logged events from a configured iptables based firewall such a gufw.\nIt will write html logs which you can browse (/var/log/fwanalog) - results are displayed as both text statistics and as pie-charts etc.\nIts does not answer your \"active\" reports part of your question - but it will allow you to look at daily/weekly/monthly statistics of various connection and active blocking events.\nNote - if you are behind a router, you will probably get very little reports since most routers actively block connection attempts.\n", "Q: Why debuild warns about \"ignoring deletion of file\"? I want to build package for ppa. I use debuild -S -sa. But it ignore deletion of files from old source.Like:\ndpkg-source: warning: ignoring deletion of file sonata/rhapsodycovers.py\n\nAll you can see at paste.ubuntu.com\nWhy does it happens?\n\nA: This is intentional behaviour: packaging is not supposed to modify the contents of the upstream distributed tarball except in a scripted manner.\nIf you must remove the file for licensing reasons, you will need to modify the orig.tar.gz directly, and then use this as the basis for your packaging.  In this case, it is common to rename the upstream tarball from e.g. \"program-1.2.3.tgz\" to \"program-1.2.3+ds.orig.tar.gz\", with the \"ds\" indicating that the original source is modified for packaging.\nIf you are not required to remove the file, but prefer to have it removed such that the build completes successfully, it is recommended to remove it in the clean: rule in debian/rules.

Ideas?\n\nA: Instead of creating a cronjob for setting values as described by @Seppo Erviälä, you can make use of the configuration files of procps and sysfsutils.\n/proc/sys\nValues for /proc/sys can be set in the file /etc/sysctl.conf. To make echo 1500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs persistent, add a line with:\nvm.dirty_writeback_centisecs = 1500\n\nTo load the changes in /etc/sysctl.conf to the current session, run:\nsudo sysctl -p\n\n/sys\nFor setting values in /sys the package sysfsutils needs to be installed. The configuration file is located at /etc/sysfs.conf. To make echo 1 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save persistent, add a line with:\nmodule/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save = 1\n\nTo apply the values in /etc/sysfs.conf to the current session, run:\nsudo /etc/init.d/sysfsutils restart\n\n\nA: Do a sudo -s or a sudo su first:\n\nFrom a script:\n# more powersave\necho 1500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs\necho 1 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save\n# ./powersave \n# \n\nBest practice would be to ussue the sudo -s before activating the script (hence the #).\n\nA: EDIT: See answer by  @Lekensteyn for more proper way to edit /proc/sys and /sys defaults.\nRunning these suggestions from command line will only enable them for your current session and they will reset to defaults after a reboot. If you want to enable these suggestions each time your system starts you should make them into a script:\n#!/bin/dash\necho 1500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs\necho 1 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save\n\nYou can place this script somewhere convinient eg. /root/power_save.sh.\nThen you want to make sure it runs with root privileges each time your system starts. This can be done with sudo crontab -e which opens list of time based tasks for root. Add line:\n@reboot /root/power_save.sh\n\nDon't forget to make your script executable:\nsudo chmod u+x /root/power_save.sh\n\nThis way these power saving options will be enabled for all users, even before login, and no password is needed to authorize them each time.\n\nA: Your command doesn't work because the redirection > file is done by the current shell prior to the execution of the command, so before the sudo is in effect.\nThere is a command, called tee, that writes to a file and to stdout what it receives on its stdin: this is handy to write something to a file without redirection. If the file can be modified only by root, it is sufficient to prepend sudo to tee.\necho 1500 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs\n\nAnother way to obtain the desired result, mantaining the redirection, is to move the redirection to a subshell executed by root, through sudo:\nsudo sh -c 'echo 1500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs'\n\nLastly, you can enter a root shell in various ways, and you remain root until you exit explicitly that shell:\nsudo su\nsudo -s\nsudo bash\n\nFor more information see the manuale pages of sudo, su and of course of bash.\n", "Q: NetBeans IDE still on 6.9 version? I wonder why NetBeans 6.9 is still in Software Center and is not replaced by 7.0?\nI mean, the new Firefox package is published within a few hours after release, why is the NetBeans package not updated yet?\n\nA: Once Ubuntu is released only security fixes or fixes to major flaws are published in the stable release.

It has three USB2.0 ports onboard. I usually plug a mouse into one of them (I've got 3 different mice - in office, at home and for when on the go).\nSometimes, usually after laptop awakening from sleep, the mouse still works but cursor movements are choppy, as if the processor was extremely loaded (it's usually not). I found that if I re-plug the mouse cord into the other USB port, it works just fine. If I plug it back to problematic port, it is still choppy and remains choppy until next boot.\nOf course I want my mice to always work fine. Problem is: I cannot reproduce this behavior for sure, it happens sporadically but regularly. I use different USB ports (problem has ever happened on each of them since), I use different mice (each has failed me this way at least once), I cannot generally find what exactly is going wrong and why plugging to different port fixes the mouse instantly.\nSo I'd like to hear at least clues where to look at, what to try to identify my problem.\nA bit of update: while beginning this post, I had the issue once again. I have just replugged the mouse back to problematic port and it is not recognized at all. On the other port it works smoothly. \n\nA: Could this be a hardware problem? There are several USB port problems reported on different Lenovo models, see for example the links listed on their user forum.\n", "Q: Fonts are not embedded into a pdf? I have created a pdf file using the pdflatex command but some fonts are not embedded into it.  Please see the output of pdffonts. I have also checked \"updmap --edit\" to see whether the option \"pdftexDownloadBase14\" is true or not. It is true. But, still some fonts are not emebedded. Please help me to resolve this. \n\n\nA: This might not be the most relevant question for askubuntu, but I'll try to answer it nevertheless: You probably included graphics in your document that use the Helvetica font (a common example are the axis labels for figures created by Matlab), right? \nIf you used Helvetica in your document (e.g. with \\usepackage{helvet}), the Helvetica replacement Nimbus Sans L would be used instead.\nEmbedding the fonts from external figures is not possible at the moment (it should work if you make sure that the external figures embed the fonts themselves, though!).\nTherefore, as suggested in the comments, the only solution seems to be to do a PDF->PS->PDF conversion, e.g.:\npdf2ps file.pdf file.ps\nps2pdf14 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dEmbedAllFonts=true file.ps file.pdf\n\nUnfortunately, hyperlinks for example will not survive this transformation.\nSee this question on the (more relevant) tex.stackexchange sister site:\nhttps://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10391/how-to-embed-fonts-at-compile-time-with-pdflatex\n\nA: Another (I believe, better) alternative is to use ghostcript:\ngs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=${file}_FONTS-EMBEDDED.pdf ${file}.pdf\n\nIt is better because the resulting pdf is smaller and keeps a good behavior in text copying. In fact, this method embeds other fonts, in place of the original. But, the resulting pdf will have all fonts embedded. I found this method here.\n", "Q: How to recover from mistakenly chmod operation? I screwed up all my files permissions under a directory, how can I recover. Especially, how to change the files that is non-executable back to read-write-only?What I did wrong was that I chmod all the files and directories executable of the user.   \n\nA: In a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) you could remove the executable bit from all files and directories in that path:\nchmod a-x /the/screwed/up/path\n\nThen you could add the executable bit back to all directories:\nchmod a+X /the/screwed/up/path\n\nThis would leave you with no files in that path being executable for anyone, except for the directories being executable (searchable) for all users.\nIf you also want to apply this to all files in subdirectories in that path, add the -R option to both chmods.\n\nA: If you like to use gui you can also nautilus in terminal (if needed with gksudo) and click on the file, permissions and tick/untick executable.\n", "Q: How can I play .bin file with VLC?

I'm trying to get clonezilla to run off of a usb stick, and it seems that the right way to do that is via tuxboot.\nTuxboot is not compilable on ubuntu.  I used git to get it from the repository, and then when I run the 'install' script (because building it is apparently not allowed, since the build script just tries to install windows things).  Qmake-linux wants my qmake executable to be in the same directory as the stuff I pulled down, and let's just say that if there's a way to do this easily, I ain't seein' it.\nSo then I download the linux file, the most recent of which is tuxboot-linux-25.  Try to run it, get a failure that libpng12.so.0 isn't found.  OK, then I go to install that via the instructions I found on the web but firefox seems to have already deleted from my history (yay!)\nThen I add the /usr/local/lib directory to ldconfig via emacs (had to install that too, of course):\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=369848\nI still get the errors that libpng12.so.0 cannot be opened because 'No such file or directory'.  ldconfig -p | grep libpng shows that the library is there, but it still doesn't seem to be findable.  What to do next?\n(for the record, doing this in windows is painless-- download, click, and it's done.  But I'm trying to be all linuxy and get away from Windows for this...)\n\nA: I just downloaded tuxboot myself and had no problem to get it running in Ubuntu 10.04. You do not need to build it from source, you can download the *.bin file from the homepage.\nAfter that, open a terminal and navigate to the folder where tuxboot is, in my case this was ~/Downloads. Execute it with:\nsudo chmod +x tuxboot-linux-25-64bit\n\nReplace tuxboot-linux-25-64bit with the appropriate file name in case of different version (like 32-bit). After that run it with:\n./tuxboot-linux-25-64bit\n\n\nA: You can easily install tuxboot from the ppa:thomas.tsai/ubuntu-tuxboot PPA. Thus you don't need to compile it or to use the pre-compiled binaries from the project website. \n", "Q: Why might Ubuntu be slow for me while using Wubi? I'm new to Linux/Ubuntu in general. I just Wubi installed Ubuntu 11.04 w/Windows 7 on my Lenovo laptop - Intel i7 Quad Core 2Ghz, 4Gb ram, etc. etc... and for some reason Ubuntu is very laggy and slow.\nWhen I'm switching between programs (Chromium, folders, software center, etc..) it doesn't run as smoothly as Windows 7 (I have no more than 3 programs/windows up at a time...). I don't think it's my system requirements because Linux OSs are known to use low system resources. I installed it using Wubi - should I do a reinstall? I've already done all the recommended updates..\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 is still a bit buggy. It should pick up after a few more updates. Or try installing Unity 2D from the Software Center. This will definitely give you a noticeable boost of performance. It is a lot lighter on resources than the default Unity. :)\n\nA: The new Unity launcher in Ubuntu 11.4 isn't as fast as the system used to be. Try selecting the \"Ubuntu Classic\" option on the login page. It should fee a bit more snappy.\nWubi shouldn't cause any significant performance issues. I used Wubi for about 18 months without any problems. One thing to check is that you gave the system enough disk space. Really Ubuntu should be equally fast, if not a little sharper than windows even on old low spec machines.\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 was the first with Unity.  By now it's a more mature environment and many small things have been fixed or improved, so that it's much faster now than in the past.  I think if you try it now (12.04 is due to be released tomorrow) you'll find it much snappier and more responsive.\n\nA: If you are using the proprietary NVIDIA drivers make sure your xorg.conf file contains the RenderAccel and UseEvents directives.\nWARNING: Editing this file directly can be dangerous. Make sure you follow the instructions exactly.\nFirst backup your origional xorg.conf file and then edit the existing copy. To do this:\nOpen a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and type:\nsudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\nsudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nThen scroll down until you find Section \"Device\". If this section doesn't already contain the following statements, add them:\nOption    \"RenderAccel\" \"on\"\nOption    \"UseEvents\" \"True\"\n\nThen hit Ctrl+X then press Y and Enter to save. Then restart your machine and let us know if this helped.\n", "Q: Upgrade to Xubuntu 11.04 Breaks Wireless When I tried to connect at 2 different places. The little connection icon would circle forever before eventually prompting for password. \nI have triple checked all network keys & then some.\nEven with my home network I now have to revert to 10.04 LTS Lucid Lynx (dual boot) or wired Ethernet. \nNot even sure where to start trouble shooting TBH?\nMy card is a Edimax EW-7108PCg PCMCIA card which I bought for it's out the box Linux compatibility.  Hardware is an IBM Thinkpad T21.\n\nA: Delete the connection and redo it. Of course not sure it will work, but ........\n", "Q: GPG Workflow in 11.04 At work we handle the transfer of small bits of sensitive data with GPG, usually posted on a secure internal website.\nUntil Firefox 4 was released, we used FireGPG for inline decryption; however the IPC libraries that it relied upon were no longer present in FF4, rendering it unusable. With the launch of Firefox 5, FireGPG will no longer install.\nCurrently I'm manually pasting the GPG blocks into a text file, then using the Nautilus context-menu plugin or the command line to decrypt the contents of the file. When we're handling a large amount of these small files throughout the day this starts to become a real chore.\nI've looked around but can't seem to find much information on useful GPG clients in Ubuntu. A client that allowed me to paste in a GPG block and instantly decrypt it, and also paste in plaintext and easily encrypt it for multiple recipients would be ideal.\nSo my question is does this exist? I can't seem to find anything about this with obvious searches on Google, so hopefully someone here can help, or offer an alternative workflow.\n\nA: Just type gpg --decrypt in the terminal, paste your code and press CTRL-D. You should then see the decrypted result.\n\nA: Here is a Python wrapper I wrote that will work on any version of linux(Providing it has nano/pico which most do):\nhttp://pastie.org/2797070\n\nA: Use:\ngpg --output [decrypted file] --decrypt [encrypted file]\n\nSo you could make a shell script (bash) or similar that decrypts every file you put in a directory:\n#!/bin/bash\nmkdir decrypted\nfor i in * do\n    if test -f \"$i\" then\n       gpg --output $i --decrypt \"decrypted/$i\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nUntested, but theoretically this or something similar would work. Perl or Python would also be good alternatives to the shell.\n\nA: In case this question doesn't get answered (perhaps this functionality just doesn't exist now, although that seems hard to believe) the command line can be used to produce an ASCII Armor (.asc) file containing the GPG ciphertext block.\ngpg  --armor --recipient [Recipient ID] --encrypt [File to Encrypt] --output [Output File].asc\n\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu ever push new versions of GCC into the package repository between releases? Current version of GCC in Ubuntu 11.04 is 4.5.2. For certain C++0x features, I need GCC version 4.6, but would like to avoid compiling from source. Is there hope that Ubuntu will update GCC in the package repository before the next release in October (11.10).\nThis question asks a similar thing except for an earlier version of Ubuntu and GCC.\nA second part of the question, if the answer is \"no\" to the first, then can I hope to see it appear in Ubuntu's unstable repository?\n\nA: I don't think they will change the compiler version in a release, because everything is compiled with the version provided in the package repositories. A new major version of gcc would require a total recompilation and thus re-installation of every package to maintain compatibility.\nBy the way, compiling gcc from source is surprisingly easy, in my humble opinion.\n\nA: It's also possible that newer packages exist for GCC in a PPA or third party repository. But compiling from source is often the way to go if you want the very latest release.\n", "Q: How to use RDP protocol in Remote Desktop Viewer? I am using a Natty Live-USB, and the Remote Desktop Viewer application (Applications -> Internet -> Remote Desktop Viewer) only shows SSH & VNC protocols.\nHow can I include RDP in the list, in order to connect to existing Windows Remote Desktop sessions on Windows XP machines.\nI am aware that I can use the gnome-rdp application, or even rdesktop hostname from a terminal, but I would like to create a persistent LiveUSB that uses Remote Desktop Viewer to connect to Windows RDP (port 3389).\nI do not want to set up VNC, TeamViewer or any others, as these do not solve my problem due to the fact they need additional software on the remote hosts.\n\nA: The versions of vinagre (the application you mention) included with all released versions of Ubuntu do not support the RDP protocol (the feature was added in 2.31.4, while Ubuntu 11.04 comes with 2.30.3).\nSo there are basically three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for a new Ubuntu version with an updated version of vinagre (the next release should be sufficient).\n\n*Use some other application to connect to RDP servers such as tsclient.\n\n*Acquire an updated version of vinagre from some other source.\n\n\nA: As the description says, Remote Desktop Viewer aka vinagre supports SSH and VNC.\nThe standard tool used in Ubuntu for RDP is Terminal Server Client aka tsclient, so use that.\n\nA: Vinagre does not support the rdp protocol. I would recommend either the default \"Terminal Server Client\", which offers a whole lot of options, and the remmina client, which is quite similar to vinagre, and offers RDP as well.\n", "Q: How can i get ubuntu to run smoother? I am relatively new to ubuntu [I've used it before and loved it but one day i just randomly couldn't connect to the internet anymore so i switched back to windows... also netflix doesn't work in ubuntu...] and I've noticed that when i used it before everything ran very smoothly and the window animations and stuff like that were just beautiful. now though, everything is choppy and just ugly really. I wanna say its because i was using an older kernel but i really don't know.\nAnyway, i guess my point is, How can i get it to look pretty again? i really do wish i could be more descriptive but...

How does the installer calculate what size of swap partition to create? Presumably it's based on installed RAM size, but does that depend on how much RAM?\n\nA: Actually there is no dphys-swapfile program on a default Ubuntu installation CD and it is not used to calculate the swap size.\nWhat happens is that the ubiquity installer uses the partman-auto scripts and configuration files (called recipes) to determine the sizes of all partitions. It works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partman finds the right recipe file according to the type of the computer and the option the user has chosen.\n\n*There it finds the minimum and maximum size of the partition and its priority. For swap it can be 96 (min - in MB) 512 (priority) 300% (max).\n\n*Then it gets the RAM size (via /proc/meminfo).\n\n*It uses its own algorithm to calculate the sizes.\n\n\nDetails:\nA recipe file can look like this:\n1 1 1 free\n    $iflabel{ gpt }\n    method{ biosgrub } .\n\n500 10000 -1 $default_filesystem\n    $lvmok{ }\n    method{ format }\n    format{ }\n    mountpoint{ / } .\n\n96 512 300% linux-swap\n    $lvmok{ }\n    method{ swap }\n    format{ } .\n\nThe algorithm to calculate the sizes:\nfor(i=1;i<=N;i++) {\n   factor[i] = priority[i] - min[i];\n}\nready = FALSE;\nwhile (! ready) {\n   minsum = min[1] + min[2] + ... + min[N];\n   factsum = factor[1] + factor[2] + ... + factor[N];\n   ready = TRUE;\n   for(i=1;i<=N;i++) {\n      x = min[i] + (free_space - minsum) * factor[i] / factsum;\n      if (x > max[i])\n         x = max[i];\n      if (x != min[i]) {\n         ready = FALSE;\n         min[i] = x;\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nFor more see:\n\n\n*\n\n*partman-auto-recipe.txtWay Back Machine\n\n* http://dev.blankonlinux.or.id/browser/pattimura/ubiquity/d-i/source/partman-auto/lib/recipes.sh?rev=pattimura%2Cubiquity%2C261 DEAD LINK\n\nA: This is going to be rather technical but was fun to find out so here goes...\n\n*\n\n*I found a package dphys-swapfile and here is the Source code. Option setup is used to set it up:\n\nsetup - tells dphys-swapfile  to compute the optimal swap file size and\n(re-)generate an fitting swap file. Default it 2 times RAM size.\nThis  can  be called at boot time, so the file allways stays the\nright size for current RAM, or run by hand whenever RAM size has\nchanged.\n\n*\n\n*Inside dphys-swapfile is a setting conf_swapsize for a pre-defined size (in Natty this is empty):\n\nsize we want to force it to be, default (empty) gives 2*RAM\nCONF_SWAPSIZE=\nand a setting for a swapfactor...\nthis is what we want, 2 times RAM size\nSWAPFACTOR=2\n\n\n*\n\n*The actual size is calculated a bit further on:\nif [ \"${CONF_SWAPSIZE}\" = \"\" ] ; then\n    # compute automatic optimal size\n    echo -n \"computing size, \"\n    # this seems to be the nearest to physical RAM size, lacks about 60k\n    KCORESIZE=\"`ls -l /proc/kcore | awk '{ print $5 }'`\"\n    # make MBytes which rounded down will be exactly 1 too few, so add 1\n    MEMSIZE=\"`expr \"${KCORESIZE}\" / 1048576 + 1`\"\n    # default, without config file overwriding, swap=2*RAM\n    CONF_SWAPSIZE=\"`expr \"${MEMSIZE}\" '*' \"${SWAPFACTOR}\"`\"\n  fi\nAs you can see the way they calculate it in this package depends on the size of /proc/kcore, then gets divided by 1048576, +1 to round it up and then gets multiplied by swapfactor. From my machine:\n\nSo the default for this system would be 1065349120 / 1048576 = 1015+1 = 1016 * 2 = 2032 MBytes.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get Team Fortress 2 working? Team Fortress 2 is now free to play! Is there an easy way to get a copy working on Ubuntu Natty?\n\nA: Team Fortress 2 works pretty well for me, as well as a bunch of other games that use Source engine.\nI recommend you to use plain Wine without PlayOnLinux. Winetricks is helpful, however.\nSteam Games on Linux website has detailed information about which games can be played successfully, and what you have to do for that.\nTeam Fortress 2 on that website (Status: playable)\n\n\n*\n\n*First you have to Install the latest Wine.  \n\n*Make sure to configure Wine (look at STEAM + WINE CONFIGURATION section)\nHow to use Winetricks:\n\n*\n\n*Select the default wineprefix OK\n\n*Install a Windows DLL or component OK\n\n*It is important to mark d3dx9 here. Optional packages that may be needed for some games: d3dx10, vb6run, vcrun2005, vcrun2008, vcrun2010, physx. OK\n\n*Install a font OK\n\n*Mark corefonts and tahoma. OK\n\n\n*Next, download Steam and go through the installer.  \n\n*When you create an account or just log in, you should have no trouble downloading Team Fortress 2 through Steam and playing it.  \n\n*Make sure to change video settings in the game to lowest ASAP (don't miss the \"advanced\" video settings). Windowed mode is mostly better. It is good to restart the game after this.\n\n\nA: Overview\nThe installation of Team Fortress 2 involves installing Steam and then installing Team Fortress itself.  Team Fortress on Wine needs a fairly decent graphics card - NVidia preferably - capable of running DirectX 9/10 etc.  I've tried these instructions on my laptop running Intel HD integrated graphics - it does run but the framerate is not brilliant.\nInstalling Steam\nOne of the simplest ways to install Steam is to use PlayOnLinux available as a deb which you can download and install from here.\nRun PlayOnLinux from menu option Games - PlayOnLinux (or if from Natty, just search for playonlinux from the dash)\nClick on the Install button and search for Steam.  Follow the instructions on screen to install Steam.  When prompted create a desktop icon for Steam\nInstalling Team Fortress 2\nDouble click the Steam Icon on the desktop.\nSign in (or create an account).\nClick \"Add a Game\" on the lower left of the Steam Application.  Select Team Fortress 2.\nFollow on the instructions for the install - create a desktop icon for Team Fortress 2\nSit back and wait for the download\nRun the application from Steam and select Team Fortress 2.\nWait until the application has started.  Then quit the game.\nFinal Configuration\nRe-run PlayOnLinux - Click on the Install Button and this time search for Team Fortress 2.  When asked, choose the option \"Already Installed\".\nFollow the wizard and select options most appropriate to you.\nNow have fun\nThat's it - launch Steam from your desktop and run Team Fortress 2 from there.\n\nA: According to this test result it should work fine with Wine on Natty. And here's a tutorial to install Steam in Wine.\nHaven't tried it myself though...\n", "Q: Error while compiling ffmpeg during make I want to install ffmpeg on ubuntu. and following this article http://pasindudps.blogspot.com/2010/12/compiling-ffmpeg-in-ubuntu-1010.html but when m doing make after config\nThen go to the ffmpeg folder.\ncd ffmpeg\nStart the installation\n./configure --enable-gpl --enable-version3 --enable-nonfree --enable-postproc \\\n--enable-libfaac --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libopencore-amrnb \\\n--enable-libopencore-amrwb --enable-libtheora --enable-libvorbis \\\n--enable-libvpx --enable-libx264 --enable-libxvid --enable-x11grab\nmake\n\ngiving this error\n/home/reach121/ffmpeg/libavcodec/x86/cabac.h:93: undefined reference to `ff_h264_norm_shift'\n/home/reach121/ffmpeg/libavcodec/x86/cabac.h:93: undefined reference to `ff_h264_lps_range'\n/home/reach121/ffmpeg/libavcodec/x86/cabac.h:93: undefined reference to `ff_h264_norm_shift'\n/home/reach121/ffmpeg/libavcodec/x86/cabac.h:93: undefined reference to `ff_h264_mlps_state'\n/home/reach121/ffmpeg/libavcodec/x86/cabac.h:93: undefined reference to `ff_h264_norm_shift'\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\nmake: *** [ffmpeg_g] Error 1\n\nPlease suggest why this error is coming and what to do to solve this problem\n\nA: The Ubuntu version of ffmpeg comes without support for restricted formats like MP3, but you can fix that by installing packages that include that support. So to fix your initial problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purge the existing installation of ffmpeg (if any):\nsudo apt-get purge ffmpeg\n\n\n*Install ffmpeg:\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\n\n*To install the restricted formats, you need to enable the Multiverse and Universe repositories. Open the file /etc/apt/sources.list:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nand uncomment the lines ending with multiverse and universe. If you don't have such lines, just append the following to the file:\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick multiverse\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick multiverse\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick-updates multiverse\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick-updates multiverse\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick-security multiverse\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick-security multiverse\n\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick universe\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick universe\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick-updates universe\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick-updates universe\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick-security universe\ndeb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu maverick-security universe\n\nSave (Ctrl + o , Enter) and exit (Ctrl +   x).\nNow update the package list by running:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install support for restricted formats like MP3:\nsudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra-52\n\nNow something like:\n ffmpeg -i in.wav out.mp3\n\nshould work.\n", "Q: Is the GT430/GT520 enough for 1080p flash?

My 8800 GTS is capable, and is significantly less powerful then either of those cards.  \nThe official recommendation for system specs from Adobe for 1080p playback on Linux are;\n1.8GHz Intel Core Duo, AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+, or faster processor \n512MB of RAM\n64MB of graphics memory\n\nIn addition a list of NVidia GPUs which support hardware acceleration with Flash 10.3.  I should note that this requires the proprietary NVidia driver with VDPAU. \n\nA: I have nvidia 9800GTX+ and 1080p videos work smooth without any problems.

I installed Ubuntu on it and it works fine, but everytime she tried to boot Windows on it (fortunately rarely) it fails and the computer is unable to boot any OS anymore.\nUpon boot, the computer stops on a black screen with a GRUB Rescue prompt.\nIs there any way to restore GRUB without re-installing Ubuntu? (preferably an easy way as I cannot do it for her and she is not extremely computer literate)\nAlso (but less important), is there a way to configure GRUB (or something else) so that Windows won't destroy it on every boot attempt?\n\nA: Reinstalling Grub2: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20GRUB2\n\nA: To reinstall GRUB2 see also e.g. this answer.\nTo avoid this happen in the future we need to deinstall all Windows rescue/security and more software that may overwrite the MBR of your harddisk.\nDepending on the software your friend runs on Windows, and in the case she only rarely needs it you may also want to consider to run Windows in Virtual Box. If it is not for gaming there are invaluable advantages over a dual-boot situation (e.g. run Windows without reboot, run Windows parallel, share data on the fly, share clipboard).

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm stumped.\n\nA: The DESTDIR environment variable is defined in the GNU coding standards:\n\nDESTDIR is a variable prepended to each installed target file.\n...\nIf your installation step would normally install\n  /usr/local/bin/foo and /usr/local/lib/libfoo.a, then an\n  installation invoked as in the example above would install\n  /tmp/stage/usr/local/bin/foo and /tmp/stage/usr/local/lib/libfoo.a\n  instead.\nPrepending the variable DESTDIR to each target in this way\n  provides for \"staged installs\", where the installed files are not\n  placed directly into their expected location but are instead copied\n  into a temporary location (DESTDIR).  However, installed files\n  maintain their relative directory structure and any embedded file names\n  will not be modified.\n\nThis is the way the debhelper scripts expect your make file to behave.  So if you want your program to appear in /usr/bin when the package is installed, then you should copy the program to $(DESTDIR)/usr/bin (creating that directory structure if it doesn't exist).\n", "Q: How to make a Stop Motion or Time-lapse video with webcam? I have a webcam that works as a v4l2 device. \nWhat is the most convenient way to capture either a stop-motion or time-lapse video?\nN.B.\nstop-motion and time-lapse are related but conceptually different. \nTime-lapse is where you take a photo of a scene at a set interval and then combine it into a video (that looks like it's going really fast). \nStop-motion is where you control the scene and take an image for every change you make, to form an animation (eg Wallace and Grommit). \nAn application for time-lapse needs to be able to take a photo at a set interval.\n\nA: To capture every X amount of seconds from a webcam use motion. \nInstall motion\nsudo apt-get install motion or sudo aptitude install motion\nConfigure motion for every X amount of seconds\nsudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf\nChange the variables minimum_frame_time and snapshot_interval to the same amount of seconds you wish to take the picture with the webcam.\n10 Minutes = 600 Seconds\n20 Minutes = 1200 Seconds\n30 Minutes = 1800 Seconds\n1 Hour = 3600 Seconds\n2 Hours = 7200 Seconds and so on...\nrun motion with sudo motion stop it with CTRL+C\nNOTE - Configure motion.conf to save the files in another directory than the default /tmp. For example your home folder. Since going to /tmp needs more privileges. You will also find many useful options in the motion.conf for many other things you might like.\n\nA: gTimelapse (Download Link)\n\n\nAn application for capturing images to generate timelapse videos, built on gPhoto2 and wxWidgets libraries.\n\nCompile instructions\nDownload the source from the sourceforge website\nin a terminal type the following:\ncd Downloads \ngunzip gtimelapse-0.1.tar.gz\ntar -xvf gtimelapse-0.1.tar\ncd gtimelapse\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libgphoto2-2-dev libwxbase2.8-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev gphoto2\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nTo run the application type\ngtimelapse &\n\nn.b. 1\ngphoto2 --list-cameras | more\n\nn.b. 2\nsee this blog for further useful info\nlists all compatible devices that the application supports\nn.b. 3\nI've read the gphoto2 does not support webcams - I'll leave this answer visible anyway just in-case anyone wants to try this answer with a decent digital camera instead of a webcam.\n\nA: Capturing a zillion images.\nThe first step is capturing images. Let's imagine you want to take a photo once every 10 seconds and save that into a directory sitting on your desktop\nmkdir ~/Desktop/cap\ncd ~/Desktop/cap\n\nWe use streamer to do the capture so let's install it:\nsudo apt-get install streamer\n\nAnd now we want to capture\nstreamer -o 0000.jpeg -s 300x200 -j 100 -t 2000 -r 1\n\n-t is the number of frames we want to capture. -r is frames per second. So this should grab one frame every second. If you compress that down into a 30fps video, one minute of capture becomes 2 seconds of video. You'll want to tune this appropriately depending on how much output video you want.\nThat line will give you 2000 images, it'll take half an hour to record and, at 30fps, will generate just over 1 minute of video.\nPutting it all together\nI'm going to use ffmpeg. There are many different ways of putting it together including mencoder but I just prefer ffmpeg's outlook on life. After installing it (sudo apt-get install ffmpeg) just wang out this:\nffmpeg -r 30 -i %04d.jpeg -s hd480 -vcodec libx264 -vpre hq time-lapse.mp4\n\nThe quality settings there aren't anything like that of my webcam so you might want to play around with the options a lot more to get a better encode, but that should generate you a nice 30fps video, compressed up in x264.\nYou might want to play around with the framerate (-r) but I wouldn't go below 15fps.\n\nA: \nA quick, dirty, but somewhat more flexible option is as follows:\nffmpeg -pattern_type glob -framerate 25 -i 'image-*.jpg' -c:v libx264 \\\n    -profile:v high -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n\nHere I am adding -pattern_type glob, using the wildcard *, and putting my file name in single quotations: 'image-*.jpg'.\nThe benefit: This syntax allows you to start at any number and have any pattern in your numbering (I often create a count by 20, starting around 20000 for example).\nThe drawbacks: This syntax does not allow you to skip repeating figures like the '%##d' syntax allows. Also, you cannot have a numbering scheme without preceding 0s. That is, the file naming scheme  must be something like 00001, 00002,...00033... (Numbering cannot be 1,2,3,...33,..., else the number '3' will sort between '39' and '40' for example).\nSeparately, also note that I had to put my input file name in single quotation marks, otherwise ffmpeg tried to overwrite all of my picture files with a copy of the first picture (It is always a good idea to copy for a backup before manipulating files).\n\nFrom this edit by an anonymous user.\n\nA: I've used Stopmotion to do this, it's in the software center. You can also capture with Cheese, but you have to alter Cheese's configuration to boost the max number of images. I found it easiest to just use Stopmotion for the entire process.\n\nA: The best and easy way to do this is by installing Motion. It's full-scale surveillance software for Linux-based operating systems.\n\n\nA: You should be able to set up motion (in motion.conf) to stream - by default it streams on port 8081. All you then have to do to get your 'rear view' mirror is to open VLC,  \"Open Network Stream\" and point it at http://localhost:8081.\n\nA: Camorama is a webcam viewer/recorder which I've used to take pictures, at 1 minute intervals and upload them to a webserver, from my webcam; it's a straightforward setup. Also it's available in the Ubuntu Software Center or you can install it using:\nsudo apt-get install camorama\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Not all updates can be installed warning when installing Gnome 3 When installing GNOME3 on natty, I got this at the Update Manager. All the items related to GNOME can not be checked.\nI'm also trying to install via command line, but the download speed of the dist-upgrade is really slow. \nWhat is the cause of the warning? And how to handle it? \n\nA: Can you try the following first?\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nStart by closing the Update Manager first... \nI am suspecting that the update part is not properly completed.\nIf that is the case, just doing the update part successfully (without errors) on the command line and then trying with Synaptic or the command line upgrade should work without further errors. Download speed is a different problem tho.\n\nA: I was having a very similar problem. My update manager would always report \"Not all updates could be installed\". Whenever I tried this:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI got this:\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n  0ad 0ad-data ginn libgrip0 linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic touchegg\n\nThen I did:\nsudo apt-get purge touchegg 0ad 0ad-data\n\nBecause I knew I didn't need those anyway.\nAfter that the command line was still giving me the same as above. Then, for no particular reason, I did System Settings > Details and clicked the Install updates button. For my surprise it installed all those packages without any issues..\nVery weird..  hope this helps.\n\nA: AFAIK, the reasons for the warning may be:\nMain reason:\n\nIf the dependencies have changed on one of the packages you have\n  installed so that a new package must be installed to perform the\n  upgrade then that will be listed as \"kept-back\".\n\nIn this case I'd recommend waiting for the dependency to be updated to new version, this would make the \"kept back\" packages no longer worth keeping back.\nOther solutions: dependency is there but was not found\nExcerpt from fossfreedom's answer to similar question:\n\nI have found sometimes the package manager cannot cope with the extent of the changes a particular PPA is requesting to be updated.\n\nPackage requires dependency, that is perhaps satisfied by other packages (I'm not clear on how different updating tools deal with this, but not all of them find out that package they are yet to install fulfils the dependency of the package currently being installed). Then, you may either:\n\n\n*\n\n*do a dangerous dist-upgrade which may break your distribution, \n\n*or upgrade by hand apt install list-of-packages-here \n\n*or just get at them one by one: sudo apt install package1, then package2... (if you want to know which is problematic)\n\n*or use another tool (like Synaptic or aptitude) to try if it will have that problem\n\n\nWorth noting that it's Ubuntu 16.04 where apt-get install can be shortened to apt install.\nDo you need them?\nTaking a look at your kept-back package, I think sometimes you will have precisely the same thoughts as @lpanebr, who purged them (see his answer).\nFinally: pinned packages and broken dependencies\nThere are options for safe upgrades or fixing broken dependencies. man your-tool-name-here should list them. IIRC it would be apt install -f packageName or aptitude --safe-upgrade but I'm not certain.\nAs for pinned packages - I know there is an option to pin a package, to make it non-updatable. However I've never done this, so can't offer details.\n", "Q: Why isn't .profile sourced on login to LXDE? I switched recently from GNOME to LXDE and since then my .profile file hasn't been sourced on login. I found out that my PATH variable doesn't include ~/bin anymore. However, my .profile file includes PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\" while PATH's content is /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games.\nIs it intended that LXDE doesn't read this file on login? If yes, what file should I use to add the bin folder to the PATH variable? If not, to what package should I report a bug?\n\nA: I dont think that there is any requirement/standard for Desktop Environments to execute .profile at startup.

If the background is made up of multiple colors, just repeat these three steps as necessary.\n\nA: I've found the following to be easiest for me and I really like the effect.\n# Select Foreground\nMain Menu > Tools > Selection Tools > Foreground Select\n# Select Background\nMain Menu > Select > Invert\n# Make Transparent\nMain Menu > Colors > Color To Alpha\nDone\n\nA: *\n\n*Select: Layer → Transparency → Add Alpha Channel\n\n*Select: Background with Fuzzy Selection Tool (Magic Wand)\n\n*Select: Layer → Transparency → Threshold Alpha...\n\n*Set Threshold to 255 for complete transparency.\n\nA: Beware of simplistic solutions\nOn CGI (logos, text), the smooth edges are produced with anti-aliasing pixels. These pixels have a color which is a mix of the background color and the subject color. When you use the color selector or the fuzzy selector, these pixels are either selected fully (if they are close enough) or not at all, depending on threshold. If you then bluntly Delete, you either get a halo with the color of the removed background (Threshold 15) or a jagged edge (Threshold 100) or both:\n\n\nA good solution\nThe good solution is to replace the background color by transparency, in proportion of its contribution to the color mix. In Gimp there are two ways to achieve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Colors>Color to alpha\n\n*Color erase mode, as a paint tool mode, or since Gimp 2.10 as a layer blend mode.\n\n\nThey both replace the pixel by the most transparent pixel, which, put over the removed color, re-produces the initial color. If you remove red from purple, you get a semi transparent blue, because semi-transparent blue over red produces purple. If you remove white from gray, you get a very transparent black pixel and not a not-so-transparent dark gray pixel, because among several solution Gimp picks the most transparent one.\nFor instance, using Color-to-alpha to remove the red gives this:\n\n\nYou will notice that in the 2.8 results, there are darker pixels that are due to Gimp 2.8 working on gamma-corrected values (the result is still vastly better than the jagged edges you get with simpler methods). Gimp 2.10 works in \"linear light\" and has no such problems. \nRefinements\nIn the general case, the subject may have parts that are close to the color of the background. So if you apply the technique above these parts become transparent (or partially transparent). Avoiding this is simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the wand to select the background. The usual threshold (15) is fine. \n\n*Select>Grow the selection so that it covers the anti-aliasing pixels. On a clean image (PNG, with no JPG history) you don't need to grow by more than one pixel. If the image is dirty (JPEG artifacts), growing the selection by two or three pixels can be necessary.\n\n*Apply color-to-alpha. The pixels inside the subject, bieng excluded from the selection, won't be altered. Color to alpha will be applied to the background and the edge pixels, where it matters.\n\n\nOutput file types\n\n\n*\n\n*JPEG doesn't support transparency\n\n*GIF supports binary transparency (all opaque or all transparent) so your semi-transparent edge pixels are going to be altered. You can use `Layer>Transparency>Semi-flatten to fill the transparency of these edge pixels with a new color (the color of the background on which the GIF will be used).\n\n*PNG has full support for partial transparency and is currently the preferred format.\n\n*WEBP is a new Google-sponsored format that can be lossy or lossless, and supports partial transparency. Gimp 2.10 supports it, but you have to ensure that it is supported where you want to use it (it won't be supported in older browsers, for instance).\n\n\nA: Imagemagick\nMaybe a better solution from here but using ImageMagick -transparent is\nconvert file.gif -transparent white -fuzz 10% file-2.gif`.\n\nYou could use \"#ededee\" to specify the color in hexadecimal.\nGimp\nProbably more complicated but there is an option to work with multiple layers/frames at once with this solution.\n", "Q: external usb hard drive is not being seen anymore I think my problem is a little different than several other similar titled questions.\nEverything started while I was using 10.10. External drive was always recognized and mounted, but the timing of this differed. I mean when I booted, the OS sometimes saw the drive immediately, sometimes after a few minutes, sometimes after hours. Although this was annoying, I tolerated this somehow.\nThen this problem persisted after I upgraded to 11.04 with a clean install. Afterwards, the drive became totally invisible to the OS. It is not even detected as an usb device anymore.\nHowever, there is one thing I can do to make it seen. If I boot to another operating system which can detect the drive, and then boot back to ubuntu, everything is perfect. but this is of course very impractical. \nTo summarize, the usb drive is recognized by ubuntu if and only if another OS in the same computer could recognize it first. I should also say I have not had any problems with the same drive in any other OS or a different computer. \nMy drive is philips with a hitachi hdd inside, has its own power source and any other usb powered drives have never caused this kind of a problem.\nI've tried almost all recommendations in similar topics but none of them seems to be related to this one. What can I possibly do to fix this?\n\nA: It sounds like the state of the USB hardware isn't being properly initialized (in the USB logic in the enclosure). I suspect once you've fully booted Ubuntu, if you power cycle your enclosure, give it a few seconds, then plug it in over USB, that you'll be able to use it normally. If not, please post the last 30 lines or so of \"dmesg\" from about 10 seconds after plugging the drive in.\nI suppose it's remotely possible this could be a missing kernel module too, but I really doubt that.\n", "Q: Can you still install Ubuntu 10.10 with Wubi?

I'm currently having a problem with my bootup process that is growing progressively worse as time goes on:\nWhile booting, it does a few minutes of hard-drive reading.  During that, instead of showing a boot splash screen, it shows various dashes and dots, as if the video card isn't recognizing.  The splash screen actually has colors similar to the splash screen (purple), it simply is garbled.  It then does a few minutes of hard-drive reads, and if I leave it long enough, sometimes it boots into the desktop (and auto-logs-in).  Sometimes, unfortunately, it just hangs on that garbled screen and reads from the hard-drive forever.\nNotably, I've also stopped being able to access grub during bootup (perhaps it is just not displayed correctly by the video, hard to tell).\nThis is a symptom that has grown over the course of various ubuntu upgrades, at least I suspect that the upgrade process is leaving behind cruft. So, is there a safe way for me to \"refresh\" the boot system so that it is clean, new, fast, and reliable?

Xorg has no account management capabilities at all.  The wording of that document is inaccurate.  It probably really means to log out of your window manager, and exit Xorg.\nIn practice, this probably means killing your X display manager (xdm, kdm, or gdm).

AAC, MP3) if you want the file to be playable with something else than VLC.\n\nA: Perhaps the easiest tool for that is ffmpeg, or avconv from the libav-tools package. Libav is a fork of FFmpeg, which Ubuntu switched to for a few years until Ubuntu 15.04. It is one of the backends for many of the GUI tools mentioned in other answers.\nChanging container without re-enconding content could not be simpler:\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -codec copy output.mp4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It auto-detects a Matroska to MP4 container conversion based on input/output filenames.\n\n*-codec copy stream copies, or \"re-muxes\", the streams from the input to the output without re-encoding. Think of it like a copy and paste.\n\n*Default stream selection behavior is to select only one stream per stream type. For example, if your input has two video streams and one audio stream then only the video stream with the largest frame size will be selected. Add -map 0 if you want to select all streams from the input.\n\n*Some containers may not support some formats. So check if your chosen container format, be it mkv, mp4 or even avi has support for all the content in your files (video, audio, subtitles, data, etc).

Will the LTS repo provide the latest and greatest of Firefox and any other softwares treated the same way?

That said, as soon as Firefox 3.6 reaches EoL, it will, most likely, be upgraded on all supported releases. The same principle applies to the regular releases, for example, Firefox 4.01 is EoL, and consequently got upgraded in Natty.\nEdit: Firefox 9 is now available from the repositories for both Lucid and Maverick, in line with the earlier decision to migrate the users of those releases to the current version of Firefox.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseNotes/FirefoxRapidReleaseMigration\n\nA: If you enable ubuntu-proposed updates, you will get the firefox 9.0.1 from there.

Attached to it are various PCs (that do not necessarily have a host-based firewall on them) that have addresses out of my 216.228.15.0/24 block statically set.

I have a doubt regarding the installation of ubuntu 11.04 on my Thinkpad Laptop.\nCurrently, my laptop has dual boot namely Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows XP.\nWhen i tried with live cd of ubuntu 11.04 for installation, i have the following option\n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh installation\n\n*Upgrading 10.04 to 11.04 with files retained\n\n*Erasing 10.04 and installing 11.04 (all the previous software and documents will be erased).\n\n\nIf i choose option 3, will my Windows XP unaffected?\n\nA: Yes, the software and documents that are referred are the ones on your Ubuntu installation, not your Windows one.\nNevertheless, it's always a good idea to backup your files and documents before upgrading. Preferably with disk cloning software, so you can revert back if you're not satisfied.\n\nA: Just to clarify:\n\nThe option \"upgrade 10.04 to 11.04\" is not like upgrading 10.04 to 11.04 via an upgrade to 10.10.. This option means that all data from your /home will be preserved but you will have to reinstall your idividual applications and you will also have to create your users again. User setting from these applications (including passwords in the keyring) will be preserved.\n\"Upgrade from 10.04 to 11.04\" therefore is like a clean installation (i.e. \"Erase Ubuntu and reinstall\") but without formatting your drive and without erasing /home.\nAs with all OS upgrades it is strongly recommended to backup your data before you proceed.\nYour Windows partition(s) will only be touched and deleted by choosing \"Erase everything\".\n", "Q: Which open source twitter clients properly support both twitter lists and read/unread?

Does anybody know a way to add Fedora 14 to grub.cfg of Ubuntu so I can choose which OS to boot?  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The easiest way to boot Fedora would be to add an entry to grub.cfg that chain loads to Fedora's copy of Grub.\nCreate a file /etc/grub.d/15_fedora with the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\ncat << \\EOF\nmenuentry \"Fedora\" {\n    set root=(hd0,3)\n    chainloader +1\n}\nEOF\n\nMake the file executable and then regenerate the grub configuration file:\nsudo chmod a+x /etc/grub.d/15_fedora\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis should ensure that the menu entry stays around when the Grub configuration is regenerated.\n\nA: Have you tried Grub-Customizer GUI; its really simple and scans your machine to look for other OS installations when you run the program.\nI just recently installed Fedora 15 alongside Kubuntu 11.04 and Windows 7; when installing I choose not to install grub through Fedora at all (not on the MBR or on Fedora's partition).  I booted back into Ubuntu and ran this program to update Grub menu entries.  So far I've booted into Ubuntu and Fedora (rarely use Windows 7 anymore so haven't tested that entry yet) and everything works fine.\n\nA: I understand that fedora is your second OS. May be you have the following issue:\nTo make grub recognize other OSes, os-prober needs to be installed and the related GRUB configuration file needs to be existent and executable.\nMake sure you've os-prober installed:\nsudo apt-get install os-prober\n\nRunning stat -c%A /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober should give -rwxr-xr-x. If it's not executable (i.e. missing the x), make it executable by running:\nsudo chmod 755 /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober linkeditflag  answered May 14 at 14:10\nThis answer was provided to me by Lekensteyn 10.9k2133\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (5) touchpad stops working after upgrading from Ubuntu 10.10 to Ubuntu 11.04 After upgrading from Ubuntu 10.10 to Ubuntu 11.04, my MacBook Pro's touchpad stopped working.\nIt works fine on the login screen, but after logging in it stops working.\n\nA: (Answering my own question, in the hope that it saves someone else a bit of head scratching).\nAfter the upgrade, your Gnome desktop configuration may have gone awry. There are a few settings which enable or disable the touchpad in certain contexts which may need tweaking to get the touchpad working again. Here's how I got mine working again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Alt-F2, and run 'gconf-editor'\n\n*Navigate to desktop->gnome->peripherals\n\n*Ensure that peripherals->touchpad:touchpad is enabled.\n\n*Ensure that peripherals->bcm5974:disable_while_other_device_exists is disabled. 'bcm5974' is probably specific to my MacBook Pro's hardware, so you may need to search around for variable disable_while_other_device_exists under the entries listed under peripherals.\n\n\nHTH\n", "Q: Are there plans to make a screensaver for Unity?

I've run into this a few times when installing apps from source, and during the occasional hack with update-alternatives. So far, it's only been a minor annoyance (ie, not got in the way of the end-goal) but it's now a frustration as it's pointing to a hole in my knowledge-base... so when I get a message that 'foo' is \"not a registered application\" (or I can't use foo's default icon cuz Ubuntu has no knowledge of 'foo'):\n\n\n*\n\n*What defines a \"registered application\"?\n\n*How can I define an application installed from source (and likely residing in $HOME/bin/app-name) such that it packs the same functionality as a package installed from a .deb? (if the solution is not self-evident from answer 1)\nExample:\nI download and unpack daily dev builds of sublime-text-2 to /home/tom/bin/sublime-text-2. I've created a *.desktop file with appropriate shortcuts, etc. But the icon for sublime cannot be display in any launcher even if I provide a full pathname to the option. The solution is to install a 2nd instance of sublime from a deb package.\nWhen I install sublime-text-2 from a .deb package, it installs under /usr/bin && /usr/lib, the installed .desktop file is stored under /usr/share/applications, and the relevant line reads: icon=sublime_text.\nWhere's the linkage I'm missing? Somehow Ubuntu knows how to exact the icon from sublime_text in the latter, but not in the former (again, even with a full path provided).\n\nA: I think you are running into several problems at once with source installations.\nupdate-alternatives will not allow you to set just any program as a preferred application for a given name.  The program will have to be registered first with the --install option.  For example:\nsudo update-alternatives --set editor /home/peter/bin/foo\nupdate-alternatives: error: alternative /home/peter/bin/foo for editor not registered, not setting.\n\nIf you want to see how the registration is done, check for example /var/lib/dpkg/info/nano.postinst.\nNote, however, that it would be quite bogus to define a system-wide alternative that points to some user's home directory.  There are usually environment variables or other settings to set a preference for one user only.\nThe issue with the desktop file is probably completely separate, but you will need to provide more details about exactly which paths you used.\nIn general, installing an application from source can be quite difficult to get well integrated with the rest of the system, depending on the particular application.\n", "Q: Unity displaying bad colors. Why? How can I fix it? I'm not sure how to explain this. So see the screenshot.\n\n\nA: Not really enough details were given into your setup. If you're running Ubuntu in VirtualBox, then that could be the issue. You could also try installing updates to make sure your graphics card (or any other drivers and software) are up-to-date. If the problem is still prevalent after updating, then try switching to the classic interface. This can be done by going to the login screen (either by logging out or rebooting) then going to the dropdown menu on the bottom of the screen. Change the setting from \"Ubuntu\" to \"Ubuntu Classic\" It may not have as much eye-candy. But it'll run a lot faster and be a much smoother experience overall.\nHope I've helped.\n", "Q: How do I stop Screenlet widgets from showing up in Installed Programs? I've been running a couple Screenlets for awhile and like them.  I'm only running two, although there are quite a few more in Screenlets. However, today I found that icons for all of them, whether or not I'm using them, have appeared in Installed Programs.  Curiously, they do not have identifying text under them, as do all other programs there.  How do I get rid of them?\n\nA: It must be a bug - or a feature - of Screenlets, but it's not one I like.  For another problem I had to reinstall Ubuntu, and when I put Screenlets back on it still did the same thing.  I'll live without Screenlets now until they get that fixed.\n\nA: To stop screenlets showing up in the launcher, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the command alacarte from the terminal.\n\n*Under the menu \"Other\", uncheck \"Show\" for the screenlets, you want to remove from the launcher.\n", "Q: Stitch scanned images using CLI I have scanned a newspaper article which was larger than the scanner glass. Each page was scanned twice: the top and the bottom parts, where the middle part appeared in both images.\nIs there a way to quickly match and stitch these scanned images, preferably using CLI? The panorama stitching tools I know require lengthy configuration, which is mostly irrelevant: lens size, focus, angle etc.\nHugin has a solution for this issue, but it isn't practical for batch jobs.\n\nA: You could play around with ImageMagick's montage tool. You'll want to install the imagemagick\n package before you go any further.\nAt face value, you just need to ply montage with input files and then give it an output file:\nmontage scan1.jpg scan2.jpg output.jpg\n\nbut montage can get really powerful. You can pass along various translation arguments if you need to rotate the pages before they're combined. You can read an extended manual on it here.\n\nA: Ok, in really what you need is ImageMagick, install it sudo apt-get install imagemagick and then you just need to do these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a blank image in the parameters to fit the two images that you need to put together.\n\n*type in the terminal: composite -gravity North top_scan.jpg blank_image.jpg top_image.jpg\n\n*type in the terminal: composite -gravity South bottom_scan.jpg top_image.jpg complete_image.jpg\nBut if you need something that autorotate the images to get them perfectly matching, sorry, but as far as I know there isn't anything that do it in ubuntu.\n\nA: In CLI, you should look at panorama tools, as Hugin is only a GUI for this software.\n\nA: I would use convert from imagemagick\nif you see the 2 examples below and play around it will be VERY easy to do what you requested [you may have to make 2 then stitch those]:\nNOTA BENE:    -append gives your vertical and +append horizontal\n-geometry allows you to state what size your final image ...\n\nconvert *.JPG -append  -geometry 1920x1200  final.jpg\n\n\nconvert hey.png hey2.png hey3.png +append final.png\n\n", "Q: Accidental deletion of the Gmail (IMAP) Trash 'System Label' in Evolution I am using 11.04 and Evolution 2.32.2\nI accidentally deleted the Gmail (IMAP) Trash 'System Label' in Evolution.\nBecause this is Gmail object and (not a label per say), it is not deletable in Gmail. Under my Gmail account settings, I have made sure that both, 'Show in Label List' and 'Show in IMAP' are checked. \nThat being said, I cannot seem to restore this IMAP folder in Evolution. I deleted the affected mail account, re-created it, re-started Evolution, and no change. \nAny thoughts?\nThanks.\n\nA: I finally solved this issue.\nDeleting a Gmail 'system label' in Evolution mail (spam, trash can) means that you are \"unsubscribing\" the folder. You can re-subscribe by doing the following: \nFrom Evolution Menu - Folder => Subscriptions. Then in Subscriptions, you'll need to specify which account (server), that you are dealing with. In my case it was my gmail web mail account. A list will be generated, and from here you re-check the folder that was unsubscribed. For me, this was the Gmail system label, 'trash'.\nHope this helps others. \n", "Q: Does 11.04 support Sandy Bridge?

I would like to keep all these partitions and setup a triple boot system.\nIf it can work, I'm also wondering if it'd be safe to install all updates from the update manager once it's installed.\nThank you in advance. :)\n\nA: I really do not have any experience with iMacs, but I would suspect that either 10.10 or 11.04 would install.  This is based on my experiences with older PCs and my ability to run either flavor of Ubuntu on them.  However, please ensure you have the appropriate install disc.\n", "Q: How to keep a window from overlapping into another workspace? It's annoying to me how if a window is even a couple pixels off the right edge of my screen, when I switch to that right workspace, the system thinks that the window is there.  The unity launcher bar gets hidden because of it and switching to that window keeps you on the current workspace where you can't even see the window cause it's only a couple pixels.\nKDE seems to do this much better where when you switch to another workspace, the window just isn't there. But well I don't want KDE.  Any way of getting that same behavior without the switch?\nEdit:\n\n\nA: There doesn't seem to exist an option to do that in Compiz.\nYou can install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (package compizconfig-settings-manager, program ccsm) and raise the Edge Resistance Distance in the Snap Window plugin options in the Window Management section:\n\nThis will help to prevent pushing a window outside of the screen. However, if you move the window too fast it won't be triggered, so it's no optimal solution.\nMaybe this issue is worth a mail to the Ayatana mailing list? :-)\n\nA: cause this reason, I use gnome flashback (metacity) rather than\ngnome flashback (compiz) for a long time.\nbut metacity has other problems.. >_<..\n\nA: I was very annoyed by the virtual desktops overlap \"feature\" of unity/compiz, too.\nAfter many hours trying to deal with their various premature concepts, bugs and inefficiencies, (which still exist in Ubuntu 11.10), I gave them up and reverted to gnome2/metacity.\nMetacity is a pretty lean and efficient window manager that separates workspaces.\n", "Q: Server automatic reconnect?

This is useful on laptops with onboard network adapters, since it\n will only configure the interface when a cable is really connected.  Features\n include:\n .\n  * syslog support\n  * Multiple ethernet interface support\n  * Uses Debian's native ifup/ifdown programs\n  * Small executable size and memory footprint\n  * Option to beep when the cable is unplugged or plugged\n  * Option to beep when the interface configuration succeeds or fails\n  * Can be configured to ignore short unplugged or plugged periods\n  * Configure WLAN devices (on detecting a successful association to an AP)\n  * Supports SIOCETHTOOL, SIOCGMIIREG and SIOCDEVPRIVATE for getting link status\n  * Compatibility mode for network devices which do not support cable detection\n\nnetplug\nPackage: netplug\nDescription: network link monitor daemon\n This daemon monitors the link status of network cards and configures\n the network on plug- and un-plug-events.\n .\n It's similar to ifplugd, but uses NETLINK instead of regularly polling\n the link status. This improves power-consumption with laptops, but does\n not work with all network card.\n\nI have used in the past the first of this, and it works well on cable unplug and replug, but I don't know if it work also in your situation that seems a little bit different.\n", "Q: Why Does Unity lag Often That I have To Manually Shutdown/Restart my Core i3 Laptop? I did a fresh install of Ubuntu then do did some upgrades. After my next restart when I try to open Ubuntu Software Center it took about 20 seconds for the window to load then 10 more seconds before it became click able. While doing some installation of software, Unity lags like hell that every time I click any application it takes a few seconds before I can see it. Even GEdit take a lot of time to load. \nThe worst part was when I was doing nothing to my computer. Even on that part, my computer lags. \nMy Laptop is a Brand New Core i3 with 2GB of RAM. Unity should run perfectly on that kind of machine right?\nBTW: I reinstalled Ubuntu 11.04 for about 5 times now and still nothing changed. \n\nA: It's Confirmed!

When looking for hardware, I often try to find out if the manufacturer employs open source developers and things like that. I know Canonical has relations with a couple of big computer companies, but who, apart from Canonical, is supporting the community effort directly? Is there a list?\n\nA: Linagora is one of those companies.\nThey count 160 employees and have offices in France, Belgium and the United States.\n\nTheir first way of supporting Ubuntu is by writing and publishing documents, scripts and more. See their community website for more info (in French).\nTheir second way of supporting is by contributing to FLOSS code including Ubuntu. All their commitments are even listed on a dedicated site (in English and in French), sorted by project.\n\nA: A short version of Paul's answer is simply \"All of Canonical's customers\".\n\nA: I know of employees of the following companies who are tasked with improvements to Ubuntu as a primary job responsibility, including maintenance or delivery of software in the archive, bugfixing, and other development work performed on and in Ubuntu.  This list is necessarily incomplete, as it is exceedingly likely that many folk have not decided to disclose their employment and/or job responsibilities to me (or I forgot).  Some of these may not meet your definition of \"big\", others are indisputably so.\n\n\n*\n\n*ARM\n\n*Canonical\n\n*Cisco\n\n*Dell\n\n*Freescale\n\n*Google\n\n*IBM\n\n*Linux System Dynamics\n\n*Ksplice\n\n*KTS\n\n*Nokia\n\n*NTT\n\n*Oracle\n\n*Rackspace\n\n*Revolution Linux\n\n*Samsung\n\n*ST Ericsson\n\n*10gen\n\n*Texas Instruments\n\n*Tiger Security\n\n\nI am also aware of employees of many other firms who provide publicity or support services (magazine publishers, book publishers, event organisers, on- or off-site systems support services, deployment services, etc.) for Ubuntu or Ubuntu Derivatives (including the remixes typically deployed for pre-installed systems) who consider themselves to be part of the Ubuntu community, although their output is often not in the form of patches or uploads directly to Ubuntu.\nFurther, there are a number of companies that look favorably on contributions by their employees into Ubuntu, and whose staff hold significant positions within the Ubuntu community, but who have not explicitly tasked their staff with improvements to Ubuntu as a primary responsibility.\nBeyond that, there exists a significant number of individual or small consultancies that provide services which sometimes include delivery or improvement of software in Ubuntu or delivery of Ubuntu into some environment, for which necessary modifications are applied directly to Ubuntu.  While these are surely not \"big\", they not infrequently perform services for clients that meet most definitions of \"big\".  As these relationships are typically confidential between the parties concerned, they may necessarily not be listed here.\nAdditionally, there is the list of companies that have commercial relationships with all those above, with the intent of delivering Ubuntu to users or supporting Ubuntu.  While these companies may not be directly funding Ubuntu Development, without their assistance, few of the aforementioned firms would be as interested in funding that development.\n\nA: Firstly, please correct me if I'm wrong, and understand that English is not my first language.\nFirstly, can we define what \"big computer companies\" are? Are we talking about the \"big-ness\" like Canonical (whose name is most probably unfamiliar to most people) or big like Intel, AMD/ATI, nVidia (whose name is synonymous to processors and graphic cards respectively).\nFrom what I know, the Ubuntu Project is solely funded by one \"big computer company\": Canonical. I'm sure there are many other smaller companies and instances funding the project, but most of those are typically donations.\nI've asked this question many times -- often rephrased to, \"how do open source companies make profit?\" -- and a majority of people will almost always answer through sponsorships, adverts, merchandise and such.\nOpen source-promoting companies, like IBM, Intel, Novell, Red Hat, etc., don't particularly focus their funding onto one opensource project, unless its their own, like Intel's MeeGo for example. \nPlease feel free to criticize my answer; I know there is a strong possibility of something being incorrect there. \nCheers, :)\n\nA: The twice-yearly Ubuntu Developer Summit (UDS) or yearly Debconf are a location where it is easy to see direct funding for Ubuntu: companies sending their own employees (or for individuals, sending themselves).  When you see people from Intel, HP, Dell, … at UDS (or another Linux conference) it's probably a fairly good confirmation that their attendance is being funded to some degree directly by their employer:\n\n\n*\n\n*launchpad.net/sprints/uds-m/+attendees-csv\n\n*launchpad.net/sprints/uds-n/+attendees-csv\n\n*launchpad.net/sprints/uds-o/+attendees-csv\nGoogle themselves have hosted UDS twice at their Mountain View campus (2006, 2008).  In addition, if you're eating a meal in the evening at UDS and it says \"sponsored by Amazon AWS\" then it's probably a further indication of contribution (but for practical reasons, the sponsorship likely went via the the conference/summit organisers).\n\n\n*\n\n*Companies and OEMs generally contract with Canonical in exchange for something; then Canonical contracts with those people that make Ubuntu happen (hotels, sign printing companies, office cleaners, travel agents, internet service providers, couriers).\n\n*One of the hardest problems in Free Software is transferring money, or rather knowing whom to transfer it to.  It is very rare that money is \"just given\" with no strings;  money is transferred from one person or company to another with some direction over how the funder wishes that it should be used—making a fair exchange. For example: \"please make this feature work\", or \"please design this poster for Ubuntu in my home city\" or just by the remit of the organisation, eg. Free Software Foundation Europe.\n\n*Charities, Foundations and Company structures are one way in which a group of people with a common interest set themselves to make money transfers and logistics easier.  Companies normally use legal contracts that make that exchange of goods/services explicit.\n\n*In all cases, it's necessary to establish some link between the sender and receiver; it could be as simple as having gone to the same school, or having a common interest.  Often it is symbiotic: organisation (a) wants their hardware to work with drivers, and (b) has driver writers waiting for work.  What follows is normally a contract, and at the end of it, an exchange of money.\n\n\nIn the case of Ubuntu, it's easier for a company to approach Canonical Ltd because Canonical have the best contacts and know-how when it comes to the Ubuntu project.\n\nA: *\n\n*There is a list of OEMs who submit\ntheir hardware for certification\nhere.\n\n*Individual components are also\ncertified here.\n\n*There is also a list of Ubuntu\n\"partners\" here. These are\nsoftware or service providers who\nspecifically support Ubuntu. It's a\nbig list ;-)\n\n*Ubuntu certification is very\nthorough, as detailed on the official\npage here and Dell's blog\nhere.\nWhile these may not be purely financial donations to the Ubuntu project, hardware and software certification is far better .. it's really best sort of practical support for Ubuntu you can give IMHO.

Okay, so I want to run a GUI application as daemon on a server without X. The application is a java program. It can be configured in a configuration file so the GUI is not necessary to use it. Unfortunately it doesn't have a shell executable.\nI knew that one once, but forgot the solution. Basically there is a program which fakes an X-server to other programs. Finding that would be the ideal solution. Just can't remember what it was called.\n\nA: I think you are referring to xvfb - the ability to run in a framebuffer.\n or sudo apt-get install xvfb\nYou need to specify a resolution and colour depth as well as the nominal display number\nUsage:\nxvfb :1 -screen 0 800x600x8 &\nexport DISPLAY=\":1\"\njava application_name.jar \n\nor shorter:\nxvfb-run -a -e /tmp/some/log/file.log java -jar /home/user/somejava.jar\n\n-a chooses a display number automatically, -e file specifies a logfile for error messages.\n", "Q: Application for taking pretty screenshots (like OS X does) I've been building a website for a guy who uses Mac OS X and occasionally he sends me screenshots of bugs. They come out looking like this:\n\nThis is fairly typical of Mac screenshots.

In this example we utilize its capability to pass screenshots to external programs in order to add a pretty dropshadow effect with imagemagick.\nNote: This method does not work properly under Unity and more than likely won't work on any other WM with rounded borders, either. You can still capture images of course, but the drop shadow will be applied not only to the window but also to parts of the background. You might be able to troubleshoot this by replacing scrot with gnome-screenshot and adjust the script accordingly.\n\nSample shot\n\n\nDropshadow script\n#!/bin/bash\n# NAME:         dropshadow.sh\n# VERSION:      \n# AUTHOR:       (c) 2013 Glutanimate\n# DESCRIPTION:  - adds transparent dropshadow to images (e.g. screenshots)\n#               - moves them to predefined screenshot folder\n# FEATURES:     \n# DEPENDENCIES: imagemagick suite\n#\n# LICENSE:      MIT license (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n#\n# NOTICE:       THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\n#               INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n#               PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

I am using Radeon 5650, and Catalyst 12.1 on Ubuntu 11.10. Unity 3D works smooth.\nThe CPU fan isn't that over-loaded compared with no GPU installed, according to my own experience.\nThis link is from the official ATI catalyst page.\nHit the link Unofficial Wiki for the AMD Linux Driver to get you there.

And it uses the fglrx driver for the ATI card, but usability and control center is absent for me until aticongfig is run. That however crashes everything. An option is to continue the use of radeon open source driver. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver\n\nA: This may not qualify as an answer, so forgive me if it's inappropriate...\nI have a Radeon 5450 with the same problem.  The post-release updates won't install, and this has been reported on launchpad, as Tim mentioned.  The 2nd option always worked for me, but I found a problem with it - shutdown would crash at least half the time (another known problem).  So, I decided to forgo the drivers, and for me, there is absolutely no discernible downside, and shutdown always works.\nSo, if you don't need the drivers, I'd advise against installing them.  For me, everything works well, but I don't play any games or put heavy demands on my system.  I just use Compiz for a few of the productivity improvements, and that's all I care about.\n", "Q: How do I increase the icon size in Unity? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I increase the font size in Dash? \n\nAs my partner is registered blind she has difficulty with small text & icons.

I have an incredibly fast (540MB/s) RAID0 SSD that would do well if a bitmap does what I think it does but I'm still very unsure. I've only known about them as long as I've known this post. \nA few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is a bitmap (in terms of mdadm)?\n\n*What are the advantages of an internal bitmap (over external)?\n\n*What are the advantages of an external bitmap (over internal)?\n\n*How do I switch between the two?\n\n\nI should add that while this is a I'm-bored-let's-break-something thread, I do value the data stored on the RAID array. If doing this is going to put data at significant risk, please let me know.\n\nA: What's a bitmap:\nA mdadm bitmap, also called a \"write intent bitmap\", is a mechanism to speed up RAID rebuilds after an unclean shutdown or after removing and re-adding a disk.\nWith a bitmap, writing data to the RAID goes like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update bitmap: Mark the RAID chunks you are about to write to as dirty.\n\n*Write the data to the RAID.\n\n*Update bitmap: Mark the RAID chunks that were just written as clean.\n\n\nThe advantage of a bitmap is that if the system goes down in the middle of a write, the rebuild needs to check only the chunks marked as dirty, rather than the whole multi-TB RAID. This can speed up the rebuild process from taking several hours to completing in just a few seconds.\nThe drawback is lower write performance under normal use (outside rebuilds), since mdadm does additional disk access to update the bitmap.\nExternal vs internal:\n\n\n*\n\n*external: Stored as a file on a disk outside the RAID. The advantage over an internal bitmap is better write performance during normal use (outside rebuilds).\n\n*internal: Stored as RAID metadata. The advantage over an external bitmap is that you don't need a non-RAID disk and you save a bit on configuration (the path to the bitmap).\n\n\nAccording to the mdadm man page:\nNote:  external bitmaps are only known to work on ext2 and ext3.\n       Storing bitmap files on other filesystems may result in  serious\n       problems.\n\nAccording to a post by Neil Brown, the mdadm author, external bitmaps should work on ext4 too:\nI haven't looked inside ext4 but I am fairly confident that external bitmaps \nwill work properly.\n\nHOWTO:\nBitmaps are added and removed using mdadm --grow --bitmap=XXX ..., where the XXX is one of:\n\n\n*\n\n*--bitmap=internal: Create an internal bitmap.\n\n*--bitmap=/var/my_bitmap.bin: Create an external bitmap at the specified path. The path must reside outside the RAID. A bitmap=... parameter must be added to the ARRAY entry in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf, and the --bitmap=... parameter must be passed if you are assembling the RAID from the command line.\n\n*--bitmap=none: Remove/disable any bitmaps.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*HowTo: Speed Up Linux Software Raid Building And Re-syncing\n\n*mdadm man page - see flag -b, --bitmap=\n\n*mdadm.conf man page - see option bitmap\nComments:\nIMO, bitmaps are perhaps primarily of interest for RAID levels 5 and 6, since these have the slowest rebuilds. \nI switched from RAID 5 to RAID 10 myself; the rebuilds are so much faster that I don't feel the need for a bitmap, and RAID 10 seems to require far fewer rebuilds in the first place. \nMy RAID 5 setup used to drop a disk something like once a month, causing 12-14 hour rebuilds. The RAID 10 has only dropped a disk once in half a year, rebuilt in less than an hour. \nI don't know if the frequent disk drops I experienced was caused by something other than the RAID level, but the RAID 10 has been far more stable and rebuild speed isn't much of a concern anymore.\n\nA: I have been using md RAID 5 for a while now, and not had any disk dropouts. I was interested to see what the addition of an external bitmap storage would gain me.\nMy current setup includes a boot disk and then 4 x 3TB disks as RAID 5. Last night I added another 3TB disk and after 20 odd hours it's 70% thru reshaping. Since reading this post, I've decided that after it's finished reshaping I will definitely add the external bitmap to the boot disk (1TB). \nI have md RAID 5 base layer, LVM2 over that and some ISCS targets to some of the LVM2 partitions with various virtual machines being tested on the ISCSI.\nI've done a bunch of benchmark images, posted here if you're interested.\n", "Q: Can not connect to PostgreSQL listening on port 5432 I installed the Bitnami Django stack which included PostgreSQL 8.4.\nWhen I run psql -U postgres I get the following error:\npsql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory\n    Is the server running locally and accepting\n    connections on Unix domain socket \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\"?\n\nPG is definitely running and the pg_hba.conf file looks like this:\n# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            CIDR-ADDRESS            METHOD\n\n# \"local\" is for Unix domain socket connections only\nlocal   all             all                                     md5\n# IPv4 local connections:\nhost    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5\n# IPv6 local connections:\nhost    all             all             ::1/128                 md5\n\nWhat gives?\n\"Proof\" that pg is running:\nroot@assaf-desktop:/home/assaf# ps axf | grep postgres\n14338 ?

My problem was that either I could set for /tmp and psql worked, but not project open, or I could set it for /var/run/postgresql and psql would not work but project open did.\nOne resolution to the issue is to set the socket for /var/run/postgresql and then run psql, based on Peter's suggestion, as:\npsql -h /var/run/postgresql\n\nThis runs locally using local permissions. The only drawback is that it is more typing than simply \"psql\".\nThe other suggestion that someone made was to create a symbolic link between the two locations. This also worked, but, the link disappeared upon reboot. It maybe easier to just use the -h argument, however, I created the symbolic link from within the PostgreSQL script  in /etc/init.d. I placed the symbolic link create command in the \"start\" section. Of course, when I issue a stop and start or restart command, it will try to recreate an existing symbolic link, but other than warning message, there is probably no harm in that.\nIn my case, instead of:\nln -s /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432 /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\n\nI have\nln -s /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432 /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432\n\nand have explicitly set the unix_socket to /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432 in postgresql.conf.\n\nA: If your Postgres service is up and running without any error or there is no error in starting the Postgres service and still you are getting the mentioned error, follow these steps\nStep1: Running pg_lsclusters will list all the postgres clusters running on your device\neg: \nVer Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory               Log file\n9.6 main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.6-main.log\n\nmost probably the status will be down in your case and postgres service\nStep 2: Restart the pg_ctlcluster\n#format is pg_ctlcluster <version> <cluster> <action>\nsudo pg_ctlcluster 9.6 main start\n\n#restart postgresql service\nsudo service postgresql restart\n\nStep 3: Step 2 failed and threw error\nIf this process is not successful it will throw an error. You can see the error log on /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.6-main.log\nMy error was:\nFATAL: could not access private key file \"/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key\": Permission denied\nTry adding `postgres` user to the group `ssl-cert`\n\nStep 4: check ownership of postgres\nMake sure that postgres is the owner of /var/lib/postgresql/version_no/main\nIf not, run \nsudo chown postgres -R /var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main/\n\nStep 5: Check postgres user belongs to ssl-cert user group\nIt turned out that I had erroneously removed the Postgres user from the ssl-cert group. Run the below code to fix the user group issue and fix the permissions\n#set user to group back with\nsudo gpasswd -a postgres ssl-cert\n\n# Fix ownership and mode\nsudo chown root:ssl-cert  /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key\nsudo chmod 740 /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key\n\n# now postgresql starts! (and install command doesn't fail anymore)\nsudo service postgresql restart\n\n\nA: I found uninstalling Postgres sounds unconvincing.\nThis helps to solve my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the postgres server:\nsudo systemctl start postgresql\n\n\n*Make sure that the server starts on boot:\nsudo systemctl enable postgresql\n\nDetail information can be found on DigitalOcean site Here.\n\nA: The error message refers to a Unix-domain socket, so you need to tweak your netstat invocation to not exclude them.  So try it without the option -t:\nnetstat -nlp | grep 5432\n\nI would guess that the server is actually listening on the socket /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432 rather than the /var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432 that your client is attempting to connect to.  This is a typical problem when using hand-compiled or third-party PostgreSQL packages on Debian or Ubuntu, because the source default for the Unix-domain socket directory is /tmp but the Debian packaging changes it to /var/run/postgresql.\nPossible workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the clients supplied by your third-party package (call /opt/djangostack-1.3-0/postgresql/bin/psql).

After 3 days of zero progress trying every permutation of fix on this and other sites I decided to re-install the server and lose 5 days worth of work.  But, I did replicate the issue on the new instance.  This might provide some perspective on how to fix it before you take the catastrophic approach I did.\nFirst, disable all logging settings in postgresql.conf.   This is the section:\n# ERROR REPORTING AND LOGGING\n\nComment out everything in that section. Then restart the service.\nWhen restarting, use   /etc/init.d/postgresql start  or restart\nI found it helpful to be in superuser mode while restarting.  I had a x-window open just for that operation.  You can establish that superuser mode with sudo -i.\nVerify that the server can be reached with this simple command: psql -l -U postgres\nIf that doesn't fix it, then consider this:\nI was changing the ownership on many folders while trying to find a solution.   I knew that I'd probably be trying to revert those folder ownerships and chmods for 2 more days.  If you have already messed with those folder ownerships and don't want to completely purge your server, then start tracking the settings for all impacted folders to bring them back to the original state.  You might want to try to do a parallel install on another system and systematically check the ownership and settings of all folders.    Tedious, but you may be able to get access to your data.\nOnce you do gain access, systematically change each relevant line in the # ERROR REPORTING AND LOGGING section of the postgresql.conf file.   Restart and test.  I found that the default folder for the logs was causing a failure.  I specifically commented out log_directory.  The default folder the system drops the logs into is then /var/log/postgresql.  \n\nA: This issue comes from installing the postgres package without a version number. Although postgres will be installed and it will be the correct version, the script to setup the cluster will not run correctly; it's a packaging issue.\nIf you're comfortable with postgres there is a script you can run to create this cluster and get postgres running. However, there's an easier way.\nFirst purge the old postgres install, which will remove everything of the old installation, including databases, so back up your databases first.. The issue currently lies with 9.1 so I will assume that's what you have installed\nsudo apt-get remove --purge postgresql-9.1\n\nNow simply reinstall\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1\n\nNote the package name with the version number. HTH.\n\nA: Possibly it could have happened because you changed the permissions of the /var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main folder.\nTry changing it to 700 using the command below:\nsudo chmod 700 main\n\n\nA: This is not exactly related to the question since I'm using Flask, but this was the exact error I was getting and this was the most relevant thread to get ideas.\nMy setup: Windows Subsystem for Linux, Docker-compose w/ makefile w/ dockerfile, Flask, Postgresql (using a schema consisting of tables)\nTo connect to postgres, setup your connection string like this:\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = \"postgresql+psycopg2://<user>:<password>@<container_name_in_docker-compose.yml>/<database_name>\"\n\nNOTE: I never got any IP (e.g. localhost, 127.0.0.1) to work using any method in this thread. Idea for using the container name instead of localhost came from here: https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/issues/297\nSet your schema:\nfrom sqlalchemy import MetaData\ndb = SQLAlchemy(app, metadata=MetaData(schema=\"<schema_name>\"))\n\nSet your search path for your functions when you setup your session:\ndb.session.execute(\"SET search_path TO <schema_name>\")\n\n\nA: The most upvoted answer isn't even remotely correct because you can see in the question the server is running on the expected port (he shows this with netstat).\nWhile the OP did not mark the other answer as chosen, they commented that the other answer (which makes sense and works) was sufficient,\nBut for these reasons that solution is poor and insecure even if it the server wasn't running on port 5432:\n\nWhat you're doing here when you say --purge is you're deleting the configuration file for PostgreSQL ((as well as all of the data with the database. You or may not even see a warning about this, but here is the warning just to show you now,\n\nRemoving the PostgreSQL server package will leave existing database clusters intact, i.e. their configuration, data, and log directories will not be removed. On purging the package, the directories can optionally be removed. Remove PostgreSQL directories when package is purged? [prompt for yes or no]\n\nWhen you add it again PostgreSQL is reinstalling it to a port number that's not taken (which may be the port number you expect). Before you even try this solution, you need to answer a few questions along the same line:\n\n*\n\n*Do I want multiple versions of PostgreSQL on my machine?\n\n*Do I want an older version of PostgreSQL?\n\n*What do I want to happen when I dist-upgrade and there is a newer version?\n\nCurrently when you dist-upgrade on Ubuntu (and any Debian variant), the new version of PostgreSQL is installed alongside the old copy and the port number on the new copy is the port number of the old copy + 1. So you can just start it up, increment the port number in your client and you've got a new install! And you have the old install to fall back on -- it's safe!\nHowever, if you only one want version of PostgreSQL purging to change the configuration is still not the right option because it will destroy your database. The only time this could even be acceptable is you want to destroy everything related to PostgreSQL. You're better off ensuring your database is correct and then merely editing the configuration file so the new install runs on the old port number\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# We can find the version number of the newest PostgreSQL with this\nVERSION=$(dpkg-query -W -f \"\\${Version}\" 'postgresql' | sed -e's/+.*//')\nPGCONF=\"/etc/postgresql/${VERSION}/main/postgresql.conf\"\n\n# Then we can update the port.\nsudo sed -ie '/port = /s/.*/port = 5432/' \"$PGCONF\"\n\nsudo systemctl restart postgresql\n\nDo not install a specific version of PostgreSQL. Only ever install postgresql. If you install a specific version then when you dist-upgrade your version will simply remain on your computer forever without upgrades. The repo will no longer have the security patches for the old version (which they don't support). This must always be suboptimal to getting a newer version that they do support, running on a different port number.\n\nA: While having the same issue I tried something different:\nStarting the postgresql daemon manually I got:\nFATAL:  could not create shared memory segment ...\n   To reduce the request size (currently 57237504 bytes), reduce PostgreSQL's\n   shared memory usage, perhaps by reducing shared_buffers or max_connections.\n\nSo what I did was to set a lower limit for shared_buffers and max_connections into postgresql.conf and restart the service. \nThis fixed the problem!\nHere's the full error log:\n$ sudo service postgresql start\n * Starting PostgreSQL 9.1 database server                                                                                                                                                               * The PostgreSQL server failed to start.

I used sudo apt-get remove python command and accidently removed a bunch of packages that were required. I logged in via command line and installed ubuntu-desktop again but there are other packages that are missing, and I'm looking for a way to easily reinstall those removed packages. Since there's the log at software-center I wanted to ask what the easiest way might be to roll back changes or extract the removed packages list from the software center...\nnote: I typed sudo apt-get install .... .... ... ... for about two dozen of those removed programs in that list, but when I pressed enter it didn't install any of them because some package names couldn't be found.\nThe programs were removed at the same date.\n\nA: So, I happen to do a similar mistake:\nsudo apt-get purge python3.6* instead of sudo apt-get purge python3.6.*.\nI was able to fix it quite fast, with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opened the log vim /var/log/history.log.\n\n*Searched for my bad command using vim command /python3.6\\*.\n\n*There was a line Purge: unity-control-center-signon:amd64 (0.1.7~+14.04.20140211.2-0ubuntu4), ... with a long list of purged packages (in case of removal it will start with Remove:), which I copied to another file without the Purge: part to work with it.\n\n*In that file I ran the vim command: %s/:[^,]*,//g, which removed the version part and left me with a list of packages unity-control-center-signon lxc ....\n\n*Finally I copied a line from the previous step and ran:\nsudo apt-get install unity-control-center-signon lxc ..., and that's how it got fixed.\n\n\nA: First of all, let me say that removing python can lead to many fundamental commands not work anymore. So I don't known if what follow will work.\nSecondly, I assume that the package names couldn't be found error you have, derives from a mispelled name on the command line, or from a package installed locally and not available in repositories.\nThen, to obtain a log of removed packages, relatively to the last dpkg log available (I don't think you need to take into account older logs):\nawk '$3 == \"remove\" { print $1, $2, $4 }' /var/log/dpkg.log | tee list\n\nThen edit the list file created in the current directory, and only leave lines relative to packages you want to reinstall, based on timestamp of the line. Say you save the modified file to list-mod.\nTo reinstall that packages, use the following command:\nsudo apt-get --simulate install $(awk '{ print $3 }' list-mod)\n\nI inserted the --simulate option to see what the command would do. If it is all ok, do the command again with that option removed.\nIf the command say some packages cannot be found, simply remove them from list-mod and try again.\n", "Q: How do I configure multicast?

So, how to install oracle 10g xe in ubuntu 11.04? \nI even found some variant how to fix it from here but in my case it does not work - the same exception take place: \n\noracle-xe-universal:i386 depends on\n  libc6 (>= 2.3.2); however: Package\n  libc6:i386 is not installed.\n\n\nA: Extract the deb file, open Oracle-xe-universal_10.2.0.1-1.0_i386/DEBIAN/control and remove the dependency for libc6 so you end up with:\nDepends: libaio (>= 0.3.96) | libaio1 (>= 0.3.96)\nThen cd to the directory that contains the extracted folders and do a dpkg-deb --build oracle-xe-universal_10.2.0.1-1.0_i386 && sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture oracle-xe-universal_10.2.0.1-1.0_i386.deb \n\nA: It seemes to me that package is broken. If I understand it correctly, libc latest version is 2.14 (http://www.eglibc.org/home)\nSo you should rebuild this package without this dependency to install it. \n\nA: At first you have to install the 32 bits libraries:\nsudo apt-get install libc6-i386\nsudo apt-get install libaio\n\nStart installation of oracle express:\ndpkg -i --force-architecture oracle-xe-universal_10.2.0.1-1.1_i386.deb\n\nConfigure it:\nsudo /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure\n\nAdd required environment variable to .bashrc:\nsudo nano ~/.bashrc\n\nAdd these lines to it:\nORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server\nPATH=$PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/bin\nexport ORACLE_HOME\nexport ORACLE_SID=XE\nexport PATH\n\n", "Q: What BURG Themes are Available What BURG Themes are Available?\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install burg themes?\n\nA: Lightness\n\n\nCalled 'Lightness' the theme was designed to feel 'calm, clean & modern' according to its designer, and certainly gives a beautifully minimalistic introduction to your boot time.\n\n\nA: Metro\n\n\nA Windows 8/Metro inspired Burg theme.\n\n\nA: Radiance\n\nKeep the common look and feel from boot to desktop\n\nA: achromatic\n\n", "Q: How do I install burg themes?

I set the permissions to none for everyone apart from me. I then changed the share folder (/home/elliot/Shared) to allow all access but my windows computers and other users on my laptop cannot access it even though they have the right permission, I think this is because they don't have access to the home folder in which the Shared folder is stored.\nWhere should I store a new Shared folder on my laptop? Should I put it as /home/Shared? Or, alternatively is there a way I can allow other users to access my /home/elliot/Shared folder even if /home/elliot is inaccessible?\nThanks in advance, ell.\n\nA: You could change the folder permissions of Shared to all and create a symbolic link in /home. This would allow others to access your shared folder. Here is how you do it:\nsudo ln -s /home/elliot/Shared /home\n\n", "Q: Bind9 fails to start After 3 weeks of trying to diagnose a failure of bind9, to start I have to admit I need assistance.\nInitially it was running correctly and when I made a modification to a bind file and re-run it an error msg came back\nrndc: 127.0.0.1#953 bind9 start fail\n\nIt also fails to start on any other bind9 upgrade or required pkg.\ngrep on mysql returns nothing now even if it is running, and dig on 127 only works when I have my phone connected as a modem.\nI don't have any more diagnostics that I know of, so some help would be appreciated as development has stopped.\n\nA: As mentioned in the comments by enzotib\n\nTry to remove completely, then reinstall bind9: sudo apt-get purge bind9 && sudo apt-get --reinstall install bind9. You will loose local configurations, if you have them.\n", "Q: How to get byobu to launch tmux instead of screen? The latest versions of byobu should apparently be configurable to run tmux instead of screen, but I haven't been able to.\nAdvice appreciated\n\nA: Byobu 5.x has excellent support for tmux.  New installations of Byobu 5.x and above will default to using tmux as the backend.  Upgrades from older versions, however, will not automatically make that switch.\nStill, you can manually run byobu with tmux by typing byobu-tmux.  Similarly, you can manually choose to run with the screen backend by typing byobu-screen.\nRunning byobu will launch with your selected default backend.  You can choose between tmux and screen by running byobu-select-backend.\nkirkland@ubuntu:~$ byobu-select-backend \n\nSelect the byobu backend:\n  1. tmux\n  2. screen\n\nChoose 1-2 [1]: 1\n\n\nA: I just installed the latest version of Byobu on Ubuntu 10.10 by following these instructions:\n  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:byobu/ppa\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install byobu\n\nFrom here: https://launchpad.net/byobu/\nThen you can launch it with byobu-tmux\n", "Q: Google Talk libcairo2 dependency is not satisfiable I am trying to install google talk plugin for an old Ubuntu 7.10. It shows an error dependency is not satisfiable libcairo2.\nIs it possible to install google talk plugin for Ubuntu 7.10? This is an old system that needs this version for compatibility with old binaries.\n\nA: The reason libcairo2 is unavailable is because 7.10 doesn't include it in its package list. You could manually install this package from Ubuntu's package search tool, but there is probably a really good reason why libcairo2 isn't in your version's package list. And that really good reason is probably that you'd have to upgrade half of your system manually in order to install it. For example, (in the worst case) it might depend on a later version of glibc or libx11 than you have. You will almost certainly have to upgrade several non-critical packages that it relies on, as well.\nUpgrading your whole system via the update-manager (in a controlled, automated way) is much better than upgrading a large portion in an ad-hoc, manual fashion.\n", "Q: Computer Janitor I'm willing to use Computer Janitor but I'm afraid to lose some important libraries.\nIs it secure to use Computer Janitor?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Computer Janitor is being dropped in the next version of Ubuntu - mainly because nobody used it and the serious perceived issues that it could break your system with some of its suggestions.\nI would recommend you take a closer look at either Ubuntu Tweak (from here) or Bleachbit (from software centre)\nThere is an AU question here with regards to Ubuntu Tweak.\nI haven't found a similar question for BleachBit - but this AU question may help.\n", "Q: Docky 2.1.2 crashes when I try to remove a existing dock I believe it has something to do with the Mounter Applet. The dock I'm trying to remove has 2 instances running for reasons I don't know. It also crashes when I try to remove Mounter. \nHow can I remove Docky completely including all my settings? I tried it from the Software Center and re-installed it but the dock I'm trying to remove still was there.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: First, I'd recommend you to launch docky through the terminal.\nType:\nkillall docky && docky\n\nThen, try to recreate the problem. See what's appears on the terminal window.\nIf you want to reset the docky settings, probably typing\n$ sudo apt-get purge docky\n$ rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/docky*\n$ sudo apt-get install docky\n\nwill do the trick.\n", "Q: Compiz effects in Unity 2D If my GPU can process basic Compiz effects as seen in GNOME Classic, will they work in Unity 2D?\n\nA: Probably. The goal of Unity 2d is to provide a unity-like desktop to those whose \"hardware platforms cannot currently support Unity's OpenGL requirements\". Check their wiki page for more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity2D.\n\nA: As I found out (after reactivating Compiz, compiz --replace), those effects are indeed functional within Unity 2D.\n", "Q: Red5 start script not working I have an EC2 instance running Red5 and I added the following script to the scripts that run on startup and shutdown of the server:\n################# NOTE FROM DOMINICK\n# First Follow these directions\n#http://embraceubuntu.com/2005/09/07/adding-a-startup-script-to-be-run-at-bootup/\n#################\n\n# Author: Jake Hilton <red5@jakehilton.com>\n# /etc/init.d/red5\n#\n# Check for missing file\nRED5_DIR=/opt/red5\ntest -x $RED5_DIR/red5.sh || exit 5\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    start)\n        echo -n \"Starting Red5 Service\"\n        echo -n \" \"\n        cd $RED5_DIR\n        su -s /bin/bash -c \"$RED5_DIR/red5.sh &amp;\" infrared5 \n        sleep 2\n        ;;\n    stop)\n        echo -n \"Shutting down red5\"\n        echo -n \" \"\n        ##su -s /bin/bash -c \"killall -q -u infrared5 java\" infrared5\n        su -s /bin/bash -c \"$RED5_DIR/red5-shutdown.sh &amp;\" infrared5\n        sleep 2\n        ;;\n    restart)\n        ## Stop the service and regardless of whether it was\n        ## running or not, start it again.\n        $0 stop\n        $0 start\n        ;;\nesac\n\nThe only change I made was the location of red5 which is in /usr/share/red5 on my instance. \nAfter Following the instructions on the following site: Adding a startup script to be run at bootup on how to install the script I ran the following command from the terminal /etc/init.d/red5 start and got the following:\n\nI navigate to http://somedomain.com:5080/ which is the red5 start page and I get a 404.\nRebooting the server also seems to have the same effect. Not sure how to touble shoot this one and could use some help figuring out what I may be doing wrong.\n\nA: The script needs an user infrared5 that doesn't exist on your system. Create that user and check the documentation whether it needs special privileges or permissions to some files or directories.\n", "Q: Add files from a network location in VLC I'm trying to add several video files to my playlist in VLC Media Player. These files are located in a network location and the \"Add Files\" option displays only local file locations. I tried using the IP address of device but that does nothing. Does anyone know how to do this?\n\nA: You have at least three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Browse to ~/.gvfs\nYour network drive is mounted in your home directory in the hidden directory ~/.gvfs. You can browse there with the file browser from VLC or enter the appropriate path in the Add Files dialogue.\n\n*smbnetfs \nWill help you to mount your network directory to your home. By this any application will be able to access it (see also this answer).\n\n*ushare .\nInstalls an UPnP server on the media server. VLC and other players are able to read files from there (the GUI stream2ip helps you to set it up)\n\nA: You can also use \"Advanced Open\" instead of \"Add file\". This displays the full VLC open dialog--complete with a \"Network\" tab, rather than the system \"File Open\" dialog. Of course, you have to remember to \"Enqueue\" the file(s), rather than Play.\n", "Q: Set compositing manager preference to Compiz As I discussed in this question, for some reason, Metacity was used instead of Compiz even with capable GPU and driver. I want to set the preference to use Conmpiz wherever possible, is there a way?\n\nA: Here is something you might want to try...from a terminal (CTRL+ATL+T):\ncd /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions\nsudo gedit classic-gnome.session\n\nFind the line listed as Required-windowmanager=gnome-wm \nand change it to Required-windowmanager=compiz\nThis is something I had done in versions earlier than Ubuntu 11.04.  I do not recall having to change anything else to get compiz to replace Metacity by default.\n", "Q: How I can recover a previous version of a file? I modified a .txt file and saved it. When I opened it again, I saw that I deleted one thing from the last version I saved. So I would like to know if I can recover what I deleted?\nThis file is very important to me. You have to help me! My life is on this file.\nI didn't delete anything, I only edited the file. When I tried to save I had get an error saying that it could not read some characters so I closed the editor and when I opened it again some lines just disappeared.\n\nA: binW's solution is the only solution for a problem like this where you have no backup or other versioning software in place. It is a one-time rescue that may help you this one time. If you save again, that backup will be replaced and you lose anything from before that backup. I hope this works for you.\nGenerally speaking, if you need version control or backup, use backup or version control software. You say this is a critical file so you should treat it like one. Look at version-control tools like git or bzr and RabitVCS to tie them into the normal user interface.\nBut that is not enough. If this file is as critical to your existence as you suggest, please do some backups once in a while. There's no excuse these days not to. They take (at most) an hour to set up and using tools like DropBox or Amazon S3, are extremely cheap to store quite a lot of data off-site. Take a look at the available backup tools.\nNeither of these systems will provide you with complete peace of mind. You want both a VCS for short-term and long-term histories and an off-site backup for long term data integrity.\n\nA: If you used GEdit and you havent disabled the backup function, then there must be a hidden file with name similar to your file but with ~ appended to it. So if your file name is somefile.txt then look for somefile.txt~ in the same directory. This is the backup file and will give you your files state before last save.\n\nA: This saved my life, while I was using Google Drive (insync / non-free).\n\n*\n\n*Enter Google Drive in the web browser; right-click on the file;\n\n\n*Click \"Manage versions\" (File lasts 30 days in google drive server or max. 100 versions);\n\n\n*Download the version of interest\n", "Q: How to troubleshoot and tweek unreasonably slow wireless connection? I've just acquired a USB F5D8053ed Belkin adapter and it is unreasonably slow. \nDetails of how I installed the firmware and device driver are described in this AU Question.\nI believe there is either a problem with a driver or adapter itself that is preventing from using the full network quality. At the moment I can see that my Windows laptop is performing at 30 x speed better than the Ubuntu desktop PC with Belkin.\nWhat are they ways to troubleshoot pure wireless network performance on Ubuntu?\n\nA: It's likely that the antenna in the USB dongle is horizontally polarized while the antenna on your access point is likely vertically polarized. Try using a short USB cable so the dongle can be situated vertically. That may help. I've a TRENDnet USB dongle that came with a very sort USB cable for that purpose.\n\nA: On 10.10, Intel 5300 was limited from N to G only, due to kernel bugs.

I was hoping that with this new driver AMD had support for the new kernel, but it doesn't.\nWhen I boot using the new kernel I practically get no compositing, and everything is really ugly.\nHow (if possible) can I patch or else do something about this?\n\nA: There is a blog entry here which states that you have to patch the new catalyst driver to make it work with 2.6.39\nFull instructions can be found in that blog together with links to the source code which need to be used to patch.\nEDIT: Since the original question was for Catalyst 11.5, the question has been revised for Catalyst 11.6\nThis forum entry gives instructions on how to compile the patches for this new catalyst version - To complete the answer, I've reproduced the answer - note - this is for 64bit - if you are using 32bit, you'll need to change the entries for \"x86_64\" for the 32bit equivalents.

Any apt-get commands I should do to rollback the installation/obtain more info of the problem?\n\nA: Well, the easiest way to recover a virtual machine is to make use of the snapshot feature available in VirtualBox. As far as apt-get, you can try apt-get check, which will make sure none of your packages are broken--i.e. missing dependencies. It there are any, you can use apt-get --fix-broken install to allow apt to try to automagically fix it. In the worst case, apt-get remove <pkg-name> any broken packages, and try to reinstall them via apt-get install <pkg-name>. In the very worst case, you might have to use dpkg --remove <pkg-name if apt cannot remove them for some reason.\nNB: This is just a quick synopsis; it cannot instil wisdom or avert impending experience.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu include support for the Intel GMA 500? I would like to know if the new open-source video driver included in kernel 3.0.x for the Intel GMA 500 will be included by default in the kernel that will be shipped in Oneiric Ocelot.\nThe driver support of this GFX chipset has always been poor and mainly community-driven, now finally we have a KMS open-source driver, written by kernel hackers, and actually included in staging kernel repo.\nIf there is any kind of testing needed there is a mega-thread on Ubuntu Forums with hundreds of users ready to test everything.\n\nA: Alan Cox from Intel is actively developing gma500 driver drivers/staging/gma500/ to become part of official kernel. You can follow his progress at lkml.\nUpdate: The lkml post provides the status update. The driver should get out of staging into mainstream kernel-3.2. The biggest issue that it doesn't use hardware acceleration neither 2D, nor 3D, nor Video yet. \nUpdate (2012/04/20): 12.04 LTS should have support for psb_gfx according to UbuntuWiki.\nUpdate (2012/05/03): Instructions about how to make it working properly on 12.04 LTS are available from bodhi.zazen blog post.\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 will ship with Linux 3.0 kernel which will be released in early august.\nI couldn't find anything to suggest that this new gma500 driver was merged into 3.0 but I did find a suggestion against it. Other than that it seems that this new driver is still heavily in development.\n", "Q: Alsa doesn't work in vlc Alsa Audio Output works fine from terminal, e.g. aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav. \nBut I got to change from default to Alsa Audio Output in vlc. I found it in Tools > Perfernces > Audio > Outputs.\nThe issue is that when I change it to Alsa, I Loose all sound. When I leave the default I get an annoying Audio delay of about 200ms or 500ms. From what I have found you have to use Alsa Audio Outpu to fix that issue.\n\nA: From the original author\nTo fix the Alsa Audio Output:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/vlc\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vlc mozilla-plugin-vlc\n\nthen, open Update Manager, there were 2 updates for vlc there, install them and reboot. Now alsa works fine and audio is in sync with video.\n\nA: After todays update to the 1.1.12 version of VLC and using Ubuntu 11.10. Most if not all out of sync problems are gone.\nUsers need to update their Ubuntu to the latest daily updates which should provide the latest version of VLC (the 1.1.12 version).

(It's based on Ubuntu 10.10)\nI've entered VPN Connections' menu (nm -> VPN Connections -> Configure VPN)\nAnd there should be button \"Add\" -> it is, but it's disabled (I can't press on it)\nI'm connecting via ethernet (LAN in a students' hostel) and we get internet via VPN connection (It worked for me in Ubuntu for a few years)\nAny suggestions?\nI've asked on IRC of elementaryos (there were few people) but they said that VPN is out-of-box, and it should work - they never met this.\n\nA: I seem to remember running into a similar issue a while back. In my case at least, the root cause was that my Ubuntu 9.10 install was missing a bunch of Network Manager plugins. Searching for network manager plugins using apt give me the following list (again on a 9.10 install):\n\nnetwork-manager-openconnect - network management framework (Openconnect plugin)\n  network-manager-openvpn - network management framework (OpenVPN plugin)\n  network-manager-pptp - network management framework (PPTP plugin)\n  network-manager-strongswan - network management framework(strongSwan plugin)\n  network-manager-vpnc - network management framework (VPNC plugin)\n\nMaybe it would be worth verifying that the plugin matching whatever type of VPN service you're trying to use is installed. \n", "Q: Recovering from mount gone wrong I was trying to break some files out of my VirtualBox install of Ubuntu, and I accidentally mounted a VirtualBox shared folder onto ~, thereby erasing the very files I was trying to get at.  Is there any way to recover my hard work, or am I just going to have to sudo rm -f /bin/mount and start over?\nAnd no, I don't seriously intend to rm -f /bin/mount.\n\nA: While the contents of a directory become inaccessible when you mount a file system over the top, they aren't lost.  Unmounting the file system should make them visible again.  Something like the following:\nsudo umount ~\n\n\nA: Mounting just hides the files under the mount point, it doesn't change them. If you unmount the VB share, you'll see your files again. You don't even need to unmount the share; you can move it:\nmkdir /media/foo\nmount --move ~ /media/foo\n\n", "Q: sudo error, is mode 0777, should be 0440 I am getting sudo errors, how do I fix this error?\nsudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0777, should be 0440\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting \n\n\nA: Boot into recovery mode, choose the root shell, and:\nchmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\n\nOr if you don't want to restart you can use this alternative:\npkexec chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\npkexec chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/README\n\nit will change the permission. Try it it will work.\n\nA: First Option\nFollowing this post:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot PC\n\n*When the GRUB boot selection screen shows, choose Recovery Mode. (If it doesn't come up, press the Shift key when you see the GRUB loader down the bottom).\n\n*A black terminal should come up, at this point you can run this command (you should have root privileges):\nchmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\n\nAlternatively\nYou will have to put Ubuntu onto a LiveCD, boot into the LiveCD, mount your Ubuntu Partition on the Hard Drive (Open a file browser, like Nautilus, and click your Ubuntu Partition; or click Places->\"xxGB Partition/Your Ubuntu Partition\").\nThen, open a terminal within the LiveCD session and type these two commands:\ncd /media/<name of permanent ubuntu partition>/etc\nsudo chmod 0440 sudoers\n\nExtra Problems\nIf there are any errors (as posted below), follow the error prompt and adjust each file accordingly using one of the above two steps:\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo: /etc/sudoers.d/README is mode 0777, should be 0440 sudo: /var/lib/sudo writable by non-owner (040777), should be mode 0700 [sudo] password for\n\nFix by following through with:\nchmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/README\nchmod 0700 /var/lib/sudo\n\nBoth of these commands should be used appropriately with the outlined steps above. They will change the file permissions associated with that file. 0440 will give the owner (root) and the group read permissions and 0700 will give the owner (root), read, write and execute permissions.\n\nA: sudo is broken in this situation, but pkexec (the command-line frontend to PolicyKit) still works, so you can fix it with a single command. No rebooting is necessary.\npkexec chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\n\nThis assumes PolicyKit is installed. If this is a desktop system (rather than a server with no GUI), it is.\n\nA: What did you do to get these errors?\n\n\n*\n\n*If you did: sudo chmod -R 777 /etc, you need a Live CD to repair this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a Live CD and select \"Try it\"\n\n*Mount your Ubuntu partition (or the partition containing /etc if you've put /etc on a separate partition). This can be done by using a file browser like Nautilus or the Places menu\n\n*Open a Terminal by going to Applications => Accessories => Terminal\n\n*Determine the folder of you Ubuntu partition, you can list the contents of mounted partitions by using ls -l /media. It's possibly named ubuntu or disk. In the next steps, I'll assume ubuntu.\n\n*In the Terminal, set restrictive permissions by default:\nsudo find /media/ubuntu/etc -type f -exec chmod g-wx,o-rwx {} \\;\nsudo find /media/ubuntu/etc -type d -exec chmod g-w,o-rwx {} \\;\n\n\n*Next, use the Live CD as reference point for restoring file permissions. The below command will change the file permissions for /etc/media/ubuntu using the /etc folder on the Live CD as reference point. It'll only change permissions on files (-type f) and directories (-type d) on the same filesystem (-xdev). Any errors are written to ~/errors.log Errors like \"file not found\" indicates that a file on the system is installed, but not found on the Live CD. The command from step 5 should set the right permissions for it, but for the best results, you'd better reinstall the packages.\ncd /media/ubuntu && sudo find etc -xdev \\( -type f -o -type d \\) -f -exec chmod --reference=/{} {} \\; 2>~/errors.log\n\n\n*Now safe ~/errors.log somewhere (like http://paste.ubuntu.com/) so you can add it as comment to this answer should you've any problems with applications.\n\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu you can first strike Ctrl+Alt+T which opens the terminal. \nAfter that you can copy-paste the command below with Ctrl+C and paste in terminal with Ctrl+Shift+V.\npkexec chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\n\n\nA: For me, I had to add one more step the the pkexec suggestions, per this, I was lucky that I happened to have 2 ssh sessions going when I made the stupid mistake:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open 2 terminals\n\n*In terminal 2, run echo $$ to get PID\n\n*Run pkttyagent --process PID_FROM_STEP2 in terminal 2\n\n*In terminal 1, run pkexec chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers\n\n*In my case, I also had to run pkexec chown root:root /etc/sudoers\n", "Q: Menu and title don't line up in the top panel?

This functionality is required to efficiently use OpenGL to render window contents to the screen (the alternative being to suck the pixel data into the window manager and then create a texture manually).\nGL npot or rect textures refers to the ability to create textures of arbitrary dimensions.  Earlier graphics hardware could only work with square textures whose dimensions were a power of two (e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc).  The npot part stands for \"non power of two\".  If you are dealing with window contents as textures, this is pretty important.\nGL vertex program and GL fragment program are extensions used to program parts of the OpenGL pipeline.\nGL framebuffer object is an extension to allow off screen rendering.  Traditionally OpenGL operations render directly to the screen.  Rendering off screen allows the resulting image to be processed further (e.g. used to create a texture for further rendering.\nGL version is 1.4+ is just checking what version of OpenGL the driver claims to support.  This check would be to determine whether the driver supports a minimum baseline of functionality required by that version of the specification.\n\nA: It's just a suggestion and could be wrong. But probably you have a pretty old video card, which does not support the necessary openGL capabilities.\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu on a HP DV6 Laptop I just bought a HP DV6 6011tx (link) Laptop.

Ubuntu will switch to desktop view so you can see the error and retry installation. \n\n*I have checked the CD for errors and it passes all the tests\n\n\nA: First thing to check is that your ISO image is good. Run a md5 checksum on the file and make sure it validates against the one published on the ubuntu downloads page.\nWhen you make a CD from the ISO always set the burner to run a check at the end. This ensures that the CD has been made correctly.\nI've had issues with some brands/batches of CDs where they would be OK for audio recording but have errors for any digital stuff. Make sure your disks are reasonable quality, free of scratches and dust.\nLast time I installed Ubuntu (just a week ago) I used my USB thumb for the image rather than a CD. It was so much faster running off of the USB. I'd recommend doing this method to anyone who has a suitable computer.

I see that there is a folder created with the name .Trash-1000  in the NTFS partitions. \nCould someone explain to me :\n\n\n*\n\n*What does this folder mean ?\n\n*For what it is used? Maybe Trash related? \n\n*Is it necessary to keep this folder ?\n\n\nA: For every mountpoint Ubuntu creates .Trash directory when a file is deleted. \nThe 1000 is the UID of the user that created the bin, so every user can have their own.\n\nIs it necessary to keep this folder ?\n\nI think it is your choice. It just a bin folder, If you need a bin folder for your mount HD you can keep it. \nIf you want Ubuntu prevent creating this directory: \n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use the delete button only (Otherwise the .Trash-1000 folder will be created)\n\n*Press the key combination Shift+Delete together to delete, then Ubuntu won't create a .Trash-1000 folder. \nNote for 12.04: Under 12.04 i noticed that .trash directory recreated even if you deleted with Shift+Delete\nNote:  If you delete this directory files and folders this way they are gone forever\n\nA: It is like a Trash bin for the files you deleted.\nThe 1000 is the user UID, so every user can get a different Trash bin folder.\nThis usually happens when youu delete a file from a NTFS partition and not shift and delete them.\nSo if the folder is empty or you don't need those deleted files it's ok to delete it.\n", "Q: I can´t download Adobe flash I can´t download adobe flash player, whenever I try it asks to pick an application.

Apparently you can have some pretty weird problems if you install fglrx (ATI's driver) along side the open source one - though I've only read that, not sure what those problems really are. \nYou may want to make sure you aren't loading the open source ATI driver - you'll want to add \"radeon\" to some blacklist file in /etc/modules/, reboot and use \"lsmod | grep radeon\" to confirm it's not getting loaded. Then I'd re-try the driver installer, but I'd have it install directly in to your system, as, like I said, I've never managed to get the .deb generating working (though maybe that's easy, just perhaps requires some package, etc?).\nThere's some pretty epic guides out there to dealing with being an ATI vicitm on Linux, if you're still stuck, I suggest you look for them. (I used to love ATI, but their cards just seem so difficult to get running really well in Linux lately.. Hopefully AMD changes that soon!)\n", "Q: Triple boot Windows XP, Ubuntu, & Mac on Acer z5g notebook I'm planning to install Mac OS X using these instructions\nhttp://basshead.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/snow-leopard-on-acer-aspire-one-aoa150zg5/\non my Acer z5g notebook \nI have Windows XP & Ubuntu 11.04 dual booting on it perfectly fine.

Let me emphasize that it's a cool project, but be prepared to reinstall everything a few times before you get it right. It's ideal if you can make an image of your drive from states that are good to restore to and try again from.\nNow, just looking at the URL you gave, those are looking like somewhat older instructions. So you may want to google around first and see if you can't find something a touch more modern. Grub2 (which is the default boot loader with Ubuntu 11.04) can detect OSX and add it as a boot option. I'd suggest you find some current, decent instructions, follow them fairly closely, but see if you can skip the bootloader installation. Then, when installation is complete, you'll need to regenerate your grub boot menu. I think running sudo update-grub will do that for you.\nHope that helps set ya on the right track.

If if not why? \n\nA: For Flash you used NSpluginwrapper which is an entirely different beast.\nndiswrapper only covers the NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification) so as the name suggests, it's only good for network cards where Windows drivers follow this specification.\nIt's not going to help you with anything else.\n", "Q: Does using Screenlets affect battery life on a notebook? I just read about Screenlets.\nI was wondering if using Screenlets will affect the battery life of my notebook?\n\nA: Well, anything that causes disk io or increased CPU cycles is particularly able to affect your battery life, unless your machine is configured to run full steam regardless. I think how much your battery life will be affected would range from hardly affected all the way to noticeably. \nMy guess is if you use them within sanity, as in run a few modest ones, you won't notice a difference.\nSo to answer the question more directly: \"Yes, using screenlets will affect your battery life, with some exceptions\"\nI believe this answers your question sufficiently, right?\n", "Q: Chrome icon not appearing in Launcher I've been using Chromium for some time now, but I decided to switch over to Chrome.

Ubuntu only ships free (libre) applications.\nffmpeg  can encode and decode ALAC with the following command:\nffmpeg -i <input> -acodec alac <output>.m4a\n\nChange input and output to you filename but you will need to rip the CD to either FLAC or WAV first (since the programs that rip CDs are probably limited to MP3, OGG, FLAC and WAV and will not natively support ALAC.\n\nA: To add to this in case any one else is interested I've pulled together a script which converts a CD to FLAC and ALAC transcribing the meta data between FLAC and ALAC since they use slightly different formats. It also performs conversion from FLAC to ALAC as part of this process and could be easily modified to go the other way. It takes the whole process from rip to FLAC/ALAC rip with 2 clicks and in under 15 minutes, it can also be used to batch CD rips.\nSee here\n\nA: You may be interested to know that the commandline ripper abcde has support for encoding CDs to Apple Lossless Audio Codec (alac) using qaac and Wine.

I installed the Ambiance Evolution Theme from a custom PPA, which overwrote the original Ambiance. Same for Midori, Flash and other apps. Is it advisable to downgrade these packages to the Ubuntu-provided versions before an upgrade?\n\nA: No, it is not safe to simply remove a ppa through the package manager without restoring defaults. This can cause unwanted side effects (e.g. if this were graphics drivers you will have no access to the GUI).\nTo fully reset your system to defaults and to remove any unwanted ppa we may use the script ppa-purge \nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge -purge <nameofppa>\n\nfollowed by\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: Yes it safer to remove PPAs and their packages. Ubuntu upgrades are tested for default installations, not installation in which everything is changed by PPAs. By removing extra repositories (not just PPAs, but also third party repositories) and their associated packages, you return the system to their original state.\nAfter the upgrade, you're free to install your preferred PPAs of course.\n", "Q: How can I setup dhcpd (dynamic DNS)?

Some I understood, some I have to say ...were beyond my understanding\nApologies if you have seen this before but he also did a more recent update which may help\nI would also as a matter of course look at what things you have starting up automatically \nHit the super key (windows key) and type Startup Applications and you can then (de)select things you do not need to start up ...it might also help alongside the more complex things\n", "Q: See computer's uptime and history I was wondering if it is at all possible to find out when the computer was switched on, what files where accessed what folders were opened, what programs run and when the computer was resumed and put back to sleep (just like in the movies).\nI know this isn't that important but it would be cool to know.\n\nA: When was the machine turned on:\nuptime\n\nExample from my notebook:    \n20:06:33 up  1:50,  2 users,  load average: 0.03, 0.04, 0.05\n\nThat is current time, uptime, amount of users and the load average.\nWhat programs run:\n\n\n*\n\n*Command line\nps -ef|more\n\n\n\n*GUI - System monitor (dash, system monitor):\n\nWhen the computer was resumed or sleep\nlast\n\n\nwhat folders were opened\nwhat files where accessed\nNone of these I know a command for. Natty has activity journal for files.\nOther interesting things...\n\n\n*\n\n*To see when the users logged in the last time: lastlog.\n\n\n*Login failure: faillog. \nlast, lastlog, faillog make use of log file /var/log/wtmp (last), /var/log/lastlog and /var/log/faillog. If those are not active you will not get any result. \n\n*lsof shows a list of currently open files.\n\nIt can do alot of checks on a lot of options. From man lsof:\n\nTo list all open IPv4 network files in use by the process whose PID is 1234, use:\nlsof -i 4 -a -p 1234\n\nTo list all open files for login name ``abe'', or user ID 1234, or process 456, or process 123, or process 789, use:\nlsof -p 456,123,789 -u 1234,abe\n\nTo list all open files on device /dev/hd4, use:\nlsof /dev/hd4\n\n\n\nA: A few things worth checking out :\n\n\n*\n\n*uptime command to see how long your computer's been running.\n\n*Gnome Log Viewer (gnome-system-log) shows all of your logs at one place.\n\n*Zeitgeist Activity Journal. This gives a brilliant calendar like view to show you what files were opened, and which applications were used. \n\n\nA: As many have said \"uptime\" gives you up time. \nI like to use \"htop\" to show me information about what's currently running - it's really really nicely formatted, easy for me to skim. \nIf you want to see who's currently logged in, try the command \"who\". You can dump messages on to their terminals by the \"write\" command, that can be fun.\nAs for seeing what's been going on, you can check your logs, such as /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages (depending on distro). Further, for somewhat lower-level messages, \"dmesg\" is helpful.\nAnother thing you can use to try to see history is take a look at users *~/.bash_history* (or ~/.history, etc). That file will show you a list of commands that user has recently run. I believe a user has the ability to nuke their own history file. There's probably ways of configuring that so you can monitor more closely.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: In the terminal write : \nuptime\n\nA: For a graphical solution, System Profiler and Benchmark (search in the Ubuntu Software Center) provides both uptime and lists all starts.  I don't know if it shows the programs that were run, although I guess I doubt it.  But the program is very good for getting all sorts of information about your system, mostly hardware-related.\n\nA: You can use the last command to check on boot times, reboots, suspends/resumes.\n\nA: To check the uptime of a PC go to Terminal and type uptime then press enter.\n\nA: screenfetch also works for this and provides data in a nice way.\nInstall it with $ sudo apt install screenfetch.\nThen type screenfetch for the information.\n(Note: It only shows how many hours it was turned on and other details of the system)\n", "Q: Corrupted file problem Is there any way to decorrupt a file in Ubuntu 11.04? I think the file might have got encrypted when I shutdown my system but didn't decrypt correctly when I started up. Or, does Ubuntu auto backup anywhere? Anything that might help me restore a lost file could help.\nThe filesystem is ext4. Its only one file that not working correctly, and it stopped working after I had to manually shutdown my system.\n\nA: I suggest you try file system checking utilities.. \"fsck\" the partition/volume the encrypted file in question resides on. You may need to boot off a LiveCD or something to do that check. Once that's done, try decrypting your file again. If that doesn't work, I fear you may be SOL. But maybe others will know tricks.\nGood luck friend!\n", "Q: Switcheroo or ACPI call: Which is the better option and what are the differences? I'm running Natty 64-bit on my Acer TimelineX 3820TG.This notebook has a switchable graphics card (ATI Radeon HD5650 and Intel Chipset).\nCurrently I am not using the fglrx drivers. I am a little confused as to how or which way to switch between the cards. \nI have downloaded and compiled ACPI_Call and can load this with the following commands:\nsudo insmod acpi_call.ko\ntest_off.sh\n\nThis works well for switching to the Intel Chipset and giving me about 7 hours of battery life (very sweet). However, that comes at a cost as I am not able to switch back to the ATI GPU (it causes my system to freeze and the only way to recover is REISUB), which is required if I want to put the laptop into sleep mode. \nI recently read somewhere that switcheroo was actually made for the ATI/Intel cards so it raised a few questions for me which I hope someone can answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*what is the difference between switcheroo and acpi_call?\n\n*What are the advantages/disadvantage of the two solutions?\n\n*How exactly do I use switcheroo on Natty?\n-- if it's built into the kernel, shouldn't it be automatic?\n\n\nA: I have used both on my 4820TG.  Near as I can tell I go from 4.5 to 5 hours on battery with acpi_call to 4 hours with vga_switcheroo.  Wifi on, basic web browsing stuff.\nWith vga_switcheroo suspend works whether the ATI is on or off.  I do not use the ATI in linux at this time, just windows for gaming.  However if I hibernate with the ATI off, when the machine awakens the ATI is on and cannot now be shut down without a reboot.\nacpi_call simply results in a hang when suspending or hibernating.\n", "Q: Lots of Internet browsing issues, all browsers Before the upgrade, everything was working fine. Now, however, I can connect to the Internet but a lot of stuff fails, and the weirdest thing is that it happens with Firefox, Chromium and Opera. Some of the things that fail:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't log in to Stack Overflow, after entering user/pass it loads for a long time on Firefox and throws Error 408 (browser request timed out) on Chromium and Opera\n\n*I can't log in to Hotmail, similar symptoms\n\n*I can login to Facebook, but when I try to write a comment, or just post something in my wall, it stays loading for a long time, and then fails\n\n\nThe first two issues seem to be related to secure pages, and the second one is another issue altogether, I believe. However, they all happen with all browsers, which is really weird.\nTalking about weird: I connect using a Huawei SmartAX MT 810 USB modem, which cost me blood and tears to get it working under Ubuntu. I ordered an ethernet modem/router with my ISP, and I'm still waiting, but this issue intrigues me anyway. Has anyone experienced this kind of problems? I Googled around, but couldn't find a similar case.\n\nA: I have 3 comps 2 of which was having this same issue didn't matter what Operating System i had installed still did same thing.

When 802.3ad bonded ethernet is configured on Ubuntu, it takes some time before it finishes protocol negotiation and starts passing packets, because the networking script just configures, but does not verify that traffic is being passed.  As a result, this can throw off some of the other network dependent scripts, like the init for drbd.  Right now, I just have a loop that pings the gateway in a startup script, but this seems less than optimal:\nGATEWAYIP=10.0.0.1\nwhile ( ! ping -c 1 $GATEWAYIP  ); do\n   echo gateway not up\ndone\n\n\nA: This is a pretty specific use case you have with DRBD in line after networking.  As I don't have much DRBD experience, I'm not sure how fast it will try to establish.  Perhaps you could get by with simply detecting when the IP is bound to the interface instead of waiting until a ping responds (which adds that latency to the mix).  \nPerhaps something like;\n#!/bin/bash\n# Fetch Interface\nBONDED_INTERFACE=$(cat /proc/net/dev | grep 'bon' | awk -F: '{print $1}')\n\n# Determine Network Status\nif [ \"$BONDED_INTERFACE\" ]; then\n    BONDED_IP=$(/sbin/ifconfig ${BONDED_INTERFACE} | sed -n  -e '/Bcast/p' | cut -d : -f 2 | awk '{print $1}')\n    while [ \"${#BONDED_IP}\" -le \"0\" ]; do\n        echo \"No IP Present on The Interface\";\n        BONDED_IP=$(/sbin/ifconfig ${BONDED_INTERFACE} | sed -n  -e '/Bcast/p' | cut -d : -f 2 | awk '{print $1}')\n    done\n    echo \"The Interface IP is: $BONDED_IP\";\nelse\n    echo \"No Bonded Interface Found\";\nfi\n\nI suppose outside of debugging the above script would make more sense calling a sleep for a time duration rather then echoing it's output.  \nIf this still isn't quite what you want, perhaps there is something to be done in NetworkManager or maybe trying to detect the link state (carrier sense).  Hope I was some help.  \n", "Q: Invalid Opcode 0000 At random times (usually when watching a movie in XBMC), the computer locks up.

Why its taking out the whole system is a little strange. \nA CPU exception is thrown when a process tries to do something it shouldn't be doing. In this case, the memory location that the process is trying to execute (Virtual Address is indicated by those numbers you couldn't decipher) contains an invalid instruction (e.g. 0x0000) or more likely, something is trying to execute an invalid (non-code) section of memory (probably a bad function pointer somewhere). CPU's throw exceptions all the time, (for example divide by zero is a standard exception that the OS catches) and exceptions are usually either handled by the OS (either by killing the process or by dealing with the problem) or ignored. The following two facts indicate it is probably a bug somewhere along the line and not a hardware fault.\n\n\n*\n\n*Its consistent in terms of the error it throws and the same (Virtual - I presume) memory location \n\n*Its reproducible\n\n\nHardware faults usually are much more sporadic then this, or are associated with specific hardware (like a crash every-time you access USB)\nIf you used windows before, CPU exceptions (as well as other exceptions that couldn't be resolved) usually result in the infamous \"Program performed an illegal operation\" message.\n\nA: I finally managed to get my machine running without the constant crashing.

I used Ubuntu some time ago and now I want to switch on it again since community raised a lot and so did support for applications like Wine. I remember that when 64bit version just came out many applications didn't work as they did on 32bit version. Is it not better or still the same? Maybe they implemented something like WoW in Windows that simulates 32bit architecture and every possible app is working just fine. I am asking because I have lots of ram and I don't want to sit on 3GB when I have 8.\nAlso, I am somewhat of a programmer, but that is not a problem because if I write PHP I use NetBeans on Windows anyway, and it works on Linux just as fine. But I also love to write C++/C# code. Is it well supported? I really like Visual Studio 2010, it is very slick and has good auto completion, debugging and so on... Is there any IDE on Ubuntu that is similar to Visual Studio in terms of auto-completion, code formatting, GUI designer, debugging?\nI really hope you will answer me these questions because I really like to \"convert\" myself to Ubuntu once and for all.\n\nA: *Most applications work just fine in a 64-bit OS. I haven't actually run across any that don't, but as soon as I say all applications one is bound to pop up.\nAs to your 8GB RAM point. Unless you have processes that take more than 4GB of RAM then a 32-bit OS with the PAE kernel will address all 8GB of your RAM.\n\nA: As far as the 64-bit Ubuntu version is concerned, I have had zero difficulties running either native Linux applications and/or Windows programs under Wine.  Obviously there is software out there, with which I have no experience, but I would suggest that the 64-bit Ubuntu version is much better than it was a few years ago when I was trying to get it up and functioning properly on a past laptop.\n\nA: I installed 64-bit Ubuntu just a few weeks ago and the only problem I've encountered so far is that LinkSys AE1000 wireless adapter doesn't work with it: the drivers provided by Ralink are only 32-bit and I couldn't get them to work with 64-bit Ubuntu.  Everything else, though, has worked as well, if not better, than before.  I'm very glad I made the switch, since the 64-but OS seems to be a little faster overall (more than I expected, frankly).\nBut I'm not a programmer: your mileage may differ.\n\nA: Regarding 64 bit Linux: in many respects, linux has better 64 bit support than windows in that there are more key applications that are 64 bit native.  Ubuntu has improved very much in the past few years with regard to 64 bit support; flash is now available in \"preview\" mode for native 64 bit support.  Also, the 32-bit support w/in 64 bit generally works as a fallback.\nRegarding an IDE, I would recommend Eclipse, if you're looking for an all-language, integrated IDE.  It has the richest plugin ecosystem (moreso than VS).  But, being a guy who considers it \"forced\" to have to use VS2010, I personally like gedit.  Good old gedit has syntax highlighting for most languages (and community available packages for more), and very many plugins to do code completion, bracket completion, etc...  It's lightweight and easy to use.  http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Plugins \n", "Q: Can't play dvd with movie player When I try to open a dvd with movie player, I get a message saying that a plugin is missing. It isn't specified what plugin is needed and when I click on the search button, no appropriate plugin is found.\nHow do I determine what I need? What is the best way to view DVDs on Ubuntu 11.04?\n\nA: by abarbaneld\nUbuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal does not come out of the box playing DVDs but with 2 simple commands you will be watching DVDs in a flash.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal Window Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n*Type sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh\n\n*Insert DVD and enjoy.\nI noticed during playback of my DVD that the picture was a bit wobbly. There is an easy fix for this.\nGo to Edit>Preferences>Display Tab and check the box that reads disable deinterlacing of interlaced videos.\nNext close down the Movie Player and reopen it and the wobbly screen should be gone.\n\nAnother option that is worth enabling is the play video where you left off.\nGo to Edit>Preferences>General Tab and check on Start playing files from last position.\n\n\nA: Open software center and search for: ubuntu-restricted-extras install it.\nAlso it should work in VLC player, try it.\n\nA: And if you keep having a message stating the decrypt lib are not installed or if VLC starts reading the media and stops, it is because your region is not correct for the DVD. To fix this, download regionset using packet manager.\n", "Q: External usb 3.0 hard drive is not recognised when plugged into usb 3 port I have an Iomega Prestige Portable External Hard Drive 1TB USB 3.0.\nIt works fine on windows 7 as a usb 3.0 drive.\nIt isn't detected on ubuntu natty 64bit, 2.6.38-8-generic.\nfdisk -l cannot see it at all:\n    Disk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x1bed746b\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1               1        1689    13560832   27  Unknown\n/dev/sda2   *        1689        1702      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda3            1702       19978   146805760    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda4           19978       60802   327914497    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5           25555       60802   283120640    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda6           19978       23909    31571968   83  Linux\n/dev/sda7           23909       25555    13218816   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nPartition table entries are not in disk order\n\nlsusb can see it:\nBus 003 Device 003: ID 059b:0070 Iomega Corp. \nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 05fe:0011 Chic Technology Corp.

I have a problem installing a theme for my Ubuntu, note that I am very new to it and probably messed something up. Still it seems to me that I did everything like it was stated in the INSTALL file.\nTheme: http://opendesktop.org/content/show.php/?content=140562\nSo I downloaded the *.zip package, unzipped it in ~/.themes folder and changed Controls and Borders inside my theme preference. Still my result is pretty poor. You can look at the image, it looks nothing like what in the screenshot of the author. I also installed fonts running sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer and tried to install GTK2 engine as sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-murrine gtk2-engines-pixbuf, but it showed that 0 files was modified since I already have it.\nPlease tell me what did I did wrong so I can fix that :)\n\n\nA: Uh... The theme is for Gnome. You, as per your screenshot, are clearly using Unity. Unity is Canonical's replacement for the Gnome desktop environment. Think of them as something like Explorer on windows (not just the file browser, but the Explorer bar as well). You're running an entirely different interface than the one that skin was made for.\nSadly, installing Gnome 3 in Ubuntu is painful and unpleasant, and unless you are lucky, it won't end without problems. Furthermore, despite the final release state of Gnome 3, it really comes off as Alpha software in is buggyness, missing features, and lack of options -- whereas Unity is, at least, beta software. I'd link you to help installing Gnome 3, but after following 3 or 4 different guides myself, I ended up with a frankenstein's monster of an install. Would not recommend. Try switching from Ubuntu to a distro that comes with Gnome 3 prepacked, if you really want to -- like Fedora, for example.\n\nA: Without having tried this myself, my only comment would be that this theme is designed around Gnome 3.0.* and the r69 version of the Unico engine.  Perhaps there is some slight incompatibility between the theme and GTK2.\n\nA: This post on Webupd8 would help. I'm quite sure that somehow you are using the Zukitwo Dark variation.\n", "Q: everything disabled in PiTiVi I'm trying to use PiTiVi...

Ok, I have searched for some time in earnest for an answer to this question.  I have a Beagleboard which has Ubuntu 10.10 Minimal install for Arm running on it.  \nWith the default install, minimal tools, no GUI, I am unable to connect to my wireless network.  The name of my network is \"MYNAME NETWORK\".  Using a text editor to edit /etc/network/interfaces I can not seem to connect at all.  \nAs an experiment, I connected to a friends network, which has a one word name \"dystek\",and was able to connect with Zero issues, and update and install a full GUI for ubuntu Arm.  \nThe problem is that I don't want a full blown gui on the beagleboard, just a minimal install of ubuntu with CLI is all I need or want.  \nIs there anyway to connect to my wireless network via editing the /etc/network/interfaces file.  Surely there is... I just don't know how.\nRight now my interfaces file looks like this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.200\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nwireless-essid BARRETT NETWORK\nwireless-key 46456xxxxxxxx\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: From here:\n\nAdd the name (ssid) for the network you want to create/join. Use single quotes if there is a space in the name.\n\nSo you could try:\nwireless-essid 'BARRETT NETWORK'\n\nAnother alternative is to specify the MAC address of the router/gateway, instead of the name. This is called the bssid. \nwireless-bssid FFFFFFFFFFFF\n\nYou would replace the essid line with a bssid line containing the MAC address of the router (it should be printed on the bottom of it, or can be found with sudo iwlist scanning under 'Address').\n\nEdit: From James' comments below, try replacing the wireless-essid and wireless-key lines with the following, as you are using WPA. Your passphrase also needs to be in hex. There are online tools for converting your passphrase to hex.\nwpa-ssid 'BARRETT NETWORK'\nwpa-psk 46456xxxxxxxx\n\n\nA: From my own test in Ubuntu 16.04.2, the rest of the line following the wpa-essid prefix is taken literally, so no quotes or escaping is required.  From your comments in this thread, it looks like the issue was actually due to using a passphrase instead of a hex key.\n", "Q: Help!

If that doesn't work try remove, then with -f flag.\nAlso - a good practice that doesn't seem to be actively encouraged by the Ubuntu installer is to have /home and / on different partitions, so that you can freely reinstall the core OS without affecting most of your settings, which makes recovering from fatal issues easier.

I don't know why I did it. I did it.\nNow, I can't get in to Ubuntu. Windows works fine. But when I try to start Ubuntu normally, it seems to run some checks, and does not start up. Sometimes, I see a black screen, and it tells me that it's running certain checks, and then, [ok]. Like...\nBattery Check Somethingorother                [ok]\nIt'll give me 1-5 of these.

I tried low graphics mode, and after going through a couple of dialogue boxes, I'm brought right back to the safe mode dialogue box. And if I hit 'resume,' a shell pushes up (still that grey on black \"your computer is broken\" type shell) and asks me to log in. I do, and try to run unity. It tells me something along the lines of:\nWARNING no DISPLAY variable set\nand then sets it to \" :0\" , which doesn't work.\nAnd then I can't do anything, really, and I have to restart. (I don't know how to do this from the command line, so I just hard reset. That command would be helpful).\nDoes anybody have any idea how I can get Ubuntu working right again? FTP is less pleasant in Explorer than it is in Nautilus or w/e it is now.\n\nA: First instead of pushing the Power Button try this command  sudo reboot . As for the issues your having with unity not loading in safe mode or normal try to boot . Type  sudo apt-get remove unity    which should remove unity . Then type  sudo apt-get install unity  to reinstall you may get lucky . Chances are your going need to reformat ubuntu with your cd.\n\nA: before formatting your HD or performing irreversible actions, consider using a livecd. your computer isn't 'broken'. you may want to check if your partition table is ok and your data is still there. if so, you may simply have to check your fs, which could be damaged. a file system check may be able to correct the errors. still, i can't understand why you managed to break your system. in order to check the status of your HD (it may be physically damaged) you may want to have a look at the smartmontools package which contains a tool to examine the conditions of your HD. I don't think re-installing any package will solve your problem but the configuration files of some packeges may be corrupted. then, remember that a re-installation (with --purge, maybe, but use it at your own risk) will overwrite the old conf files and create new ones.\nand remember that if acpid is installed and properly configured, a single, little push on the power button will cause your computer to shut down genlty, with no consequences.\nand, this is a good chance to learn some odd command line stuff! :)\n", "Q: Different action for unity launcher icon depending on action?

Is there something I can type into the terminal that when the command actually goes through, that will be treated like an ampersand?\nWill ;amp; work?\n\nA: Quotes will fix this but you can also escape things with a back-slash:\necho http://whatever.com/?x=1\\&y=2\n\nNot saying this is better, by any means, it's just another option for situations like this.\n\nA: You need to put the address in quotes:\nchromium-browser 'http://whatever.com/?x=1&y=2'\n\n\nA: It won't actually matter in this case, but there is a difference between single quotes and double quotes.\nDouble quotes will substitute special characters such as '$' and quotes, whereas single quotes treat everything literally, except for the closing single quote.\nBoth will group the text together, which causes chromium to treat it a single argument, and characters like \";#&\" have no special meaning in that context.\nThis shows the use of '\\' to escape a double quote within double quotes, and a backslash itself:\nmat@sen:~$ echo \"a&bc\\\\#de\\\"f\"\na&bc\\#de\"f\n\nWith single quotes nothing changes:\nmat@sen:~$ echo 'a&bc\\\\#de\\\"f'\na&bc\\\\#de\\\"f\n\nWithout the quotes the '&' splits it into two commands:\nmat@sen:~$ echo a&bc\\\\#de\\\"f\n[1] 2619\na\nbc\\#de\"f: command not found\n[1]+  Done                    echo a\n[1]+  Done                    echo a\n\nUsually when dealing with one kind of quote you can just wrap it in the other type, but you may run into problems with this:\nmat@sen:~$ echo \"'a'bc$foo\"\n'a'bc\n\nThe single quotes aren't substituted, but the '$' is.

Is Oxygen GTK  better for me to use since I'm using the Oxygen theme anyway?\n\nA: The QTCurve theme does not try and mimic the default look and feel of KDE in any way. It is a theme that gives your GTK-based application a QT-styled appearance, but it will make your GTK-based application stand out and look different to your KDE applications.\nThe Oxygen theme will make applications both look and feel similar whether they are QT-/KDE- or GTK-based, and the oxygen developer go through much effort of making sure the oxygen gtk theme makes GTK-based applications not just \"look\" like QT/KDE applications, but also have the same \"feel\".\nFor more information on the effort put into the oxygen gtk theme, you can have a look here:\nhttp://hugo-kde.blogspot.com/2011/06/oxygen-gtk-11-is-out.html\nand here:\nhttp://hugo-kde.blogspot.com/2011/04/taste-of-things-to-come.html\n", "Q: How do I select QtCurve theme for GTK apps in KDE?

I assume I have to select the QtCurve theme somehow.\n\n@13east has posted a picture of the settings dialog in his answer below. Unfortunately the GTK+ appearance is the only tab that is missing from my Settings Dialog. I assume this is because I've installed only plasma-desktop instead of the entire kubuntu-desktop. Is there a way to manually set the theme, perhaps by editing some configuration files?\n\nA: If you open the \"System Settings\" app, there's an icon in the top row for something like \"application settings\" (I think it's second or third from the left in the top row--I don't have KDE available at the moment). If you click on that icon you'll see a dialogue with a few options in the left-hand panel. One of them is to set the theme for GTK applications. You should just be able to select qtcurve from the drop-down menu in the right-hand pane under that tab. \n\nA: IIRC there's some package named kde-gtk  , which is why you don't have the GTK config tab.\nAlso , you should edit ~/.gtkrc-2.0 manually if things above failed to function:\ninclude \"/usr/share/themes/QtCurve/gtk-2.0/gtkrc\"\nFor GTK3 , i'm not sure if it's supported.\n\nA: System Settings -> Application Appearance -> GTK+ Appearance -> Widget Style\n\n\nA: Install the kde-config-gtk package, and you'll get the missing sub-applet.

When I try to launch this script from /etc/event.d/ it works fine.  Why would this be and how would I fix it?\n\nA: Ubuntu 8.04 included an older version of Upstart, which stored its scripts under /etc/event.d rather than /etc/init like current versions do.\nWhile upgrading Upstart would make it look in the new location, I would strongly recommend against doing that unless you are upgrading the entire system (e.g. to the current LTS release: 10.04).

It's a very fast CPU by any measure. It also has a Nvidia GTX 580 strapped to it. I say this not to boast (you should see my poor bank balance) but just to get the point across, I'm talking about a powerful system.\nIt struggles with 1080p Flash.\nIf you need flawless performance, ignore the system requirements because they're likely idealised for Windows. Flash Player's performance has, at least for the past and the present, been awful, whatever your hardware.\nHardware acceleration with Flash in Linux is also a billion times less certain than in Windows.

It includes both a color prompt and a quote displayed with ASCII art. \nIs it possible to have it in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The custom setup is done in /etc/bash.bashrc on Linux Mint 11 - if you download the .iso you can mount that as a loop device on Ubuntu and copy/paste the text, which is quite large, but you should be able to paste it into your ~/.bashrc.\nOne nice feature is that the prompt changes to red when you are root.\nThere will also be some setup for the GNOME Terminal application to make the background be white - you can do that through the Terminal preferences.\n\nA: The file ~/.bashrc allows you to make the customizations you would like, among other things.\nFirst open it with gedit ~/.bashrc\nNow in order to have the multicolored prompt, find the line that looks like this:\n#force_color_prompt=yes\nUn-comment it (remove the #).\nNow to get the ascii art and quote, you will need to install two packages:\nsudo apt-get install cowsay fortune\nNow in ~/.bashrc add a line with:\nfortune | cowsay\nSave the file, and restart your terminal (or resource the file with source ~/.bashrc).\n\n\nA: If add the following to your .bashrc file, you get color-coded date, time, username, hostname, and the current directory. Most importantly, you get the entire line to type your command.\nPS1=\"\\a\\n\\n\\e[31;1m\\u@\\h on \\d at \\@\\n\\e[33;1m\\w\\e[0m\\n$ \"\n\n\nA: Instead of customizing ~/bashrc file manually, simply use Gogh script for the customization of the entire color scheme for Gnome terminal.\nThe Gogh library provides dozens of different color schemes which can be installed by simply running a single command and restarting the terminal. \nFor instance, the following command will change the color scheme to light,\nwget -O xt  http://git.io/vs7UQ && chmod +x xt && ./xt && rm xt\n\nDEMO\n\nPlease visit on the following page for the list of all the available Color Schemes and their demonstration,\nhttps://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh/blob/master/content/themes.md\n\nA: Yes, It's possible. Just open up your .bashrc file with any Editor(ex: nano, vi and etc.).Then scroll down to this line of code.\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '...........\nThen comment out the current PS1 variable (If you want to use it later).Then add Mint prompt instead of that. Just paste this right below that.\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;31m\\]\\h\\[\\033[01;34m\\]$ '\nThen save it and reopen up the terminal.

Peter Anvin et al\"\nThe laptop is an old Toshiba Satellite Pro.\nI have tried this CD on my PC and the LiveCD can boot there.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I'd make sure you've got the CD in perfect condition. First check that the ISO image you downloaded is complete (# of bytes is correct is an okay quick test). Then burn it again, at a low speed and have the burning software verify the burn. Then try booting from it again.\nFailing that, look in to your BIOS. Note the version number. Then go to the product page for that laptop and see if there are newer BIOS versions available. If so, read their change logs to see if any of them corrected booting problems.\nAlso, make sure your boot settings in BIOS make sense. I don't think you could get to where you are without them being good enough, but still, have a look. \nAs a last resort, you may want to look in to installing from USB. Note that some USB drives just don't work well as boot devices. So you may end up needing to try a few different drives.\n", "Q: How can I organize mixed mp3 files in natty? \nPossible Duplicate:\nSort music by metadata \n\nI have missorted the mp3 files into different folders. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to organize all the mp3 files in correct folders ? \n\n*Can I move the files in those folders according to the genre ?\n\nA: You could use something like Banshee to move the MP3's into a consistent folder structure, although you can't do it by genre. You just need to select \"copy files to media folders when importing\" in the preferences and make sure the directory you are importing from isn't the same as the directory you are importing to.\n\nA: Before looking at the brief script below please read these notes about a couple of the lines: Within the MediaMonkey installer I accepted all defaults except on the last page.

The wiki page describing the current state of these efforts is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/OMAP/Archos101it\nNote that due to the relatively low memory available for this device, support is never expected to be wonderful: those who do not currently own such a device would be better served by something with a bit more RAM (Archos's G9 series is one example).\nUsers who have installed Ubuntu on devices with 4GB or 8GB of local storage have expressed a sense of confinement in terms of available storage for common data: while the environment works, devices with 16GB of local storage have received more positive reviews.\nYou will not be able to use Unity in Ubuntu 11.04 on this device: Unity support for GLES is too new: while it is hoped that it can be included in Ubuntu 11.10, this has not yet been confirmed.\nI am not personally familiar with the bootloader configuration for the Archos tablets, but people with similar devices have reported that dual-booting is difficult.

On both drives grub is installed to boot both operating systems. When I wanted to install SP1 for Win 7 I had to add a bootable flag to the partition from which Windows boots, otherwise the installation of SP1 does not work. I did so by booting into Ubuntu and using gparted to add this flag. After doing so the update for SP1 worked without any problems.\nWhen trying to boot back into Ubuntu grub complained that it couldn't find the kernel anymore! I tried to boot into a Ubuntu minimal cd and to restore grub using chroot, update-grub and grub-install which didn't work. I still had the problem that it was Unable to boot Ubuntu putting me in some minimal system called initramfs. It seems however that the uuid of the partitions changed. I guess this happened when I added the bootflag to the windows disk.\nNext thing I tried was to tell grub not to use the uuid for loading the kernel by uncommenting something in /etc/default/grub. Then I got the kernel booting but it suddenly stops (I guess when it is trying to mount the root file system) saying that the concerning uuid does not exist putting me into initramfs again. The strange thing is that there I coulnd't even manage to mount the root partition using /dev/sdb1 (on which it is in my case).\nI would be glad if there is a way to restore the system again without having to reinstall it.\nUpdate\nIn case anyone cares I solved this. For some reason I also reseted the BIOS and it set the SATA protocol back to IDE. It seems that there is no driver for this in initrd. So I just set it back now it works again.\n\nA: Ah, UUIDs for partitions. In my experience, that approach only works as long as you don't tamper with your partitions. \nWhat I have resolved to is removing every reference to the UUIDs in /etc/fstab and in Grub and then things tend to work.\nSometimes drives are named differently when you are in a minimal system, therefore you cannot mount /dev/sdb1. Try looking which partitions were found by doing\n\nfdisk -l\n\nAlternatively you can watch the kernel boot very careful, or use \n\ndmesg\n\nto show you the kernel ring buffer again...\n", "Q: Locking down Systems in a Computer Lab School for Orphans I am helping out an NGO, called Orphans Found Fund, here in Arusha Tanzania setup a computer lab to teach students about Ubuntu and open source applications.

Any advice is much appreciated. Brendon\n\nA: *\n\n*Delete or alter system files\n\n*Alter the system settings\n\n*Add or remove applications\n\n\nTo do any of these you need the sudo password. So after installing your system you have your own account and start creating normal users. Do not tell them the sudo password and they can not alter these. All they can do is change values in their own home.\nIf you want total control install ACL  \n(wiki: access control list)\nguest login takes care of these too. Logging in as a guest will lock down anything important. But I think you would not want this if you want to track who was responsible for altering something. guest will make everything show up as altered by guest. I would set up useraccont instead so you could see based on user if someone created something. \n\n\n*\n\n*Exceed a time limit (like an Internet Cafe)\n\n\nMy favourite method would be a cron script that checks uptime and shuts down after reaching a threshold. Command for shutdown after 120 minutes:\nsudo shutdown -h 120 \n\nIf you put that in a script and put it into cron with crontab -e it would kill the machine after 2 hours.\nMind you... you will get into trouble with your users if this happens when they have some unsaved content or a website open they wanted to bookmark before the system quits.\n", "Q: How to test plymouth via virtual machine?

What I want to keep in sync are some folders, mainly ~/Documents, that are changed often when working on them.\nIf it matters I can connect to my desktop from anywhere via an URL but my laptop is harder to access since it might be behind NAT and such.\nI have been looking at Ubuntu One but it seems to not go well with working on documents written in LaTeX. If I work on a .tex file in the Ubuntu One directory and compile it (with pdflatex) every now and then (as often as every 10 sec when working) it will create several new files including a pdf which are uploaded to Ubuntu One and this seems stupid since it will create continuous upload when working on .tex files. I also usually keep .tex documents version controlled by git and then every commit (which also can happen frequently) will cause upload (by changes in ./.git) so that it happens continuously when working. Another example is editing images that are saved often. What I think would be best is for sync to happen every tenth minute or at the end of every working session (but there might be some other way to handle this?).\n\nA: I think you do not need to add the generated (PDF, dvi or Postscript) files to the version control system; however it makes sense to copy them to a synced directory or other server. I usually make this sort of things with the make command.\nI have a Makefile like this in the directory where the LaTeX files are (indents are tabs, not spaces).

A solution here would be to use 2 git repositories, one that is synced by Ubuntu One and one that is not. You can then push your changes to the synced folder when, and only when, you want the synchronisation to happen.\nYou probably want to keep the version in ~/Documents synced along with all of your other documents (enable Ubuntu One sync for ~/Documents if you haven't already), so create a clone in a non-synced folder:\nmkdir ~/nonsynced\ncd ~/nonsynced\ngit clone ~/Documents/LATEX_PROJECT\n\nYou can then work on the files in ~/nonsynced/LATEX_PROJECT. When you want to synchronise, push to ~/Documents/LATEX_PROJECT:\ngit push ~/Documents/LATEX_PROJECT\n\nIf you then work on another synchronised computer you can get the up to date version by running:\ngit pull ~/Documents/LATEX_PROJECT\n\nfrom ~/nonsynced/LATEX_PROJECT.\nYou will need to replace LATEX_PROJECT with the name of your version controlled folder in ~/Documents.\n\nA: This is a solution based on fossfreedom's answer to another question, Synchronizing 2 Ubuntu Systems with Unison, the Unison manual and my answer to another question.\nSetup\nBoth computers\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install openssh-server unison\n\n*Test the SSH link from each computer to the other.\n\n\nOn the computer that might be behind NAT\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir ~/.unison\n\n*nano default.prf – Create a profile file named default.\n\n*Write the profile file, e.g.:\nroot = /home/user\n\nroot = ssh://user@user.dyndns-ip.com//home/user\n\npath = Documents\n\nSync\nSync the computers by running unison -auto default on the computer that might be behind NAT.

I want user foo to auto-login using LightDM (which has been used by Ubuntu since version 11.10). How would I do that?\n\nA: An alternative to Alin's answer is to create a file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and add the following content:\n[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-user=<YOUR USER>\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nuser-session=ubuntu\n# Uncomment the following, if running Unity\n#greeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nNext time you start, auto-login should work like expected.\n\nA: gksu gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nadd lines:\nautologin-user=username\nautologin-user-timeout=0\n\nexample:\n[SeatDefaults]\n\nuser-session=ubuntu\n\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nautologin-user=alan\n\nautologin-user-timeout=0\n\n\nA: You can do this without editing configuration files: go to System Settings > User accounts, click \"Unlock\" and enter your password, then click the button next to \"Automatic login\":\n'\n\nA: From Ubuntu 14.04 and above create the file:\n/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/12-autologin.conf\n\nand add:\n[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-user=youruser\n\n\nA: Open settings, select 'user accounts'.

This solved my issue when trying to get lightdm to actually login in without going in loop.\nThe reason for the system to go in loop may be because lightdm needs the ubuntu desktop before it may work.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, I solved it with the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*login as root: sudo su\n\n*enter the file:\nsudo nano /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/60-lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf\n\n\n*at the bottom add:\nautologin-user=xxxx\n\n\n*save the content of the file then exit and reboot.\nThis should definitely work.\n\nA: For kali-rolling: (may work for other kali versions)\nsudo sed -i '/^\\[Seat:\\*\\]$/a autologin-user=YOUR_USERNAME\\nautologin-user-timeout=0' /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nthen create/add yourself to autologin group\nsudo groupadd -r autologin\nsudo gpasswd -a username autologin\n\nand reboot.\nthe command uses a seds insert after regular expression match feature to insert the line needed in the right section, you can alternatively just edit the file and add autologin-user= in the Seat section.\n", "Q: Will Thunderbird 5 appear in the official 11.04 repositories?

It implements the UPnP AV Media Server interface with the DLNA extensions.  There is some code in there to support the Xbox 360's quirks (Xboxes won't talk to UPnP servers that don't look enough like Windows Media Player), so is worth a shot.\nThe default configuration should pick up music in your ~/Music folder through the media export plugin, but you can configure this through the Rygel Preferences control panel.\nIf your music is not in a format the Xbox supports, Rygel is also capable of transcoding it to either raw PCM data or MP3 (assuming you have the correct GStreamer plugins installed).\n", "Q: Auto updates via aptitude? Just like here: How do I set my system to auto-update without user interaction?\nHow can I set the auto-updates via aptitude? \nAre there any auto-update features in aptitude?\n\nA: The unattended-upgrades package will automatically apply security updates on a scheduled basis.  The apticron package will check for available package updates daily, and tell you about it.  \nBoth may be configured to have more agressive update behaviours.  Neither will use aptitude by default: for that, your best strategy would be to create your own cronjob (perhaps based on one of these packages, or the other question referenced) which calls aptitude with the appropriate arguments on the schedule you prefer, and provides notification of success or failure by the method you prefer.\n", "Q: How can I sync Gnote notes? I'm looking for a way to keep a desktop and a laptop in sync. Something that I want to keep in sync are Gnote notes.\nIf it matters I can connect to my desktop from anywhere via an URL but my laptop is harder to access since it might be behind NAT and such.\n\nA: While this doesn't directly answer your question, you might want to check out Tomboy as a note taking application.  One of its features is the ability to synchronise its set of notes via various back ends.\nOne of the synchronisation options is to synchronise via an Ubuntu One account, which would provide the required functionality without having to set up any special server software.\nIf you would prefer to use a server under your own control, you could set up an instance of Snowy, which uses the same protocol as the Ubuntu One sync option.  Alternatively, if you can access a server via ssh, Tomboy can use that via the SSH Sync Service Add-in.\n\nA: This is a solution based on fossfreedom's answer, Synchronizing 2 Ubuntu Systems with Unison and the Unison manual. The differences are that I instead of using a GUI for Unison use the command-line version and that I instead of trying to tunnel past NAT always execute the sync command from the computer that might behind NAT.\nSetup\nBoth computers\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install openssh-server unison\n\n*Test the SSH link from each computer to the other.\n\n\nOn the computer that might be behind NAT\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir ~/.unison\n\n*nano default.prf – Create a profile file named default.\n\n*Write the profile file, e.g.:\nroot = /home/user\n\nroot = ssh://user@user.dyndns-ip.com//home/user\n\npath = .local/share/gnote\n\nSync\nSync the computers by running unison -auto default on the computer that might be behind NAT. This will sync notes and it will ask the user what to do if there is conflicts. Note that you should close Gnote on both computers before syncing. I do this before and after my laptop leaves the LAN with my desktop to keep their notes in sync.\n\nA: Gnote holds its notes in the folder ~/.local/share/gnote\nTherefore you could use something like Unison (install unison-gtk from software centre) to sync the gnote folder between the two computers  if they are on the same network.\nUnison\nSince you are behind a NAT then you can use the concept of reverse ssh connections - rather than duplicate, there is an excellent step-by-step in this AU question and answer. However during my testing, I found that the version of unison in Natty doesnt work with the openssh version in Natty.\nSo here is a guide to get Unison to work.\nOn each PC you'll need to install openssh-server to enable you to ssh between each PC at any one time together with unison\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server unison unison-gtk\n\nNow open your browser and download the Debian version of unison-gtk - i386 for 32bit and amd64 for 64bit Natty and install it N.B. the version in Natty has a serious SSH bug and does not work.\ncd Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i unison-gtk_2.32.52-3+b1_i386.deb\n\nFollow the openssh-server guide above to setup a SSH link between your two computers.  Test the link both ways to confirm you can see both computers home directory.\ni.e. from desktop pc to NAT pc\nssh -p 6222 localhost\n\nand from NAT pc to desktop pc\nssh username@desktoppc\n\nNow configure a unison configuration on your desktop pc\nunison-gtk &\n\nenter the FULL path to your gnote folder as per this picture\n\nNow enter both the NAT pc gnote folder and the socket number 62222\n\nThen click the SSH radiobutton and enter the host name localhost\n\nYou will now be able to sync folders either manually or automatically.\nTo do the same from the NAT pc start unison-gtk, configure the local gnote folder as above, and the desktop pc folder as per this picture\n\n\nA: Syncing the Gnote folder between several computers works perfectly with Ubuntu One. See this question for more details: How to access a synced folder from another PC?\n\nA: Its probably not what you're looking for, but I did this manually (Gnote is awesome, no more, no less). \n(On laptop) I use Wicd's postconnect script-function to scan the network. If it finds my home network, it connects sshfs local (192.168.0.12) and mount the folder on the homeserver with the gnote-files at ~/.local/share/gnote-folder, else it grabs the home-ip from my webhost, which is always updated from the homeserver (no static ip from ISP). My desktop has the gnote-folder in fstab, if I remember it right.\nWorks like a charm, but I never open Gnote without network, and are not using Gnote on my desktop and laptop at the same time. \n\nA: Get a SpiderOak account.  They have a zero-knowledge privacy policy: everything is client-side encrypted, unlike other services.  Also, you don't have to mess around with the command line - it's quite user-friendly.\nEither enable backup and syncing on the data folder (or folders) you care about, or put the data directories in an already-backup-and-synced folder, and they symlink to them.\n", "Q: Sync subscribed feeds in Thunderbird I want to sync subscribed feeds, e.g. rss and atom feeds, in Thunderbird between computers.\nHere is an example case to describe what I'm asking for. Say that I have the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*A laptop on which I've in Thunderbird subscribed to certain feeds.\n\n*A desktop on which I've in Thunderbird subscribed to certain feeds.\n\n\nWhat I want is that the subscribed feeds in Thunderbird are the same on the laptop and the desktop. For example if I add a subscription on the laptop it will also be added to the desktop and if I remove a subscription from the desktop it will also be removed from the laptop.

Also, I'm already syncing other things with Unison.\n\nA: You can use dropbox and symlinks from your ~/Dropbox folder to your ~/.thunderbird folder to sync the relevant files.\nFor example:\nOn the first system:\n\n\n*\n\n*mv ~/.thunderbird ~/Dropbox/thunderbirdsync\n\n*ln -s ~/Dropbox/thunderbirdsync ~/.thunderbird\nOn the second one:\n\n\n*\n\n*rm -i -r ~/.thunderbird (I believe you are using the same mail accounts on each system?)\n\n*ln -s ~/Dropbox/thunderbirdsync ~/.thunderbird\nNB: You can do this from your file manager as well, though it would be more complicated to explain in text.\nP.S. if anyone spots any mistakes, edit the answer, or leave a comment.\n", "Q: How to get back the application menu for LibreOffice after an update?  I do not have the menu bar of LibreOffice in the top panel of my Unity desktop (the Global Menu functionality). Though I have installed lo-menubar. \nThose are the characteristics of my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.04.\n\n*LibreOffice 3.3.3 installed from the appropriate PPA.\n\n*lo-menubar 0.1.1~pre1-0ubuntu2.\n\n\nHow do I fix it?\n\nA: It works now simply by removing the lo-menubar package and installing it again :\nsudo apt-get remove lo-menubar\nThen\nsudo apt-get install lo-menubar\n\nWhy this happend?\nAs I suppose the lo-menubar is like a plugin for libreOffice. When you updated the program, the plugin needs to be re-installed, this solution worked for me after trying it. \nAnd this must be done when you install this package by the above command :\n Synchronizing repository for bundled extensions\n\n\n\n  Enabling: menubar\n   Enabling: Jobs.xcu\n   Enabling: menubar.uno.so\n\nunopkg done.\n\nThis what I can explain for now.\n", "Q: Cannot access Compiz Config I was going through one article here and the topic was \"Changing the Size and Appearance of the Unity Launcher\" which required to open up CompizConfig from System Settings --> Desktop. I could find System Settings and could reach to control panel but cannot locate either Desktop or CompizConfig. When i go to Software center and search for compizconfig, it says that it is already installed.But when i search it from the list of installed applications, i couldn't find it.??\n\nA: CCSM (compizconfig-settings-manager) is not installed by default. To install it go to the Software Center or click on the link below:\ncompizconfig-settings-manager \nThen you can open it by typing ccsm in the Dash or run it from System Settings\n\nWarning: ccsm can lead to unwanted effects that may be hard to overcome and may leave you without a desktop (see also this question for more background information).\n\nYou may have installed simple-ccsm instead.\n\nA: Try accessing Compiz Config Settings Manager (or ccsm) by pressing Alt+F2 and typing ccsm. The Unity settings are in there, just type \"unity\" into the search bar.\n\nA: In the Applications lens (at the launcher), on the extreme right of the search bar, you will see \"All Applications\" written along with an arrow. Click n it and choose \"System\". You should be able to see CompizConfig Settings Manager there.\n", "Q: Why does LibreOffice use OpenOffice.org-like icons? After having solved this issue by uninstalling and installing lo-menubar, I got a weird bug in LibreOffice. The icons now look like the ones of the legacy OpenOffice.org which is not installed on my computer.\n\nCan you help me solve this problem?\nThose are the characteristics of my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.04,\n\n*LibreOffice 3.3.3 installed from the appropriate PPA.\n\n\nA: You have the tango icon theme selected (this not a legacy Open-Office theme by the way). Also I found that LibreOffice seems to force certain themes if your GTK+ theme is changed (at least in 3.4, so they might have back ported that to 3.3.3).\nWhat you can do is go to tools>options>view and choose another theme (such as galaxy). If you don't have that theme, then you need to install the other LibreOffice icon themes (called styles) from the Software Centre or synaptic.\n", "Q: My computer stops seeing the other computers on my network I'm running Ubuntu 11.04. \nSometimes my computer stops seeing the names of the other computers on my network. \nSo I can no longer log into another computer by typing the hosting name\ne.g. ssh me@secondcomputer.local\nI can still log in using the local network IP address.\nHow can I get the first way to work again without rebooting? I know this problem is local to the computer. \nThe other computers on my network can still see one another. But they can no longer see the computer I'm working on, not even by local ip address.\n\nA: OK I found the answer:\nsudo service avahi-daemon restart\n\n\nA: You may have a problem with Avahi not reconnecting to the service once it disappeared (see also bug #586229). This can happen when services disconnect without sending a proper signal (e.g. after WiFi problems). There is a timeout to avoid this but this seems not always to be working.\nTo avoid problems with Avahi you may setup your local network including ssh by using a fixed IP address rather than the .local address resolution from Avahi. \nYou can also add your known host in ~/.ssh/config to ease connections:\nHost <hostname>\n    HostName <IP>\n    Port <Portnumber>\n    User MyName\n\nand connect by\nssh <hostname>\n\n", "Q: Setting gnome-terminal window size from within ~/.bashrc It know that it is possible to pass the --geometry=WxH arguments when using launcher, but how to set this option with the ~/.bashrc file.\n\nA: You need to install the wmctrl package. Then, add this to your ~/.bashrc file:\nHORIZONTAL=600\nVERTICAL=400\nwmctrl -r \":ACTIVE:\" -e 0,-1,-1,${HORIZONTAL},${VERTICAL}\n\nIt will resize your active window (should be the terminal), to the size specified by the ${HORIZONTAL} and ${VERTICAL} variables. Note that these are measured in pixels. You can set your terminal's geometry to what you want, then use the screenruler package to measure the dimensions in pixels.\nHope this helps :)\nEDIT: Actually you can run this to show the size of all the gnome-terminal's that are open:\nwmctrl -l -x -G | grep gnome-terminal.Gnome-terminal | awk '{ print \"Horizontal: \"$5\" pixels; Vertical: \"$6\" pixels\" }'\n\n\nA: You can put the following command in your .bash_profile file.\ngnome-terminal --geometry=WIDTHxHEIGHT+XPOS+YPOS\n\nIn which:\n\n\n*\n\n*WIDTH is the width in characters\n\n*HEIGHT is the height in rows\n\n*XPOS is the X-positon in pixels\n\n*YPOS is the Y-position in pixels\nNotice that an x separates WIDTH from HEIGHT. A + separates the HEIGHT   from XPOS. Another + separates XPOS from the YPOS.\n", "Q: Hold packages back from updates without APT Pin? I know about pinning packages with Apt.

Once an\n       automatically installed package is no longer depended on by any manually installed package it is considered no longer needed and e.g.\n       apt-get or aptitude will at least suggest removing them.\n\n       auto\n           auto is used to mark a package as being automatically installed, which will cause the package to be removed when no more manually\n           installed packages depend on this package.\n\n       manual\n           manual is used to mark a package as being manually installed, which will prevent the package from being automatically removed if no\n           other packages depend on it.\n\n       showauto\n           showauto is used to print a list of automatically installed packages with each package on a new line. All automatically installed\n           packages will be listed if no package is given. If packages are given only those which are automatically installed will be shown.\n\n       showmanual\n           showmanual can be used in the same way as showauto except that it will print a list of manually installed packages instead.\n\n   Options\n       -f=filename, --file=filename\n           Read/Write package stats from the filename given with the parameter filename instead of from the default location, which is\n           extended_status in the directory defined by the Configuration Item: Dir::State.\n\nPREVENT CHANGES FOR A PACKAGE\n       hold\n           hold is used to mark a package as held back, which will prevent the package from being automatically installed, upgraded or removed.\n\n       unhold\n           unhold is used to cancel a previously set hold on a package to allow all actions again.\n\n       showhold\n           showhold is used to print a list of packages on hold in the same way as for the other show commands.\n\nSCHEDULE PACKAGES FOR INSTALL, REMOVE AND PURGE\n       Some front-ends like apt-get dselect-upgrade can be used to apply previously scheduled changes to the install state of packages. Such\n       changes can be scheduled with the install, remove (also known as deinstall) and purge commands. Packages with a specific selection can be\n       displayed with showinstall, showremove and showpurge respectively. More information about these so called dpkg selections can be found in\n       dpkg(1).\n\nOPTIONS\n       -h, --help\n           Show a short usage summary.\n\n       -v, --version\n           Show the program version.\n\n       -c, --config-file\n           Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use. The program will read the default configuration file and then this\n           configuration file. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration files are parsed specify a file with the\n           APT_CONFIG environment variable. See apt.conf(5) for syntax information.\n\n       -o, --option\n           Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is -o Foo::Bar=bar.  -o and --option can be\n           used multiple times to set different options.\n\nFILES\n       /var/lib/apt/extended_states\n           Status list of auto-installed packages. Configuration Item: Dir::State::extended_states.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       apt-get(8),aptitude(8),apt.conf(5)\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       apt-mark returns zero on normal operation, non-zero on error.\n\nBUGS\n       APT bug page[1].

The job file in question is /usr/share/upstart/sessions/dbus.conf. You can replace the default random address by overriding the pre-start script stanza which specifies the address to use. Create ~/.config/upstart/dbus.override with the following:\npre-start script\n    DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=$HOME/.dbus-$(hostname)-$(echo $DISPLAY | sed -e s/:/%3A/)\n    initctl set-env DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\nend script\n\nThe fixed address will be used after you next log in.\n\nA: This is apparently a bug in gconf that already has a fix (if I understood correctly from this bug report). In the meantime, the following should work around the problem:\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(tr '\\0' '\\n' < /proc/$(pgrep -U $(whoami) gnome-session)/environ|grep ^DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=|cut -d= -f2-)\n\n\nA: Or if as me you don't use gnome:\nunset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\n\nA: tmux can be told to always reset certain env vars:\n\nupdate-environment variables\n\nSet a space-separated string containing a list of environment variables to\nbe copied into the session environment when a new session is created or an\nexisting session is attached.

The default is \"DISPLAY SSH_ASKPASS\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID XAUTHORITY\".\n\n\nBased on that it might be appropriate to add DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRES to this option in ~/tmux.conf:\nset-option -g update-environment \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS DISPLAY SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID XAUTHORITY\"\n\nThis worked for me.\n", "Q: Trouble installing from disk I'm writing this in desperation, Windows is slowly killing me and i need to change my home pc os to Ubuntu 11.04 as soon as possible.\nI created a USB flash drive to install ubuntu, twice, and both times they failed to begin install on restart of my pc. i read on another forum that you might have to change some boot sequence in BIOS but when pressing F2 to enter it didnt work.\nAfter a lot of cursing, I made myself an UBUNTU install cd and booted.

If you do ls /dev/video* you should see the device.  Assuming it is the only one plugged in, it will either be /dev/video or /dev/video0.\nIf you don't see the device, you may have to look for the appropriate driver. This post suggest that it is really a Geniaech EZ Grabber that has been rebranded, and it uses the uvcvideo driver.\nTo test the device, you can use mplayer: mplayer /dev/video should do it.\nI like VLC for most things, and it can do video streaming from a capture device.  You can install VLC from Synaptic.  VLC is pretty pretty straight forward to use, but this entry from the VLC Documentation Wiki should get you started.\n", "Q: How to Boot from iRAM Solid State Drive on Ubuntu I've got an iRAM solid state drive.\nI'd like to use this to store a root filesystem; the trouble is the device is not recognized as a hard drive to the BIOS.  It only shows up if a live CD environment is loaded and the SCSI drivers are available (may be other drivers needed as well).\nI've heard of Boot to Ram and wonder if some variation of that could work here so I can start Ubuntu from the iRam?\n\nA: If the hard drive is not recognized as a bootable volume in the BIOS, you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Place /boot on an alternate device. This can be an ordinary hard disk drive, or even a CD-ROM or USB key device. The idea is to get the kernel and initrd loaded off this (possibly slow) device, then finish the boot off the real root filesystem.\n\n*If you're feeling up for a challenge, you could theoretically use coreboot to flash a Linux kernel and initrd image right into your BIOS chips (assuming you have large enough BIOS flash chips for this).\n\n\nYou may also want to consider running your iRAM module in a RAID-1 configuration with a normal hard drive partition. If you did this, you could boot off your hard drive as normal, and use the iRAM as, essentially, a fast, persistent cache device. This has the major advantage that your data will remain on the normal hard drive if the iRAM drive runs out of batteries.\n", "Q: How to run a command before the machine automatically shuts down?

If you have hdmi you will likely have 2 devices and you need to check for your device id using alsamixer or pacmd list-sinks or even pactl list sinks.\nIf it doesn't work, try this script.\nIf it works, manually set a keyboard shortcut for these commands through the application  'keyboard shortcuts' (on ubuntu 11.04: key 'super' -> type 'keyboard shortcuts' -> button 'add').\nThe command pactl belongs to the package \"pulseaudio-utils' to install it use the command:\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio-utils\n\n\nA: In the audio preferences dialog (Gnome volume control), you can press → to increase volume beyond 100% (or less intuitively, ↓). So the question becomes: how do you get to that dialog using the keyboard. There are several ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press F10 to move focus to application menus, then left arrow until you get to the volume indicator. Press the up arrow once to get to the lowest menu item, which is audio settings. \n\n*That dialog is actually called gnome-volume-control so you might want to add a keyboard shortcut/hotkey to it: How to use a hotkey shortcut to run a launcher?\n\n*Press super and begin to type \"gnome-volume-control\" until it suggests it. \n\n*Press alt+f2 and type \"gnome-volume-control\".\n\nA: If you are on Gnome, you can install Volume Mixer. Enable Use Volume Boost in the extension's settings. That's it! Your default keyboard shortcuts now increases the volume past 100% (and as a bonus, you get a quick change audio output menu in the notification area).\n\nA: Warning: I'm using Linux Mint, which is similar to but different from Ubuntu.  I believe Ubuntu has an equivalent keyboard shortcuts dialog, but it might look or work slightly differently from how I describe below.\nWow, lots of answers here, but not the simplest one!  You can solve everything with just the built-in (GUI) Keyboard Shortcuts dialog.\nFor the full explanation see https://superuser.com/questions/1277724/how-to-change-the-binding-of-keyboard-volume-dial-linux-mint-mate, but here's the quick version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Keyboard Shortcuts through the menu\n\n*Add a new shortcut\n\n*Name it and set the action to pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ +10% (or - for the \"turn down the volume\" action)\n\n*Click apply to save it, then click on the \"Shortcut Column\" for its row.  Type whatever key you want to bind the action to (I have a volume knob on my keyboard so I bound the actions to that, but you could use any key combo you want)\n\n*Repeat the above for turning the volume down\n\n\nCongratulations: with a few seconds at a friendly system dialog you just configured volume \"up to 150%\" for any key combination you want!\n\nA: No, at least not to my knowledge, there is no way by default to raise the volume with the keyboard beyond 100%.

I used Fn+Alt+Volume Up.\nThis will make the volume 150% (if the volume is currently under 100% it will make it 100%, press again to make it 150%) then you could lower the volume with your keyboard normally to reach the exact volume wanted.\nTo do this you need to go to keyboard shortcuts which is under System → Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts (I use 10.10) and click Add Shortcut with the command above and then assign the desired shortcut you want to use.\nYou could also add a panel button by right-clicking on a panel (I use 10.10) then choose Add to panel then create a new launcher and add the same line as before \npacmd set-sink-volume 0 100000\n\nThis will add a button on the panel, that when pressed will make a 150% volume.\nI hope I was clear enough. If it doesn't work, try installing the package pulseaudio-utils using\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio-utils\n\n\nA: As a 13.04 user, I have used Adham's answer. It works very fine for me because although it is said that it increases the volume up to 150%, it is increasing to 200% which I was trying to do.\nI just added a shortcut for the command pacmd set-sink-volume 0 100000 with the Fn + CTRL + Volume Up keys. When I press this combination, volume is increasing to 200% and then I am adjusting with the Fn + Volume Down combination.\n\nA: My approach (not on Ubuntu though):\nFirst create two scripts ~/bin/volume-up.sh and ~/bin/volume-down.sh:\n$ mkdir -p ~/bin/\n$ echo \"#!/bin/bash\" > ~/bin/volume-up.sh\n$ echo \"pactl set-sink-volume 0 +10%\" >> ~/bin/volume-up.sh\n$ chmod +x bin/volume-up.sh\n$ echo \"#!/bin/bash\" > ~/bin/volume-down.sh\n$ echo \"pactl -- set-sink-volume 0 -10%\" >> ~/bin/volume-down.sh\n$ chmod +x bin/volume-down.sh\n\nThen, in the keyboard options (gnome-control-center -> Keyboard) find the Shortcuts section. In there remove the shortcuts for volume up/down and add two custom shortcuts using those keys. The commands for these two custom shortcuts are ~/bin/volume-up.sh and ~/bin/volume-down.sh.\nNow I do not have the indicator anymore (showing me the volume), but I can get more than 100% just by using the volume keys on my notebook.\n\nA: On my Lenovo Ideapad I can press FN+← to increase up to 100%. I can press ctrl+← to increase above 100%. \n\nA: UI SOLUTION Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and above\nyou can simply open Settings and after that search for \"sound\" or just click on the Sound tab on the left side of the Settings panel. After that press \"Over-Amplification\" and change your max sound volume to more than 100%\n", "Q: what is the difference between a GTK theme, Metacity theme, and Emerald theme? I keep seeing themes as being labelled as metacity or GTK or Emerald. From reading in other places, I gather that Metacity is a window manager and changes the window borders, so what is a GTK theme? Isn't GTK a widget toolkit, used for drawing controls and other interface elements inside the window? and what is Emerald?  can somebody please explain in simple noob-to-linux terms?\n\nA: What you are referring to as a theme is probably a different kind of theme (in light of your comment on Uri's answer).\n\nThose themes control GTK, Metacity (the Gnome 2 windows manager), Icons, cursors, and sometimes wallpapers all in one. However, they do not control your emerald theme. What you are seeing referred to as a GTK, Metacity, Cursor, or Icon theme is what you get when you click customize.\nEach of these controls a different aspect of your interface, and of course, they are all themes in their own right.\n\nA: In simple terms, Metacity is the GNOME 2 Window Manager, which is sometimes replaced with the Emerald Window Manager via Compiz.\nEmerald works on GNOME, KDE, XFCE and more.\nA GTK theme, changes the window appearance (colors), not the window borders.\n\nA: Metacity is the Gnome 2 window manager - the thing at the top of your windows that has the minimize, maximize, and close buttons. On Ubuntu 11.04 and earlier, you can customize your themes to change just that part of the the theme.\nThe GTK theme is the overall theme that handles stuff like the panel color, the backgrounds for windows and tabs, how an application will look when it is active vs. inactive,  buttons, check-boxes, etc. Most theme packages also include a 'Metacity theme' so that everything looks integrated.\nAn Emerald theme is like a metacity theme, but it is used when you are using Compiz to handle your window management. Compiz can do more visually interesting things than regular theming.\nNote that Gnome 3 uses \"mutter\" as its window manager which is Metacity implemented using the Clutter toolkit.  Metacity + clutter = Mutter.  :)\n", "Q: ubuntu software center crashes after fail install I tried to install libboost-system1.42-dev package but for some reason it crashed for the first time.\nNow for ANY package I try to install I get:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 961, in simulate\ntrans.unauthenticated = self._simulate_helper(trans)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aptdaemon/worker.py\", line 1085, in _simulate_helper\nreturn depends, self._cache.required_download, \\\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apt/cache.py\", line 226, in required_download\npm.get_archives(fetcher, self._list, self._records)\nSystemError: E:I wasn't able to locate file for the libboost-system1.42-dev package.

Is there a way to set the OOM killer adjustment value right when a daemon process (Apache in my case) starts? I would like to give the Apache processes a higher likelihood of being killed and make it virtually impossible for some more vital services to be killed by the OOM killer.\n\nA: I think you best bet would be to add a separate script as part of your init.d.  In it, you will want to do something like this\necho 15 > /proc/`pidof APP_NAME`/oom_adj\n\nThe pidof APP_NAME will retrieve the process ID of the app with that name.  Writing 15 to /proc/{pid}/oom_adj ups the \"badness\" of process {pid}, making it more likely to be killed by OOM killer.\nThe article Taming the OOM killer from LWN.net also hints at some other ideas that were suggested to allow specification of an \"oom_victim\", but I am not sure any of them are actually in the kernel.\nBTW: The best solution would be to avoid having to use the OOM Killer in the first place.

If you tell me I'll be happy to provide them.\nNot sure what to do as of right now other than never shutdown/reboot or logoff\n\nA: Overview:\nThe concept of switchable Graphics support in Linux - whether ATI & Intel, or NVIDIA & Intel - is currently in development.\nVarious workarounds are available, but I suspect strongly, these issues will be eventually resolved, but you may have to wait some time for stable solutions.\nIn the interim, may I suggest you look at the latest graphics drivers and an updated Kernel.\nIn my experience, if the boot/shutdown issues are not Power Management related, then they are most often Graphics related.\nRemember - use a good imaging tool such as Clonezilla so that you can easily rollback if stuff goes wrong.  \nUpdating your intel drivers & mesa stack:\nThe latest \"bleeding edge\" intel drivers can be found by adding the Edgers PPA.  These work best with the 2.6.39 kernel.\nThese drivers can be very unstable - but given your current graphics issues, it is worth a try.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nthis should update your graphics including your intel driver.  If it doesnt then\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nAssuming this works - my recommendation would then to be to disable the xorg-edgers ppa from your software sources.  Updates to this PPA are frequent - and there could be a strong possibility that one or more updates could break your system.\nBefore you upgrade from the PPA again - take a quick image backup just incase the revised updates breaks your system.\nBy fortunate coincidence, the latest ATI Catalyst driver (11.6) can also work with the same 2.6.39 kernel - see the AU question and answer.\nIf you couple both the intel and ATI updates with the vgaswitcharoo trick - together with the latest Kernel, hopefully this should resolve both the boot & shutdown issues as well as most of your graphics issues.\nBefore upgrading to 11.10\nBefore you upgrade to 11.10 when it is finished in October this year, you should \"ppa_purge\" the xorg-edgers PPA as well as remove the ATI Catalyst driver.  \nThis should allow you to upgrade successfully.\n", "Q: Cannot login in account with encrypted home after update from 11.04 to 11.10 After upgrading from ubuntu 11.04 to 10.10 I cannot access my encrypted home partition anymore.

The latter seems right in your case. \nYou can use the Gnome menu editor, alacarte, for this (installed by default) or you can create a shortcut by right clicking the desktop and then move it to ~/.local/share/applications manually afterwards. Alacarte will let you place the file in a certain category so that it displays in the Development category, for instance. You just navigate to Applications > Development in Alacarte and click \"New item\".

It has been such a confusing matter that my hidden files on Window now can easily be seen on Ubuntu. It's not good at all. \nHow can I disable this function of Ubuntu?\n\nA: If your using Nautilus File Manager you can create a file called '.hidden' in the directory where you want to hide files, open it with a text editor, and add the names of the files you want to hide (with each files respective extension as well).\nThis is not an system wide automatic method of hiding files without renaming it (in Linux files and folders are automatically hidden if they have \".\" in front of the file/folder name).  You would have to do this manually for every file/folder that you want to effect; and only feasible for the Windows system files/folders that you really want to keep hidden and not want to mess around.\n\nA: You can't.  Also the fact that you are even concerned about it is alarming because it sounds like you think that hiding a file provides some sort of security.  It does not.  Showing hidden files is easily done in either Ubuntu or Windows, and I never have them NOT shown.\n", "Q: How can I install a driver? Although my ethernet card worked, I had very bad latency and speed. I looked up the hardware and I found a driver. Having run its autorun.sh script makes the hardware work correctly. It loads the module by calling modprobe. However, I have to do this after every boot. How can I permanently install this module?\n\nA: Just add the module to /etc/modules to make sure it's autoloaded at boot.\nUse the following command\necho r8168 | sudo tee -a /etc/modules\n\nor edit /etc/modules with your favorite text editor and add r8168 to the bottom.\nAfter adding the module, the initial ramdisk should be updated with this driver, run:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\n", "Q: eth0 missing after upgrading from Hoary to Dapper I'm trying to upgrade a fairly old server that's been running Hoary for the last five years. I followed the directions on the wiki, but when I restarted after upgrading to Dapper, eth0 disappeared from ifconfig -a. I can see two ethernet adapters in lspci and lshw, and if I put in an Ubuntu 10.10 LiveCD it registers eth0 and eth1 perfectly well. Their MAC addresses also match what's in /etc/iftab.\nIt was working fine before the upgrade, and I have no idea what else I should be trying at this point. The server is entirely cut off from the network right now.\nEDIT: /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules doesn't exist, either.\n\nA: You are kidding, right?  Hoary's support ended in late 2006.  You didn't notice it kept complaining that it could not get updates when they closed the repository for it almost 5 years ago?  You can't directly upgrade from Hoary to Dapper ( skipping Breezy ), which hasn't been supported on the desktop since late 2009.\nIf you are serious and not just trolling, then you need to do a clean install of a supported release ( 10.04+ ), and keep up to date.  That means upgrading every 6 month release, or sticking with 10.04 until it is time to upgrade to the next LTS in 12.04.\n\nA: You can try to rename /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. I think you need to reboot afterwards.\n", "Q: How to fix a key that sends a modifier+key My laptop has a dedicated lock key, which sends a Super_L+L messing with unity and making it rather useless. \nI have no idea how to fix this as I get 2 keycodes with showkeys and acpi_listen gives no output. Any ideas?\n\nA: The key code conversion is likely happening within the ACPI BIOS routines, making the key press indistinguishable from a Win+L key sequence.\nThere is a similar issue with some laptops that generate a Win+P key sequence when you press their dedicated video output switch key, and there isn't much you can do about it.\nDepending on how common this lock screen key stroke becomes, Unity may just have to adapt.\n", "Q: Dlink DWA-556 Access point fails to start on 2.6.35-25 while 2.6.35-24 works.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get this in Ubuntu just yet however the version slated for inclusion in Oneric 11.10 will be the new version in the mean time you will have to compile from source or alternatively you could use alien to convert an rpm as one has been built for Fedora 15 Here Hostapd at pkgs.org\nhope this helps solve your problem\n", "Q: Computer freezes up I am using the latest Ubuntu OS and up-to-date Chrome browser.

How to add a kernel module parameter in Ubuntu 11.04?\nCan I use the /etc/module file? If yes, how?\n\nA: With Ubuntu 16.04 one can no longer include kernel module parameters in /etc/modules. An error is generated in the boot log saying it can't find \"my_kernel_mod myparam=x\".\nInstead one needs to put only the kernel module name in /etc/modules and put the options in /etc/modprobe.d/myfilename.conf (as suggested above).\n\nA: /etc/modules seems to be loaded by /etc/init/module-init-tools.conf. The first argument is the module name, other arguments are the parameters. Adding the following to /etc/modules seems fine:\nthinkpad_acpi fan_control=1\n\nTo load this module and set these parameters in the very early stage of boot, add the previous line to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules file. After a change in that file, you need to regenerate the ramdisk:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nAs a possible alternative, you can try to add the options to the kernel line (I haven't tested it myself, but it seems to work for settings like i915.modeset=1. Edit /etc/default/grub and find the line with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\". Replace it by something like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash thinkpad_acpi.fan_control=1\"\n\nTo get a list of options for a kernel module:\nmodinfo -p thinkpad_acpi\n\nThis did not work for i915, for that I had to run:\nmodinfo i915 | grep ^parm\n\nTo get the current value of a module parameter, run:\nsudo cat /sys/module/MODULE/parameters/PARAM\n\nFor the fan_control parameter of the thinkpad_acpi module, you have to run:\nsudo cat /sys/module/thinkpad_acpi/parameters/fan_control\n\nIf this function returns an error, check if the module was loaded and whether the option exist or not.\n\nA: Setting module options using files in /etc/modprobe.d/\nFiles in /etc/modprobe.d/ directory can be used to pass module settings to udev, which will use modprobe to manage the loading of the modules during system boot. Configuration files in this directory can have any name, given that they end with the .conf extension. The syntax is:\n/etc/modprobe.d/myfilename.conf\n---------------------------------------------------------\noptions modname parametername=parametervalue\n\nFor example:\n/etc/modprobe.d/thinkfan.conf\n---------------------------------------------------------\n# On ThinkPads, this lets the 'thinkfan' daemon control fan speed\noptions thinkpad_acpi fan_control=1\n\nSource:Kernel modules - ArchWiki\n\nAs far as I know, you can use the mentioned method for modules that are automatically loaded at boot time (to avoid unloading and reloading modules with special parameters, as this might be the case for driver modules), and the /etc/modules file for modules that are not automatically loaded at boot time.\n", "Q: USA keyboard layout keeps getting added on login I use the USA International keyboard layout.

In some versions, indicator-messaging will have a colour change when it detects new items, although this will not necessarily be present at login, depending on the interaction between the messaging provider and indicator-messages.  \nWhen a user opens the messaging menu, for any reason, the colour is adjusted to the base colour, even when the user has not viewed messages in all available applications: this allows the user to tell the system they are aware there are pending messages, and not be reminded to check again until more new messages arrive.  \nIn the special case of liferea, there are some interaction issues related to parsing large numbers of feeds that can cause indicator-messages to be confused about the status.\n\nA: The solution was to switch to Feed Indicator.\n", "Q: How can I debug the unity launcher where it sometimes causes a system freeze?

It wouldn't hurt to run the long SMART selftest.  You can use smartctl or the disk utility gui to do so.  You may also want to download and run Seagate's drive diagnostics tool.  If it says there is a problem with the drive, then they should replace it under warranty.\n\nA: I'd say the seek and raw read errors are not critical, maybe just annoying. There is nothing you can do about it except replace the drive.\nFor more info and explanation on the SMART data see wikipedia.\nIf the errors started to appear after a kernel update, it might be worth booting into an older kernel and check the logs there.\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu 11.04 under 64b is not able to identify sunspots on serial port?

How can I change this to something more similar to my KDE icon set?\n\nA: I'm not sure how to change the menu icons (perhaps by using an other chromium theme), but the icons (Back, Reload, etc) can be changed at Preferences -> Personal Stuff. (click on the wrench icon on the right to open the menu containing the Preferenes item)\nAt Personal Stuff, scroll down a bit till Appearance. Press the Use GTK+ Theme to get the icons used by the system (Dolphin, Firefox, etc).\n\n\nA: The reason the file dialogue and certain other components do not look native, is that Chrome/ium is using GTK+ for desktop integration, and not Qt libraries. Since GTK+ is still missing some critical Qt integration features, you cannot get applications based on it to do everything you want.\n", "Q: How to convert .odt document to .org file?

Everytime I press one key repeatedly, like when I read a long article in a website/ebook or when I play games which required me to press arrow keys repeatedly, it would randomly freeze. That is, whatever I press on keyboard has no effect, and that also happens with touchpad. However, the USB mouse works just fine. I later found out that it's not actually freeze but more like it's like the key stuck. For example when I play tetris which I usually press w (down) button repeatedly, after some times it would freeze. And if I put the cursor in, say, browser's address bar, it would type \"wwww.....\" infinitely.\nThe only way I could fix it is by suspend the laptop, either by using mouse or by closing the lid. And instead of suspended, in that case the laptop would automatically wake up and everything will be fine. (Usually my laptop would wake up after suspended by pressing any key)\nIt has happened since the first time I use Ubuntu, 10.10, and it also happens in Linux Mint 10, and until now in Ubuntu 11.04. It never happened when I use Windows, though.\nAnyone has ever encounter similar problem? Anyone know how to fix it permanently?\nUPDATE\nI just recently installed Windows 7 and Windows 8 Development Preview and both have similar symptoms. So I declare that this problem is not OS specific, probably hardware problem.\n\nA: Use the folling command in terminal to set the keyboard repeat rate and delay time to whatever works for you.\nkbdrate [ -r rate ] [ -d delay ]\n\nFor example, use the following command if you want to set the repeat rate at 20 characters per second and 500 millisecond delay time.\nsudo kbdrate -r 20 -d 500\n\nTest out few other numbers for \"-r\" and \"-d\" to find values that work for you.\nTo make the values stick at every login:\ngksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nAnd at the end of that file add:\nkbdrate -r 20 -d 500\n\nSave the file and restart your machine.\nReference\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Manuals: keyboard repeat rate and delay time\n\nA: I had the same issue.

I wanted to create more space for Ubuntu on my hard disk in favor of my Windows partition. I booted the livecd and resized the NTFS partition to 100 GB. Then I wanted to resize my Ubuntu (ext4) partition to fill up the created unallocated space.\nA screenshot of my current disk. (With the livecd there's no 'key' icon after sda6)\n\nMy first thought was just right click on sda6 → move/resize → done. Unfortunately I cannot resize or move the partition. However I can resize the NTFS partition.\nI guess it is because the extended sda4 partition is locked. I couldn't see an unlock possibility though…\nSo how do I resize the ext4 partition anyway, probably by unlocking the extended partition, but how?\n\nA: You cannot resize a mounted filesystem, that's why you see a lock icon.\nYou were doing well, you booted into a Live CD and resized the NTFS partition.\nNow you need to enlarge the Extended partition, partitions \"inside\" that extended partition cannot \"escape\" outside.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that /dev/sda6 is unmounted. If a lock icon is visible, right click on it and choose for Unmount\n\n*Make sure that the swap partition /dev/sda5 is unmounted.

The fonts are very small and it does not look good.\n\nA: install a GTK+ theme that's compatible with your KDE theme\ni'm using oxygen for KDE and installed the oxygen-gtk theme to have all my GTK+ apps look like my Qt apps\n\nA: First you need to conpfigure GTK fonts on KDE control center (now don't ask me how because I haven't used KDE in a while)\nSecond, for eeh theme, download the kde4 theme from mozilla addons or from kde look\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/es-ES/firefox/addon/oxygen-kde/\nhttp://kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=117962\n", "Q: Kubuntu 11.04 bad experience, Gimp crashes and other bugs I installed Kubuntu 11.04 64bit today.\nFirst let me expose some issues, this is not a rant, just some observations on Kubuntu 11.04 :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Flash doesn't work.

Video card is ATI Radeon HD 4670 and I am using the newest proprietary driver downloaded from ATI website.\nSome Flash apps, such as embedded youtube vids and a couple of other apps, are displayed incorrectly (i think with real embed instead of the new iframe embed). What happens is as a portion of the flash moves around, parts of it keeps blanking out.  For the embedded youtube vid, it greys out.  Some other apps turns transparent, showing the webpage's background.\n\nThe same flash apps runs perfectly fine for Google Chromium on the same computer.  I have another computer with 10.10 Maverick, Firefox 5 and nVidia card and driver, and it they also run fine.\nSo, anyone has an idea of what is causing the problem?\n\nA: Try Flash-Aid, it's a Firefox add-on that detects the system and selects the appropriate Flash player for you, remove conflicting plugins and apply some tweaks to increase performance a fix common issues.\n\nA: NOTE FROM FLASH-AID DEVELOPER: Flash-Aid security issues addressed here have been fixed in version 2.2.0. The extension now uses SSL for downloading beta plugin data, there is no more redirection and beta plugin is only installed if hash value is authenticated.\nWhile Flash-Aid (should) work, I personally do not like the way it installs Flash system wide.  It also downloads the flashplugin via an unsecured redirector on updates.webgapps.org so it is possible that somebody tricks you  into downloading and installing a malicious version of Flash (or something completely else) by using a MITM attack on a public network.\nThe actual fix for the initial problem seems to be that 32 Bit Flash on 64 Bit systems sucks.  So all you need is the preview version of the 64 Bit version of Flash codenamed \"Square\".  You can get it here.  The compressed tar file contains a single file, libflashplayer.so.  You have to put this file into the directory ~/.mozilla/plugins and restart Firefox.\nI put a simple script to achieve this here.  You can run it by calling\nwget -O- https://github.com/mss/getflashplugin64/raw/10/getflashplugin64.sh | /bin/bash\n\nOf course you still have to trust me not to do anything nasty, but at least you can be sure that nobody intercepts your download.\nOne thing you have to watch out for:  The current Preview 3 is from November 2010 and carries the version number 10.3 d162.  There was at least one security fix since then and the current version is 10.3 r181.  I recommend to use Flashblock.  You also have to keep this version of Flash up-to-date yourself.\nP.S. to @lovinglinux:  Feel free to reuse my script in Flash-Aid.  Maybe you could add an option to install the plugin locally only.  And you could request the update JSON file from your GitHub repo and get HTTPS for free.  It could also return the required download URL which I parse from the HTML and you wouldn't need your redirector either.\n", "Q: Sync profile/data/software for multiple computers? Is it possible to sync all the user settings (interface settings, program settings), as well as programs for multiple computers? Data is not as important, though the settings (which is technically data, but not that kind of data, like music, files...) and applications are. Also, it will not sync the drivers. (Example: 1 computer uses bumblebee and the other uses ATI catalyst, and maybe there's different network drivers.. etc.)\n\nA: I think I have a plausible answer for you; enter rsync. If you have multiple machines you would want to use this in a script; You would want to ensure that the package, 'openssh-server' is installed on all of the target machines and you would run:\nrsync -ar -e ssh /home/* user@destination_hostname:/home\nIn the above example user would be a user with write permissions to the destination /home filesystem. After each run it will only synch the diffs. You would need to run this on the system that is going to act as the source system along with the target user account having write permissions to /home. \nFor multiple systems I would throw all of the target hostnames in a file, 'hosts.txt' run this shell code:\nfor i in cat hosts.txt\ndo\n   rsync -r -e ssh /home/* user@$i:/home\ndone\n", "Q: Backlight can't be turn on in Acer Aspire 4736 When I booted up my newly installed Ubuntu 11.04, I discovered, to my dismay, that the backlight was off by default.

I'm trying to understand how libraries work. Here are some questions I have about it:\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded a tarball and extracted it. When I do \"./configure\", it searches in pre-defined directories from what I understand for certain library files. \nWhat does it do then? It creates a makefile, and the makefile contains the paths\nto these libraries?\nThen I do \"make\", it compiles the source code and hard-codes the locations\nof the libraries? Am I correct?\nI do not really understand if libraries are files with pre-defined paths or the OS somehow gives access to the libraries through system calls.\n\n*I complied something on my computer than moved it to a remote\nserver, the executable needs MySQL libraries to work, the server has MySQL\nbut for some reason when executing the file it tells me \"can't find libmysqlclient.so.16\". Is there a solution for this? Is there a way to know\nwhere is tries to locate this file or give it another path?\nI can't compile it on the server since it has no compiler and I don't have\nroot access to install packages.\n\n*Last question is if in the sequence \"./configure\",\"make\",\"make install\"\nthe \"make install\" command is the only one that actually puts files\noutside the directory in which these files reside?\nIf for example the software will be installed in /usr/local/ is the \"make install\"\ncommand the only one that will require \"sudo\" before it?\nLet me see if I got it correctly: \"./configure\" creates the Makefile according to the location of various files on your system. \"make\" compiles the source code according to this makefile. And \"make install\" moves the files to their appropriate location.\nThank you to those who had the patience to read my questions.\n\nA: configure generates a Makefile and often other files, such as config.cache. The contents of these files is based on the options you pass to configure and on observing your system. For example, many programs have optional components, and configure looks for the dependencies of each component and generates a makefile that only builds the components for which you have all the dependencies.\nIf you run configure and then change your system configuration, you should do make distclean first (if the program follows the usual conventions), to remove the makefile and configure's cache. Running configure again typically works when you want to pass it different arguments, but not when it's cached observations about your system.\nRegarding libraries, the configure stage looks at what you have from a source compatibility point of view. If libfoo2 is source-compatible with libfoo3 but not with libfoo1, and you have libfoo2, then the resulting makefile will work build a binary linked against libfoo2 or a binary linked against libfoo3 but not a binary linked against libfoo1 (compilation would fail due to the source-level incompatibility).\nWhen the executable is compiled and linked, the version requirement becomes more precise: the resulting executable needs a binary-compatible library (same ABI, not just same API).\nExecutables don't hard-code full paths to libraries; they hard-code names of libraries (-l argument to the linker) and sometimes a runtime library search path (-rpath) that comes in addition to the default search path of the target system. Finding the libraries at run time is the job of the dynamic linker.\nI recommend playing a little with ldd and strace. ldd shows the libraries required by an executable and where the system would find them. strace shows all the system calls that happen when a program is loaded; the first few come from the dynamic linker that loads the required libraries. Here are a few experiments whose results you should try to understand.\nldd /bin/true\nstrace /bin/true\nperl -pe 's/libc\\.so/libc.zz/' </bin/true >broken\nchmod +x broken\nldd ./broken\nstrace ./broken\nln -s /lib/libc.so.6 libc.zz.6\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=. strace ./broken\n\nSummarizing the answers to your specific questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*configure hard-codes source compatibility issues. The make step hard-codes binary compatibility issues. Library locations are determined at run time.\n\n*If only the location of the library has changed, the dynamic linker will typically find it (if you have a library installed in a non-standard location, pass the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable). If you have only a different version of the library, then it's not the same library; you need to either get a library with the ABI version that your program is compiled against, or compile your program against the ABI version for which you have the library installed.\n\n*configure determines the build configuration from what you have on your system and the arguments you pass. make builds the executable and other bits. make install copies the bits into place; only this stage might require elevated permissions (if you don't already have permission to write to the target directory, which you would e.g. if you were installing into your home directory).\n\n*configure overwrites the makefile, but just re-running configure doesn't start from scratch because it keeps a cache.\n\n\nA: I believe that when you ./configure on one computer, it derives a makefile specific for that one computer, then when you transfer the compiled program, the library is not where the makefile (or the executable) knew it was, so it throw out an error. As you can see that when you configure, not every library it checks for is required. So it must make a different makefile depending on your system. Another example of this is when you have a different architecture it requires different libraries, and so on.\nAnd yes you have the order correct. 'make' is the safe command, only working in the current directory, sudo is basically required for 'make install'. It's bad to not have root privilages when installing software. \n", "Q: How to format a partition with hfs+journalized filesystem? I want to make a partition with hfs+journalized format.

You can see that the output of ls will always display the current directory (that is not necessarily your home directory!)  if invoked with an empty or undefinded variable:\n ls $BLABLABLA\n\nThe current user's home directory is stored in $HOME:\necho $HOME\n\nThe current user name is stored in $USER:\necho $USER\n\nOnly invoking ls with $HOME will always list the contents of the current user's home directory.\n", "Q: Wireless not detected on an hp Pavilion g6 - RT5390PCIe I just bought an HP Pavilion g6 laptop and I installed Natty Narwhal alongside Windows 7.

The general command for mounting a partition is:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\nHere, /dev/sdb1 is the first (1) partition on the second disk (b). If the command was succesful, the filesystem wil be available at /mnt. Only the superuser can mount new filesystems, therefore sudo is prepended on the command. If you're mounting multiple partitions, you might want to create a folder before use:\nsudo mkdir /media/mountp\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/mountp\n\nDo not forget to remove the directory after unmounting it:\nsudo umount /media/mountp\nsudo rmdir /media/mountp\n\n", "Q: How to install firefox-5 without a PPA?

It took me a while to find out that with Ubuntu One I can sync only folders in my home folder.  On all other folders the Ubuntu One option is available in preferences, but the actual actions are greyed out.\nThe Ubuntu One FAQ is quite clear on that:\n\nNo, currently you can only select to synchronize folders inside your home directory.\n\nBut I actually wonder why and if this is going to change and if there is a trick around it (an other one than setting my home to /) ?\nI personally don't have any important data in my home folder other than the program configs.  All documents, pictures, music are on a folder called /data that is actually on a different partition.  That makes it much easier when one wants to reinstall Ubuntu.\n\nA: I did manage to get this to work by using a bind mount. The line in /etc/fstab looks like this:\n/mnt/s1/Audio   /home/daniel/Music      bind    defaults,bind   0       0\n\nObviously you will need write permissions to the folder in question. Possibly you may need to own the files also, I'm not sure.\n\nA: I suspect the reason is rights. You'll notice that you can't easily edit any of the files outside your home directory either? This is a general security feature of linux, and I suspect that the Ubuntu One developers (quite rightly) feel that the average user would keep all his files in the home directory, where the daemon can easily run without elevated privileges.\nOn a side note about your configuration, its all a matter of preference, but I keep my complete /home/ on a seperate disk/partition. This does mean that between re-installations you need to go through and delete all the hidden folders/files for a clean install, but will give you the advantage of a completely native home directory with ubuntuone rights, etc. - just a thought.\n\nA: It's not going to change, at least in the foreseeable future (and on this I can foresee a couple of years into the future). Allowing users to select arbitrary folders outside of their home for syncing with Ubuntu One, which could potentially sync between multiple different computers, opens a large number of usability problems to cover a use case that, quite frankly, isn't all that common.\nOne of the problems that I remember off the top of my head is that if you try to sync a mount point of a removable device (and quite a few people try to do this), when you remove the device syncdaemon will delete everything; to make it work properly syncdaemon would have to know about devices, detect their removal, things like that. Quite a large effort, and a lot of potential for usability nightmares.\nAnother problem is if you try to sync a folder with special permissions, ownership or file types in it: think of /etc/, /tmp/ or /dev/ as some of the worst cases. Or any folder you don't own, really. We could simply disallow syncing folders you don't own, but we know for a fact some people are running syncdaemon as root (despite our warnings).\nA workaround for you would be to mount (via /etc/fstab, so you're reasonably sure the partition is mounted every time -- otherwise you risk losing your synced data) the /data folder into your home. You could simply move /data to ~/data or, if you have things that have the /data path hardcoded (quite likely), or if you're already used to /data yourself (also quite likely), symlink or bind mount /data to the mount point in your home. If you don't want to see it in your home at all, just make it ~/.data.\n\nA: In two words: Use Dropbox.\nThe reasons listed by @Chipaca might be difficult to overcome, but dropbox has managed somehow. True, this solution isn't open source, but until the folks at Ubuntu One solve some major usability problems (this being one of them), lot's of users won't be able to use Ubuntu One.\n\nA: I have a very similar setup under Ubuntu 12.04.  I have an NFTS partition with my music library on it that is visible to both Windows 7 and Ubuntu.  I wanted to be able to synch this directory to Ubuntu One without having to explicitly move the entire directory to my home directory (seems like a reasonable request, right?).  \nMy solution was simply to mount the shared partition within my home directory each time I boot into Ubuntu.  This took two fairly simple steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and use pysdm to ensure that the partition mounts correctly on startup (not necessarily in your home directory, just somewhere in the file system).  Alternatively, you can modify the /etc/fstab file yourself if you're confident enough.  As a fairly new user, I found the pysdm solution more straightforward.  \nEither way, make sure to backup your /etc/fstab file before doing this step! (just in case!) \nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.old (for example)\nIf something goes wrong, you can always restore the old file and be back to square one:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab.old /etc/fstab \nIn the pysdm GUI, select the target partition and hit the \"Assistant\" button.  Make sure to select the \"The owner of the device can mount it\" option.  This will ensure that you can re-mount within your home directory using Upstart.  In my case, I set the sda4 partition to mount at /media/sda4/.\n\n*In general, the behavior of Upstart is defined by files in the /etc/init/ directory.  To mount the new partition (for me, /media/sda4) within my home directory, I defined a /etc/init/mount-mydirs.conf file that contains:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\ntask\nexec /bin/mount-mydirs`\n\nThe first line tells Upstart to perform the task upon normal startup.  The second line tells Upstart that the job is to be performed once (not as an indefinite or recurring job), and the final line tells it to execute the script /bin/mount-mydirs (with root privileges).\nThe file `/bin/mount-mydirs' looks like:\nmount --bind /media/sda4/ /<home directory>\n(The --bind option allows for the files to be accessed from both the original mount point and the new one).\nI am listening to my fully synched, newly mounted music library as I write this!!\n", "Q: How to repair ods files I have few ods files but all of a sudden it is not opening.

You can try to repair the file using regular tools for repairing ZIPs. For example on the command line:\nzip --fixfix file.ods\n\nBeware that you should always operate on a copy of the file. If extracting data works, you might be able to re-assemble the file as a ZIP archive and load it in OpenOffice.org.\nBefore trying this, you should make sure the file is actually an ODS file.

Since the root of the DNS tree has been signed, how do I change my caching DNS server to start validating DNSSEC signatures?\n\nA: Install and set up your nameserver (bind9 package) normally, and then just add the following stanza to /etc/bind/named.conf.options:\nmanaged-keys {\n  \".\" initial-key 257 3 8\n    \"AwEAAagAIKlVZrpC6Ia7gEzahOR+9W29euxhJhVVLOyQbSEW0O8gcCjF\n     FVQUTf6v58fLjwBd0YI0EzrAcQqBGCzh/RStIoO8g0NfnfL2MTJRkxoX\n     bfDaUeVPQuYEhg37NZWAJQ9VnMVDxP/VHL496M/QZxkjf5/Efucp2gaD\n     X6RS6CXpoY68LsvPVjR0ZSwzz1apAzvN9dlzEheX7ICJBBtuA6G3LQpz\n     W5hOA2hzCTMjJPJ8LbqF6dsV6DoBQzgul0sGIcGOYl7OyQdXfZ57relS\n     Qageu+ipAdTTJ25AsRTAoub8ONGcLmqrAmRLKBP1dfwhYB4N7knNnulq\n     QxA+Uk1ihz0=\";\n};\n\nThen restart the service (sudo service bind9 restart).\nTo make sure it is working, try to resolve \"www.dnssec-failed.org\", it should fail:\n$ host www.dnssec-failed.org\nHost www.dnssec-failed.org not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)\n\nIf it gives an IP address, then DNSSEC validation is not working.\n\nA: You have a choice of at least two possible caching nameservers: bind9 and unbound.\nInstructions on configuring and testing each of them with the current root key (first created in July of 2010) are in the Debian wiki:\n\n\n*\n\n*DNSSEC - Debian Wiki\nYou should be careful to validate the actual key that you add to the configuration, and not e.g. trust what you might find in a web site that doesn't use SSL (https) or that doesn't have secure management of its content.  E.g. posting the actual key here is probably not wise, and it can change over time at any rate.  The advice at the unbound site for \"unbound-anchor\" looks good, and when that command is securely available as part of an Ubuntu release it looks like that will be a good option.  It looks like that has been enabled since unbound version 1.4.9-1 and is currently part of the Oneric release.  See more at Debian bug #594911.\nFor bind9, follow Bug #782614 in bind9 (Ubuntu): “make configuring DNSSEC validation easier” for progress on making this process easier.  It would seem to make sense to actually include the current key as part of the Ubuntu packaging of bind9, or add some sort of update mechanism like unbound-anchor, for the convenience and protection of the users.\n", "Q: Unmet dependencies error while installing uuid-dev I'm getting the following error:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n  uuid-dev: Depends: libuuid1 (= 2.17.2-0ubuntu1.10.04.1) but 2.17.2-0ubuntu1.10.04.2 is to be installed\n\nHaven't been able to find much useful information online.\n\nA: Update did not help on Ubuntu 10.04 32bit. \nI had to manually download the required package here and install it:\ncd\nwget http://launchpadlibrarian.net/41632055/libuuid1_2.17.2-0ubuntu1_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i libuuid1_2.17.2-0ubuntu1_i386.deb\n\n\nA: Your package lists are outdated, you need to refresh it by running:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: Login keyring prompt appears twice on login Whenever I log into my Ubuntu desktop machine, a password dialogue appears for the login keyring.

I use and enjoy Firefox on my Ubuntu 10.04.2 laptop (although Firefox needs work for the Linux/Ubuntu version).\nYet I realize that in comparison to other pieces of software that have an \"Ubuntu/Debian\" version (.deb file, and usually .rpm files as well). I don't see it in one of the most profound assets of the FLOSS world. \nThe Question is - Why? \nIf Google Chrome/ium can , why can't they? It will be easier to get up-to-date software and features and so forth.\n\nA: I think this question can only be definitely answered by some one from Mozilla. My guess is that they dont do it because they dont need to. When Ubuntu's Mozilla team is already doing a fantastic job why would Mozilla want to waste their resources re-doing the same? They are better off focusing on making Firefox better than packaging it for different platforms.\n\nA: Why are you limiting your list to .deb and .rpm?\nWhat about Gentoo ebuilds, Arch packages, Pardus PISI files, Slax' LZM files, PUP/PET of Puppy linux and whatnot?\nThe sheer number of linux distributions and package managers out there is the reason: Nobody of Mozilla can test all of that.\nWhat if I invent my own Linux distribution with its own package format? Do you expect Mozilla to support that, too? Even if I'm the only user? What if there are 10 users of my distribution? Where do you draw the line between supported and unsupported distribution?\n\nWhat about dependencies? Firefox 14 might work with ffmpeg 12, but Debian ships ffmpeg 11.92. Fedora 23 ships ffmpeg 12.2. Mozilla cannot resolve all this issues.\n\nThis are the reasons why packaging for distributions is the task of the distribution people, not the application programmer's.\n\nA: I think Mozilla doesn't want that... They only built the cross-platform browser, and help users use it easily, make all add-ons compatible over the different systems...\nBy the way, if Mozilla focus on building deb, rpm,... they must work more harder... For example, they need to create deb file that work on Ubuntu 11.04 (with Global menu, that only work on Unity), they must create deb file to work with GNOME theme... So, if they only provide tar file, users only need to untar it and run, and then users can choose another profile if they want, or easily run Debug mode (for addon developers)...\nBut, if you want deb file, you can follow that instruction: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/debian-26/how-to-build-a-deb-of-the-firefox-cvs-trunk-680801/.

But now I have the solution for you:  \nFirst you must install the voice and video- plugin from google. \nThen you open this plugin with Ubuntu Softwarecenter. If you have done that, you have to go to Multimedia and there you must install the Google voice and videoplugin at the second time. \nAfter all you can start the Hangout!\n\nA: I believe you can uninstall any package installed using the software centre.

Can this be done? if so how?\n\nA: The Ubuntu One file synchronization daemon, ubuntuone-syncdaemon and the related commandline utility u1sdtool, are python programs and as such don't need “building” in the traditional sense (the parts of ubuntuone-client that need building are the nautilus extension—which you don't want—and the icons used by it). At runtime u1sdtool simply talks to syncdaemon over dbus, and syncdaemon has very narrow dependencies on some services provided by the Ubuntu desktop, and then again only via dbus (so you could in theory satisfy the dependencies with another service that provided the same API).\nYou need something on the session bus providing org.freedesktop.Secret.Session and related interfaces. This is used by ubuntu-sso-client, which is used by syncdaemon to provide the needed credentials.\nYou probably also want something on the system bus providing org.freedesktop.NetworkManager (typically Network Manager itself) to give the syncdaemon awareness of whether you are connected to the network or not. This isn't essential, however.\nYou also need the following python libraries: configglue, dbus (obviously), oauth, pyinotify, simplejson, twisted, xdg, and ubuntuone.storageprotocol (which in turn depends on some of the above and also protobuf).

I've got the xfce4 packages all installed, which is something I've had no problems with on any of my other machines.\nOn this new laptop, however, though I can log in and use an xfce session without any problems, logging out of a session is problematic:\n\n\n*\n\n*I click the \"Log out\" widget from the panel and then \"Log out\" from its option dialog. Then the thing just sits there, not logging out. Subsequent attempts to open the \"Log out\" widget fail with an error about the session manager being busy.  After maybe a minute or so, it logs out.\n\n*Though I've got the \"Save session\" option checked in the log out dialog, xfce just makes a complete hash of the business. It does remember the applications that I had running, but it seems to forget about the window manager (!!) and the workspace configuration.\nI don't log in/out that often, and generally I don't care much about restarting applications, but the window manager being missing is of course pretty annoying.\nI like xfce because it's simple and unobtrusive and usually works pretty well. I've never experienced this, and I've got two other machines also running 11.04 with pretty much the same setup (straight Ubuntu install with xfce4 packages added). Is there some good way to diagnose stuff like that?\n\nA: This question was answered by the OP:\n\nwell I nuked my session cache, did an explicit save from the session widget, and now it works. Well, it doesn't save the workspace location for each client and instead opens them all up on the first workspace, but I think that may be because, in the session, xfwm4 is the last thing in the \"Client\" list, so before it's started all the other clients just pile up in the first (and only) workspace.\n\n", "Q: Problems in Gnome-shell and GNOME3 in ubuntu 11.04? \nPossible Duplicate:\nGnome 3 ppa was unstable until April 28th, so is it ok now? \n\nHow is GNOME3 reliability in Natty 11.04? \nDo you think production machines can be migrated to it or it's too early? I mean I'd like to move to it but I don't want to spend a lot of time fixing a broken gnome installation... \n\nA: Gnome3 (Gnome-shell) works perfectly well under natty. I did a Ubuntu-minimal installtion and started from scratch that way. This is the best way imho. Otherwise you get other, residual stuff from the Unity installtion. It's worth doing if anything to get practice with the terminal commands, and it's fun in to the bargain. \nGnome3.shell has a long way to go before its fully ready to be shipped as default.

The system will have the following storage hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 x 80 GB SSD (Intel 320 series)\n\n*2 x 2 TB HDD (green, 64 MB cache, 5400 rpm, SATA-600)\n\n\nI'm going to use the system to typeset with LaTeX, to watch movies, to listen to music, to edit images and graphics, to surf the web, as firewall for my LAN and as file and backup server for a laptop (it will sometimes need to be on for days). Some of the data I'm going to keep on it is really valuable so I'm not giving priority to speed over reliability or security. Also, I want to avoid unnecessary wear on the SSD.\nThe setup I'm considering is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have the SSD as boot partition, format it as ext4 (does ext4 work well with SSDs?) and mount it at /. Backup from the SSD will be handled by having sbackup scheduled to backup chosen files to the HDDs.\n\n*Put the HDDs in RAID-1, mostly for reliability, format them as ext4 (for reliability and ability to recover from corruption) and mount it somewhere, maybe /home/archive (what is the correct mount point according to convention?). Backup for these HDDs will simply be having them in RAID-1. Also, I'll keep the swap (how big?) on these HDDs.\n\n\nI'm thinking that I should take measures to reduce wear on the SSD by mounting it with the flags noatime and discard and keep the swap on the HDDs (the system will have 4 GB RAM but I want to be able to hibernate). To further handle what goes on the SSD and what goes on the HDDs I'm thinking about using symlinks (e.g. symlink ~/Videos to the HDDs). I should say something about the needed storage capacity too. What I plan to initially put on the HDDs is ~400 GB.\nMy question: Is there anything in the setup that I'm considering that I should change given the mentioned hardware and the mentioned usage of the system? Or more generally: How should I setup my partitions given my hardware setup and how I want to use the system?\n\nA: Raid is not backup.  The purpose of raid1 is to keep the system up and running, instead of having to restore from backup when a drive fails.  You still need to keep regular backups.  Raid1 does not help if your filesystem becomes corrupted, or you just accidentally delete or overwrite a file.\nYes, ext4 works well on SSDs and the noatime and discard options are somewhat helpful.\nYou might want to use LVM\n\nA: I think you sort of nailed it already.\n\n\n*\n\n*Test if trim is active with...\n\n\n  \ncd /tmp\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=tempfile count=100 bs=512k oflag=direct \nsudo hdparm --fibmap tempfile\nsudo hdparm --read-sector 732160 /dev/sda\nsudo rm tempfile\nsync\nsudo hdparm --read-sector 732160 /dev/sda\n  \nchange the 732160 to a sector that --fibmap shows you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the 80 Gb for / only. Or set / to 25 Gb and leave the rest empty. \nToss /home on your 2Tb too.\nI always put /home on 20 Gb and symlink the directories to another part with symlinks: I want to be able to format /home whenever I want w/o loosing any actual content.\n\n*Add /tmp into ram with:\ntmpfs   /tmp  tmpfs  nodev,nosuid,noexec,mode=1777  0 0\n", "Q: I want to completely remove titlebars from windows I want to completely remove titlebars from windows...but still have shadows via window decorations.\nI am using the Elementary borderless theme and Compiz.

And how to enable? I noticed in Ubuntu 11.04 there are only two notifications allowed at once, one being for sound, etc... and the other for all applications. I am using udev-notify and my computer likes to dump my webcam and whenever that happens, there are two popups just for it being disconnected and then two more for re-connecting it which takes forever to see since I have to wait for each to close.  \nIs there a way to enable multiple notifications?\n\nA: No, there is not a way to enable multiple notification bubbles:\n\nJD, this is the intended behaviour. We queue application notifications,\n  so that only one will be displayed at any time. That means they are\n  delivered asynchronously, which drives a number of the changes in our\n  implementation from other implementations.\n- Mark Shuttleworth\n\n\nA: You can achieve 2 notification at once at a screen with notify-send. One is synchronous and another is asynchronous. \nnotify-send \"Message1\" -h string:x-canonical-private-synchronous:anything\nnotify-send \"Message2\"\n\nHere for first command you don't need to wait for it to complete and it's output position is at top (checked in 12.04).

I'm running Xubuntu 11.04 (Natty).\nUsing Settings->Settings Manager->Windows Manager->Keyboard I assigned Super+D to \"Show desktop\".\nThen, using Settings->Settings Manager->Keyboard->Applications Shortcut I assigned Super+E to thunar. So far, everything works perfectly.\nBut, at least, I'd like the Super key when pressed alone to open the Applications Menu but, being Super a modifier key I wasn't able to assign it alone to a shortcut. For reference this problem is also described here.\nBased on this forum post I used to xmodmap to make it behave like a normal key - ie. not a modifier key. And guess what, it works. Sorta.\nSuper alone works perfectly. Super+E still opens thunar but also opens the Applications Menu. Super+D no longers works at all.\nOf course, I can just remove my .Xmodmap file and assign a Super+A or similar to Applications Menu. But if there's a way to get just Super working it would be great.\nCan someone shed some light on this issue?\n\nA: I had the same issue and I finally resolved it. Since there is no way to solve this with Xfce alone, one needs the small tool ksuperkey. It was originally developed for KDE, but it works fine on other desktops. You basically install ksuperkey or compile it yourself, and bind your menu to \"alt+f1\". Once you run ksuperkey, the superkey will behave as one would expect. I highly recommend to put this tool into some form of autostart, so that ksuperkey gets started on startup. Set it and forget it! \n\nA: Restore back what you did. In natty super key is already used for menu.\n", "Q: How do I troubleshoot a \"connection failed\" error when using `apt-get install`?

I don't quite like Gnome3, or maybe it's just Unity (for the moment)? Was wondering if all Linux distro is going to eventually adapt and move to Gnome3 and have similar interface? I know there is classic login, but as for now, I don't quite like the global app menu and huge not yet so friendly to modify the dock, and was hoping to stick to Gnome2.x as long as possible.  When will Gnome2.x be unsupported? \n\nA: When you refer to Gnome 3 and Gnome 2.x, it seems to me that you're talking about the shell, but Gnome is far more than its shells. It includes Nautilus, Evolution, Gedit, Totem, Banshee, Rhythmbox and many other applications. Lots of stuff. Unity is only one of many shells for Gnome and Ubuntu will move to Gnome 3 in 11.10, which is scheduled to be released in October this year. Using Gnome 3 does not mean you have to use Gnome Shell or Unity and so many GNU/Linux distros will use other shells by default. There is also work being done to port Gnome Panel to Gnome 3. \nUbuntu Classic does not use the global menu by default, although you can install and use it if you wish. Gnome 2 will be supported by Ubuntu at least until April 2013, but the differences between Gnome 3 compared to Gnome 2 will not be as big as you seem to think, since Gnome Panel will still be available for it.\nAlso, if you like the old school shells, then you might want to try out Xfce. \nEdit: \nNow that 11.10 with Gnome 3 has been around for a while, I thought I'd add a screenshot of my Gnome Panel 3 desktop, AKA \"Gnome/Ubuntu classic\".

How to upgrade?\n\nA: The 2.6.39.2 kernel is named \"oneiric\" - but according to this ubuntu mailing list entry, this kernel is the generic kernel without any specific modifications for ubuntu & oneiric. \nYou will need to install the kernel yourself:\nBrowse to the following location on Launchpad - link is below.\nIf you have a 64bit system download the two amd64.deb files.\nIf you have a 32bit system download the two i386.deb files.\nIn addition download the \"_all.deb\" file.\nthen install the downloaded debs\ncd Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i linux*.deb\n\nThen update your grub\nsudo update-grub\n\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.39.2-oneiric/\n\nA: You can Try:\n\nKernelCheck.\n\nKernelCheck is a graphical user interface program designed to make the kernel-compiling process as easy as the click of a button. A kernel is the base of any operating system – in our case, the Linux operating system. KernelCheck will fetch the latest information from http://www.kernel.org, which hosts the source packages for the Linux kernel, and ask the user which one they would like to compile into a .deb package (with the option of installing the kernel after the compilation).\nThis automated process is a fork of AutoKernel by Robert Wolterman (xtacocorex), Timothy Janssen (mentok), and Kristof Verbeken (PingunZ). KernelCheck is currently licensed under the GNU Public License version 3.\nCurrent Features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability to download, compile and\ninstall latest kernel automatically\n\n*Ability to compare latest kernel\ninformation with your current running\nkernel\n\n*GUI designed with Glade\nprovides easy accessibility for any\nuser Supported Platforms\n\n\nAt the moment, KernelCheck is only supported on Debian-Based platforms. Some of these include Debian, Ubuntu (or any derivatives), Mint, etc. RPM and Slackware based are planned to be supported in the future. \nSource.\n\n\nA: Compiling a kernel under Ubuntu (even with the command line) is quite easy:\nJust install the kernel-package package (:D):\nsudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install kernel-package\n\nand then download the kernel sources from http://kernel.org (under the \"Latest Stable Kernel\" heading) to a working directory, such as ~/kernels. Then to actually compile the kernel, run:\ncd ~/kernels\n\nto change to your working directory. For the next two steps, it's a good idea to open your file manager, so you can see the names of the files and folders easily. Now, you need to extract the archive you downloaded. You can either run the command below or right click the file and click \"Extract.\"\ntar jxvf name-of-file.tar.bz2\n\nNow, change to the directory that was created when you extracted the source archive.\ncd name-of-folder\n\nNext, you need to copy the kernel configuration. 99% of the time, Ubuntu's default configuration will work just fine.\ncp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config\n\nFinally, to compile the kernel, just run: [Note: CONCURRENCY_LEVEL should be set to the number of processor cores + 1. It will speed up the compile time a lot]\nCONCURRENCY_LEVEL=3 fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers\n\nIn your ~/kernels folder, you will find two shiny new DEB's waiting to be installed :D\n", "Q: How to integrate Psi (or Psi+) into the messaging menu?

If this is the case, simply do a four-finger slide to the left to slide the bar back into place.\n\nA: Its not uncommon for the launcher to get stuck.

Because you're using a LAMP stack, you should become familiar with using a console since most servers do not have a GUI for administration at all. So, to install the packages Apache, MySQL and PHP, run:\nsudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5\n\nThe webroot is stored in /var/www by default, if you're doing a new installation, create a separate partition for /var/www (choose for custom partitioning in order to get the option for it). MySQL databases are stored in /var/lib/mysql, you can create a separate partition for it in the same way as you did for Apache.\nConfiguration files are put in /etc/, so backup those:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache (module config, vhost, ...): /etc/apache2/\n\n*MySQL (server settings and administration password for MySQL): /etc/mysql/\n\n*PHP (php.ini files): /etc/php5/\nWith those files you can setup an identical LAMP stack after a re-install.\nA single command for creating a backup named \"lamp-backup.tar.gz\" of the config files, webroot an databases:\nsudo tar cf lamp-backup.tar.gz /etc/{apache2,mysql,php5} /var/www /var/lib/mysql\n\nFor the best results, stop the database before creating the backup by running sudo stop mysql. After the backup, the database can be started again by running sudo start mysql.\nTo restore the previously made backup (on a fresh installation), run:\nsudo tar xf lamp-backup.tar.gz -C /\n\nDo not forget to install the packages too.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses packages instead of .exe files for programs. The packages are in the form of .deb files and are automatically downloaded when you install software through the software center or apt-get. \nWhen you installed the LAMP software, you probably downloaded multiple .deb files--one for each program and library that was not already installed. So there's probably one for Apache, a few for PHP and its integration into apache, and a few for MySQL. Normally, it could be a chore to gather all these things on Windows. The reason for Ubuntu's package archive is to keep track of all these things and make sure that (1) when you install something, everything that is needed is also installed; and (2) you don't have multiple copies of the same things installed, and (3) everything is updated when there's an update.\nNow, when Ubuntu's package system downloads a package to install, it caches a copy in /var/cache/apt/archives. You can look in there and copy the packages you want to save to a different drive if you wish. You can also put package files into /var/cache/apt/archives on a new install* and when you install software using software center, synaptic, or apt-get, the package will be used if it is the latest version available. I should point out that because of this caching, if you are reinstalling apache on the same install of Ubuntu, the packages will not be re-downloaded; the cached version will be used without you having to do any copying.\nBy the way, you can move to a new version of Ubuntu without reinstalling. The package management system comes to the rescue again. Ubuntu is made up of packages. So when you decide to go to a new version of Ubuntu, the package system downloads the newer versions of the packages that make up the system, and replaces the old version with the new versions. This leaves all your settings and user files intact.\n*You need root user (equivalent of Window's Administrator user) privileges to do this. You can open a Nautilus window (equivalent of Windows Explorer) with root privileges by pressing Alt F2 and putting in gksudo nautilus, then pressing run and entering your password.\n", "Q: Why does my radeon driver crash when booting?

Please try to answer this objectively\nI'm getting a new hard drive today and my current setup (on this machine) is running Windows with Linux in a VirtualBox virtual machine. I am wondering if I could achieve better performance/compatibility if I ran Linux with Windows in a virtual machine, as there are some Ubuntu features that do NOT work in a virtual machine (such as playing fullscreen games). Are there some Windows features that would NOT work if I ran Windows in a virtual machine? Which setup is better? Running Linux in a virtual machine; or Windows in a virtual machine?\n\nA: Actually, neither is better.\nEither way you twist it, running in a virtual machine gives a serious performance and feature penalty for either OS, and for the native OS it also steals resources. Your best bet is to dual boot, and only when you have to, run either one in a virtual machine on the other.\n\nA: There isn't better setup, there is just setup that you will like more. And since everyone likes different things...\nAbout features... probably only playing games in fullscreen and maybe some hw ( if you have some that wont work in linux ). Performance, you didn't mentioned your hardware, so we cannot tell.\nIf you have time, you can try both for some time just to see what fits you better.\n\nA: I vote for Ubuntu host + Windows guest... but as others have mtnioned depends on what your day-to-day is like.\nI started with Windows and Wubi (didn't want to muck with my Windows set up), then switched to dual boot. I eventually killed the dual boot and started running Windows under VirtualBox only. My business requires me to have access to Windows apps and frankly still like to use Photoshop and MS Office. \nThe key for me was being able to do most of my day-to-day without running a virtual machine. Cloud-based/browser apps helped me quite a bit. I also use Crossover to run MS Office apps inside of Ubuntu w/o virtualization, which has worked great. I now fire up Windows only when I need to, and can easily have it running in the background. Because of Ubuntu my machine starts up quickly and am not encumbered by Windows stuff (e.g. anti virus, anti spyware/malware etc...).\nI have 8 GB of RAM and regularly run virtual machines with XP and Windows 2003 server under 10.10 64 bit (I use VMware for the 2003 Server). RAM helps. This set up works well for me, in spite of the performance hit for things like full motion video/audio, which I mostly do in Ubuntu, but sometimes can't avoid using Windows.\n\nA: If you're really interested in maximizing your productivity, your VMhost OS should be the OS that boots and reboots the quickest on your particular machine. That's where most of your \"dead time\" is spent on any given day. Rarely will you ever be slowed down significantly for other operations like file saves, compiles, image loads, file downloads--because you multitask. Most people read/edit/browse something else while they wait for resource-intensive operations.\nIf you use the Linux OS more than the Windows OS then using Linux as the host is definitely better, because there will be little overhead for all your Linux tasks and your Windows VM will fire up much more quickly than if you had to reboot to it. Most desktop environments use a fraction of the available processing, memory, and hard-drive resources, so any speed penalty for virtual-boxing them has a negligible impact on your productivity. Because your hardware is already initialized and configured, booting a guest OS (windows or linux) is so fast you probably won't get time to sip your coffee before getting back to work.\n", "Q: What is wrong with my Ubuntu download?

Please pick a supported language from /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED and log in again.\n\n(no idea what this means, my system is now configured to en_US.UTF-8)\nAnyone here can help me out understanding this?\n\nA: I guess it's related to decomposed vs. precomposed diacritic characaters: In Unicode you can write many diacritic characters like é either as as one character (\"precomposed\", NFC) or as a combination of the base character \"e\" and an additional accent character (\"decomposed\", NFD), see \nOS X always uses decomposed characters for file names. Linux files systems don't care about characters but just store bytes as file names and let the programs interpret them. NFC and NFD lead to different byte sequences Linux considers the resulting file names to be different. Most programs under Linux use NFC.\nI don't know of any program that can convert text between the two encoding forms. The program convmv (not installed by default) can convert file names between NFC and NFD. Maybe that helps, but maybe it causes other problems, so be careful.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I use on my Debian Server the convmv tool. It works like a charm.\nI use the following command line to convert NFD in NFC (for the file in DIRECTORY) :\nconvmv -r --nfc --nosmart -f UTF-8 -t UTF-8 --notest DIRECTORY\n\n", "Q: How to fix this \"New tab\" issue in Chromium?

If so, am I doing something wrong, am I misunderstanding how it works, or is that a bug in $eval?\n\nA: I don't know what's wrong with ${eval} and nobody in the Conky's chat was able to explain it to me, but they suggested using ${execpi} and it did exactly what I wanted :)\n\nA: I got here with the same problem. In your example you need to replace exec with execp inside eval for it to work as expected.\n\nA: I think you need \n${font DejaVu Sans Mono :size=6}${exec echo 'hey!'}\n\nConky formatting is not nested like HTML. Instead you set a formatting and it sticks until you change it. So, first we set the font and size (${font DejaVu Sans Mono :size=6}), and then we tell it what to output (${exec echo 'hey!'}), which is in this case the output of the command echo 'hey'.\nSo, if I put this\n ${font DejaVu Sans Mono :size=6}${font DejaVu Sans Mono :size=20}${exec echo 'hey!'}\n\n'hey' would be printed in  size 20 and the size 6 would be essentially useless.

Otherwise it'll just wait there for those to exit before it does anything else.\nSo your .xinitrc should look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nxrdb -merge .Xresources\nif [ -x /usr/bin/nm-applet ] ; then\n   nm-applet &\nfi\n\nif [ -x /usr/bin/gnome-power-manager ] ; then\nsleep 3 \ngnome-power-manager &\nfi\n\n\nexec xmonad\n\nAlternatively, you could run xmonad as the window manager inside a Gnome session, and then whatever is set in gnome-session-preferences will autostart.

I normally download all .deb packages and just copy the packages from /var/cache/apt/archives directory to the rest of the computers, saving me to have to download all the updates and programs again. But since Ubuntu 11.04, the directory keeps deleting the oldest file or some kind of delete method that literally resets the amount of packages there. So then I need to download them again on the rest of the PCs. The files stay there for a couple of days, but then \"magically\" it's not there anymore after some days. \nSo what do I need to do to tell Ubuntu NOT to eliminate any files from /var/cache/apt/archives, not even the previous versions of the same package? I do not want it to delete anything from there.\nJust to add, I install packages using aptitude or synaptic.\n\nA: This is not a direct answer to your question, but have you considered puttting something like apt-cacher-ng on one machine? It sounds like you are doing a lot of work copying when it could be done rather automatically. \nAll you have to do (IIRC) is install the apt-cacher-ng package on one computer, make sure port 3142 is open to your LAN if you have a firewall, and run echo \"Acquire::http { Proxy \\\"http://<ip_of_cacher_computer>:3142\\\"; };\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02proxy on each client. The clients will download through the cacher computer, and if a package has ever been downloaded by one client, it will just be grabbed out of the cache instead of being redownloaded. It's a pretty automatic solution to the problem of taking a long time to download the same packages twice.\n\nA: try APTonCD to make these files more portable\n\nA: Take a look at /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20archive.\nIn there there are a few lines used by the daily apt cron job:\nAPT::Archives::MaxAge \"30\";\nAPT::Archives::MinAge \"2\";\nAPT::Archives::MaxSize \"500\";\n\nThose are the defaults.  You should get what you want by setting all three to 0.\nYou can look at the headers of /etc/cron.daily/apt for more information.\n", "Q: Why should I use gksudo for Gtk apps instead of sudo? I read somewhere that people should use gksudo for applications that use the Gtk GUI instead of sudo?

In Windows, when you click on the address bar, it automatically highlights all of the web address so you can enter another one without having to drag across everything. I've noticed that it doesn't do that in Chrome or Firefox (I don't know about other browsers). This is very annoying, especially when the site has a long address that goes past the end of the address bar. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Double click on on the address bar, and it will select the address.\n\nA: Ctrl-L selects the location bar. After selecting you're going to type anyway so I don't find the process objectionable.\n\nA: Alt+d highlights the address.\n\nA: In firefox, you can change this configuration setting through the \"about:config\" command.\nIn the address bar, type in and go to:\nabout:config\n\nClick on the \"I'll be careful, I promise\" radio button.  And input in the following query into the filter:\nbrowser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll\n\nDouble click on the entry to toogle its value between true and false.  Select \"False\" if you want to place the cursor at the insertion point, and select \"True\" if you want to highlight the entire address bar on a single mouse click.\nHere is a link to an article that gives some more useful \"about:config\" hacks:\n28 Coolest Firefox About:Config Tricks\n\nA: I believe the reason that clicking doesn't highlight the entire address is to facilitate partial selection of the URL.\nFor example on this page you may wish to select the question ID, which you can do with a simple double-click.\nOr you may wish to delete everything after the domain, to return to the home page (assuming there is no \"home\" link). Or copy just the domain for whatever reason.\n\nA: on firefox  in address bar enter\nabout:config\n\nbrowser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll\nto  true\n\nbrowser.urlbar.doubleClickSelectsAll\nto  false\n\nbenefit of this solution is it not only highlights URL it also copies into clipboard ... at least on linux dunno about other OS\n", "Q: Bundle of important softwares Is there any bundle of softwares to download in a package for free?\nI want software for everyday use and for general programming development.\nEdit\nEditor and other required programs to run PHP, C, C++, Java.\nA music & video player, an image editor.\n\nA: As far as I know, you can't download all of those in one package for Ubuntu.

As .NET is OS independent how can I run programs built/compiled on .NET 4.0 ?\nCan I develop software in Ubuntu for .NET 4.0 [if yes, what i need to download, link] ?\n\nA: Overview\nMono provides the core compatibility API for the .Net framework.\nThe version in Natty (v2.6.7) has support for both Visual Basic & C# version 2,3 & partial API support for v4.\nThis also includes a VB .Net compiler & the runtime compiler.  The other members of the family, j# and f# are not supported in terms of development.  Obviously - their compiled variants are byte compatible with the rest of the .Net family.\nWindows Forms up-to version 2 is supported - source\nThe next version of Ubuntu - 11.10 - will come with mono 2.10 which has virtually complete .Net v4 support\nMono Example Usage\nAn example of a .Net application which I use that runs without issue on Ubuntu is Keepass 2\nYou run the compiled .exe [it was created under windows] using mono i.e.\nmono Keepass.exe\n\nDeveloping\nTo develop under Ubuntu, I would have a look at the Mono Develop project - an IDE based environment - search for MonoDevelop in the Software Center.\nInstalling\nTake a closer look at the suggested Add-Ons - choose the Add-Ons in the area that you will be developing in.\n\n\nA: The Mono project offers a compiler and class library for C Sharp compatible with .NET 4.0. The compatibility improves with later versions. Ubuntu contains 2.6.7, I believe, which is the latest long-term stable release. Mono 2.10.2 is the most recent release and has various improvements.\nFor development, install monodevelop. Ubuntu offers MonoDevelop 2.4.

My HDD is reaching a very high temperature, aprox. 50°, while using Ubuntu. On Windows it only gets as high as 40° and it causes the touchpad to get hot.\nWhat can I do to determine what is causing this behaviour and how can I cool off my drive?\nMy notebook is a Toshiba A300-2D4 with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3470 graphics card.\n\nA: Did you try to open the powermanager and tick the box to allow the hdd to spin down whenever it is possible? Use powertop (you can find it in synaptics paketmanager) and increase dirty writeback as proposed by powertop. Pls report back if this reduced the temp.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem with my hdd (Scorpio blue WD2500BEVT), but I've solved by setting the sata link to min_power instead of the default max_performance: as root, check the files on: /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy, and /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/link_power_management_policy, etc.\nif you get max_performance, then change it:\necho min_power > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy\n\nthe same on the other files. Notice that this will get back to the default when you restart, or when you came back from a suspended mode, so you'll have to apply this every time. \nI've also set hdparm to -B128. If any of this does not work try to monitor your hard drive and check how many times it is been accessed, maybe modifying your fstab file, google it, on how to improve the hard drive. hope this help you, it got me really upset.\n\nA: try using hdparm, if supported\nhdparm --help\n\nyou can try hdparm -S 9 (for random example)\n", "Q: Screen goes into power saving mode on boot up I have an annoying problem in that when I turn my computer on my monitor (an LG Flatron) immediately goes into power saving mode and I can see nothing but a black screen, apart from occasional flashes as the boot up process continues. This necessitates me having to use the reset button numerous times until I \"get lucky\" and actually manage to see the screen and log in as normal. Sometimes this process can take 15 to 20 minutes. Once logged in with a visible screen, however, there is no problem. I can even restart the system without problems. The problem only occurs when the computer is turned on for the first time, e.g. in the morning after having been switched off all night.

I waited for 10 minutes and nothing happened, so I decided to restart the laptop and that's where the problem started. When the computer restarted, the log in was different! It was a black screen with my name in the middle and a white bar at the bottom of the screen with the options \"shut down\", \"restart\" and \" Hibernate\". And it said on the top right corner of the screen\n\nInstall Error! your GNOME power\n  manager Isn't configured. please\n  contact the administrator of the\n  computer!\n\nso I tried logging in, and I was bought back to the login screen. (The one I just explained). So I tried installing the program from my Disk. It was all good. It even asked me to import the things from my mucked up account! So I logged into the new account and I found nothing there! And so I restarted the computer and chose the account (thats the mucked up one). And it was the same! In the disk analyser it said I still had the files but I cant get to them! \nSo what do I do?\nThanks in advance\nand please tell me the solution because lots of my family pics are on that account and I don't want to lose them!\nPs. I am 15, so please try to keep everything brief!\npps. The mucked account has the following Ubuntu \"UBUNTU 10.04.2 LTS\" \nAgain thanks in advance and it would be appreciated if this problem is solved!\n\nA: Imrose,\n  not sure what you mean by \"installed the program from my disk\" - can you clarify what exactly you did?  \nTry this - plug in you 10.04 CD and boot to a desktop from the CD.  \nNow use Nautilus (File Manager) and find your photos and any thing else you want to keep.  \nPlug in a USB stick and copy the files to the USB stick.\nIf you can't find your files then maybe you have overwritten them by the \"installed the program from my disk\"?\nAn excellent tool for finding photos etc is PhotoRec.  The key-thing to remember for trying to recover files is NOT to install anything else onto the hard-drive.\nUse another computer and burn to a CD the Ubuntu Rescue Remix.  You can launch PhotoRec from booting using that live CD.\nOnce you've retrieved your valuable files, then I would concentrate on trying to find a solution for your mucked up installation.\nYou perhaps could spend a few hours or days searching for a solution - or you can spend 20 minutes doing a reinstall.

I cannot watch youtube or other flash videos on fullscreen on the external monitor plugged into my laptop and type on the other screen, since the fullscreen video will go back to small screen if I try typing on the other screen. Is there a way to fix this?\n\nA: The Flash plugin is specifically designed to un-fullscreen as soon as the video loses focus.  As far as I am aware there is no way to change that, nor there is a way to hide the \"Press ESC to leave full screen\" message that shows up upon entering fullscreen mode.\nA partial workaround at least for YouTube is to enable HTML5 mode.\n\nA: You can also break the flash plugin via hex editing (not the best idea in the world, but it works): http://www.buttonhome.org/articles/23-linux/194-fullscreen-flash-on-dual-monitor-linux\n", "Q: How to debug grayed out VPN connection in Network Manager?

As soon as the keyring gets unlocked (For example by trying to edit the connection settings) the VPN connection is not disabled anymore.\nThere are various options to unlock the keyring automatically when login, but the simplest I found was to just use a blank password for my keyring.

You could get something like a \"timestamp\" command in the contextual menu. Nautilus-actions lets you choose which file types will have the command available.\nNautilus-actions is available in software-center and then in settings menu. Nautilus scripts are those stored in \"~/.gnome2/nautilus-script\"\nDoing so, your files won't be automatically timestamped, but the job will be easier.\n\nA: Put this code into a file (e.g. add_date) move it to the ~/.gnome2/nautilus-script directory.

(to a different part of the drive, i mean) I would like to install more than just a few distributions and i would like to avoid spending the time to install them one by one, having my system practically non operational for half a day - or more. Is there any way to install them while i am still running Ubuntu? \n\nA: I suggest VirtualBox.\n\nVirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.\n\nYou can use it to make virtual drives for each operating systems or Linux distributions.  \n\nA: I don't think it is possible, and not even convenient, because the installation process of various distributions is not particularly long.\nOnly thing you can try is to install on a virtual disk with virtualbox, then could be possible to move the installation on a real partition, with the required modifications, to fstab and to grub for example, but the process is not simple, and I cannot recall exactly the details.\n\nA: You could probably try Unetbootin, but I have not tested this and would not suggest it necessarily.\n\nA: There is no problems installing other distros on your disk. You just need to partition for it. Make sure you give each distro all the partitions it needs.\nIt should also be possible to install the other distros on a file, like wubi does on Windows, since grub supports booting from disk images. At least it supports booting from ISO-images. I don't know any reason why you shouldn't be able to boot a normal raw disk image just as easily, but I'm not entirely certain. There are several ways you can create a disk image and install an operating system on it, but here's one way to do it without any virtualization (which might be easier):\nCreate a RAW disk image using qemu-img. Boot a live-cd for the distro you want to install and use qemu-nbd to mount the disk image you created so you get a block device. I skip and references to invocations here because you really need to read the manual for those commands. (It's not difficult) You can then create partitions on that image as if it was a normal disk. Install the operating system and boot loader. \nNow, you have to configure your grub to boot from that disk image. Unfortunately, that's where my knowledge ends. Good luck. :)\n", "Q: 2.6.38-10 stops booting 11.04 natty narwhale (2.6.38-10) stop boot.\nAfter work with: gparted, palimpsest, mountmanager.\nsda:\n\nsda1 ntfs flag: boot  Windows 7  mbr\nsda2 ntfs\nsda3 extended flag: lba (?)\nsda5 ntfs\nsda6 ext4  Ubuntu 11.04\nsda4 ext4\n\nstops after:\nuhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.0: Unlink after no-IRQ?

I read that this is possible, and suggested it as a possible solution for someone else, but I'm curious as to if it is actually advisable (as I might just try it). I might even try running 11.10 on my system this way.\nIs it worth the risk to do this?\n\nA: In one of my laptop partitions I've got a variant of Ubuntu Lucid (called Deepin) installed.  I used Unetbootin to install Ubuntu based distros inside that partition a few times (I mean, one distro at a time).  Each time Unetbootin basically added one or two directories containing the live data of the distro and added boot entries to the Grub menu.  On rebooting after installing the distro this way,  I select the entry \"Unetbootin\" on the Grub menu will run the distro the same way as running the live CD or USB of the distro, but much faster.\nIn case I want to delete the installed distro, I just run Unetbootin again within my Lucid variant (Deepin) and I'll be asked if I want to remove the installed distro.  On confirming, the distro will be removed (the added directories and Grub additions) right away.\nI have tested a few distros this way and I'm very happy with it.  But I must make it clear that I haven't tested non-Ubuntu-based distros this way; and I recall reading somewhere that some versions of Unetbootin may not work this way. \n\nA: Roland, could it be this webpage you came across:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/02/how-to-boot-iso-with-grub2-easy-way.html\nIn fact, it was this webpage that inspired me exploring Unetbootin's hdd installation mode.\n", "Q: How can I force the installation of the Virtualbox Extension pack?

In this case, it means the version originally written for the Pentium 3 using the SSE extended instruction set.\nThe speed printed is the average number of megabytes of data it can pass to the checksumming function per second, a measure of the function's efficiency.\n(And the kernel tries all the versions it knows about and uses the one with the highest MB/s; this doesn't necessarily mean one named after your particular CPU.

Apparently, the new\n  desktop features are unable to load.\n\nFor some features like Unity 3D you need better hardware,\notherwise it will fallback to Unity 2D, but you can also run classic gnome desktop, which is not so cpu and gpu power hungry.\nIf that happened just after install maybe you will need to add or enable some drivers for your hardware, many times I saw that same hardware under different drivers act differently, under one driver same hardware not work under unity3D but when i find better driver it works!\nUnder safe mode it is normal that some functions are reduced, or not loaded.\nFor example in real recovery mode there is not desktop,just text mode so:\nInvestigate and activate graphical card perhaps proprietary ,for your laptop.*depends what u have inside as Graphic Card,or integrated card...\nthat is mostly normal,not to all,but to newer hardware ,yes.\nUnder Ubuntu you can find variety of different drivers for same hardware, not like under Windows.\n", "Q: What should I do when the GETDEB repository is down?

Sdb must be at least as big as sda, otherwise you will loose information. Since you're cloning the disk, that means the partitions will also be identical. You will then use something like gparted to resize the partition and then resize the filesystems. For ext2,3,4 filesystems, you can use resize2fs for that. \n", "Q: Can I manage Ubuntu workstation through Windows like Local or Global Group Policy?

I have updated the UUID in fstab file.But it is again booting up continuously or infinitelyWhat might be the problem ?How to get rid of this ?The output of the fdisk command\n\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x022c022b\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *           1        6374    51199123+   7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda2            6375       60800   437176814+   f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5            6375       21672   122881153+  83  Linux\n/dev/sda6           21690       40659   152367104    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda7           40929       60800   159614976    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda8           40664       40925     2097152   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\n Partition table entries are not in disk order\n\nIn Live CD\n$ sudo blkid\n/dev/loop0: TYPE=\"squashfs\" \n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"F8F81FD0F81F8C4E\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"b6768343-075c-44a5-8229-4070a80d2d49\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"entertainment\" UUID=\"7630A95430A91C5D\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda7: LABEL=\"label1\" UUID=\"9414A64F14A63460\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda8: UUID=\"1993033c-a261-4506-8520-2b5ff9fd9a60\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\n\nI can start the Ubuntu in recovery mode. \nI've mounted the filesystem located in the hard drive at mount point /mnt.\n The kern.log file(/mnt/var/log/kern.log) content is in pastebin.the link is kern.log\nThe fstab file(/mnt/etc/fstab) content is fstab\nI pressed break key while splash screen is showing.It shows this line:\n(process:311):GLib-WARNING ** :getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (0)\n\nThen  some messages repeated thrice.I again pressed break key the splash screen shown again.After few minutes When I pressed break key that messages repeated more.\n\nI've noted and it is here.Some texts can be missing there.\nfsck from Util-linux 2.17.2\n/dev/sda5: clean, 191939/7684096 files, 5176534/30720288 block\n* starting AppArmor profiles\nSkipping profile in /etc/apparmor.d/disable:usr.bin.firefox\n                                                                              [ok]\n*setting sensors limits                                                       [ok]\n\n*Not starting jetty-edit  /etc/default/jetty and change NO_START to be 0 (or     comment   it out)\n\nSpeech dispatcher disable: edit /etc/default/speech-dispatcher\n*pulse Audio  (...... some thing ......)\nSaned disable  (...... some thing ......)\n* Enabling edit executable binary format bin fmt-super                        [ok]\n*checking battery state ...

The Live CD is the right tool for this job.\nFirst, mount your Ubuntu partition in a mount point:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n\nNext, start editing the file:\nsudo nano /mnt/etc/fstab\n\nNavigate to the line containing the swap and press Ctrl + K to delete the line. Enter the following line in its place:\nUUID=1993033c-a261-4506-8520-2b5ff9fd9a60 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nSave the changes by pressing Ctrl + X, followed by Y and Enter\n\nA: I see that your new swap partition is known as /dev/sda8. You can use that instead of the UUID in your fstab file. In my opinion, it's easier, and problems are only possible if you add an additional internal hard drive.\nFrom your live CD, you must mount your local filesystem before you can do anything productive.\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\n\nThe reason you couldn't mount it earlier is because you have to use sudo to mount a partition unless fstab explicitly says you don't. And in the live CD, it doesn't say so.\nNow, your hard drive lives in /mnt. So, the correct fstab to edit lives in /mnt/etc/fstab.\nAlternatively, you might prefer to set up a chroot. That means that you can have a shell where everything looks like it's running from your hard drive, not the live cd. To set this up, do the following after mounting /dev/sda5 on /mnt:\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\n# The above two commands make kernel settings available to the chroot.\n# They aren't always necessary, but they never hurt.\n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nAt this point, you will be root on your internal hard drive. Thus, editing /etc/fstab will be the fstab on your hard drive, not the live CD. And all commands you run will be run from your hard drive.\n", "Q: are there any issues creating a tmpfs mount when my root partition is a RAID5 array I have a new Ubuntu 11 server install created per the wiki with the following partitions: \nmd1 : active raid5 sdc5[2] sda5[0] sdb5[1]\n  1935813632 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]\n\nmd2 : active raid5 sdb6[1] sdc6[2] sda6[0]\n  16722944 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [3/3] [UUU]\n\nmd0 : active raid1 sda1[0] sdc1[2](S) sdb1[1]\n  487412 blocks super 1.2 [2/2] [UU]\n\nunused devices: <none>\n\n/ is mounted at md1, md2 is swap and md3 is /boot. \nI would like to create a tmpfs for /tmp which I probably should have done at install time, but I'm wondering if there is any issue doing it now, considering that its parent is a RAID array?  \nAlso, what process would you recommend for creating the tmpfs? \n\nA: No problem, by the time you are mounting /tmp is mounted / will aready be mounted.  The file system you are mounting to is relatively unimportant.  It is important that it is already mounted.  Using tmpfs will actually help your raid perfomance if you do use /tmp a lot.\nMore important with tmpfs is the size of your swap partition.  The available memory including swap controls how large a tmpfs file system you can create.  When memory gets tight or /tmp data ages, it is likley be moved to swap.  Creating large files in tmpfs tends to involve swapping some of the data to your swap partition, but generally this should not be a problem.\nEDIT: WARNING: tmpfs is temporary and will be flushed every reboot.  I've seen long multi-step runs trashed by storing data on file systems cleared on reboot. Don't use a tmpfs mount for anything that needs to survive a reboot.  Do use tmpfs for anything that should not survive a reboot.  \nSome systems have a script that clears /tmp and/or similar directories on reboot.  Behavior of these should be the same whether or not tmpfs is used. \n", "Q: Move Emblems and Notes with copy When I copy and transfer emblems and notes which I created on directories to my friend's machine, they are not going with it.  \n\n\nIs is possible to move them with copy? If it is yes, how can I move emblems and notes with copy between two Ubuntu machines?  \n\nA: Notes and emblems are stored in ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata/ or (for older versions (2008-ish) of Ubuntu) ~/.nautilus/metafiles/ in binary format. \nRegarding emblems. Have a look at this answer: How to change the icons of multiple files from terminal? \nRegarding notes. From CRC OK weblog:\nNotes are not embedded into the file.

Otherwise LKMPG (!) is enough to get the result. Specifically, the section 2.2 Compiling Kernel Modules is the direct and detailed answer to my question.\nHTH\n\nA: *\n\n*To build the final module images in a directory, you can use the M= argument for your make command:\nmake M=drivers/usb/serial\nThis will build all the needed files in that directory and link the final module images.\n\n*\n\n*To build only a specific file in the kernel tree, just pass it as the argument to make:\nmake drivers/usb/serial/visor.ko\nThe build system will build all needed files for the visor.ko kernel module, and do the final link to create the module.\n", "Q: How do I make VLC handle videos in Firefox instead of Totem? Some websites that use Windows Media does not work when using Totem as a player, but people have told me that replacing Totem with VLC in Firefox can sometimes make things work. So the question becomes: how do I replace Totem with VLC as a video handler in Firefox?\n\nA: I don't recommend doing that. While VLC is one of the best players, the plugin is really bad. The recommendation on the other reply to change the Applications settings won't work. When you have multiple plugins installed, Firefox decides which one to use by the mime-type of the content. The only way I know how to force Firefox to use another plugin is to change the video object type in the page, but that is very complicated and not feasible.\nI would recommend removing VLC plugin and Totem plugin, then installing gecko-mediaplayer.\n", "Q: Expose-like spread mode in unity 2d without compiz I'm using ubuntu 11.04 with unity-2d but without compiz because my computer has a two-screen setup. \nI'd like to know if there's any way of having a view of all active applications running like Mac OS X' Expose feature.

The first possibility is that your computer is using a buggy DNS server that doesn't handle requests for IPv6 addresses well. The second possibility is that your computer thinks it has internet IPv6 connectivity when in reality it doesn't.\nRun dig aaaa he.net and dig a he.net. Each one will list a Query time. The times should be within ~200msec of each other. If they are not, you DNS server is what is causing this slowness. \nOne case to test for is how fast the DNS server will tell you that a website does not have an IPv6 address. You can test this by running something like dig aaaa bluecc.edu. It's Query time should be similar to the other times you ran 'dig'. The important thing is that the Query time is short.\nIPv6 access itself could be broken. You can test by running ping -c 5 he.net and ping6 -c 5 he.net. The 'time' for the ping6 should be comparable to just ping, and the 'time' should be at least less 1000 msec. If the ping6 is giving you destination unreachable errors, then your IPv6 connectivity is broken. In that case, you have two options. One is to disable IPv6 and the other is to install miredo, which will make an IPv6 tunnel, which should fix any connectivity problems. (You shouldn't have to do anything to set up miredo. It should just work. It's also easy to remove if you ever need to with sudo apt-get remove miredo)\n\nA: For the record, disabling IPv6 can be done by setting the following in /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"ipv6.disable=1\"\n\nDon't forget to call update-grub afterwards and reboot. This seems to be the most sure-fire way to do it in Ubuntu.\nAnother way is to set it in /etc/sysctl.conf:\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\n\nTo disable IPv6 immediately, but not permanently, without reboot:\n# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1\n# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1\n\nI've found that using /etc/sysctl.conf didn't work as expected but I don't exactly remember what the problem was. Maybe the settings were applied too late in the boot process for some applications? \n\nA: I followed the instructions here:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2010/05/how-to-disable-ipv6-in-ubuntu-1004.html\nIt worked perfectly on 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04.\n", "Q: I have slow video acceleration, is there any way to fix this?

There is a legacy driver available but it intended for distributions predating February 2009 and may not work with newer distributions.\nIf you are experiencing slow framerates with games I suggest you disable some of the effects.\n", "Q: Unity / Compiz problem after update from Xorg ppa After update from Xorg ppa (ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa)\nI have many problems with Unity Shell / Compiz.\nPreview of moving icons is broken and GTK theme of unselected windows breaks.\nVideo:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BArR1OsssD0\nVideo card: Intel GMA965\nSystem: Ubuntu 11.04\nKernel: 2.6.39-3 - present\nMy old Kernels: 2.6.38-8 - the same problem\n2.6.38-10 - the same problem\nSorry for my english.\n\nA: As you have found, the edgers PPA can be very unstable - it is frequently updated.  Some updates are OK - some will break your system.\nMy general advice would be - if you find that a particular update from edgers work for you, then untick the box in software sources for the edgers PPA, so no further updates are received which can break your system.\nI note that you are using both the edgers PPA and Kernel 2.6.39-3.  Can I ask why?\nYou perhaps can either wait for a few days to see if a further update to edgers works - or you can ppa_purge the edgers PPA to return to a known Natty build configuration.\nIf you want to do a ppa_purge, then in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nsudo ppa-purge xorg-edgers\n\nYou may have to also boot from the standard Natty kernel, 2.6.38.x\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Again I installed ubuntu last week on my computer. The way I did it was creating a partition on my HDD and then I used the windows installation of ubuntu to installed there. After I did it, I restart my computer and try to boot ubuntu, but it did not work. So I tried to go into my windows 7 boot again. On the booting process I got the message that my computer crash or had some kind of error so I choose the option to recover my system from a rally point, after I did it; the partition that I created was gone. So I turned my computer of and turned it on to see if the dual boot screen was gone, but it was still there. After that I tried many different was to erase the dual boot.\nI also tried to install ubuntu again, but the installer is not letting me do it because the file of Wubi still in my system. I would like to know if some can help me with this, so I can erase those files, and install ubuntu again on my computer.\nI have windows 7 64-bit\n\nA: Here's the official Ubuntu wiki topic on uninstalling WUBI.

I am a Linux enthusiast with some very basic programming experience and I am currently trying to set up a touch surface interface using Microsoft's Kinect and Simple Kinect Touch software. I am in the process of building the software and was just wondering if anyone could tell me what a \"Mono Wrapper\" is.

The script works great with one exception... in /etc/apache2/sites-available/ all of my virtual host files have two copies, one with an e and one without. \nI believe my issue lies when I use the SED command. Can I get a second opinion?\nHere is the script:\n# set the working directory\ndir=$(pwd)\n\n# request the new domain name\nprintf \"Enter the new domain name, without the www (i.e newdomain.com):\\n\"\nread newdomain\n\n# request the new username\nprintf \"Enter the new username (i.e newusername):\\n\"\nread username\n\n# create the new user\nsudo adduser $username\n\n# copy the virtual host to sites-available\nsudo cp /templates/domain-vhost /etc/apache2/sites-available/$newdomain\n\n# echo results\necho \"Successfully created the virtual host file at: /etc/apache2/sites-available/$newdomain..\"\n\n# change the domain name in the virtual host file\nsudo sed -ie \"s/NEWDOMAINNAME/$newdomain/\" /etc/apache2/sites-available/$newdomain\n\n# echo results\necho \"Modified the virtual host to reflect the new domain: $newdomain..\"\n\n# change the directory path in the virtual host\nsudo sed -ie \"s/NEWUSERNAME/$username/\" /etc/apache2/sites-available/$newdomain\n\n# echo results\necho \"Successfully modified the new virtual host file..\"\n\n# enable the site with apache\ncd /etc/apache2/sites-available/\nsudo a2ensite $newdomain\n\n# echo results\necho \"Successfully enabled the $newdomain..\"\n\n# change to previous working directory\ncd $dir\n\n# reload apache\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n\n# notify user of action\necho \"Finished creating the new domain, $newdomain, and restarted Apache..\"\n\n\nA: You need separate -i and -e arguments to sed. -ie is telling sed to create a backup file with an 'e' appended.\n\nTo fix, just replace the sed invocation above to:\nsudo sed -i -e \"s/NEWUSERNAME/$username/\" /etc/apache2/sites-available/$newdomain\n\n", "Q: Bind Alt-N to Nth window in byobu/screen I've been trying to bind a shortcut to switching to a specific window in Byobu, but I'm not having success. I wanted to bind Alt-(screen's number) but it's not working. I think I'm using the wrong ASCII codes. \nTake Alt + 1 for example: I've tried using the lines\nbind \\078 select 1\n\nand  \nbind \\78 select 1\n\nto both ~/.screeenrc and ~/.config/byobu/keybindings, but neither worked.\nAm I using the wrong code, or is there no standard ASCII code for Alt + 1?\n\nA: First check what octal code is generated when you press alt+1, type in the following:\necho -n C-qM-1 | od -t o1\n\n(If that makes no sense to you: instead of writing C-q, press ctrl-q and for M-1 substitute alt-1, and some character should show up). For example, I have Finnish keyboard and en_US.UTF-8 locale and get:\n0000000 302 261\n\nso I put in my .screenrc:\nbindkey \"\\302\\261\" select 1\n\nNote: by default this will not work in a gnome-terminal at all, since alt+number changes the tab and screen (or bash) doesn't get a chance to see the keypress.

My interface will then freeze, after which I have to wait 20 minutes time to be able to even move the mouse.\nThe current suspected culprit is Chromium or XChat as these are always present when this issue occurs. I'm leaning more towards XChat as I've previously noticed the freeze starting right around the time when I click on something related to XChat.\nAmong the other things I've noticed is the Swap usage will build up over time.\nI've also had Emesene and Dropbox open, but i doubt they're the root cause of the issue as they're just idling when the interface freezes.\nRebooting is currently my only fix at the moment, (That I can find anyway...)but if the interface didn't completely stop working, in that case it would be a hard reset. Also when the swap is full, the HDD light is constantly on.\n\nEdit:\nFound some additional information.

You can check your own system's swappiness value by running:\none@onezero:~$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n60\n\nAs I have 4 GB of RAM, so I'd like to turn that down to 10 or 15. The swap file will then only be used when my RAM usage is around 80 or 90 percent. To change the system swappiness value, open /etc/sysctl.conf as root. Then, change or add this line to the file:\nvm.swappiness = 10\n\nReboot for the change to take effect\nYou can also change the value while your system is still running\nsysctl vm.swappiness=10\n\nyou can also clear your swap by running swapoff -a and then swapon -a as root instead of rebooting to achieve the same effect.\nTo calculate your swap Formula  \nfree -m (total) / 100 = A\n\nA * 10\n\nroot@onezero:/home/one# free -m\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          3950       2262       1687          0        407        952\n-/+ buffers/cache:        903       3047\nSwap:         1953          0       1953\n\n\nso total is 3950 / 100 = 39.5 * 10 = 395\n\nso what it mean is that when 10 % 395 MB of ram left then it start using swapiness\n\nHelp . Ubuntu . Swap\nWhat is swappiness\nThe swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk. Because disks are much slower than RAM, this can lead to slower response times for system and applications if processes are too aggressively moved out of memory.\n.     swappiness can have a value of between 0 and 100\n.     swappiness=0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory for as long as possible\n.     swappiness=100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory and move them to swap cache\nThe default setting in Ubuntu is swappiness=60. Reducing the default value of swappiness will probably improve overall performance for a typical Ubuntu desktop installation. A value of swappiness=10 is recommended, but feel free to experiment. \n\nStarted Using swap at 91%\n\nAs i have configured my system & vm to make use of ram at 90 % . At 90 % there was no swapping \nafter that i opened  some application like Firefox & Shutter , its start swapping because of ram usage is above 90 % \n\nA: I found this link Help.ubuntu.com Community: Swap FAQ. The part about swapiness stands out as a point to check. To check the value from a terminal type this in.\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nDefault desktop version is 60 which mine is. A server is 10. The higher the value the more aggressive swap is used. The help FAQ explains how to adjust the value. \nI have 4G of RAM and swap, like your system, and have never noticed my swap partition used.\n\nA: According to Mr. Gilles's  suggestion find out the buggy application.

The problem is a bug, that I wasn't able to trace down.\nThe only solution that I've found is installing Ubuntu 10.04 and then upgrading it to 12.04, in this situation the bug mysteriously does not appear. The bug was introduced in 11.10, and is still there in 12.04. Appears only on clean installs, not upgrades (and on live cds also).\nHere is bug report on launchpad: Bug 863552\nSo, the problem is as follows: kernel somehow does not release cache and buffers, and drops pages to swap instead of reducing cache. Also, swappiness has absolutely no effect.  Dropping caches helps, just until cache fills up memory again.\n\nA: *\n\n*gksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\n*On the very bottom: vm.swappiness=10\n\n*Reboot\n\n*cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness gives you 10\nThats a really good value with 4gb RAM.\n(By the way on 11.04 I encouter similar things with my Ram, I know 1 program; Lernid, which doesn't/didn't close all related proc.

I have 64Bit Ubuntu installed, and a MSI Graphics card.\nAny ideas on why this might be happening?\n\nA: Check in the motherboard BIOS for an option similar to \"map around memory hole.\" Your motherboard's chipset may not support this option.\nOlder, especially laptop, chipsets (for example, the Intel 945p chipset) did not support true 64 bit memory addressing and had a ceiling of 4GB even in 64 bit mode. If that is the case with your system then this is a hardware limitation that can't be addressed without replacing the chipset (motherboard.)\n\nA: Is it an integrated VGA? In that case, some will share the main memory, so it won't be available to applications. \n\nA: Is the missing memory on the graphics card or memory in your computer?  How have you determined that only 3.2GBs are showing up?\nIf it's a matter of available memory, you might check System Monitor (in System Settings) and look under the Processes tab, and then click \"Memory\" to put the processes in order so you can easily see which are using the most memory.  The Resources tab will show total memory in your system, as well as how much is being used.\n\nA: You need to install pae kernel. This will allow usage of memory on a computer larger than 4GB\nMost times you can install with:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-pae\nOnce you restart you should see the correct memory size. \n", "Q: No sound from speakers I was mucking with my sound card hardware profile in the Sound Preferences menu and I seem to have lost my sound.

I had to move files from U O to some temp location, rename them and upload them back. Is there a special procedure for files renaming?\n\nA: This could be a major bug in the software. Are you sure that it is deleted PERMANENTLY when you try to rename it? i.e. does it magically 'disappear' and 'reappear' (maybe after a few minutes) after you've renamed the file? If so, then i think you have a network problem (maybe your network is a bit too slow or you have very low latency).If not, then I think it is a bug in Ubuntu One.\nP.S.

I got a tutorial, but when I'm trying to run the following command apache2-ssl-certificate I'm getting a command not found error message. My question is how can I fix this problem?\n\nA: The tutorial you've found is unfortunately very old. To generate a SSL cert run the following:\nmkdir -p /etc/apache2/ssl\nopenssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.pem -keyout /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.pem\nln -sf /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.pem /etc/apache2/ssl/`/usr/bin/openssl x509 -noout -hash < /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.pem`.0\nchmod 600 /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.pem \n\nThis will create a SSL cert that expires in 365 days. To adjust the lifetime just change the -days 365 argument.\nMake sure that /etc/apache2/ports.conf contains something like:\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\n    Listen 443\n</IfModule>\n\nAssuming you still enabled SSL (sudo a2enmod ssl) you need to create a new virtual host. For example create a file /etc/apache2/sites-available/svn, containing among others:\nNameVirtualHost *:443\n<virtualhost *:443>\n        ...\n        SSLEngine On\n        SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/apache.pem\n        ...\n</virtualhost>\n\nand enable this site with sudo a2ensite svn. So you have a site that listens for SSL connection. I hope this helps.\n\nA: This is due to bug #77675. A solution is mentioned in the comments. I have not tried it myself so I don't know if it's correct.

It says that Nautilus cannot find/create a directory for /home/USERNAME/Desktop and all I get is a blank screen (default 11.04 purple background and no Unity. My keyboard shortcuts work, but nothing exists on the screen.\n\nA: As you probably know it's not possible to have an encrypted home folder without a password. The login password was used to encrypt the folder, if the computer doesn't know it, it can't decipher your home folder.\nAs this is the whole point of an encrypted folder, you just can't have both things at the same time (encrypted folder and automatic login).\nYou have a couple of workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user account for your friend. Get sure that it's home folder is not encrypted and set the computer to autolog to this account. You will need to add it to the superuser group to allow him to do administrative tasks.\n\n*You can also disable encryption in your home folder, Jonik answer to this question is quite straigh forward.\nIf you need to disable the autologin from the command line, check this enzotib answer. If you are not able to log to the GUI, you can usually access the command line pressing CTRL+ALT+F1. \nIf this doesn't work boot into recovery mode and follow the enzotib guide. You can usually select recovery mode on the grub screen, the first menu that appears when booting, where you can select the OS that will be loaded. If you don't see this screen try to press shift while booting.\n\nA: If I'm not mistaken you need your password to decrypt your home folder password, so that won't work since it just lets you bypass gdm, it doesn't save your password nor it can unlock your keyring.\nIts best to create a new user for your friend. \n\nA: Restart your computer, boot into recovery console, select \"Drop to the root command line\", type passwd, change to your original password, restart the computer and log in hopefully like earlier. \n", "Q: Installers asks me to insert CD that is already in tray I have tried installing Ubuntu 11.04 server and Ubuntu 10.04 server on a fairly old AMD Athlon machine but after quite som time of the install the installer asks me to insert the install disk, which is already in the drive.

Is there a way to install a deb package directly from a URL, using a shell?\nSomething like\ndpkg -i http://domain.com/path/to/package.deb\n\n(I know I could use wget and then dpkg, I'm just wondering if there's something that does it already)\n\nA: You may try with curl.\nTo download the file into the current folder and install from the local file:\ncurl -sLO https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb && sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-precise.deb\n\nor download into /var/cache/apt/archives/ and install from there:\ncurl -sL -o/var/cache/apt/archives/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb && sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb\n\n\nA: Edit: I didn't see your previous statement about knowing you could wget so this is a bit awkward... I'll leave this here for anybody who wants to know how to do this. Additionally the previous version of my answer didn't work but this version (at the expense of being somewhat longer) does:\nTEMP_DEB=\"$(mktemp)\" &&\nwget -O \"$TEMP_DEB\" 'http://path.to/my.deb' &&\nsudo dpkg -i \"$TEMP_DEB\"\nrm -f \"$TEMP_DEB\"\n\nYou just need to alter the URL at the beginning. This could be aliased or written as a bash function.\nI realise there are technical and security issues surrounding this (you don't get automatic updates, can the source be trusted, etc), but on a purely can-I-do-it basis, this might work.\n\nA: If you have (or install) Ansible:\nansible -m apt -a deb=http://domain.com/path/to/package.deb localhost\n\n\nA: I actually have a script that does something similar:\nJust copy and paste this script into ~/bin (create this folder if it doesn't exist):\n#!/bin/bash\n# ~/bin/dpkg\nCOUNT=0\nfor i in $@; do\n        echo $i | grep http 2>&1 > /dev/null\n        if [ $? == 0 ]; then\n                URL=\"$URL $i\"\n                continue\n        fi\n        PASSTODPKG=\"$PASSTODPKG $i\"\ndone\n\n#Remove beginning and trailing space\nURL=$(echo $URL | sed -e 's/^ //g' -e 's/ $//g')\n\nif [ ! -z $URL ]; then\n        mkdir /tmp/debs\n        cd /tmp/debs\n        for i in $URL; do\n                wget \"$i\"\n        done\n        dpkg $PASSTODPKG /tmp/debs/*.deb\nelse\n        dpkg $PASSTODPKG\nfi\n\nThen add this to the last line in ~/.bashrc\nPATH=\"~/bin:$PATH\"\n\nThe script is just a wrapper for dpkg. The line in the ~/.bashrc file tells bash that whenever you type dpkg, it will run ~/bin/dpkg (the script), rather than /usr/bin/dpkg.\nThe script will just pass the arguments to dpkg if there's no URL's given. The script also supports multiple URL's. Here are some examples that will work:\nsudo dpkg -i http://www.example.com/file1.deb\nsudo dpkg -i http://www.example.com/file1.deb http://www.example.com/file2.deb\nsudo dpkg -i http://www.example.com/file1.deb existing.deb http://www.example.com/file2.deb\nsudo dpkg -i existing.deb\n\n\nA: It is not possible without creating a temporary file. Normally you would do this like\n### Does not work\nwget --quiet --output-document=- http://example.com/path/to/package.deb | dpkg --install -\n\nor maybe\n### Does not work\ndpkg --install <(wget --quiet --output-document=- http://example.com/path/to/package.deb)\n\nbut dpkg uses mmap to access the file so neither works.

My bad, sorry.\n\nA: It could be that some process still has deleted files open. If this is the case then they will not appear in the du output but would still be counted in the df output.\nOne quick way to check for these is to list /proc as user root (hint sudo su should get you a root shell). Any open, but deleted files will have (deleted) at the end of the symbolic link target name.\nls -l /proc/*/fd/* | grep deleted | grep /home\n\nshould give you a list of any files open. Once you have that then an ls -lL of the specific file should give you the size of the file.\nAs an example (using /tmp on my system because there are no examples on /home here) I see a few files owned by user mysql.\nrichm@viking:/$ sudo su\nroot@viking:/# ls -l /proc/*/fd/* | grep deleted | grep /tmp\nlrwx------ 1 root     root     64 Oct 13 06:30 /proc/1489/fd/11 -> /tmp/ibwmCqpg (deleted)\nlrwx------ 1 root     root     64 Oct 13 06:30 /proc/1491/fd/12 -> /tmp/ib9MTMQi (deleted)\nroot@viking:/# ls -lL /proc/1489/fd/11\n-rw------- 0 mysql2 mysql2 0 Aug 24 14:09 /proc/1489/fd/11\nroot@viking:/# ls -lL /proc/1491/fd/12\n-rw------- 0 mysql mysql 1320 Oct 15 13:40 /proc/1491/fd/12\n\nIf you have any processes with large deleted files open then stoping the process should be enough to reclaim the disk space. Alternatively a reboot should do the same thing.\n\nA: Each file system only has a certain amount of inodes and blocks that can be stored on it. Even in case there is enough space, you can't go further.\nCheck your settings with\ndumpe2fs /dev/sda5\n\n(only the top 50 lines are important here).\nIf you have a lot of small files that are smaller than the blocksize, a lot of space is wasted.\n", "Q: Limit applications that can go online when tethered I sometimes USB tether my laptop to my phone to allow me to access the internet using 3G.

But don't let that stop you if you want an Asus netbook they are definitely a good option. I own a 1015pn and it works great with Ubuntu 11.04.

After installing, I added xfce as my default desktop/windows manager. Sometime over the weekend, my computer turned itself off.  (I'm not sure what happened, but when I came over to use it, it was turned off.  Chromium said it wasn't shut down cleanly when I started it up again).  Ever since then, xfce seems to be running gnome's desktop.  \nSpecifically, it's using gnome's desktop background, it is using the gnome right-click-on-the-desktop menu, and not letting me use the scroll wheel while pointing to the desktop to change workspaces.  When I have terminal window with transparency open, it shows my xfce background images as being what is behind it, even though that isn't what is behind it.\nHow do I restore xfce to its former glory?\n\nA: I bet it was Nautilus taking over !\nIf it happens again terminate nautilus in task manager. If you want to switch to xfce permanently get rid of Nautilus in favor of Thunar or maybe PCMan.\n\nA: Well, that's odd.  [using the gnome switch background dialog] I changed the background.  Immediately after doing that, it switched back to xfce's backgrounds and menus, etc.\n", "Q: fail2ban doesn't match anything I'm working on a new build of my FTP server and I can't get the ssh part of fail2ban to match anything.

At some point along the line, Ubuntu started requiring the persistent drive be a minimum of 1gb. If your distro leaves less than 1gb of free space on the usb drive you are using, it will be grayed out.\n\nA: I got the same, but I noticed that was because I had deleted all the partitions.\nIn the Startup Disk Creator, if the size option is gray, select the USB key and click on Erase.

How can I use UbuntuOne synchronization on a desktop running Linux but not Ubuntu? For example on Fedora or Linux Mint?\nIs there a way to achieve that?\n\nA: Yes, there is nothing to prevent that. It'll need to be packaged for that distro, but no other customization should be required. The software is written in Python, uses gnome-keyring by default and synchronizes desktopcouch instances (desktopcouch is also written in Python and depends on normal couchdb).

I also have it on my Android phone.  But at work and my home Linux box, I run Fedora.  I'd really like to sync all my devices, and while I will try compiling the client from Launchpad, if I can't get it working, I think I'll have to switch to the platform-agnostic Dropbox.

Somehow, this aspect of restarting the entire system just to get a functioning interface defeats the purpose of using linux.\nAny help is kindly appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: There's a good possibility that your problem is related to one I asked about earlier. I suspect that compiz is hanging. To test this, try the following the next time the problem occurs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to a virtual console (VC). For example, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. Then log in there. (To get back to your graphical environment from the VC, hit Ctrl+Alt+F7.)\n\n*Kill compiz: killall compiz. If that doesn't solve your problem, or if compiz refuses to die as happens in my situation, get tough with compiz: killall -9 compiz. Sending -9 forces compiz to end immediately without cleaning up after itself.\n\n*Compiz should automatically restart.

And what is the Gnome Shell exactly, and is it possible to use Gnome 3 without the Gnome Shell (or are they the same thing)? And if so, would it be possible to maybe develop another shell similar to Gnome Panel?\n\nA: *\n\n*Gnome 3 Release Notes: Includes \"What's New?\"\n\n*What is GNOME Shell:\nGNOME Shell is the core user interface of the GNOME desktop environment starting with version 3, that was released on April 6, 2011.(more)\n\n*GNOME Wikipedia article\n\n*A custom shell for GNOME?\nShould be possible.\n\nA: You can replace Mutter and Gnome Shell with about any other window manager and panel or dock or whatever you want.\nGNOME3 comes with a fallback mode that is based on Metacity and Gnome Panel, quite similar to GNOME2.\nIn Ubuntu 11.10 Unity will be based on Gnome3, so together with Compiz (the window manager for which Unity is a plugin) it will replace Mutter and Gnome Shell in the Ubuntu standard installation.\n\nA: \nWhat are the differences between Gnome\n  2 and Gnome 3?\n\nGNOME3 is the next major version of GNOME with lots of changes. It features a new desktop shell, libraries with new API, deprecation of a few libraries, rewritten applications like power-manager, introduction of gnome-control-center etc.\nGNOME 3 was like - \"GNOME2 was released years and years back, let's start working on the next generation GNOME desktop and hence you find GNOME3\"\n\nWhat is the Gnome Shell exactly\n\nGnome shell is a desktop shell for GNOME. It is the UI part of the desktop. Like in Windows you have a taskbar below, with a start button on the bottom left side and icons on the desktop. The thing which you encounter after you login. \nThe shell decides how your notifications should show up, how your running applications should be shown and how new applications can be launched.\n\nIs it possible to use Gnome 3 without the Gnome Shell\n\nUnity present in Oneiric will be going to be ported to Gtk3 and GNOME3 technologies. I am running Oneiric development version and get many of the GNOME3 goodies like newer applications for power management, mouse & keyboard settings. \nSo basically Oneiric can be thought of as GNOME3 - GnomeShell + Unity (some more changes under the hood which is out of scope of this explanation)\n\nAre GNOME3 and GNOME Shell the same thing?\n\nTechnically speaking, GNOME3 is a suite of technologies, applications, libraries, desktop-shell. Gnome-shell is one part of the whole GNOME3 stack\n\nWould it be possible to maybe develop another shell similar to Gnome Panel\n\nActually you can still have GNOME Panel for GNOME3. Actually it is GNOME Shell which looks and behaves like GNOME Panel. Vincent Untz blogged about it earlier\nIt would also be worth noting that desktop shell and window managers are separate things. Desktop shells are written over Window manager. KDE's Window Manager(WM) is KWin, Unity's WM is Compiz 0.9 (not Compiz 0.8) and GNOME Shell WM is Mutter (Metacity+Clutter). Gnome panel's WM is Metacity\nIn fact you can use GTK3 and use GNOME3 technologies write your own shell with the WM of your choice and it would still run. The whole Linux stack is pretty much flexible and many components are be added and removed at your will.\n", "Q: NIC stays on after shutdown Network stays on at 1Gb after shutdown...with Windows 7 it would just shutdown with the rest.\nIs there a way to make the NIC behave as in Windows 7, this is not the router's computer.\n\nA: Disable Wake on Lan in the bios.  If you have WOL enabled, then the NIC stays on so it can wake up the computer.\n", "Q: Is there a (simple) replacement for SWAT? Years and years ago, a client of mine had a dying Windows NT Server 4.0 box that was really only used as a file server.  I replaced it with SuSE and Samba (it's been so long, I no longer remember version numbers - or even years) and gave the local power user a shortcut to SWAT and instructions on how to resolve connection conflicts.\nA couple of years ago, that machine was showing its age, and I replaced it with a 64-bit, dual-core machine running Ubuntu Server 9.04.  Better in all sorts of ways - performance, simplicity of configuration, ease of setting up Samba to play nice with  legacy apps (which was a huge nightmare when I was setting up SuSE!) - except: no SWAT!\nHere's the situation: the main line-of-business app used to be a DOS/cTree database app;  that program uses DOS SHARE (and its Windows successors) to handle file/record locking.  In addition, certain utility functions (e.g. \"Close the Day\") require exclusive access to the database.   SWAT gave the power user a way to see which stations had open connections to the database, and to kick them off if they were unresponsive.\nOf course I've installed WebMin, and that gives me all the power that SWAT did - and a whole lot more, which is the problem.   I can't make a shortcut directly to the Samba / connections section, so the user has to navigate the menu... and furthermore, there are a lot of options that the user doesn't need, and that I don't necessarily want her to have.\nSo far the solution has been that she calls me when there's an issue, and I log in to WebMin and resolve it.  Also, they migrated to a much newer line-of-business app, and the old one is winding down.  Still, though - is there anything that does (just) what I'm looking for (and nothing else)?\nEdit: When I upgraded to Ubuntu 9.04, I did install SWAT, and I tried to use it.  As the package summary warns, it did bad things; not only did it rearrange entries in my smb.conf, but Samba itself had been significantly updated relative to SWAT (I seem to recall that the issues had to do with oplock handling, which broke the DOS app), and nothing really worked anymore.  Eventually I uninstalled SWAT, put my smb.conf back the way it had been, and used WebMin.\nI hear and understand the suggestion that I update to a newer version of Ubuntu: I will do that as soon as I have the opportunity.  But has SWAT been fixed?  Has anyone actually used it recently?  Because last time I tried it, it was not a good experience...\nUpdate: I upgraded last night... what a nightmare that turned out to be!  do-version-upgrade insisted on thinking I wanted to jump straight from Jaunty to Lucid (and of course insisting that I couldn't); eventually I just edited all of the sources from \"jaunty\" to \"karmic\" and did a full-upgrade.  Then when I restarted, GRUB failed to start up with an Error 15 - turns out that it had added an extra \"/boot\" to the beginning of every entry in the list.  Got that fixed; did a do-version-upgrade to Lucid... which broke HylaFax.  (The bugtrackers claim that the problem's been fixed in Lucid, but it hasn't.)  So I upgraded twice more to Natty, which fixed HylaFax... but somewhere along the way, smb.conf got trashed!  But all's well that ends well, I guess.  After all that, I didn't have the heart to try SWAT (considering the hash it made of things last time I tried it, in 2009); I'll try it in a day or two when I have time for experiments.\n\nA: Why not install swat? It's in the repositories just a sudo apt-get install swat away...\nPre-post-edit: I've just noticed that you're running an unsupported version of Ubuntu. Support for 9.04 ended late last year. You can see the support schedules here. \nThis might explain (I'm not sure if they actually shut the repos off) why you can't access the package. You should consider moving up to at least 10.04 (a Long-term Support version) and that'll get you support up to late-2015. For business deployments where you don't want to shift platform versions all the time, you should always consider LTS versions.\nSo the fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update to a supported release\n\n*Install swat\n\n*Sit back and relax.\n\n\n\nThere's quite a bit of buy-in with that plan. You have to do two major upgrades to get to 10.04 and while I'd argue it's worth it for security (it is), there is a quicker, cheatier method: just grab the packages from a later release.\nYou can see and download the package available for Lucid here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/swat\nOnce downloaded you just run:\nsudo dpkg -i downloaded-package-name.deb\n\nYou might find you need to grab dependent packages too. Dpkg will inform you of missing dependencies.\nThis is not secure. This is sometimes dangerous. It might break Samba completely. Consider that a warning. Do things properly. Do an upgrade.\n", "Q: Trying to stop a service with cron On my Ubuntu 11.04 server when I try to run\n service powernap stop\n\nas a cron job with the root user, it fails and gives me this message in syslog\n NAS CRON[10853]: (CRON) error (grandchild #10854 failed with exit status 2)\n\nand this is emailed to the root users email account\n exec: 129: stop: not found\n\nI can start and stop the powernap service from the command line so why doesn't it work from cron?\n\nA: Looks like /sbin is not in $PATH when starting it from cron.

I just installed Ubuntu. How do I set it up to allow me to ssh into it?\nRight now I get \"ssh: connect to host x.x.x.x port 22: Operation timed out\".\n\nA: Configure SSH Services or Enable SSH Server services on Ubuntu server:\nFor install or configure SSH on Ubuntu first you need to install SSH packages on Ubuntu server so you next you able to take your virtual machine on your host system via Putty or other SSH login patch...\nfirst you need to install SSH package on Ubuntu so run this command \n#sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nsome time you guyzz got some errors while installing or add this package on your server like..\nCDROM Error while install package SSH\nso for resolve this issue you can you my another shortcut available on \nMounting CDROM\nFinally after mounting this CDROM on Ubuntu server you now easly install SSH service by below command \n#sudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nThis package install now and during installation ask for yes / no ans then hit YES...\nFinally the SSH package install on Ubuntu sever then restart the SSH services by following command..\n#sudo service ssh restart\n---OR type---\n#sudo service ssh start\n\nThen BooM your SSH have install and start SuccessFully...\nnow open Putty from your local host machine and type your VM IP there \nPutty Login\nAnd BOOM you able to login your VM server trough host machine Putty SSH...\n\nA: sudo apt update\nsudo apt install ssh\nsudo ufw allow 22      # if you have ufw running, but it doesn't hurt to run.\n\nThat's the very minimum. It allows unlimited failed password attempts on a known port. Direct root-login is disabled (you can still su and sudo once logged in). If your username and password are guessable and the Internet can see the server, somebody will eventually break in.\nI can't stress this enough: You need to harden the default setup. You essentially trade convenience for the likelihood of being hacked but I've gone through several suggestions on my blog. At the very least, I'd suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Key-based logins. Disable password logins.\n\n*Move it off port 22. Use something crazy-high, in the 20000-60000 range.\n\n*Use fail2ban to ban people who do find it and try to brute it.\n\n\nIt'll take you less than 10 minutes and they take youfrom a 1/10000 chance of being broken in-to a probability so small, there isn't enough paper in the world to write its fraction. All assuming you're careful with your key, it has a passphrase of its own and you don't trumpet your credentials all over the net.\nIn terms of accessing this SSH server from the Internet, you may be facing local networking obstacles. If the computer is behind a NAT router (eg most home networks) without direct incoming access from the internet, you may need to look at port forwarding. Obviously if you don't need access outside the network, skipping this step will aide network security.\n\nA: I just wanted to add that you need to make sure you have picked the correct WAN interface, if your modem/router support multiple WAN interfaces.\nI have a Billion BiPAC 7800NXL which has 3 possible WAN ports (DSL, ETH and 3G). When you create a new forwards (called a \"Virtual Server\" in this router), the 7800NXL always defaults to the DSL WAN interface, even though I only use the Ethernet WAN interface.\nI had all the ports set up correctly, but my forward was configured to use DSL, so it didn't work. As soon as I created a new forward for the ETH WAN interface,  it worked.\n\nA: Installing the openssh-server package which is available from the Software Center will provide the server element to allow a client such as another ubuntu desktop to achieve a secure connection to a 'server' such as your VM.\nThe ubuntu community has an excellent guide about SSH, OpenSSH-Server and how to configure it in a secure manner.\n", "Q: Fast and reliable way to move directories from one HDD to another I'm looking for a fast and reliable way to move some chosen directories from one HDD to another.\nThe case is as follows. I'm getting a new desktop system which will replace my old desktop. I want to migrate a couple of directories from the old system to the new system and I'm quite concerned about the integrity of the data. The amount of data I want to migrate is >300 GB. This might take a while to move even over 1000 Mbit/s Ethernet, so I figure the fastest way is to unplug the HDD of the old desktop (it's connected via SATA) and plug it into the new system and cp the data to the new system's HDD.\nMy question: Is this the best and most reliable way to proceed? If not, how should I proceed? Maybe I'm better off using rsync? I would also want to know how any solution handles permissions and how it preserves the integrity of the data.\n\nA: I'd personally trust rsync to do the job (with -arvx flags - archive, recursive, verbose and one-filesystem) but if you need something extra:\nsha256sum <(find ./original_path/ -type f -exec sha256sum {} \\; | sort) | cut -d' ' -f1\n# Should output something like:\n# dbda116eaa459cee10b25765202c37d40b9371df52afb2ad202b13327760b251\n\n# copy your files to ./new_path/\n# Something like: rsync -arvx ./original_path/ ./new_path/\n\nsha256sum <(find ./new_path/ -type f -exec sha256sum {} \\; | sort) | cut -d' ' -f1\n# Should also output:\n# dbda116eaa459cee10b25765202c37d40b9371df52afb2ad202b13327760b251\n\nIf you're not happy with rsync, you could always tar up the files and extract them in the new location.

The instructions in help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring recommend disabling password authentication so that \"it will only be possible to connect from computers you have specifically approved\".  But they don't say how to specifically approve a computer.  How do I do that?\n\nA: On each user you want to have access to the server, run in a terminal:\nssh-keygen\nssh-copy-id <username>@<serverIPorDNSname>\n\nIt will ask you where to save it, the default is just fine. It will ask you to enter a passphrase. This is to encrypt the key just in case the computer is stolen or compromised. If you do not want a passphrase, you leave both passphrase prompts blank.\nThe first command creates a ssh key for the current the user it is run on. The second command ssh's into the server and adds the the current user's key to the server's list of who is allowed to login. Since ssh-copy-id is using ssh, you will need to do this before you disable password logins.\nSSH keys are two matching halves. One half is told to everyone, the other is kept secret. Using a mathematical algorithm, the public half can be used to decrypt data encrypted with the private key. If data decrypts successfully with the public key, you know beyond a doubt that it was the private half of the key that encrypted it. So when you login with a ssh key, the client sends a message (encrypted using the private key) that basically says \"let me in\". The server checks using the public key and if the public key is in the list of allowed computers the login is successful.\nssh-copy-id is (using ssh) copying the public half to the servers list of what keys are allowed to login (this list is stored at /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys2, or in the case of root at /root/.ssh/authorized_keys2). If you already disabled password authentication, you can still add a computer. You just have to copy the public key (at /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on a client computer) to something like a USB stick and then add the contents of id_rsa.pub to the end of the /home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys2 file on the server. (You could do this by running command like cat /media/USB/stick/path/to/id_rsa.pub >>/home/<username>/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the server.)\n\nA: Iptables\nIf the computers have a certain ip-range you could use iptables to control access. Iptables are part of the kernel. You can control them in the file /etc/iptables\n# from /etc/iptables\n*filter\n:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n:RH-Firewall-1-INPUT - [0:0]\n-A INPUT -j RH-Firewall-1-INPUT\n-A FORWARD -j RH-Firewall-1-INPUT\n#\n# loopback device\n#\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n#\n# all connections already established (started outgoing from my machine)\n#\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n#\n# but SSH - restricted\n#\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 --source 138.232.0.0/255.255.0.0 -j ACCEPT\n#\n# block all others (without answering - thus nobody is able to scan the network)\n#\n-A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -j DROP\nCOMMIT\n\nThe interesting line is this one:\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 --source 111.111.0.0/255.255.0.0 -j ACCEPT\n\nProt 22 is the default ssh port. If it's different with you machine, change it. 111.111.0.0/255.255.0.0 -j ACCEPT means it accepts all connections coming from '111.111.foo.bar' with 'foo' and 'bar' being any 3 digits.\n", "Q: How to fix error in pdf2djvu: \"Bogus memory allocation size\" I am using pdf2djvu to convert a pdf file into a djvu file, but got this error while trying to convert either bundled or indirect multi-page djvu file:\n$ pdf2djvu 1.pdf -o 1.djvu\n1.pdf:\n- page #1 -> #1\nBogus memory allocation size\n\n$ pdf2djvu 1.pdf -i 1.djvu\n1.pdf:\n- page #1 -> #1\nBogus memory allocation size\n\nI was wondering what is wrong here and how I shall fix the problem?

So is it normal or a memory leak problem?\nFor example, I now open 16 text files, each about 1~2KB, but the memory gedit takes is 100Mib.\nThanks and regards!\n\nA: It could be a memory leak.  It could also be creating an undo storage area or any number of other minor things that no one thinks of when using a text editor, like syntax highlighting by extension for example.

I want the list of files installed by 'make install' and the list of files installed by the .deb package to be the same)\n\nA: You can list the contents of a deb file by running\ndpkg-deb --contents package.deb\n\ndpkg-deb can show a whole lot of information about a deb package. You can see the other options by running dpkg-deb --help.\nUnfortunately, you can't determine what files a Makefile will install. However, you can install to a temporary directory by setting the DESTDIR variable. Note that this works well mainly on Makefiles generated by autotools ie. the ./configure script. For example:\ncd sourcecode-1.2\n./configure --prefix=/usr           #Just the usual compiling stuff\nmake\nmkdir /tmp/installedfiles           #Create a temporary directory for the files\nmake DESTDIR=/tmp/installedfiles install\n\nThat last make line will install the files in /tmp/installedfiles. You can then see the files that would be created, although those files and directories will all be relative to the prefix specified in the configure script. In other words, /tmp/installedfiles/bin/mainprogram would be installed as /usr/bin/mainprogram.\nI hope I answered your question :)\n\nA: A deb file is an archive file which you can extract to see its contents.\nFrom Wikipedia\n\nSince Debian 0.93, a deb file is\n  implemented as an ar archive.\n  Canonical contents of this archive are\n  three files:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*debian-binary: deb format version    number.

As far as I know, bumblebee is the most fruitful effort to hotswitch gpu's.\n\nA: \nIf I want to use Ubuntu 11.04, then can I switch between the two GPU's\n  on-the-fly in a similar way as Windows 7 - if yes, how do I do this?\n\nThe EeePC-1015PN is a corner case of hybrid graphics. As you know this Laptop defaults to nvidia - only mode in Linux (the intel GPU is not visible via lspci) but via sending a specific acpi-call you can set the VGA Mode for the next boot cycle manually.  \nThis laptop has a rather unusual hybird setup. The nvidia chip is directly wired to the display device and hdmi port (most muxless hybrid setups are build without this feature) allowing this model to switch the GPU modes manually or use a dual gpu mode (there is no bios change required to set the gpu mode)\nAvailable VGA Modes are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel only Mode (the nvidia chip is powered off and not visible via lspci)\n\n*Nvidia only Mode (the intel chip is not visible via lspci)\n\n*Optimus Mode (both chips are visible via lspci => bumblebee works only in this mode)\n\n\nWe are discussing this model since some time in a ubuntuforums thread (1), and prepared some helper scripts to set the VGA Mode for this model. To get bumblebee working, you need to install the eee1015pn-acpitools package first. Those scripts allow you to manage the VGA Modes of this model.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mtron/eee1015pn\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install build-essential eee1015pn-acpitools\n\nStart the 'VGA-Selector' gui and set the VGA Mode for the next boot to \"Optimus\" \n\nTo use Optimus as default GPU mode, click on the 'Set Default GPU' button in the Settings Window. Also disable the auto-power down of the nvidia chip in optimus mode. The 'bbswitch' daemon shipped with bumblebee takes control over the power state of the nvidia gpu.  \n\nNow reboot and your laptop should be in Optimus mode. \ninstall bumblebee via it's ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade \nsudo apt-get install bumblebee\nsudo usermod -a -G bumblebee $USER\n\nTo test if the nvidia gpu works try to start an application by prefixing it with optirun. e.g.\nglxspheres will use the intel gpu to draw the benchmark \noptirun glxspheres will use the nvidia GPU\nLimitations of bumblebee:\n\n\n*\n\n*Performance of the nvidia chip via bumblebee is bad. glxsperes runs 3 times slower via bumblebee (compared to nvidia only Mode) \n\n*HDMI port is not usable via bumblebee (the nvidia chip is directly wired to the HDMI port). \n\n*no video acceleration. va-api is not supported on the intel GMA3150, and the nvidia vdpau technique is not useable via bumblebee\n\n\n\nwhat progress is being made towards achieving the same capability as\n  Windows 7?\n\nThe bumblebee Project is just a temporary hack for hybrid-graphics on Linux. Quoting from Ubuntu's hybrid-graphics support strategy:\n\nThe kernel DRM work required for sharing GPU objects is not too\n  complicated, according to Airlie. (2)\nThe biggest blocker at the moment is that the X server has limitations\n  which prevent using GPU’s without attaching a screen to them. Airlie\n  proposed changes to the X server on the xorg-devel mailing list (3),\n  and he has been doing some work on this area (4).\nUpstream (NVIDIA/AMD) Schedule: Once the X server re-architecting is\n  finished and released, the drivers just need to add support for the\n  new ABI in order to work. Highly dependant on when the actual X server\n  release is, of course. Aaron Plattner from NVIDIA has already showed\n  interest in helping with the redesign work (5), so it’s likely that at\n  least NVIDIA has support for it right from the start.\n\nSo a real solution will take some time, but people are working on it. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1677780\n\n*http://airlied.livejournal.com/71734.html\n\n*http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-devel/2011-March/020557.html\n\n*http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/xserver/log/?h=drvmodelv2-wip\n\n*http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-devel/2011-April/021225.html\n", "Q: What can I use to install a package file with dependency from command line?

Depending on the type of the connection, you may have to switch tabs.\n\n*In the Editing dialog, switch to the IPv4 Settings tab (or the IPv6 Settings tab if you're using IPv6).\n\n*Leave it set at Automatic (DHCP). Simply fill in the Additional search domains field with a comma-separated list of domains, and click Save.\n\n*You may need to disconnect and reconnect.\n\n\nA: Here is a complete solution that works at least with 12.04:\nsudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf\n# add next line (alternatively you can use append instead of prepend)\nprepend domain-name \"example.com other.example.com\";\n# before: request subnet-mask...\n\n(you can also use sudo -e /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf if you trust the default editor)\nIf you're on any sort of \"professional\" network that has its own DNS servers and/or if you've setup your own DNS service(s) on said network and also on your workstation, then, you might also want to comment-out this line:\n# domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,\n\n--Doing so lets you use your own domain-name-servers, enabling your personalized domain-search to work much more smoothly, which is probably better than using whatever somebody else has setup for you.  E.G.: I'm on the network 192.168.10.0; the company has name server 192.168.10.10 and 192.168.10.11 -- but, I run my own name server with a more extensive list of names on 192.168.10.20 (which will forward to 192.168.10.10 and .11 as needed). All my network configurations declare 192.168.10.20 and 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (the Google name servers), but, DHCP will tend to override that preference, feeding me 192.168.10.10 as the default server. In the end... not requesting those aspects from DHCP makes for a much better network life.\nNow restart the networking:\nsudo service networking restart\n\n(you can also use sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart with old rc scripts)\n\nA: Sorin's answer and Ib33X's answer are correct if you are not using the Network Manager. If you are using the Network Manager, then it appears that the Network Manager completely controls generation of the resolv.conf file (which is ultimately what the networking system uses for dns lookups). Changing the dhcpclient.conf is ineffective.\nHowever, there is an (imperfect) solution if you are using the Network Manager:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make note of the DNS servers setup by DHCP by inspecting the resolve.conf file:\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\n\n*Right-click on the Network Manager indicator and select Edit Connections...\n\n*Select the connection you want to adjust, and click Edit. Depending on the type of the connection, you may have to switch tabs.\n\n*In the Editing dialog, switch to the IPv4 Settings tab (or the IPv6 Settings tab if you're using IPv6).\n\n*Change the Method from Automatic (DHCP) to Automatic (DHCP) addresses only.\n\n*Copy the DNS servers you saved in step #1 into the DSN servers text box (sue commas to separate multiple entries).\n\n*Enter each of the domain names to search by into the Search domains text box.\n\n*Click Save...\n\n*Disconnect and reconnect the connection.\n\n\nThe downsides of this approach is that you must specify both the DNS servers and the search domain names. It isn't possible to still pull the DNS server addresses from DHCP.  \nAdditionally, the settings must be changed for each connection. I don't know of any way of changing the settings for all connections. However, this is often an advantage. For example, you might want different settings for your home wireless network and your work wireless network.\n\nA: in ubuntu 11.10 edit file /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and add this line\nappend domain-name \"domain.com\";\n\nThen restart your network.\n/etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n\nA: Try below in this case when users gets ip address from dhcp server it gets mulitple dns servers\n/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf:\nddns-update-style none;\nignore client-updates;\nauthoritative;\ndefault-lease-time 1209600;\nmax-lease-time 1814400;\noption local-wpad code 252 = text;\n--- Domain name servers, tells the clients which DNS servers to use.\noption domain-name-servers 10.0.0.15, 8.8.8.8, 192.168.1.1;\noption time-offset 0\n", "Q: How to find the type of the file without using extension I ask this question for running an find command.\nI want to list all mp3(lets say) using the find command.How to do this without having an extension.\n\nA: This will do it for almost all audio files.

Anyone have any idea?\nThanks.\n\nA: There's an easy to use GUI called \"arandr\" for changing your monitor settings. It's a GUI frontend for the xrandr command line utility.\nYou can use the xrandr utility from command line to switch back and forth between single and dual screen. In my zshrc (or your Bash login file if you use Bash) I have defined the 'single()' and 'dual()' functions for this.\nYour outputs will probably be different - I have one HDMI and one VGA - look for an xrandr tutorial for more detail. In this example, the VGA output is my primary monitor, and the HDMI monitor is to the right of my primary monitor.\n# set dual monitors\ndual () {\n    xrandr --output VGA-0 --primary --left-of HDMI-0 --output HDMI-0 --auto\n}\n\n# set single monitor\nsingle () {\n    xrandr --output HDMI-0 --off\n}\n\nI like this because at any point I simply send the single or dual command to my terminal and turn my second monitor on and off.\n\nA: Did you try to configure xorg.conf with Xinerama? You need to enable Xinerama setting it to \"true\" in the xorg.conf file. By default it will be attributed one workspace to each monitor and you can switch the focus pressing mod-{w,e,r}.

I've got some info on the website of Webup8 for adding a ppa from Libreoffice to the system (11.04) in order to get the latest, more stable version, of LibreOffice. \nI've done that, and I'm pleased with the outcome. But I gave this as a tip on the Dutch Forum, and they received it as highly dangerous and risky. \nI stay within logics: a new version (read an updated version) of LibreOffice (3.3.3) can't be so unstable that Ubuntu (the OS itself) will crash or do some strange things. (?)\nI compare it with Windows: there you have the same issue with upgrading/ updating LibreOffice regardless what it can do with Windows itself. Or am I wrong with this comparison? \nI see that it is for people whom use the office package professionally, as a more reliable way for getting a more stable version of Liberoffice. \nHow is your point of view for this matter?\n\nA: In this case you can see that the uploads to this PPA are done by Björn Michaelsen, who is also the maintainer of LibreOffice in Ubuntu itself, which means it's not just some random guy uploading packages, you know it's someone who probably knows what they're doing.\nPersonally I feel safe using this PPA, it's used by a bunch of people and I haven't had problems with it so far. \nHowever it is labeled as \"test builds and backports\", so I would use it for my own personal gear, but I wouldn't deploy it in production if I had to support desktop machines or if I was installing Ubuntu for a new user as even experienced developers can make mistakes in a PPA and probably doesn't get as much testing/exposure as the released version.\n\nA: The LibreOffice PPA falls into the category of safe. It is provided by an official source, and it is only updated when a new stable release comes to the table. As The Evil Phoenix pointed out, PPAs are a case of \"own risk\", so you should still be careful with other PPAs especially, and careful with this one that it does not break any packages by being out of sync with something (as can happen when using newer software on systems that have not been updated to match the software).\nLong story short though, this PPA is safe for use on a stable system.\n\nA: No PPA can be confirmed 100% safe for use or not.  PPAs are a use-at-your-own-risk solution, but most times they're generally safe (but there could be other system issues on your end that can cause PPA'd software to break).\n", "Q: Where can I find a Unity configuration file? I was wondering if someone can tell me where are the main Unity configuration files, at least the file that you can graphically configure through CCSM. I'm wanting to edit the dash size and the panel colour, but I didn't find where to do it.\n\nA: Unity and Compiz are using GConf to store their settings.  GConf is a configuration store that provides an API for applications to read and write configuration information and receive notifications when configuration items change.  The configuration data is saved under ~/.gconf, but modifications should only be made through the GConf daemon.\nYou can modify the Unity settings directly using gconf-editor and browsing to /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options.  You will notice that Unity responds to changes instantly, the same as CCSM.\nIf you want a command line tool to modify these settings, use gconftool-2.  For example, to reduce the launcher icon size I can do:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/icon_size --type int 32\n\n\nA: You cannot change the colour or size of the Dash (the thing you open from the ubuntu-logo). If you want to change the launcher size, you can use ccsm for that.\n", "Q: Would it be safe to install the 11.10 Unity version in 11.04 after adding the GNOME 3 PPA? I was thinking of installing GNOME 3 in a regular Natty, but I would like to have the option to switch to Unity available. Since building Gnome Shell turned out being quite hard a task, I was considering installing Unity 4.x, the Oneiric version based on GNOME 3, via one of the avilable sources, such as Launchpad. Would this be possibile and safe? Thanks for your advice!\n\nA: While this might be possible, I would suggest that you rather just upgrade to 11.10. It would not be worth the trouble (and risk of breakage) to compile Unity 4.x on 11.04, while also trying to upgrade to GNOME3 (which will itself make your 11.04 system much closer to instability).\n", "Q: Is there a better pdf to text converter than pdftotext?

And if not, is there another pdf to text utility that can do this?\n\nA: If you have a Google account, you can use Google Docs to upload the PDF and transform it into editable text.\n\nA: You could try ebook-convert from Calibre.\nIf anything, I'd say it errs in the other direction: too many line breaks. \nAnother thing I'd definitely consider though is converting to HTML using pdfreflow, and then convert the HTML to TXT.\n\nA: As a fan of open source (and automation) I hate to say this, but the best results I just got (on quite a large, complex PDF) were to open it in Adobe Reader, then choose File|Save As Text.\n(I am pre-processing for text analysis experiments, not as a reader, but I think my first and second choice would be the same.)\nI've been comparing the output side-by-side. My second choice is ebook-convert.\nAdobe: left in FF for page breaks, left in page numbers, hasn't converted headings/paragraphs to single lines, but it has fixed hyphens. Junk that was hidden in the PDF did not get output. Correctly got the big capitals at start of sections, e.g. \"The\", not \"T he\" or even \"T   he\".\nebook-convert: Left in page numbers, and some hidden junk in header/footer (but no FFs). Converts most paragraphs to be single lines. The ones it missed are double-spaced though! Bullets don't always line up with the text. Correctly got \"The\" at the start of the chapter.\npdftotext (without --layout): Not bad, bullets line up, but header/footer noise. FFs are in there. Hyphens removed. Worst for start of chapter big letters: \"T\\n\\nhe\".\npdftotext (with --layout): Similar, but more indents. \"T  he\" for start of chapter.\npdftohtml >> pdfreflow >> htmltotext: It removed page numbers, but still junk in header/footer. \"T he\" for start of chapter. Hyphens removed. (It uses multiple lines per paragraph, yet they are not the same line breaks as in the other versions!)\n\nA: If you are using pdftotext you can use the -layout flag to preserve the layout of the text on the pages in your input pdf file:\npdftotext -layout input.pdf output.txt\n\n\nA: I also tried pypdf and compared it against pdftotext on two documents. It had more linebreaks and split some section names (REFERENCES was R E F E R E N C E S). \npdf2txt did output complete garbage.\nI often use pdfBox (java) if pdftotext screws up the output. You  might give it a try.\n", "Q: The Fn keys on my HP dv6t are mapped all wrong I've tried going through the keyboard fixing process documented with that udev README file (as described here), but I get confused pretty much right off the bat. I'm using that \"/lib/udev/keymap\" tool to diagnose what's going on, but the output I get is weird and the instructions don't really make clear what it is that I should do.\nThe problem I'm having on this laptop is that the Fn keys all (or mostly) seem to behave as if the Fn key is pressed.  That is, the F6 key for example is also the \"Previous Song\" key when used with the Fn meta key on the keyboard, or at least that's what it's supposed to be.  Well, for me, if I just hit \"F6\", key is mapped to \"previoussong\".  If I hit my Fn key, let it go, and then press \"F6\", then it comes through as F6.\nFor some of the keys, instead of that, a single keypress is reported as two keys: \"leftmeta\" with a scan code of 0xDB, and then the \"Fn\" key. So, when I press F1 (which is not labeled as having an Fn alternate meaning), I get what looks like two separate events.\nFinally, for the F2 and F3 keys, labeled as being for screen brightness controls, I get no key events whatsoever if I don't precede them with a press and release of the Fn meta key.  They do, however, show me the brightness adjustment growler message, though they don't actually seem to have any effect on the display.\nWhat do I need to look at in order to get the keyboard to stop being so weird?\n(Again, the laptop is a brand new HP dv6t \"quad edition\" with a US keyboard, and I'm running 11.04.)\nEdit — I've just now started forming a theory that the keyboard might be working as designed, which would be another reason for me to recommend against these things.\n\nA: Does your computer allow you to switch the fn key row from being the F1-12 keys or the media keys? I know my computer allows this, the way I can change this setting is by going into the BIOS and selecting the option from there. I'm not sure if that is what your computer is doing though.\n\nA: You can search for \"keyboard\" in the Unity Dash and click on the Keyboard icon, then on the window opened go to the Layouts Tab and there you can choose a new layout and set what keyboard model is yours. By the description I think you need to change your keyboard model, not the layout.\n", "Q: Razer DeathAdder mouse going nuts I'm using ubuntu 11.04 and a Razer DeathAdder mouse. I've used the mouse in other distros perfectly but now it happens that randomly after some time it will start to act buggy and click things by itself, I have to unplug it and plug it back. Any idea what could be going wrong?\n\nA: I've never had a problem with my mouse randomly clicking things.  But I have had similar problems with scrolling.  So it sounds like unplugging and plugging it back in is a very common fix.  It sounds like a common bug.\n\nA: This is very likely a driver issue, I have similar problems with my Cyborg R.A.T. I am not familiar with your mouse, but you might want to check the manufacturer's website (or Google) for Ubuntu drivers.\n", "Q: Is there a hotkey to switch between tabs in the default terminal app?

Hi I am learning how to manage and set up a ubuntu linux server. I'm reading a book called beginning ubuntu lts server administration.\nIt suggests setting up the hard drive manually and also gives an example set up. The book is based on 8.04 and I am using 10.04, so my question: is this example set up still valid or can it be improved? Given that the ext4 filesystem is more popular now for example.\nHere is a screenshot of the example setup:\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 10.04 changes two important things related to the choice of filesystem types and layout: GRUB 2 and ext4.\nWhen Ubuntu's default filesystem was ext3, it made some sense to look for alternatives, because ext3 is pretty reliable and flexible, but somewhat slow. Ext4 is perceptibly faster. Barring special requirements, I would recommend ext4 over the alternatives (ext2, ext3, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS, ZFS, Btrfs). Ext4 sees wider use, so it gets more testing and more optimization on typical Linux platforms. Ext4 has generally better tool support (data recovery, resizing, etc.) under Linux, as well (most ext2/ext3 tools were quickly adapted for ext4). The main contenders now are ZFS and Btrfs; but ZFS isn't well-integrated into Linux and Btrfs isn't quite ready for production use yet.\nWikipedia has a comparison of filesystems. Look there if there's a feature that really matters to you and that ext4 doesn't have. If at all in doubt, pick ext4.\nWhat GRUB 2 changes is primarily the need to have a separate /boot partition. This is higher-maintenance, and no longer has any benefit unless you have old hardware where the BIOS can't access the whole disk (old, as in older than Ubuntu at any rate). GRUB 2 can be installed on LVM.\nSo just keep it simple:\n/      LVM    ext4     50GB\nswap   LVM    swap     varies\n/home  LVM    ext4     everything else\n\nA separate /var doesn't do much for you. Separating out specific pieces of /var (e.g. /var/log, /var/mail) can make sense if that piece gets a lot of action (e.g. a busy mail server).\nHow much swap to put depends on what you're going to use the machine for. On a server with many users with shell access, be generous since there'll be a lot of idle applications. On a dedicated web server, you aren't going to be swapping much. There's a historical recommendation of 2*RAM; the reason for that recommendation is wrong but the figure isn't stupid.\n", "Q: no application icons (quicksynergy or florence) in \"Indicator Applet Complete\" i'm running ubuntu 11.04 classic. \nin previous versions of ubuntu i had florence or quick energy staying in the indicator applet after i close or minimmize them. but now only drop box shows up. \nas a result, when i minimize florence, it runs in the background but there is no way to open it since there is no icon in the applet.\nnot sure how to even approach the problem. i hope i don't have to reinstal the system to find out which application broke the icons.\nany suggestions?\n\nA: You can whitelist all icons in tray, with\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\n\nIt does not work for all apps, for example for KeePassX that I use.

It's also included in the default install of Ubuntu.\nNo idea if it'll automatically create reminders. I'm sure there's something you could hack together (a little script that talked to Evolution) if it doesn't do it all for you.\n\nA: This is an old question, but you might be looking for something like gcalcli.

I know Ubuntu is basically Debian, and I know Ubuntu releases every 6 months, Debian every 2 years. However, I want to know more the advanced differences between Ubuntu server and Debian. If they have the same base, what is the difference between them?\n\nA: Like Enzotib mentioned in his answer, Debian uses a SystemV style init, while Ubuntu uses upstart. Since servers aren't restarted very often (or at least they shouldn't be :P), the init system doesn't really matter. That's about where the differences end.\nMost of Ubuntu's packages are just recompiled from Debian, so the software defaults (like the Apache web server configuration) are identical. I have two servers, one running Ubuntu Server 11.04 and one running Debian 6.0 and there hasn't been a single instance where I couldn't just copy a configuration file between them and have it work correctly.\n\nA: Some of the differences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debian uses SystemV style init, and inittab;\nUbuntu uses Upstart\n\n*Debian has root account enabled by default, but can be configured to use sudo;\nUbuntu uses sudo and has no root account enabled\n\n*Debian has a release cycle not predefined;\nUbuntu has a release cycle of six months (two years for LTS)\n\n*Debian has a rolling unstable release, called sid;\nUbuntu has nothing similar\n\n*Debian has a testing release that is destined to become the next stable;\nUbuntu has a development release, initially based on sid that becomes the stable\n\n*Debian uses gnome2/metacity by default;\nUbuntu uses gnome2/compiz+unity by default;\n\n*Debian is released for several architectures (more than every other distro);\nUbuntu essentially only for x86, ARM and amd64\n\n\nthis is what comes to my mind, something might be inexact or wrong, and I might have missed something big. I wait to see other answers.\nEdit\nmissed the word \"server\" in the title: \nDebian has not a server version, you get a so called server not installing a desktop environment.\n\nA: The difference is that there's an ubuntu server but not a debian server.\nUbuntu server comes with a variety of packages predefined by the maintainers, debian let these choices to its administrator. \nAs far as I Know there's no special patches to the kernel made by canonical to the default kernel.\n", "Q: How do I install the Perforce client?

How can I start Nautilus's \"File Operations\" GUI from the command line?\n\nMy goal is to include this in a Nautilus script.\n\nA: The short answer is, you can't. Nautilus is not built to allow that sort of thing and you can go through the source code of nautilus and look at the file copy/move sections to see how it works.\nPart of this lack of integration was the motivation behind the progress indicator design. It would replace the nautilus progress window and several other progress inconsistencies and allow multiple programs to show their progress to the user in the same way:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ayatana/ProgressIndication\nMore work and advocacy for these new designs would help, allowing integration of all sorts of tools.\n\nA: From a discussion in irc://irc.gnome.org#nautilus, I can say that the current version of Nautilus do not expose methods for file operation on D-Bus, but version 3.0 will do, so the answer should be\n\nyou can't, now, but you will in the future\n\n\nA: Apparently this is now supported; at least the following seems to work under 12.04:\nqdbus org.gnome.Nautilus /org/gnome/Nautilus org.gnome.Nautilus.FileOperations.CopyFile \"file:///source/directory\" \"*\" \"file:///destination/directory\" \"\"\n\nwhere /source/directory is the absolute path to your source directory, * is the glob for file[s] to copy, /destination/directory is your destination directory and the last \"\" is for destination file name. Note that you need to have the last one there even if it's empty as in here, to fulfill the method signature. Also, if you specify a target name and have multiple source files, they'll all get copied to that one destination file, giving an overwrite prompt for each file after the first one (which may or may not be what you want).\n", "Q: Is there a binary package for php5-sqlite3 with fts3 enabled? I would like to have PHP with SQlite with FTS3 extension enabled, as noted in Manual:SQLite - MediaWiki. \nI'm somewhat confused about FTS3 support in the default Ubuntu packages;  \nfrom Bug #229003 in sqlite3 (Ubuntu): “Build sqlite3 with fts3 fulltext search ”:\n\nIt would be great if ubuntu can ship with enabled fts3 too. \n\nThat bug seems to have been fixed in karmic, so from Issue 448 - clementine-player - Clementine 0.4 does not start - A cross-platform music player based on Amarok 1.4 - Google Project Hosting:\n\nThat's strange - all of Ubuntu's sqlite3 packages have FTS3 enabled, even 3.6.23... \n\n... so all should be fine - however, that doesn't seem to be the case for php5-sqlite package.. \nSo, it seems,  that in order to enable FTS3 for PHP, I'd have to re-build SQlite (and possibly PHP) from source -  but I was hoping there's a package-like way to use precompiled binaries (as I'd like to make an install suggestion to an administrator of a server, and compiling from source will be too troublesome). Is there?\nThanks in advance for any suggestions,\nCheers!\n\nA: Well, I got an answer at LInux: How to install FTS3 (for sqlite3) in PHP? - Stack Overflow - and I guess, the answer is, there is no such binary package; things have to be compiled from source.\n", "Q: What do the different Boot Options mean? (i.e. acpi=off, noapic, nolapic, etc) I've been having issues installing 11.04 on my new laptop, the solution was to enable any of these boot options:\n\n\n*\n\n*acpi=off\n\n*noapic\n\n*nolapic\nBut, what do these options actually do?\nWhat sort of problems are there in enabling them?\ni.e. can they cause hardware problems (like fans not running causing system overheating).\n\nA: In general, such boot parameters are not needed unless there is a problem with your BIOS and how it handles these standards, or it just might be old enough where these standards were not fully implemented properly.\nACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard for handling power management. Older systems may not support ACPI full, so sometimes it helps to give the kernel a hint to not use it. \"acpi=off\"\nAPIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is a kind of feature found on newer systems. The \"local\" version is called \"LAPIC\". What this controller can do is be set up to generate and handle interrupts, a signal the hardware uses to pass messages. Again, some implementations of APIC can have problems on older system, and so it is useful to disable it. \"noapic\" and \"nolapic\".\nSometimes the APIC is working, but it slows things down by getting in the middle of messages being passed around. This can mess with audio and video processing, for example. Folks might disable it for that reason as well.\n\nA: no problem for the hardware I think, as setting those functions off doesn't actually turn them off, but sets who implements them - 'off' in bios would mean that would be the kernel\nwhat actually impacts the cooling fans I think was 'noapm' or 'apm=off' (advanced power management), but turning that off would mean cooling fans work in full speed all the time, as the 'advanced' part is actually slowing them down when system cool enough\nsetting those things permanently was doen by writing them in the grub file in /etc/default (usually) and after that rebuilding grub with 'update-grub' or 'grub-mkconfig' (grub2 instead of grub might be needed sometimes) depending on the system\ngenerally it goes like 'the smaller the laptop - the bigger probability it will need them and more of them' ;)\npnpbios=off might also help (it's for plug n play)\n", "Q: Flash appears to be missing or broken in all browsers In Firefox and Chrome (both latest stable, Ubuntu 11.04), flash is unavailable.

Bookmark opened directories one by one is not what I ask for. Thanks and regards!\n\nA: Nautilus does not support this functionality. What you might want to do is use session saving, or write a script to have nautilus open those directories by default.\nYou could replace nautilus with this script in your start up applications.

There are known issues that won't allow other programs (such as Access) to work properly both in Wine or PlayOnLinux.\nThere are several versions of MS Office that are known to work without a hassle using PlayOnLinux and/or Wine.\nInformation on how to install these applications in PlayOnLinux and or Wine can be gathered on the net, examples are provided as follows:\nPlayOnLinux:\nhttp://www.wine-reviews.net/wine-reviews/playonlinux/install-ms-office2007-on-ubuntu-using-playonlinux.html\nOffice 2007 Installed in Ubuntu Screenshot:\n\nWine:\nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?appId=31\nOffice 2007 Installer:\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: I use LibreOffice on my netbook and Microsoft Office 2007 at work and have therefore some experience in transferring files back and forth. \nLibreOffice reads and writes doc, xls and ppt files and even the docx, xlsx and pptx formats. Do not expect perfect compatibility however. Simple stuff without complex features transfers OK, but there are limits, especially in fonts. \nFor instance MS Office replaces the pretty Ubuntu font with an ugly one that it believes to be a close match. More serious problems happen  with fonts in PowerPoint. Slides may turn out distorted in LibreOffice with text no longer fitting in the title bar or in the slide. Can be corrected, but not if you are in a hurry to start your presentation...\n\nA: ALthough it has some compatibility with basic documents, more complex MS Office documents don't render correctly, and if changed, will not render correctly on MS Office either. This is especially true with OOXML. ALthough LibreOffice do plan to add more compatibility in the future, many in the project are reluctant to do so, because of (possible) patent issues and of the headache it will bring to support another prorietary format.\nYour best bet is Office 2007 via wine. DO NOT install as root; there is simply no need. just go into winecfg and set 'riched20' to native then builtin (MSOffice comes with it's own modified version of this system file), install the corefonts package, then install Office as you would on Windows.\n\nA: Yes, LibreOffice, or previously OpenOffice.org, can read and write word documents and excel worksheets.\n\nA: LibreOffice is installed by default and will do it.\nAlternatively you can install Microsoft Office via wine, that is supported pretty well.\n\nA: Recently I discovered a major shortcoming in LibreOffice's implementation of .docx when I was working on a file that recorded changes. After I had saved my changes in LibreOffice I closed it before later coming back to it. The file was garbled and I thought that all of my hours of work had been lost. Eventually in desperation I tried the file on a Windows computer and opened it in MS Word. The file was perfectly fine. So it seems LibreOffice, which had never failed me before, can't even open all of the files it saves.\nBut my point is that LibreOffice is usually compatible with MS Office file types, but not completely.\n\nA: The important point here is that you need to separate the office suite, such as OpenOffice or LibreOffice, from the operating system. A litthe bit like separating Microsoft Office from Microsoft Windows. \nUbuntu, as an operating system (OS), will not open any document file by itself. What will open documents will be the office suite or software that you will use. Ubuntu comes with OpenOffice or LibreOffice, which should open \"Most\" of MS Office documents, although not perfectly. If you use other software, you r mileage will vary, of course. \nIf you are considering using Ubuntu or Linux in general, and opening Office document is an important point for you, you should look at the different office suites available, rather than the actual distributions themselves. You may also see that some distributions will offer you more choice for office suites than others. \nDistroWatch is perhaps a good starting point for selecting a distribution.\nI realize this will not answer your question as such, but should help you better orient your search/quest for solution to your question.\nJF\n\nA: Yes you can, but yu sometimes can have issues with the closed document format that uses by default. \nIf you us the Open Document Format that both Open/Libre Office and MIcrosoft Office besides other office suits, you will have no problems in compatbility at all\n\nA: If you just want to see or read xls files (Excel), then you can use the package python-excelerator. \n$ sudo apt-get install python-excelerator\n$ py_xls2csv spreadsheet.xls 2>&1 | less\n\nYou can read more in the post Command line tool for viewing xls files .\n", "Q: How can I connect to my machine which is connected to internet via dsl?

Then insert the internal IP of your machine in the \"Server IP address\" text field. \nFor services not in the list you should select \"Custom server\", I suppose the dialog will change to let you put in the port number. \nFor dyndns, your gateway could have the support (see the help or doc of the gateway) or you can use some software on your host to inform dyndns of external IP changes.\n"]
