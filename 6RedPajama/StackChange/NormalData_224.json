I will suggest do a fresh install of both the O/S. First recover the system and install(recover) Windows 10. Then create partitions for Ubuntu from Windows only(using disk management tool).\nMake sure secure boot is completed disabled in BIOS. If windows 10 is installed in EFI mode, make sure that Ubutnu is also installed in EFI mode only.\nNow make use of the live USB to install Ubuntu. At the time of install options - choose install Ubuntu along side Windows(I don't recommend something else option for newbies). Once the installation is done - make sure that grub2 is working.

Easiest method is using \"ssh\". A script like this ...\n#!/bin/bash\nssh -t {user}@{ip-adres-1} \"echo {pwd} | sudo -S poweroff\"\nssh -t {user}@{i-padres-2} \"echo {pwd} | sudo -S poweroff\"\n\nThere is software to do this (and more) called \"puppet\", \"chef\" or \"cfengine\".

I'm writing a script to analyse some data. I have several subset of files, and I would like to count the line from these files and write the result into a csv file. I'll try to do an example. I have these two subset of file:\nsample1.ext  \nsample1.ext2  \nsample1.ext3\n\nsample2.ext  \nsample2.ext2  \nsample2.ext3\n\nI would like to count the lines contained in all the files in *.ext, *.ext2 and *.ext3 and write the results into a csv file that seems to this:\ncount(sample1.ext), count(sample1.ext2), count(sample1.ext3)  \ncount(sample2.ext), count(sample2.ext2), count(sample2.ext3)\n\nAfter counting the first series of file in *.ext, I output the results to the first column of a csv file. How do I write the output of the second count series of *.ext2 into the second column of the same csv file? And the same for the third column?\n\nThank to everybody for the answers, I was trying to adapt them to my files, but unfortunately I cannot do it. The example that I posted was just an example, where I put numbers instead of weird extensions to be easiest to understand the problem. You all understood, but you focused too much on the numbers that do not exist in the reality. I will explain you again using the real files.\nThese files are coming from a mapping of genomic data to a reference genome. I treat these data to clean them, so I have three steps where the number of lines changes. So the file are:\nname.sort.bam  \nname.mapped.bam  \nname.rmdup.bam  \nothername.sort.bam  \nothername.mapped.bam  \nothername.rmdup.bam   \n\nThe extension bam is a compressed file. To count the lines in this file, there is a special command line:\nsamtools view -c (file)\n\nThe only way I found was to iterate into each *sort.bam, *mapped.bam, *rmdup.bam and write a txt output for each, and paste them at the end in a csv file. Is there a way to avoid these three loop and do averything together?\nSorry for the misunderstanding, you all got great ideas!\n\nA: Assuming you want output like 42, 19, 10207, 3 on each line (no filenames), wcand some Bashing will solve your problem.\noutfile=\"Result.csv\" \nfor samplenum in $( seq 1 100 ) ; do\n    line=\"\"\n    for file in sample${samplenum}.* ; do\n        numlines=$( wc -l <$file )\n        line=\"$line $numlines,\"\n    done\n    # remove the final comma\n    line=${line%,}\n    # not quoting $line below will suppress the initial blank \n    echo $line >> $outfile \ndone\n\nRead man bash, man wc, man seq and man bash again\nResponding to comment:\nDid you read the man pages? \n$( seq 1 100) is replaced with the results of the seq 1 100 command, which simply outputs the integers from 1 to 100 (which reading man seq would have told you). Replace it with something that supplies the numbers of the samples you have. \nPut the code in a file (e.g. test.sh) and run it with bash -x test.sh to see details. Replace the seq 1 100 with seq 1 2 for the test, to avoid an avalanche of output. \nsamplenum holds the number of the sample, which, for this example, runs from 1 to 100. \nsample, in sample${samplenum}.* is just a string. It is concatenated with the value of samplenum and the string .* to produce the filename pattern, e.g. sample1.* the first time through the for samplenum ... loop, sample2.* the second time, etc. \nDid you read, and understand, man bash, man wc, man seq and man bash again?\n\nA: You can use this Perl script:\n#! /usr/bin/perl\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nmy @names;\nmy @files;\n\n@ARGV == 1 || die();\n\nopendir(my $dir, $ARGV[0]) || die $!;\n\nwhile(readdir($dir)) {\n    if($_ =~ /(.*)\\.(sort|mapped|rmdup)\\.bam$/) {\n        grep(/^$1$/, @names) == 0 && push(@names, $1);\n    }\n}\n\nclose($dir);\n\nforeach my $name (sort(@names)) {\n    my @fields;\n    push(@fields, $name);\n    foreach my $extension (\"sort\", \"mapped\", \"rmdup\") {\n        if(! -f \"$ARGV[0]/$name.$extension.bam\") {\n            push(@fields, 0);\n            print STDERR \"'$ARGV[0]/$name.$extension.bam' missing\\n\";\n            next;\n        }\n        my $count = `<\"$ARGV[0]/$name.$extension.bam\" wc -l`;\n        chomp($count);\n        push(@fields, $count)\n    }\n    print(join(\", \", @fields).\"\\n\")\n}\n\nSave it somewhere in your system, make it executable and run it passing the directory as an argument:\npath/to/script path/to/directory\n\n% tree directory\ndirectory\n├── name.mapped.bam\n├── name.rmdup.bam\n├── name.sort.bam\n├── othername.mapped.bam\n├── othername.rmdup.bam\n└── othername.sort.bam\n\n0 directories, 6 files\n% perl script.pl directory\nname, 0, 0, 0\nothername, 0, 0, 0\n% for f in directory/*.sort.bam; do printf 'line\\n' >>\"$f\"; done\n% perl script.pl directory                                      \nname, 1, 0, 0\nothername, 1, 0, 0\n\nWhat the script does is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Iterates through all the files in path/to/directory; if a filename matches .*\\.(sort|mapped|rmdup)\\.bam$, appends the string before .sort.bam, .mapped.bam or .rmdup.bam to a list @names if not already in the list;\n\n*For each name in the sorted @names list as $name, appends $name to a list @fields; for each extension in sort, mapped and rmdup as $extension checks if $name.$extension.bam exists in path/to/directory; if the file doesn't exist, appends 0 to @fields, prints an error message and moves on to the next $extension / $name; if the file exists, appends the output of <\"$name.$extension.bam\" wc -l to @fields; once all of the possible values for $extension have been iterated, prints a line containing the elements of @fields joined on ,.\n\n\nA: A python option\nInteresting question. A nice occasion to apply python's groupby()\nSince your files are in a single, \"flat\" directory:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom itertools import groupby\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndr = sys.argv[1]\n# list the files in the directory, split into \"sortable\" elements\nflist = [[item, item.split(\".\", 1)] for item in os.listdir(dr)]\n# sort the file list by first section (until the first found dot)\nflist.sort(key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n# create sub groups of the files, grouped by first section of name\nfor key, line in groupby(flist, lambda x: x[1][0]):\n    line = list(line)\n    # sort the files by second section of name for correct order in the csv lines\n    line.sort(key=lambda x: x[1][1])\n    # count the lines of the files, arrange the csv file\n    print((\", \").join([str(len(open(dr+\"/\"+f[0]).readlines())) for f in line]))\n\nHow it works\nIf a directory contains nine files:\nsample1.ext                  2 lines\nsample1.ext2                 3 lines\nsample1.ext3                 3 lines\n\nsample2.ext                  1 lines\nsample2.ext2                 1 lines\nsample2.ext3                 4 lines\n\nsample3.ext                  6 lines\nsample3.ext2                 1 lines\nsample3.ext3                 4 lines\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The script lists the files, splits each of the names into two sections, e.g.:\nsample2\n\nand\next2\n\nsince the order of both the lines and the file length inside the lines depends on accurate sorting of these two sections.\n\n*The script then sorts the files by the first section of the name, since the length of each of the files (with a similar first name section) should be grouped per first section into one line; sample1, sample2, sample3 and so on.\n\n*Subsequently, sub groups (per csv line) are created, properly sorted by the second name section, to make the (line-) numbers appear in the correct order in the line\n\n\nThe result:\npython3 '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/create_csv.py' '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/samples' \n2, 3, 3\n1, 1, 4\n6, 1, 4\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as create_csv.py\n\n*Run it with the directory with your files as argument\npython3 /path/to/create_csv.py /path/to/directory_with_files\n\nImportant note\nThe method, used to count the lines, is appropriate as long as the files are not huge. If the files are, another method to count the lines would result in a better performance.   \n\nEDIT\nAs a result of the latest info, added to your question, an edited version of the script. Coincidentally, not much has to be changed: the script already split the file names by the first found dot, by the command:\nitem.split(\".\", 1)\n\nSince the last section of the name is .bam, which is equal on all files, it is meaningless for the sorting order.\nThen we only need to replace the \"old\" way to count the file's lines:\nstr(len(open(dr+\"/\"+f[0]).readlines()))\n\nby (the python implementation & integration into the script of-) the command you provided:\nstr(subprocess.check_output([\"samtools\", \"view\", \"-c\", dr+\"/\"+f[0]]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip())\n\nThe edited script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom itertools import groupby\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\ndr = sys.argv[1]\n# list the files in the directory, split into \"sortable\" elements\nflist = [[item, item.split(\".\", 1)] for item in os.listdir(dr)]\n# sort the file list by first section (until the first found dot)\nflist.sort(key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n# create sub groups of the files, grouped by first section of name\nfor key, line in groupby(flist, lambda x: x[1][0]):\n    line = list(line)\n    # sort the files by second section of name for correct order in the csv lines\n    line.sort(key=lambda x: x[1][1])\n    # count the lines of the files, arrange the csv file\n    print((\", \").join([\n        str(subprocess.check_output([\"samtools\", \"view\", \"-c\", dr+\"/\"+f[0]]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip())\n        for f in line]))\n\nNote\nNote that the order of the numbers inside the line is determined by the sorted order of the second part of the name, e.g. \nmapped.bam, rmdup.bam, sort.bam  \n\n", "Q: Boot/repair problem I am attempting to repair a new Ubuntu 15.10 installation with Boot-repair.

Or what's problem on this backtrace?\nThanks\n\nA: The problem:\nOn your keyboard, the Print Screen (PrtSc) and System Request (SysRq) are on the same physical button, like on most layouts I know.\nThe key combinations Alt+SysRq+[SPECIFIC LETTER] are generally known as Magic SysRq Commands which directly send commands to the kernel.\nThey're mainly used as a safer alternative to a cold reset if the system is completely crashed, because there are e.g. commands to sync and unmount the file system to prevent damage and data corruption and to reset/reboot (if you press B as 3rd key) or power off (3rd key O). More information and a full list of combinations, even with respect to different keyboard layouts, can be found in the corresponding Wikipedia article Magic SysRq Key.\nSo what you're accidentally doing is to directly send the kernel the command to reboot, and that's what it does.\n\nThe solution:\nDepending on how your kernel was compiled, you are however able to specify on which SysRq commands the kernel should listen when the system is running. I just tested this on 15.10 with kernel 4.2.0-27-generic and it worked, but it would be nice to learn since when or for what kernels this is enabled. Please comment if you know.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out the current SysRq command filter value:\nWe can learn which SysRq commands are currently enabled by checking the content of the virtual file /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq:\ncat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\n\nThe result will be a number that must be interpreted like this:\n0 - disable SysRq\n1 - enable SysRq completely\n>1 - bitmask of enabled SysRq functions:\n    2 - control of console logging level\n    4 - control of keyboard (SAK, unraw)\n    8 - debugging dumps of processes etc.\n    16 - sync command\n    32 - remount read-only\n    64 - signalling of processes (term, kill, oom-kill)\n    128 - reboot/poweroff\n    256 - nicing of all RT tasks\n\nMy default value when I'm on the desktop is 176, which is 128+32+16. So according to the table above, I can reboot, poweroff, sync and remount file systems to read-only.\n\n*Disable all SysRq commands:\nExecute the command below and try whether the SysRq shortcuts still work afterwards (e.g. Alt+SysRq+B to reset/reboot):\necho 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\n\nThis should disable all SysRq commands for the current session, until you reboot the next time.\n\n*Enable all SysRq commands:\nTo manually enable all SysRq commands, we write the value 1 to the same virtual file instead:\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\n\n\n*Enable previous default SysRq command filter:\nYou restore your default configuration by either rebooting, or if you checked and remembered the value before tweaking it, you can set that value again instead of 0/1 to enable/disable all commands.\nSo in my case where the original value was 176, I would run:\necho 176 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq\n\n", "Q: Mouse cursor changes size when new process starts In KDE, you may already change the mouse size in setting (maybe bigger size for better vision or smaller size for more comfort).\nWhen new process starts, mouse change its size (usually become smaller) which is annoying.\n\nA: Edit ~/.kde/share/config/startupconfig \nsudo gedit ~/.kde/share/config/startupconfig\n\nand add the following line:\nkcminputrc_mouse_cursorsize=\"20\"\n\nNow save the file and everything is hopefully fine.\nsource\n", "Q: Windows 8 host, Virtual Machine with Ubuntu 15.10.

To open it press Ctrl + Alt + T \nAs for which to use: use command prompt if it's dealing with host side things, use the terminal if it's VM side things (installing software, opening/editing files)\n**Side note: VirtualBox will only go up to 128MB for Video Memory, if you're wanting more than that you need to actually install it on a physical machine\n\nA: You can freely change RAM, video RAM, number of CPUs, virtual network cards, audio devices, and more for any virtual machine. But it requires the machine to be not running. Reinstalling the guest is not needed and will not help anyway.\nAs soon as you had shut down you virtual Ubuntu the Virtual Box Manager will allow for up to 128 MB of VRAM. The virtual graphics card you may have had installed with the guest additions will provide many but not all of the hosts graphic card's 3D capabilities. By this it will also make use of the physical VRAM your graphic card has. You may never need more than the 128 MB of VRAM to assign to the virtual guest in addition.\nTo quickly access the terminal in Ubuntu press CtrlAltT or search the Dash for \"Terminal\". The built in virtual terminals TTY1 to TTY9 can be accessed by pressing HostF1 to HostF9, where Host is the key you defined to be the \"host key\" in Virtual Box (e.g. right Shift-key). Go back to the lock screen with HostF7.\nThere also is a command line interface to control a virtual machine from the host terminal, but this is thought for the more advanced users, or in case we had a VM running on a desktop-less server.\n\nA: I decided to try another route. I figured out how to install UBUNTU 15.10 32 bit (it won't deal with 64 bit) via USB and after install to it's own partition it says DUAL BOOT ? Sure, not what I wanted but i'll take it. Can't get the BIOS to cooperate apparently because I still have no dual boot. I'll keep searching for a fix for this to get a dual boot choice at startup...unless someone can find me a fast-track solution.

Mount it and, if Ubuntu is no longer installed, delete the EFI/ubuntu directory tree. You may also need to delete EFI/BOOT -- but it may hold Windows files, so that could help or make things worse.\nYou can mount the ESP in Windows by opening an Administrator Command Prompt window and typing mountvol S: /S (you can change S: to another drive identifier if you like). The ESP will then be mounted at S:, but only for that specific Command Prompt window.\n\nA: I guess you have installed ubuntu in the Wrong partition(which is C: drive).\nTo confirm: Boot your ubuntu os and search for directory which have folders below.(perflog, Program files, Users, Windows)\n\nIf no, you need to install windows Operating system again.\nif yes, start your ubuntu os and follow this http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-change-the-boot-order-of-a-dual-boot-linux-pc/ and select windows os.\n", "Q: SMART Pre-fail (Temperature 70) Could someone please interpret the SMART Data and Self-tests using Disks in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:\nThe other day all of a sudden I started receiving errors upon every command entered into the terminal, I restarted and everything has been working fine.\nYet, SMART tests reveals this:\nDISK is OK (Temp 30, Threshold not exceeded, All values 100 except Temperature is 70(pre-Fail)\nIt's and SSD disk I've been using for 8 months.

I'd like to have it be default when opening a file from the command window and when using the files app. \nWhen I right click on a file and select 'open with', VSCode doesn't show up on the list of possible apps, even after clicking \"show other applications\".\nIt also doesn't show up in the list of possible apps when I enter\nsudo update-alternatives --config editor\n\nin the command window.\n\nA: To open with VSCode from Nautilus, create a .desktop file, open it in gedit, and paste in the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=VSCode\nComment=Edit code files\nExec=code %f\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=code\nCategories=TextEditor;\nStartupNotify=true\nMimeType=text/x-text;\n\nSave the file, then move it to /.local/share/applications (you may need to open Nautilus via sudo Nautilus to be able to move it there). It should now appear in the \"open with\" dialogue when right-clicking on a file. Set VSCode as the default program for that file by right-clicking on the file, Properties, 'Open With' tab. The downside to this method is that it just opens the file, but not the folder in VSCode's 'Explorer' pane.\nTo open a file with VSCode from the terminal, follow the directions here (Linux section about 1/3 the way down), making sure the paths you use are absolute, not relative. Once that's working, if you cd to the directory you want and enter code . it'll open that folder in the VSCode's 'Explorer' pane.\n", "Q: \"file /var/log/syslog is being edited\" message in nano To the best of my knowledge, I can view /var/log/syslog with the command\nsudo nano /var/log/syslog\n\nand successfully did so several times during a session; however, I was trying to search the log for keywords and apparently entered some 'unknown commands' by mistake.

Have I screwed up my syslog file? If so, how dire is that?\n\nA: If the option \"vim-style lock-files\" is enables (set locking in nanorc), which is the case by default, nano creates a special so called \"lock file\" while you edit a file to indicate that the file is currently edited. \nNormally this file is removed when nano is closed, but that doesn't happen if you kill it by closing the terminal.\nJust remove the file\n/var/log/.syslog.swp\n\n", "Q: OpenVPN missing bridge.ko Installing OpenVPN on a new server following these instructions.\nI have gotten this working a couple times before but this time I get stuck getting the bridge driver to load.\nOnce the interface file has been configured to use br0 the network no longer will come up.\nManually trying to configure the bridge using\nsudo brctl addbr br0\n\nresults in the error message\nadd bridge failed: Package not installed\n\nApparently this message comes from the kernel missing the module.

When I boot from windows 7 with all the updates installed I have the same problem and I get this error message: Display driver stopped responding and has recovered.\nThank you very much!\n\nA: I think it is not Intel adapter crashing, but the problem is with the open source Nvidia driver.\nInstall the correct driver by\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\n\nReboot and switch to Nvidia\nsudo prime-select nvidia\n\nThen log off and on.\nBut I suspect that Intel will work OK too.\n\nA: I believe that opening the Additional Drivers app and installing the proprietary NVIDIA driver will automatically make the NVIDIA card be used for everything. Once the installation is done and you have rebooted, you can check by opening the NVIDIA X-server Settings app (not exact name, sorry) and going to the PRIME Profiles section.\n", "Q: VLC from menu or double-click starts in background, terminates On most Ubunutus, VLC can be started from the gnome launcher(?) or by double-clicking on assiociated items in nemo or nautilus. I expect VLC to run; in the second case, I expect the file I clicked on to be played back.\nSince yesterday, this is no longer the case. Mostly, nothing visible happens. In very rare cases of clicking on files, a control-less version of vlc (like cvlc) appears, playing the file, but closes after a few seconds. I cannot reproduce when this happens, and there is never a visible window when choosing vlc from the launcher.\nThings I have found/tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*starting programs by double-clicking still works for everything else.\n\n*starting vlc from a terminal works, as does vlc --started-from-file <filename>: playback with controls, does not terminate after a few seconds.\n\n*vlc --reset-config did not help, neither did deleting ~/.config/vlc\n\n*/usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop exists in its packaged state; deleting it caused VLC to disappear from the launcher, showing it was being read. apt --reinstalling vlc restored the file, but did not help.\n\n*for a few seconds after running vlc from menu/double-click, a /usr/bin/vlc --started-from-file <filename> process is running. Unfortunately, it is Sl, not Sl+, explaining why I cannot see or hear it.\n\n*When a VLC instance was started from the console, double-clicking on a media file in nemo/nautilus causes that VLC instance to play back the file.\n\n\nI am using a gnome-flavored and up-to-date ubuntu 15.10, currently on 4.2.0-25-generic, 64 bit.

I've spent several hours reading and trying to track down the issue.\nThe logkeys code finds the correct device \"/dev/input/event2\" and fopens it:\ninput_fd = open(args.device.c_str(), O_RDONLY);\n\nThe code is then supposed to enter a while loop when it reads input:\nwhile (read(input_fd, &event, sizeof(struct input_event)) > 0) {\n\nThe while loop isn't actually entered (confirmed with debug statements). It appears that no keyboard events are actually happening.  This could all be because I'm running this is a VM, but I'm not sure as some other things check out. E.g., per several posts such as this one, it appears that event2 is in fact the correct device in my Ubuntu VM:\ncat /proc/bus/input/devices\n...\nI: Bus=0011 Vendor=0001 Product=0001 Version=ab41\nN: Name=\"AT Translated Set 2 keyboard\"\nP: Phys=isa0060/serio0/input0\nS: Sysfs=/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/input/input2\n...\nB: EV=120013\n...\n\nI've confirmed that logkeys has actually chosen to listen to event2 through debug statements to console added to the code.\nWhen I cat /dev/input/event2, and type, the keystrokes are shown on console.  I had thought that that was an accurate test of determining the correct event to listen to; however, when I cat /dev/input/event4, which is supposed to be a mouse, the same thing happens - keystrokes echoed on console.\nI don't have an Ubuntu machine to test on.  I could try it on an VirtualBox machine with an Ubuntu ISO, but don't follow how that would be different than what I'm doing now.  I have tried other Vagrant Ubuntu boxes as well (ubuntu/trusty and another one) with no change.  I do like the speed and convenience of doing my dev on the Vagrant box.  Well, it's usually pretty fast and convenient, but not at the moment.\nDoes anyone have any insight on what might be going on, and what I'm missing?\nThanks very much, jz.\n\nA: Answering my question for posterity, in case anyone ever does something similar, which is highly unlikely!\nIn my tests, I had only been connecting to the box with vagrant ssh, and was typing in my original terminal window.  I changed my Vagrant file to include a gui, with config.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" { |v| v.gui = true }, and vagrant launched a CLI window with the guest.  The typing in that terminal worked, and the debug was output to the original terminal.\nUnfortunately I don't have time to investigate exactly why the keystrokes on the host box weren't showing up in the guest ... probably something obvious I'm missing.

I have an old computer that I'm ready to get rid of that has been encrypted using LUKS full disk encryption. Is it possible to delete the encryption key from the LUKS metadata so that nobody will ever be able to unlock the partition again? If so, how do I go about doing that?\n\nA: Just overwriting the LUKS header will work, overwriting the whole drive is way overkill for LUKS & would take possibly hours longer.\nThe LUKS header could be 1MB or 2MB or bigger  depending on the type & number of keys, ArchWiki advises to wipe/overwrite the first 10MB:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdx2 bs=512 count=20480\nNote the correct partition sdx2 or whatever it is, you can check with a live dvd/usb and lsblk or blkid and confirm with the cryptsetup command below, this will tell you if partition sdx5 for example is a LUKS device:\ncryptsetup -v isLuks /dev/sdx5\nAlso from ArchWiki:\n\nNote: It is crucial to write to the LUKS encrypted partition ( /dev/sdx5 in this example)\n  and not directly to the disks device node. If you did set up encryption as a device-mapper\n  layer on top of others, e.g. LVM on LUKS on RAID then write to RAID respectively. \n\nYou could only (or additionally) delete all the luks keyslots, leaving no keys, if you know a working passphrase. See man cryptsetup or a web version here, with:\ncryptsetup -v luksRemoveKey  <device>\nor\ncryptsetup -v luksKillSlot <device> <key slot number> \nAlso note about SSDs (also from ArchWiki):\n\nWhen wiping the header with random data everything left on the device is encrypted data.\n  An exception to this may occur for an SSD, because of cache blocks SSDs employ. In theory\n  it may happen that the header was cached in these some time before and that copy may\n  consequently be still available after wiping the original header. For strong security\n  concerns, a secure ATA erase of the SSD should be done (procedure please see the\n  cryptsetup FAQ 5.19 ).\n\n", "Q: Can't run GUI applications as root I know i messed something up, i just don't know what, how or when. \ni used to be able to run gksudo (gui application)\nor sudo (gui application)\nand then i couldn't anymore - I've torn the whole Internet apart looking for a solution and this is my last hope please how do i fix this???\n$ sudo heimdall-frontend\nheimdall-frontend: cannot connect to X server \n\nsudo nautlius givesFailed to connect to Mir: Failed to connect to server socket: No such file or directory\nUnable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused\n(nautilus:5327): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:\ni don't know if the server error i'm getting has anything to do with the lamp-server^ i recently installed?\n`\n\nA: Since running GUI applications as root is a Bad Idea, I'm not happy to give you this answer: Read man xhost, then do xhost +localhost.man xhost also show how to set up this permanently.\n", "Q: Using SSL with redirects from non http causes redirect loop?

All I can find is for the Windows to Ubuntu way and not Ubuntu to Windows.   \nI want to keep Ubuntu as my main OS and Windows as my secondary for video games. \nI've been reading a bit though that this is kind of hard too do, as Windows doesn't like being a secondary OS.\nThanks.\n\nA: This is defiantly possible!\nYou have to have a spare partition or drive for Windows to install on in the first place. \nThe tricky part is that Windows as you stated does not \"like\" to be installed alongside Ubuntu.

I've got the Wireless Trackpad working fine with no issues.  However, I can't for the life of me get the keyboard working.  I've followed several guides and have managed to pair this keyboard via bluetoothctl, entering the PIN and seeing successfully paired.  But it simply won't connect... it's paired but won't connect.\nI do see the following error using journalctl:\nAuthentication attempt without agent\nAccess denied:  org.bluez.Error.Rejected\n\nThe same keyboard works flawlessly in Windows 10, so I know it's not the Bluetooth controller or keyboard itself.  The trackpad also works in Windows 10, and I used this trick to copy the bluetooth keys from the Windows registry to the bluetooth configuration in Linux: How can I avoid having to pair my bluetooth mouse all the time?\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/229930/finding-bluetooth-link-key-in-windows-7-to-double-pair-a-device-on-dualboot-com\nAgain, the trackpad works without issues in both Windows and Linux using this approach of mirroring the Bluetooth key.  Even forgetting the goal of pairing the keyboard in both Windows and Linux, and setting up the keyboard with a new pairing, the keyboard won't pair via the GUI interface.  I had to use bluetoothctl and even that wasn't reliable.\nAre there known issues with Bluetooth drivers in 4.2, or perhaps a bug with the Apple Wireless Keyboard specifically?\n\nA: This was a pain in the button to get working. I really wanted to make a precise answer but I think the tech is a little flaky and the tools are a little trying. I did it once successfully, went to do it again from my notes to make sure my answer was sound and it took me another hour of trying to get it to take. These are the steps I followed on Ubuntu 16.04 (derived from @phireph0x and @danielfbm's answers).\n\n*\n\n*Install bluetoothctl:\n sudo apt install bluetoothctl\n\n\n\n*Run bluetoothctl. You should see an initial list of connected devices like so:\n[NEW] Controller 23:34:17:64:AF:0E ChromeLinux_A00F [default]\n[NEW] Device 00:19:32:D3:38:01 Pico the Keyboard\n\nIt's ok if you don't see the Apple keyboard initially. You should see it by the end of step 5 in the next section.\nThe remaining steps are from the bluetoothctl command prompt:\n\n*\n\n*Set the agent:\nagent KeyboardDisplay\ndefault-agent\n\n\n\n*Turn off the Bluetooth keyboard by removing the batteries. Hold the power button in and wait 10 seconds.\n\n*Scan for devices: scan on.\n\n*Turn on the Bluetooth keyboard by reinserting the batteries holding the power button in for 10 seconds. If you don't see the keyboard power light blinking continuously, it's not trying to pair. Try again.\n\n*Wait for your Bluetooth keyboard to appear in bluetoothctl. This will happen asynchronously while you wait at the prompt. My keyboard popped up after 20-30 seconds.\n\n*Remove any previous attempts: remove 00:19:32:D3:38:01. Replace 00:19:32:D3:38:01 with your keyboard that popped up in step 5.\n\n*Wait for your Bluetooth keyboard to pop up again. This will probably take 20-30 seconds.\n\n*Make a connection and pair the Bluetooth keyboard: connect 00:19:32:D3:38:01. Replace 00:19:32:D3:38:01 with your keyboard that popped up in step 5 and 7.\n\n*If you're on track, you should see your prompt change from: [bluetooth]#  to [Pico the keyboard]: .\n\n*Now, on your Bluetooth keyboard, type 1234 and press enter.

If the connection failed, turn off the keyboard and try again from step 2.\nTroubleshooting:\n\n*\n\n*The keyboard seems to mate for life and will try to pair with any Macs it has paired with in the past. Make sure they're off.\n\n*Restart your PC if all else fails. I was surprised to find that I didn't seem to have much trouble with the Ubuntu Bluetooth stack. I did restart a couple times but I don't think it's what got things working in the end.\n\n\nA: I solved the problem in a similar way compared to phireph0x, but whenever I tried to use:\npair [dev]\n\nThis would give me an authentication error. So I restarted the whole process from the beginning and this time instead of using pair, I used:\nconnect [dev]\n\nNext thing was input the PIN in my computer, and then type the same PIN in the keyboard. Worked like a charm. I am now using the bluetooth keyboard!\nIt is also worth trying to setup the agent before connecting (also inside the bluetoothctl):\nagent KeyboardDisplay\ndefault-agent\n\n\nA: Wow. This was a super pain to set up. After following the tips in this thread (on Ubuntu Mate 16.04), I found I also needed to modify some configuration files as suggested here in the Debian wiki\n\n/etc/default/bluetooth - Default HID bluez setting - enable for mice\n  and keyboards\nHID2HCI_ENABLED=1\n\n/etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf - HCI bluez settings - configure static\n  device information [Replace the device address with the address shown\n  by bluetoothcl]\ndevice 00:1E:52:FB:68:55 {\n    name \"Apple Wireless Keyboard\";\n    auth enable;\n    encrypt enable;}\n\n\nIt seems there has been some churn in the Ubuntu bluetooth stack along the way and many of the older tips'n'tricks for bluetooth fixes seem not to help any longer.\n\nA: I eventually got this working, but note that the initial pairing/connection process (at least for me) was extremely flakey.  So it may take several attempts before you can successfully establish a connection.  First, I had to completely remove the keyboard device from the Bluetooth configuration using bluetoothctl:\nremove [dev]\n\nThen I reset the keyboard's stored pairing configuration by removing the battery, waiting 10 seconds, replacing the battery, and holding down the power button until the keyboard goes into discoverable mode.  Then add the device once more using bluetoothctl:\ntrust [dev]\npair [dev]\n\nThe other gotcha is the keyboard is initially in Numlock mode when connected to Bluetooth, as described Apple wireless keyboard does not work and elsewhere.  You can use the Fn+F6 trick, but this isn't persistent between reboots.  To permanently fix this, you must set the 'Default numeric keypad keys' as described https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NumLock  However, in Ubuntu 15.0 this Settings->Keyboard Layout configuration option is no longer present.  So you must install gnome-tweak-tools:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nAnd set the option in Typing->Miscellaneous compatibility options.\nHope this helps someone avoid the hours of anguish in getting this keyboard working properly.\n", "Q: How do I create an application launcher without coding? I want to create a launcher for an application that I just installed but whatever I searched was about creating a file with .desktop extension, but I need another way to make this without any coding or typing.\nI found Arronax but it doesn't work for me. that's not launching the desired application. Arronax can make .desktop file visually by selecting needed parameters. Somebody suggest me something please.\n\nA: Outside sources\nWhat you need is  gnome-desktop-item-edit program. Basically it does the same thing - it creates a .desktop file. Why ? Because launchers are .desktop files, just pinned to launcher. Nothing more than that. Windows shortcuts are .lnk files too by they way, they just don't show up as files with .lnk extension, but if you ever mounted a Windows hard drive - you'll know.\nThe gnome-desktop-item-edit command is still available if you install gnome-panel or gnome-tweak-tool. \nOnce you have it, you can use this command in terminal:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop\n\nHomebrew\nI've actually written a small script  for that purpose before (because why not ? ). You can copy the code, save to file, and run whenever you want it. That simple !\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFORM=$(zenity --forms \\ --title=\"Simple shortcut maker\" --text=\"Create new .desktop file\" \\\n        --add-entry=\"Program Name\" \\\n        --add-entry=\"Command or path to file\" \\\n        --add-entry=\"Terminal app(true/false)\" \\\n        --add-entry=\"Icon (path)\") \n\n[ $? == 0 ] || exit 1\n\nawk -F'|' -v home=\"$HOME\" '{ \n    FILE = home\"/Desktop/\"$1\".desktop\"\n        print \"[Desktop Entry]\" >> FILE\n        print \"Type=Application\" >> FILE\n        print \"Name=\"$1 >> FILE\n        print \"Exec=\"$2 >> FILE\n        print \"Terminal=\"$3 >> FILE\n        if ($4 !~ /^[ ]*$/)\n            print \"Icon=\"$4 >> FILE ;\n    system(\"chmod 755 \" FILE);\n\n}' <<< \"$FORM\"\n\nAnd that's how it looks:\n\nYou will have .desktop file in your Desktop folder, which you can later pin to launcher. \nNote: the content about the gnome-desktop-item-edit is provided by fossfreedom's original answer, please upvote his good work ! \n\nA: Assuming your application is a GUI application, currently without a launcher, there is a simple way to let Unity create the launcher for you in ~/.local/share/applications, after which you can move it to anywhere you like.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the (GUI) application a single time from command line.\n\n*In the Launcher, right-click on the icon that appears, running the application, choose \"lock to launcher\"\n\n\n*Navigate to ~/.local/share/applications, there you'll find your new launcher, created by Unity.

I searched Like System V Ubuntu and other variants but can't find info about it.\nIn general are problems or so and I cannot get the context.\nCan someone explaine the System V role in Ubuntu and some documentation?\n\nA: System V refers to one of the versions of the original AT&T Unix all the way back from the 80s. Some software is configured to run on multiple platform and that's what Geany apparently does. \nOn the other hand, you didn't necessarily need to build it from source, because Geany is available through official repositories in Ubuntu. You can either open Software Center and find it there, or you can open terminal and run\nsudo apt-get install geany\n\nSide-note: System V may not be as prevalent these days, but it had really big influence on the world of Unix and Linux in general. For instance, many Linux distributions use same style of starting processes through the System V style of init scripts. Ubuntu also did so  prior to 6.10 release of Ubuntu; 6.10 featured new upstart system. Now as of 14.10 Ubuntu is switching to systemd , which is totally different.

Find the wireless card and change the antenna connector to the opposite post: http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk2WDg3Nw==/z/XmYAAOSweW5VRppE/$_1.JPG?set_id=880000500F In this example, which may or may not be exactly like your wireless card, if your wire is on post A, change it to post M.\nReplace  the cover, battery, etc. and restart the computer. Is the wireless signal strength good? If so, you have confirmed that this is an ant_sel issue. \nIf that is the case, I suggest you file an issue against the driver here: https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new/issues\n\nA: I had the same problem with rtl8821ae on my asus laptop on Ubuntu 15.10.\nI tried a variety of things.

Do you see what I'm saying? You'll need to upgrade most of Gnome.\nBecause of all the dependencies, it's also pretty hard to compile just the bits you want.

The copy dialogue is stuck at 0 seconds left...\nWhenever I try to copy big files to my USB pendrive (in any format), it always stops at the last moment. It finishes after a long time.\nI searched Ask Ubuntu for similar Posts and got many, but none of them have good solutions.\nSo... Is there any alternative copying tool like Teracopy on Windows?\nOr are there any fixes I can do?\n\n\nA: The reason that you see the copying happening the way you do is that writes to the USB drive are asynchronous. \nWhen you copy a file it actually copies it in to the usb drive's buffer, which is in the RAM of your computer. The first part of the copy is very fast because it is just going in to the buffer. The data is flushed from the buffer to the USB drive at a much slower rate. Once the buffer has filled up it has to wait for some of the data to be flushed to disk before it can place any more in the buffer, so the copy then slows right down, effectively to the speed of the USB drive. Once all the file has been placed into the buffer it appears that the file has been copied. However not all the data has been flushed from the buffer onto the USB disk itself. Some copy programs just return and let that flushing carry on in the background. Some will wait until all the data has been flushed, which is why it will stay on 100% for some time.\nYou can switch the disk into synchronous mode which means that all data is immediately written to the USB drive without using the buffer. This will give the impression of a smoother transfer of data, but may actually end up with an overall reduction of speed.\nIf you manually mount the disk from the command line you can add -o sync.\nIf you mount it using fstab you can add the sync option.\nIf you rely on Ubuntu mounting it for you when you access it in the GUI you can modify the mount options from the command line once it is mounted:\nsudo mount -o remount -o sync /media/yourname/diskname\n\n\nA: You should not worry about this too much.\nMaybe your USB pendrive is of \"lower quality\".\nThe dialog output regarding the time is misleading.  \nOther copy tools may have a different output behavior,\nbut they do not improve the writing speed of the USB drive.\nMost important of all is that finally the copy action succeeds.\nWhat you can do is optimizing the input/output schedulers of disks.  \nInstall gksu (when you haven't already) to edit files with gedit as root :  \nsudo apt-get install gksu  \n\nNow optimize the priority of all running processes for various disks types :\ngksudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/60-schedulers.rules\n\nPaste the following lines into this empty file and save the file afterwards :\n# set cfq scheduler for rotating disks\nACTION==\"add|change\", KERNEL==\"sd[a-z]\", ATTR{queue/rotational}==\"1\", ATTR{queue/scheduler}=\"cfq\"\n\n# set deadline scheduler for non-rotating disks\nACTION==\"add|change\", KERNEL==\"sd[a-z]\", ATTR{queue/rotational}==\"0\", ATTR{queue/scheduler}=\"deadline\"  \n\nThe changes you made take effect after a restart of the operating system.\nAlso ... an alternative copy solution is available  in the Ubuntu repositories :  \nsudo apt-get install dirdiff  \n\nNow launch the tool from a terminal to compare or copy files and folders :\ndirdiff\n\ndirdiff is a GUI for diff and can handle up to 5 trees. It displays a main window with a list of files which are different between the trees, with colored squares to indicate the relative ages of the versions.  A menu allows you to display the differences between any two of the versions in another window.  Another menu allows you to copy files and folders from one tree to another.  \nSummary : Most relevant of all is the quality of the USB disk and its writing speed capabilities !\n\nA: The problem is likely that the file is read and stored in memory completely before it's completely written to the target drive.\nThis doesn't mean to answer the question exactly, but a workaround could be using pv from the command line in case of big files:\nsudo add-apt-repository universe && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pv\n\nWhenever one needs to copy a big file:\npv /path/to/big_file >/media/username/usb/big_file\n\nTo be noted that this suffers from a similar unwanted buffering problem when used in a pipe; if that's the case a fix is limiting the transfer rate to something slightly above the target drive's write speed:\n[...] | pv -L 10M >/media/username/usb/big_file # Limits the transfer rate to 10 MB/s\n\n\nA: There are a number of alternatives. You could use the command line approach:\ncp *source* *target* \nwhere source is the file you want to copy and target is the file or folder you wish to copy to. Further options might be found at https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/\n\nA: dd if=INPUT_FILE_PATH of=OUTPUT_FILE_PATH bs=$(( 64 * 1024 * 1024 )) oflag=sync\n\nThis will read from your if file and write to of file in 64MiB chunks and wait until each chunk is written out before starting the next one.  The utility you are using is most likely just reading the file into memory and then sending it to the disk (and there is no telling how many bytes at a time it's doing it).  The write caching can be in the usb dongle itself though.... So the 60MiB per second speed that you are getting is the transfer rate over the usb connection to the dongle's internal cache.  But that's not likely unless it's a USB3 dongle.  USB2 doesn't have enough throughput to handle 60MiB per second.\n\nA: There is no need for all the above. Simply open a terminal window when the transfer is showing 0% left and type sync From the man pages, the sync command flushes the file system buffers, but of course it will only flush those to which you have the rights. If you want to flush them all type sudo sync\n", "Q: Grub not showing up at boot I have installed the linux-lowlatency kernel recently.\nSetup of a DAW (MIDI support) was the reason to change from Fedora to Ubuntu.\n\nAfter reboot uname shows that I am running the generic kernel. \nThere are 2 entries (normal and revovery) for the lowlatency kernel in \n/boot/grub/grub.cfg\nbut the grub menu does not show up at boot time at all.\n\n... and no - I do not want to buy Windows software like an answer else where to this question suggests\n\nA: To enable the grub menu to select the kernel, you have to comment the line in /etc/default/grub\n\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\nThen you have to run update-grub and reboot and the grub menu should appear.\n", "Q: How to switch off gdm?

Nvm is normally sourced by the ghost user in /home/ghost/.bashrc:\n# in /home/ghost/.bashrc\nexport NVM_DIR=\"/home/ghost/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n\nI found from these questsions that putting the nvm init code in /home/ghost/.profile makes nvm available to su -l since it starts a login shell.\nI still can't figure out why I can't source the file explicitly. Can anybody tell me why?\n\nA: The file was getting sourced, but execution was stopped when it reached this case statement, which will only continue if it is being sourced in a shell in interactive mode.\ncase $- in\n    *i*) ;;\n      *) return;;\nesac\n\nThe variable $- represents the flags with which the current shell was initialized. If it doesn't see i (the flag for interactive mode), the code will return. Because the shell wasn't being run in interactive mode, source .bashrc stopped when it reached that case statement.\nFor reference, the output of echo $- when using a normal interactive shell is himBH. The output of su -l -c 'echo $-' ghost, however, I see hBc.\nMoving the nvm lines above that statement solved the problem, as did putting them into a clean .profile or .bashrc.\n", "Q: nvidia-prime doesn't turn off Nvidia card while using intel graphics So I'm using nvidia-352-updates and nvidia-prime.

It is working great although the stick is a bit of bottle neck since it only have one chip.\nI knew if I made swap partition on it, it would slow down even worse so I decided to not make one.\n.\nProblem:\nI wanted to hibernate my computer but I couldn't without a swap file or swap partition. I can't use stanby 'cause battery is dead. Swap file will try to write quite a bunch of data so it will slow down the computer and kill my USB faster.\n.\nQuestion:\nHow can I make a swap file for hibernate only? I want to hibernate my computer but don't want to it to start using swap for \"performance boost.\"\nIf there is possible solution, could I get a walk through of it?\n\nA: First of all: a warning as you're saying:\n\nthe stick is a bit of bottle neck since it only have one chip.\n\nWhich makes me suppose you're using an MLC USB stick.  These sticks are slow and prone to errors, so one day in the near future, you're going to wake up and find that you've got no system at all and all of your data is lost, as HDDs die a slow, painful death like cancer, whereas SSDs just suddenly stop working like a heart attack!\nTherefore:\n\n*\n\n*Install your stick for the moment like here\n\n*Buy an SLC USB stick ASAHP and re-install on that one\n\n*Make back-ups of your data from the SLC stick onto the MLC stick...\n\nData isn't data until it's backed up!\n\nA: My computers have lots of RAM, so I never have seen swap space being used to supplement it.\nI do use hibernate often so I still define more swap space than I have RAM.\nNever noticed this slowing down my computer, but have never tried benchmarking it.\nAre you sure using swap space actually slows you down.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on my laptop that has Windows 10 My question is how to install Ubuntu 15.10 to my laptop that has Windows 10 without replacing my documents and all my information.\nI tried to make a boot on my USB, but my application for the boot doesn't recognize it, it sends me an error that it doesn't have the files and I need to download them. The files are \"ldlinux.sys\" and \"ldlinux.bss\".\n\nA: If you want to replace Windows 10 with Ubuntu you're going to have to make a back up of all documents you want to keep. After installing Ubuntu you can then copy the documents to your Ubuntu install.\nThe reason why the USB pen isn't bootable might be because the Ubuntu ISO hasn't been burned correctly onto the USB pen. A search for \"windows burn iso\" should give you plenty of information about how to burn an ISO.\n\nA: What software did you use to import Ubuntu on your USB flash drive? Sometimes the bootable usb creators use their own syslinux and cause problems. I recommend burning the ISO file to a disk and load it from the boot menu. This should fix the problem. Also, unless you have your files on another hard drive or partition, if you install Ubuntu it will remove everything on your system. \nWhat you are trying to do is risky; you should backup all your data. If it's not possible, then create a another partition, install Ubuntu on it. Then, copy your files that you have on your windows partition to your Ubuntu partition using file manager. Finally, you can decide whether to remove Windows or keep it.\n\nA: Use the software named Universal USB creator to create a bootable USB drive .\nMaking a dual boot for Ubuntu and windows is sometimes a problem as the various different file systems such as swap and ext4 are required.\nOption 1:\nRun the installer , if it shows Install alondside Windows , then you're golden.\nOption 2:\n-Use a software called Acronis to backup windows (Image file is 15~20 GB)\n-Store the backup in an external drive\n-Install Ubuntu on the full disk\n-Install Ubuntu again on the smaller disk size you want to allocate\n-Delete the older Ubuntu (format that partition) .

I have about 240 GB for each.  But my Ubuntu tells me my efi partition only has 6mb of remaining space.  In addition, my Ubuntu sometimes freezes after which I'm not sure if this is related.\nAnyway, would I need to resize my efi partition with Mac?  I'm running el capitan.  Everything concerning booting is running perfectly with ReFind, so I don't want to change too much. I'd just like to dedicate a little more space to my EFI partition.\n\nA: Macs normally come with EFI System Partitions (ESPs) of about 100 MiB, which is plenty big enough for most purposes. (I recommend making them bigger for reasons related to EFI driver bugs, but that's not an issue here.) If you're seeing just ~6 MiB of free space on your ESP (with a mount point of /boot/efi), then something is wrong. I recommend you discover what's consuming your disk space and delete or move anything that should not be there. Normally, you'll have an EFI/ubuntu partition with GRUB and/or an EFI/refind partition with rEFInd, neither of which should consume more than a few megs of space. There's also likely to be an empty EFI/APPLE directory and possibly an EFI/tools directory with two or three .efi binaries.\nThat said, I can't help but wonder if you might have mis-reported the problem. If you have a separate /boot partition, it often fills up with kernel updates; see these bug reports:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unattended-upgrades/+bug/1357093\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1465050\nThe Linux /boot partition is not the same as the ESP. If this is the problem, then doing a sudo apt-get autoremove should clear it, provided there isn't an issue with the package system that prevents removal of the old packages.\n", "Q: Restoring setings in Windows 7 after Dual mode with Ubuntu I am a new user of Ubuntu. Until recently I used only Windows 7 on my computer. Ever since I set up Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my computer to run in Dual mode with Windows 7, I have noticed the following problems in Windows 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*I cannot disable the mouse touchpad by just holding the Fn key and pressing the disable-touchpad (on the F9 key). In order to disable it, I go to the Control Panel and press Apply on the preference of disabling the touchpad when the mouse is connected. The annoying part is that I have to do this procedure after every single restart of Windows.\n\n*Almost after every single restart of Windows, the computer does not play sounds and music through headphones when I connect them. Curiously, the sounds and musics are OK when the headphones are not connected.\nIt is important to add that none of these problems occur in Ubuntu, but they started in Windows only since the day I put Ubuntu on my computer.\nIs there something I am missing? Maybe there is a way to restore Windows settings so as to overcome these problems? And are there any other problems of Dual-mode that I should be aware of?\n\nA: The OSes, Windows and Ubuntu runs independent of each other.  The difference after installing Ubuntu is the boot manager.  The boot manage will load the OS, and from there it's up to the configuration of the OS, as to how it behaves.\nWindows does not poll the Ubuntu partition while it's running because Windows can't read the Ubuntu file system.  While Ubuntu could poll (read) the Windows partition, it doesn't.  It reads the Ubuntu configuration from the Ubuntu installed partition.  Making changes to Windows will not affect it's partition and vice versa.\nThe bottom line is that you will have to describe your Windows problem to a Windows support group.  Keep in mind that if you mention Ubuntu, it might confuse the issue.  They might say you're having a problem because of Ubuntu (a similar deduction that you inferred).\nYou can configure how Windows defaults while Windows is actual running.  The Windows gurus will help you with this configuration.  If you were having problems with the defaults in Ubuntu, then this would be the pace where the Ubuntu gurus hang out.\nCheck a group such as http://superuser.com for help with configuring Windows defaults with subjects such as sounds and mouse behavior.\n", "Q: Is there any program for ubuntu which handles pptx file properly?

I already have W7 on a WD hard drive, I got a Seagate hard drive I want to dedicate to Ubuntu. I popped in the disk and went to install, but a notification popped up asking me if I wanted to force UEFI (or go back), and something about only running one OS with this. I clicked go back and quit install. How would I properly dual boot these two on separate hard drives?\n\nA: There are two ways you can go about this.\nThe legacy method will have you boot from one drive and choose which OS you want to boot. Boot control then transfers to the appropriate HDD. In this scenario GRUB is installed to the MBR of the boot drive. This could be your Windows or Linux drive. You could also install GRUB to both drives just in case the first drive suffers a failure.\nBut in your case, UEFI is enabled.\nThe UEFI method generally sees boot entries written to the BIOS so that the Windows and Linux installations are effectively isolated from one another. You would boot either OS by hitting your Boot Menu key (usually F12) and choose which one you want to boot, or it will boot the \"default\" OS that is first in the boot order of your BIOS setup.\n", "Q: Postfix odd configuration The Ubuntu 14.04's postfix (installed from mail-stack-delivery meta package) configuration file, main.cf, comes with an odd configuration directive:\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain, reject_unknown_recipient_domain, reject_unauth_pipelining, permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, reject_unauth_destination\nBased on how those restrictions work, I can't understand what reject_unknown_sender_domain restriction is doing under smtpd_recipient_restrictions.\nreject_unknown_sender_domain restriction also is placed under smtpd_sender_restrictions, where, I think, it's make more sense:\nsmtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain\nHow does a sender restriction under smtpd_recipient_restrictions makes any sense?\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain, reject_unknown_recipient_domain, reject_unauth_pipelining, permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, reject_unauth_destination\n\nsmtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain\n\nPlacing reject_unknown_sender_domain under either smtpd_recipient_restrictions or smtpd_sender_restrictions has the same effect.. but why mail-stack-delivery main.cf file has it under both? \n\nA: Think from the perspective of the server, not the client.\nThe Postfix server receives and processes email for potential recipients on your server and therefore needs to apply checks to that to filter spam, including determining whether or not the received email comes from a known domain. If it doesn't, it's a safe bet it's spam and you can reject it.\nTo apply the same restriction when your Postfix server sends email for your users would simply mean it checks to see if YOUR domain exists or not, which of course it does, so it's a moot check.\n", "Q: How to set up systemd after failed upgrade I recently upgraded Kubuntu via update manager from 14.04 to 15.10.

I can easily set them and I know that hitting Backspace will clear one. However, how can I reset it back to the original shortcut? I know that I could manually reset it to whatever it was but I was wondering if there was an easier way just to reset it back to the default shortcut.\n\nA: The easiest way: delete the menu accelerators' configuration files, then restart the applications to take effect.

I had a problem at some point and installed a new linux kernel. Ever since I've seen the occasional \"system error\" flag but things have worked fine, so I  didn't update and just keep things as is.\nRecently I decided to run an update and I lost all ability to connect to a network: wifi, ethernet, nothing worked. I tried the apt-get commands I found on Ubuntu forums for people who lost the wifi display but that obviously didn't help. So, I backed everything up and attempted to install 14.04.3 from my flash drive. I choose the option to install without internet connection, and then had some success getting the Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS desktop to show up, with internet connections. I selected the \"MIT\" wifi. However, in attempting to complete the install, an error occurred when I had to pick a time zone. A field opened with question marks in it. So, I attempted to reinstall and hit \"yes\" to install with internet connection but the option no longer was available.\nI went back to Ubuntu forums and decided to turn off boot security. Now when I turn the computer on it takes me straight to grub command line.\nThe current problem (short story): \nHow can I install Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS from grub2 command line? Here is the info in the only directory I've been able to look around in:\ngrub> ls\n(hd0) (hd0,gpt3) (hd0,gpt1) (hd0,gpt1)\ngrub> ls (hd0,1)/efi/ubuntu/\n./ ../ shimx64.efi grubx64.efi grub.cfg MokManager.efi \n\nAny help / recommendations would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Turning off Secure Boot was unnecessary in your case and is, generally speaking, inadvisable. If Secure Boot causes a problem, it will be a problem that causes Ubuntu to not boot at all -- you wouldn't even see a grub> prompt. The fact that you got into a desktop well before you disabled Secure Boot means that it's not the problem.\nIf you're seeing a grub> prompt, then that means that a mis-configured GRUB is booting. My hunch is that you're booting to an old GRUB installation that's trying to access a now-nonexistent Ubuntu partition. There are a couple of ways around this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the old GRUB files -- Ubuntu installs GRUB to the EFI/ubuntu directory on the EFI System Partition (ESP). You can delete that directory, assuming you don't need to preserve that GRUB installation (as you certainly don't if you've deleted Ubuntu, or even if you intend to re-install it). Of course, deleting that directory will be a challenge if you can't get anything to boot; but if you know how to boot into another OS, or even an EFI shell, you should be able to delete it. Once it's gone, the EFI won't be able to launch this non-functional GRUB, and the firmware will instead move on to another boot options.\n\n*Use the built-in boot manager to boot something else -- Most computers display a boot manager if you hit Esc, Enter, or a function key soon after powering on. (Which key does this varies greatly from one computer to another. Some machines display a prompt about this matter, but on some you may need to read the manual or just try keys randomly until something works.) Using this key, you should be able to select a boot option. With the Ubuntu install medium inserted, pick it -- and more specifically, pick the option that refers to the USB drive with the string \"UEFI\" attached to the description.\n\n\nIf you're having problems booting the Ubuntu installer, try creating it again. You may need to try with another program -- some programs for doing this job omit the EFI-mode boot loader or install it in a way that doesn't work with all EFI-based computers. Rufus and Unetbootin generally do a reasonable job of it, but I can't promise that either will work for you.\n", "Q: No ethernet on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS My ethernet has stopped working, leaving me with wireless only:\n\nThis seems to be a common problem but I have yet to find a fix.\nStandard diagnostics\n$ ifconfig -a\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 68:f7:28:39:71:5d  \n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\neth0:avahi Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 68:f7:28:39:71:5d  \n          inet addr:169.254.6.136  Bcast:169.254.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n          RX packets:2208 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:2208 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:190071 (190.0 KB)  TX bytes:190071 (190.0 KB)\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 74:29:af:29:9b:09  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.94  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::7629:afff:fe29:9b09/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:689 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:570 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:268689 (268.6 KB)  TX bytes:135063 (135.0 KB)\n\n$ sudo lshw -C network\n  *-network               \n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 10\n       serial: 68:f7:28:39:71:5d\n       size: 10Mbit/s\n       capacity: 1Gbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=half firmware=rtl8168g-3_0.0.1 04/23/13 latency=0 link=no multicast=yes port=MII speed=10Mbit/s\n       resources: irq:61 ioport:5000(size=256) memory:c3504000-c3504fff memory:c3500000-c3503fff\n  *-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter\n       vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 00\n       serial: 74:29:af:29:9b:09\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=rtl8723be driverversion=3.16.0-59-generic firmware=N/A ip=192.168.1.94 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n       resources: irq:19 ioport:4000(size=256) memory:c3400000-c3403fff\n\n$ lspci | grep Ethernet\n01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I would like to know if there is a file type, or even a program that can perform a root operation without input of the user. For example, when any change is made to /usr/bin the user is asked to input the root password, and that is (usually) only known by them/the person that installed Ubuntu. However, I have seen questions on Security\n concerning viruses that simply wait for the user to use terminal for root need, and record the keystroke. Is this possible? I do not want to know any specific virus examples or even how to do this, I would just like to know IF a program or file like this exists or can exist. Thank you, David!\n\nA: To answer this question in reality, it can be done, but not passively. Over time, Ubuntu and Linux in general have become more secure, to prevent viruses. The site found here explains most Trojans, Viruses, and Worms that can and have affected Ubuntu. This site is updated to even the most recent, because as you said, viruses today are mostly designed for Windows and Mac OS X. Giving Ubuntu a virus is possible, but it really isn't worth the work.\n\nA: There are two major categories of how a virus can infect a system:\nExploiting Bugs\nOne way a virus can infect a system is to exploit bugs. Assume a system has all sorts of security in place, but if you do x, y and z in sequence (a sequence unforeseen to be problematic), you can run a piece of code as root.\nThis kind of virus can be a serious treat. However, there can never be a permanent answer to your question regarding this. Any answer for this type of virus to your question would be describing an exploitable bug, which end up being quickly fixed, patched and made unexploitable.\nWe don't see this kind of virus on Linux mainly for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hackers labor to find a bug in a system, and feel great when they do. In case of windows, there is not much to do but exploit the bug and write a virus. In case of Linux, they can send a patch to fix the bug and get additionally rewarded by fame. If you follow the news, you occasionally hear of a team of researches finding an exploit in some free software (not just Linux, e.g. heartbleed) and getting it fixed, but you never hear about a hacker finding an exploit in windows, even though the shear number of windows viruses show these bugs are numerous.\n\n*GNU/Linux distributions generally have excellent package managers. All software is often updated and bugs are squashed quickly. On windows, many tech-non-savvy users may just disable updates due to how annoying it's done (Did you restart yet? Did you restart yet? Did you restart yet? Shutting down, wait indefinitely please), and even if they don't, updates only come for the core of windows and nothing else. Any virus exploiting this kind of bug has a higher chance of living for a long time on windows, and thus spreading farther.\n\n\nExploiting Users\nAnother way a virus can infect a system is to fool a user into doing it. Download some application off the internet, run it and you bring the virus upon yourself. GNU/Linux distributions use package managers which make sure the executables are those built from source by trusted packagers, and unless a packager is malicious, prevents any virus from leaking in. On windows, you have to download each application from a different website, some of which don't offer HTTPS, nor a hash of the executable. There are so many ways a virus can get through this way, and we know they do.\nHowever, this by itself would not be so problematic, if it weren't for the user having root access. On windows, this is generally the default: the first (and usually only) user has administrative rights. It's like logging in as root on Linux. On Linux however, you are prompted to enter root passwords for anything that touches your applications (residing e.g. in /usr/bin), and so no virus can really \"sneak in\" without your notice.\nWith this kind of virus, the answer to your question would be to write a virus that is not open-source, asks for root permission under the pretext of doing something else, then convince a large number of people that they need this application available only in binary and give it root permission.\nThat's essentially not a virus anymore. It might have as well been \"instructions to format your hard disk\" given to people who don't know anything.\n\nThe most successful of bugs are those that exploit both the bugs and users. Imagine how easy it is on windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take application X that opens files of type Y. Make sure the application cannot update itself (given how poorly software updates are supported on windows (they are not), it's very easy to find applications that don't come with an updater). You can even make it easier and go with something open-source, for example inkscape.\n\n*Find an bug in the application that can allow you to execute code. For example a buffer overflow, which makes it even possible to open a non-executable file such as an image and still be able to take control of the software.\n\n*Spread your virus to everything you can, since you likely have root access to everything. This includes the buggy software itself, so that it can automatically infect future files, or even to make sure the software would never be able to update itself.\n\n*The virus would eventually get detected, but given that the buggy software is never updated, continues to roam.\n\n\nNow compare the situation to Linux. The bug you find may not live long as the buggy software gets patched and updated as soon as the virus is found. Moreover, even if you do get hold of the software, the most damage you can do is infect the user files, and not the system files. In the example of viruses attached to images, the software itself would not be able to get infected and the only method of transfer would be of the image itself by the user. This doesn't mean the virus cannot exist, but that it would be considerably weak and boring. No one would boast having written a boring virus.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 installation error (screenshot included) I need help resolving the following issue that I'm facing during installation of Ubuntu 14.04 on my Lenovo Z510 PC. \nI created a bootable USB which works fine, but just after clicking either 'Try Ubuntu without installing' or 'Install Ubuntu' on the main screen, Ubuntu loading screen comes, after which I get the following error:\n\nIgnoring BGRT: invalid status 0\nACPI PCC probe failed\nnouveau E[PIBUS]...

Quoting, with some formatting adaptation:\n\nInstalling the driver manually isn't very difficult either, because\n  Brother has issued a generic install script for that: the Driver\n  Install Tool.\nWith that, you can install not only the printer driver, but also (for\n  a multifunctional printer) the scanner driver.\nYou can use it as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to the download section of the Brother website and look up your printer model.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*For \"OS Family\" you choose Linux.\n  \n*For \"OS Version\" you select Linux (deb).\n  \n*Click the Search button.\n  \n  \n  Then click the Driver Install Tool and download\n  linux-brprinter-installer.\nSave the downloaded file in the folder Downloads. Don't extract the\n  zipped file, but leave it there just as it is. Note: don't use the\n  installation how-to on the Brother website, but use the installation\n  how-to on my website instead (see below)!\n  \n*Launch a terminal window.  (You can launch a terminal window like this: Click)\n  \n*Now copy/paste the following command into the terminal, in order to unzip the downloaded file:\ncd Downloads && gunzip -v ~/Downloads/linux-brprinter*\n\nPress Enter.\n  \n*Use copy/paste to transfer the following line to the terminal:\nsudo bash ~/Downloads/linux-brprinter*\n\nPress Enter. Type your password when prompted; this will\n  remain entirely invisible, not even asterisks will show, which is\n  normal.\n  \n*Follow the steps that the installer script presents you. When asked for the printer model name, type it and press Enter.\nAn example is best: for a Brother DCP-7065DN you type:\nDCP-7065DN\n\nNote: is there at the end of the model name a letter between\n  brackets? Then you probably have to omit that letter (including the\n  brackets).\nExample: for the Brother MFC-L9550CDW(T) it becomes:\nMFC-L9550CDW\n\nAt the question about the Device URI, you answer N for a USB\n  printer and Y for a network printer.\nFor a network printer, you select in the next question the last\n  option: (A): Auto. For that, you type the number of that option and\n  you press Enter.\n  \n*Reboot your computer.\n  \n*Done! Your printer should work fine now, including the scanner part (when present).\n  \n\n", "Q: teach apt-get to not complain about a particular package I need to have xpra 0.15.10 installed on my system because the version that comes with trusty doesn't work. Now I downloaded the binary from http://xpra.org/#download which generally works fine only that apt-get wouldn't let me install anything else but complain that I need to run apt-get -f install first which will remove xpra again i.e. whenever I need to run apt-get I need to un- and re-install the xprapackage - not very convenient I must say. Is there either an option to tell apt-get to not worry about this particular package or manually tell apt-get where to install the deb from for this package?\n\nA: You can use apt-mark to hold the package so that it does not get updated after you install it.  The command would be from a terminal window:\nsudo apt-mark hold xpra\n\nfrom the manpage for apt-mark:\n   hold\n       hold is used to mark a package as held back, which will prevent the\n       package from being automatically installed, upgraded or removed.\n       The command is only a wrapper around dpkg --set-selections and the\n       state is therefore maintained by dpkg(1) and not affected by the\n       --file option.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: aptitude can be useful for resolving conflicts. sudo apt-get install aptitude\nIt will automatically suggest a few options to resolve any issues. It handles everything to do with apt (install/remove/update etc) with simple keypresses all in the CLI.\nIf apt-get has problems; then launching aptitude might give you a better understanding (or way of handling it). and avoids having to know most of the uncommon apt-get commands.\nIf anything is highlighted RED, press E to then examine the solutions.

They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nWhat could be the cause? And how to install it successfully?\n\nA: As of today, Feb 7th, 2016, per MongoDB documentation:\n\nMongoDB only provides packages for 64-bit long-term\n  support Ubuntu releases. Currently, this means 12.04 LTS (Precise\n  Pangolin) and 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr). While the packages may work\n  with other Ubuntu releases, this is not a supported configuration.\n\nYou should follow the instructions for installing MongoDB from a tarball.\nIn brief:\n$ curl -O https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-3.2.1.tgz\n$ tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.11.tgz\n$ mkdir -p <your-intended-mongodb-install-directory>\n$ cp -R -n mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.11/ <your-intended-mongodb-install-directory>\n$ export PATH=<your-intended-mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH\n\nEven if you manually download the .deb package for 14.04, there is a problem with 15.10 confirmed here. Either way after manual installation you need to configure MongoDB and either run it as a process or daemonize it using for example:\ndaemon -- <your-intended-mongodb-install-directory>/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf\n\n", "Q: Digital Clock Issue in Kubuntu 15.10 I am new to Kubuntu and I have an issue with the Digital Clock Widget. \nFirst things first: \n\n\n*\n\n*I did install NTP \n\n*datetimectl does say NTP Sync Yes and the Local Time is correct as well \n$ timedatectl\nLocal time: sáb 2016-02-06 21:30:02 VET\nUniversal time: dom 2016-02-07 02:00:02 UTC\nRTC time: dom 2016-02-07 02:00:02\nTime zone: America/Caracas (VET, -0430)\nNetwork time on: yes\nNTP synchronized: yes\nRTC in local TZ: no\n\nHowever, ntpq shows just the following: \nbbuske@bmstiL1:~$ sudo ntpq -np\n\n     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset      jitter\n 186.71.75.78    .INIT.          16 u    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n 190.15.128.72   .INIT.          16 u    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n 146.164.48.5    .INIT.          16 u    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n 200.93.227.170  .INIT.          16 u    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n 91.189.89.199   .INIT.          16 u    -   64    0    0.000    0.000   0.000\n\nThis is however not the main problem. The main problem is with the digital clock widget on the task bar. The hour displayed there, is off one hour. Like right now it says 10:52 PM while it is 09:52 PM. \nI went into the setting and revised the time zone (VET - Venezuelan Standard Time), which is correct, we also do not have DST and there is no option to enable it. \nNow: The strange thing is, that in the settings itself, the time shows correct and is set to auto sync. It appears to be a sole issue with the desktop clock. I have tried the analog widget and the other one and both seem to show the correct time.  \nSo I wonder if there is any way to have this fixed? Is there any way to modify the widget? Or anything else I can try? Of course I could just use the system settings to manually set the time one hour back, then the time would show correct but the system time would then be false. Another solution I found is, set the time to GMT and then in the settings for additional time zones, de-select Caracas / Venezuela and and select a time zone named GMT -4,30. Then I could just change the displayed time on the task bar to that one. \nHowever: I would like to have my general time set to VET not to GMT. In the general time and date settings there is just one Caracas / Venezuela. The additional Options like GMT -4.5 are not present there but only in the widget settings.  \nI have seen this link here where someone from Venezuela had the same issues. However, he claimed that this has been fixed which apparently is not the case for me. \nAny ideas or help would be much appreciated. \nCheers, \nBen \n\nA: So I was able to find a solution on my own.  \nFirst of all, as I have guessed, the issue was not with the system itself, but with the Digital Clock Plasma Widget. I could confirm that, since the system time in the system settings was correct and because the other clock widgets for the analog clock and the written clock were working correctly. \nAttempts to find that widgets config or reference file to fix it manually or do some further investigation on the issue remained fruitless. \nToday I had an automatic update check done after activating the kde-backtrack apt in Software Center. Promptly the system showed up various updates to KDE. After installing them all, without a reboot the clock was fixed and the visual effects, especially those of the taskbar significantly imporved. \nThanks everyone for attempting to help out.\nCheers. \n", "Q: Cannot backup using Duplicity via cron I am trying to run a backup script foo.sh via cron.

And is disksize the space it consumes on RAM or just the maximum zram disk size?\n\nA: According to http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/zramctl.8.html, you can remove and recreate a zram swap like this:\n# swapoff /dev/zram0\n# zramctl --reset /dev/zram0\n# zramctl --find --size 1024M\n/dev/zram0\n# mkswap /dev/zram0\n# swapon /dev/zram0\n\nTo permanently change the size, you have to adapt the init script, where the swap files are created. Be aware, that this file may be overridden by future system updates.\nTo increase the size of the swapfile in Ubunutu 16.04 from 50% to 200% of your total memory size, change this line in /usr/bin/init-zram-swapping\nmem=$(((totalmem / 2 / ${NRDEVICES}) * 1024))\n\nto\nmem=$(((totalmem * 2 / ${NRDEVICES}) * 1024))\n\n\nA: I'm a Fedora 33 user, but I came across this answer when looking for how to configure my zram.

I am a bit of a noob and trying to get ubuntu to run on an usb-stick, but it is painfully slow. If I make a live-usb with no persistence it works great. But if I add persistence it is very slow. Also tried installing on an usb-stick but this is also very slow.\nThis is on my Asus NJ550JK. I have managed to get a live usb with persistence running fine on anonter weaker machine.\nDoes this make sense? Any advice?\n\nA: The most obvious recommendation here is to try a different OS for the live USB. Try Puppy Linux, which is designed for this use case.\nTo speed up Firefox, in case you're just using that, try the recommendation here, which has worked for me: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox_on_RAM\n\n  \n*\n  \n*open about:config in the address bar\n  \n*set browser.cache.disk.enable to \"false\" (double click the line)\n  \n*verify that browser.cache.memory.enable is set to \"true\" (default value)\n  \n*add the entry (right click->new->integer) browser.cache.memory.capacity and set it to the amount of KB you'd like to spare, or to -1 for automatic cache size selection. (Skipping this step has the same effect as setting the value to -1.)\n  \n\nThis tells firefox to not use the disk to cache any files, since reads and writes from the USB are slow compared to a hard disk.\nAnother useful method could be to switch off swap using sudo swapoff -a. This is not advisable for your system as you may not have enough RAM to support the entire OS, but if it fails, it will lead to system instability and will reset on reboot.\n", "Q: Execute command when USB device is added I have a razer deathadder mouse connected to my ubuntu 15.10 laptop.

The command razercfg -p 1 -r 1:1800is tested and works. \nI reloaded the rules with sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger. \nHowever, it does not work. Indeed, udevadm monitor confirms, that this rule does not seem to fire.\nAny idea whats the mistake here?\n\nA: 1) Go into /dev/input/ and query the input devices that are most likely to correspond to your mouse, with the terminal cmd:\n $ udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/input/yr-device-file-name\n\nYou will be able to identify it using the two environment variables (env-var)\n\n\n*\n\n*ID_VENDOR_ID=1532\n\n*MODEL_ID=0016\nper your question (depending on yr device, the 2nd env-var may not show).\n2) Identify the value of the env-var SUBSYSTEM and add it to yr udev rule.\n3) Add the absolute path for the executable razercfg. \nSo yr udev rule should read something like:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"___\", ACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"1532\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0016\", RUN+=\"/path/to/razercfg -p 1 -r 1:1800\"\n\nRemember that udev does not execute in a shell environment, so it may not know  (mostly does not know) of PATHS and other environment settings you may have come to depend on as a login user. That includes printing to stdout (FD1), unless you make provisions for that by correctly setting DISPLAY and exporting it from within the udev rule, i.e. from within a wrapper script that executes razercfg... (See this AU answer for a redacted summary on that particular aspect and read about udevadm on man udevadm if you have not done so already). \nHTH\n", "Q: How can I setup multiple users to connect to an ubuntu server? I have recently been setting up a samba file server.

You can give access to this folder only for one user e.g:\nsudo chown john:john /srv/samba/share/\nBut you can also give access to this folder to certain group that contains people you need to give access to this folder.\nsudo chgrp users /srv/samba/share/ \nor\nsudo chown -R john:users /srv/samba/share/ \n", "Q: Cannot mount pendrive in write mode I have an Odroid XU4 with Ubuntu 14.04 server installed and a Kingston DataTraveler pendrive, which works perfectly on other systems (Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Fedora 23, Mint, Ubuntu 14.04 desktop, Ubuntu 15, etc.). I mounted a pendrive, which I can read from. Now I try to copy files on it, but I got the no permission to write message. I checked with whoami that I am superuser (actually there is only root on the device currently, so it is not possible to be something else). I tried to mount it in read-write mode with the following command:\nmount -o remount,rw /dev/sda /media/kingston-pendrive\n\nI got that you must specify the filesystem type, which is odd, because it recognized NTFS in read mode automatically. By the following:\nmount -o remount,rw -t ntfs /dev/sda /media/kingston-pendrive\n\nI got a not mounted or bad option message. With force:\nmount -o remount,rw -t ntfs -force /dev/sda /media/kingston-pendrive\n\nI don't have any message, I am able to use the cp without error messages, but it does not copy the file.\nI tried out without the remount option too, because I am not sure how it reacts on being unmounted:\nmount -o rw /dev/sda /media/kingston-pendrive\n\nI don't have any error message by mounting the drive, but I got the no permission message by trying to cp.\nWhat is going on here?\nupdate:\nI got a HDD with a SATA-USB bridge. I managed to mount the HDD with mount -o rw /dev/sdb2 /media/asmedia-hdd. I can write on it. It has ext4 filesystem.\nBy the kingston pendrive I have NTFS filesystem. I checked with scandisk, and ntfsfix too. There is no problem with it. It still cannot mount in r/w mode. I don't know why, I suspect the NTFS in the background. I cannot use FAT32 on the long run, because it does not support large files, but I'll repartition it to FAT32 just to verify whether the problem is with the pendrive or with the NTFS filesystem.\n\nA: It turned out that I need to install a special driver for NTFS filesystem. After apt-get install ntfs-3g the mount /dev/sda /media/kingston-pendrive worked properly and I was able to write to the pendrive.\nMore info here: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-mount-partition-with-ntfs-file-system-and-read-write-access\n", "Q: How safe is it to use \"sudo -i\" I have few applications which I need to run on root permission. Am pretty new to Ubuntu, the kind of shortcut I do to gain root access was that I open a new terminal with sudo -i and will launch my applications from that terminal. But I need to be cautious while I was in this terminal since I can accidentally mess up something. \nAm I doing it right here ? am aware of what sudo -i does but my query here is to find any other way that I can achieve this feat or was it only sudo -i\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Not \"safe\" at all. Running a command terminal as root makes everything you do (including mistakes) Very Powerful, and when you try (intentionally or not) to do something dumb, you're not protected by the restrictions placed on non-root users. \nPrograms generally should not require root to run (the exceptions are programs that manipulate the system state: mount/unmount disks, install software, shutdown, etc). From the sparse information in your question, it sounds like you have a permissions problem. Figuring out, and solving the permissions problem should be your first step, running as root should be the infinitely last step (there must be another way)\n", "Q: When will Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 be released?

My computer came with a FreeDOS. It has a 1 TB HDD and 8 GB RAM. Also, it is a 64 bit processor. Sadly the computer / laptop does not have a CD / DVD ROM drive. Fortunately, it has 4 USB ports. The BIOS support UEFI boot mode. \nWhat I wish to do:\nI want to have a system that can dual boot Windows and Ubuntu 15.10. \nWhat are the catches here?\nI can make a Ubuntu bootable USB key easily, using the Startup disk creator. So I did that. I do not know how to make a Windows 10 bootable USB key, for which I possess that ISO image file. \nWhat attempts did I make?\nI took the following steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Installed gparted on an existing Ubuntu system, and formatted an 8 GB pen drive (USB key), in the ntfs format. \n\n*Installed unetbootin and attempted to write the Windows 10 iso file to the pen drive. \n\n*The pen drive fails to boot. \n\n\nWhat do I need to know now:\nI need to know the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to create a Windows bootable USB key from the available ISO file? \n\n*How to install Windows in UEFI mode? \n\n*After Windows is installed which partition mode is to be used for Ubuntu? \n\n*Will 15.10 install alongside Windows, in UEFI mode and how? \n\n\nA: How to create a Windows boot medium is a topic best addressed on a Windows forum, not here. That said, I'd use FAT, not NTFS, and I'd try using Unetbootin for the job, or copy files manually from the UDF side of the .iso image file. (Most Linux tools will mount the ISO-9660 side, which in the case of a Windows disc, contains a text file with a message to the effect that it should be mounted with UDF.)\nIf your goal is an EFI-mode boot of both OSes, you should disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy boot support\" or a similar phrase) in your firmware. The CSM provides BIOS-mode boot compatibility, and as your computer came with FreeDOS (which, AFAIK, boots only in BIOS mode), it's probably active. See this page of mine for more on this subject. Note, however, that if you intend to keep FreeDOS in a triple-boot, your best bet is probably to do a BIOS-mode install of all three OSes; I'm assuming you want to ditch FreeDOS entirely, or at most boot it in a virtual machine.\nOnce Windows is installed, there are hundreds of tutorials for installing Ubuntu. The trouble is that many are poor. One litmus test: If a tutorial tells you to activate the CSM, move on to the next page. (An exception is if this advice applies to certain special cases.)\nHere's some more reading for you, including a couple that will help with Ubuntu installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than the preceding one.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\nA: How to create a Windows bootable USB key from the available ISO file? \nMy preferred option is Rufus as it always work. But as its Windows only, I'd recommend following this guide:\nMake A Bootable Windows 10 USB Install Stick On Linux With WinUSB Fork \nHow to install Windows in UEFI mode? \nMake sure your Ubuntu is installed in EFI mode. And your Windows image should support UEFI as well. Then write that image to an usb disk. Boot the usb device in uefi mode and continue with the installation.\nOnce you install WIndows, your existing Ubuntu installation will most likely to be disappear. But it is not required that you re-install Ubuntu.

I am OVER having to use Windows. My old MSI (GT 680R) was a perfect candidate for dual booting and I found myself in Linux far more than windows. Now I have a new MSI but am a little unsure of the install. I specially ordered it with Win 7 Pro so no UEFI issues, but it has an intel and Nvidia 970M video card in it (yes, it is a laptop). Not sure if the switching tech is out there for Linux to be able to work on this or am I going to be stuck with just the intel if I boot into Linux? Has anyone successfully installed a dual boot to this machine yet? My goal is to dual boot for a couple of months then migrate back to ubuntu totally.\n\nA: I was finally able to install Linux Mint 18 on my 6th gen MSI GS60 ghost pro 002. It would not work until I updated my firmware to the latest (it became available on April 2016 via the MSI website). After installing the latest graphics drivers via the Linux Mint update software, I can even select between my two graphics cards. I was only able to complete the installation using my entire 2nd hard drive (internal hard drive) and you must go to your BIOS and select legacy mode (not UEFI) for it to work.\nEverything via Linux works great.  Dual/external monitor support isn't quite as good as in Windows, but everything else runs even better/faster.\n\nA: Ubuntu has pretty good compatibility with normal (non-hybrids/tablets) computers, even ones that are 14 years old. Newer computers can have issues, but installing the latest Ubuntu version usually avoids any problems. \nAs for your graphics situation, I don't see any potential problems. Once you install and boot Ubuntu, just open the Additional Drivers app and install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. Reboot and you'll be using NVIDIA. If there's a period of time where you don't need performance and want battery life instead, just open the NVIDIA X-server Settings app (might not be the exact name -- searching NVIDIA should find it), go to PRIME Profiles and select the Intel option. There is a way to switch from Intel to NVIDIA for certain apps, like in Windows, but I can't vouch for its stability. The feature is called Bumblebee.\nMy recommendation for you is to install Ubuntu 15.10. 14.04 is LTS, but it might have problems with your computer.\nUse Rufus to burn the ISO to a USB stick.\nThere is a possibility that you'll have some issues with video. If you try to boot the installer and are greeted with scrolling text containing the word Nouveau, you'll need to take an extra step to start the setup. When the options to Try Ubuntu or Install Ubuntu come up, select the Try Ubuntu option and press E. Use the arrow keys to scroll the cursor to the end of the Linux line and type nouveau.modeset=0. Press F10 to boot into the setup.\nYou shouldn't have to put that in after the installation, although you might see the same text. Once you install the proprietary drivers for NVIDIA, this text should disappear.\nThe dual-boot setup should be an option shown in the setup. There are already multiple questions on this site about removing Windows and keeping Ubuntu, so a quick search should find everything you need on that.\n\nA: I have installed Linux Mint 18 on my MSI GS60 6QE GHOST PRO(4K).\nI have a dual boot with UEFI and that works splendid.\nTo get everything to work properly I had to get the 4.8 Kernel of Linux. This was to get the WiFi to work properly.\nAlso I had to patch the bluetooth to get it to work.\nAfter that I installed the nvidia 375 driver. When I start the system after install Cinammon will crash. Go into the Nvidia X Server program and switch to low power mode to use the Intel card and after reboot it will work.\nEDIT:\nThis unfortunately doesn't use the Nvidia driver.

I can click on items just inside the border of the virtual screen, and this works so I know the mouse emulation is sort of working.\nHowever since the cursor is invisible I have no idea where I am clicking when I try to click on something close to the center of the virtual screen.\nWhat do I need to do to make the mouse cursor visible in qemu?\n\nA: It turns out all I had to do was to add -show-cursor to the command line. Additionally I found that adding -enable-kvm reduced the bootup time from 10 minutes to 45 seconds. This version works:\nqemu-system-x86_64 -show-cursor -enable-kvm -cdrom ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso -m 2048\n\nI find it a bit puzzling why this is not turned on by default.\n\nA: The provided answer is a little outdated... at time of writing adding:\n-display default,show-cursor=on\n\ndid the trick.\n", "Q: Why using the command `./myFile a` `a` is intepreted as an input parameter? After compiling a program with g++ -o myFile myFile.cpp I used ./myFile & to execute the program.\nWhen using the ampersand, I understand the program is executing in the background.\nCan someone direct me to the right link explaining what ./myFile a means? I don't understand why using the command a is intepreted as an input parameter.\n\nA: Re-reading your question again I think I understand what you're asking.\nWhatever you type in the command prompt is interpreted by an underlying shell (if you didn't change it, Bash).\nThere is a number of steps Bash goes through before actually running the command:\n\nWhen the shell reads input, it proceeds through a sequence of operations. If the input indicates the beginning of a comment, the shell ignores the comment symbol (‘#’), and the rest of that line.\nOtherwise, roughly speaking, the shell reads its input and divides the input into words and operators, employing the quoting rules to select which meanings to assign various words and characters.\nThe shell then parses these tokens into commands and other constructs, removes the special meaning of certain words or characters, expands others, redirects input and output as needed, executes the specified command, waits for the command’s exit status, and makes that exit status available for further inspection or processing.\n\nWhatever is left to the right of the command delimited by any sequence of the separators contained in $IFS, usually  , \\t and \\n after Bash has went through the steps outlined above is interpreted as an argument to the program: without being technical, this means that each token is made available to the program, which can make use of it the way it wants.\nMore specifically what happens under the hood is that each token is passed as an argument to the execve() syscall which starts the program and becomes available to the program through argv (a pointer to a pointer to a character often included in the declaration / definition of main()), which the program can access in order to retrieve the arguments.\n\nA: The shell processes the parameters.\nThat will prevent the shell from doing it:\n./myFile '&'\n\nSo, the program will get & as a parameter.\nOther example:\n./myFile *\n\nIt'll expand the star into a whole list of the parameters - the file names of files in current directory.\n", "Q: WiFi disconnects for few seconds and resumes In Kubuntu, strangely enough, Wifi completely goes off for about 5 to 30 seconds and then reconnects again.

As if so you can just type ebay.co.uk rather than ebay or ebay.com.\n", "Q: Help with Users in Linux \n\nI need to separate the privileges of two users. One must be able to manage certain folders while the other should manage the rest.\nMy problem is that the root user has all the privileges and could eg change the owner of one of the portfolios managed by one of the users that I have mentioned.\nHow do I remove / disable the root user? Do you get it, it could be reactivated?\nAnd how can I remove any user than can execute a command as root?\n\nA: You should create two users.  \nUser A: can manage certain folders.\nUser B: can manage the rest of the folders.\n\nChange the password to root so only you know it and no one but you can change permissions. \nDo not give root privileges to either user and this way they will be unable to \"reactive\" it. \nThere is NO way to disable root... \n\nA: You will not be able to achieve this. A root user can do anything. Even if a  directory or file is not accessible (like protected with a password or encrypted) for a root user he can delete it, overwrite it just by being root. Heck, he can even format the whole disk if needed. \nAbove makes 2 assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*you are not the admin\n\n*you are talking about your main system\n\n\nThere is always at least one person that can use \"sudo\", or be \"root\" in your words. If that is you: fine, you can arrange those files for those users just by having 2 users, not in the same group and put permissions on their files and directories. If you are not... you are not going to be able to do this on your system itself.\nSecondly, you can achieve what you want with an external disk. You can password protect that disk, or encrypt it, and unmount it when not immediately needed and even take it out of your machine when you are not using it. \n\nA: You cannot remove the root user. It is integral to how Ubuntu works. If you remove all users that can execute a root command, you are not able to install new software or update your computer. You might not be able to shutdown and you can't change some settings.\nHowever, you can limit who has access to root. Any users you add should be \"standard\" users, not \"admin\".\nWith regards to the people who can manage certain folders, you need to add 2 users, each a standard account. Any folder these users create, only they will access it.\nTo change any folder that exists, you need to be root (ironically).\nFirst, open nautilus as root, with this command:\nsudo -i nautilus\n\nThen, navigate top the folder, chose properties, then select the \"Permissions\" tab. Then chose the owner and change it to the person you want to have access. You may also want to change the group.\n", "Q: why Can't I use the internet on mozilla? I've just installed the 14.04 ubuntu version and I the internet on mozilla was working, but now I can't use it.\nI tried to restart the machine, but It hasn't worked so far.\n\nA: have you made any changes to the settings? Especifically, did you set up a proxy or changed the proxy settings? \nYou could - in a first step - ping a server like google (ping www.google.com) and check if you get any response, if so, it shows that your net is working and that it is the browser setting. If not you could try to ping google using its IP address... If that works, then the issue is most likly an issue with the DNS Servers (which are responsible for the resolution of the domain names). \nEither way... it would help to have some more information on that one. You could - of course - also try to open the page with another browser and check if that works. \nHope that helps you. \n", "Q: PCIe Bus Error Severity=Corrected I have installed Ubuntu 15.10 on a HP B&O Pavilion Core i5.

I have reloaded Kubuntu 14.04.3 on the HP B&O Pavilion Core i5. in hopes of correcting the problem.  It did correct the initial problem in that it will now connect to the network without scrolling continuous error messages, but the operating system will not stay connected to the internet.(that is not exactly correct, because the network symbol on the desktop says it is connected to the network) The browser will not connect to the network or internet, after a couple of minutes it says it cannot find the server.  If I restart the computer everything connects, and works.  If I let the computer set, say overnight, it somehow loses the connection.  I can only assume there is some sort of incompatibility between the network adapter and the operating system. The network adapter is; Realtek Semiconductor C., Ltd. RTL8723BE PCIe Wireless Network Adapter.  I will continue searching for an answer.  If anyone has any ideas please don't hesitate to give me a shout.

to be trusted?\nBonus question: If I do indeed only have 1 of 2 cores enabled how do I enable the second one?\n\nA: \n\"based on Intel's info has 2 cores capable of 4 threads each\"\n\nNot quite, it says 2 cores and 4 threads not 4 threads per core, this means it has 2 cores each with 2 threads for a total of 4 threads. \nI have an i3-2100 dual core, it is comparable to yours, the first command\nsudo dmidecode |egrep \"Socket Designation: Proc|((Thread|Core) Count)\"\n\nGives me the same result, 2 cpu cores, each with 2 threads\nlscpu \nsays I have \nCPU(s):                4\nOn-line CPU(s) list:   0-3\nThread(s) per core:    2\nCore(s) per socket:    2\nSocket(s):             1\n\nI think you just misread that because it says 4 cpus but it means the total threads, it is a bad choice of terms, I was confused too when I first looked :). \nYou have 1 socket, 2 cores and 2 threads per core and it reports that as 4 cpus total, so that is correct. \nAs for the 16 logical cores in cat /proc/cpuinfo mine is the same, 4 cpu each with 4 siblings but I had no idea what that means, so I looked it up and found this at server fault\n\nThe number of siblings on a processor is the total number of execution\n  units within that processor.

Following is what I did, if it helps someone else.\nMy machine is HP-Pavilion x360 Convertible. It comes with Windows 10 pre-installed.\nInitially I tried using Sandisk Ultra 3.0 32GB as the LiveUSB. It supports USB 3.0. I tried connecting it to sub 3.0 port as well as 2.0 port, landing with the same error(mentioned in the question). \nAfter, I tried using another Sandisk 32 GB that has dual head, one for smart phone, dont know the name of it. It comes with USB 3.0 as well.\nThis one also gave the same error for 3.0 and 2.0 ports.\nAnd, I tried using the 15.10 image as well in both the USBs, landing in the same error.\nAfter going through a lot of posts once more, I finally bought Sandisk 8GB Cruzer, which  lot of posts says to be working properly. Luckly, it worked for me as well. I installed Ubuntu 14.04.3. \nI installed using the first option of 'Install alongside Windows Boot Manager'. This was done with Secure Boot enabled. That means, I didnt change any UEFI firmware settings other than adding initial 5 seconds delay, so that I can enter the UEFI settings by pressing 'ESC' key at start.\nAfter installation, I ran into the next problem, booting to Ubuntu.\nI could not modify the boot order, with any of the tools (efibootmgr, Boot-repair, EasyUEFI) or commands (bcdedit /set path {bootmgr} \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi). What finally worked was, I started boot-repair, and inside Advanced Options> Main Options, I enabled 'Backup and rename Windows EFI files', and ran the repair boot. This solved the booting problem. Now, after power-on, it goes straight into the Grub menu, with a lot of entries, ubuntu as the first listed. But the default selected entry was 'Windows Boot Manager'. I then updated the Grub file to point to 'Ubuntu', from the Boot-repair.\nI had the next problem, not connecting to wireless networks, rather, wireless connection not enabled. Again, after going though a lot of posts, I disabled bluetooth, and restarted. After restart, I saw the 'Enable Wireless' option, but could not tick it. I used the lspci -vnn command, which I found in a post (not able to find it now). \nAll these solved my problem of getting a proper Ubuntu 14.04 LTS up in my new Convertible. \nHope this might be of some help to someone else.\nI have my next problem, brightness buttons not working. I am going behind that.\nThanks.\n\nA: First, if the computer shipped with Windows 10, do not enable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy boot\"); doing so just complicates the boot path and creates new problems. Disabling Secure Boot will not help, either; given the error message you got, your problem is clearly beyond the point where Secure Boot could be causing it.\nSecond, it could be that your disk was created incorrectly. Try another tool, such as Rufus or Unetbootin.. It sounds like the system can't find the initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs), or that the code it contains can't find the rest of the installation image. I'm not sure of the precise meaning of that message, as it's a bit ambiguous; but it's something that could be caused by an improperly-created USB flash drive. You could also try another USB flash drive, since a failing USB flash drive could be the source of the problem, too.\nThird, a more difficult possible cause is that your disk controller (note: disk controller on the motherboard, not the disk itself) is not yet supported by Ubuntu 14.04.3. You might try Ubuntu 15.10, which has a more recent kernel. (Ubuntu 14.04.4 will use the same kernel as 15.10, but it won't be out for a few days.) The pre-release Xenial images might also help, if you're willing to live on the \"bleeding edge\" for a couple of months.\n", "Q: Windows 10 not seeing my Ubuntu shares I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 15.10 from 14.04.

For z500 lenvo laptop there is a problem with brightness key on windows 8.1 and windows 10; and each one has their own solution. Currently I have windows 10 and for solving the brightness problem you should do a manipulation in intel graphic driver and it's:\n\"Open this file and search \"FeatureTestControl\" and change 0xF000 to 0xF048 (or change it to 0xFFFF if doesn't work)\n[PwrCons_IVB_AddSwSettings]                                   ------>  [PwrCons_IVB_AddSwSettings]\nHKR,, FeatureTestControl,%REG_DWORD%, 0xF000  ------>  HKR,, FeatureTestControl,%REG_DWORD%, 0xF048\"\nafter this my the brightness keys worked perfectly fine then I installed Ubuntu 15.10 and when I pressed the brightness key in this operating system for the first time, everything got dark. and now when I login to windows 10 the brightness key won't work either and the only time I can adjust the brightness is before login into any of this tow OSs ( I mean in the boot page panel).\nand when I go to Ubuntu everything gets dark again but when I login into windows 10 it's same as the adjustment I just made before the login, but still I have no control on the brightness.\nfor solving the problem on Ubuntu I have tried these solutions in this topic:\nMake xconf configuration permanent\nbut for each solution I got an error\nCan anyone save me from this disaster , it's really driving me crazy and I'm new to Ubuntu.\n\nA: That's indeed a tough one, I agree... Here's a possible solution.\nFirst we would have to boot ubuntu in recovery mode ('Advanced options for Ubuntu') and drop to a 'root' shell. \n1.) As you see in the UI menu, the 'filesystem state' is 'read only',so first we would have do remount the '/' (root) filesystem read/write: \nThe command for this is... (as described here) \nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nThat change will not be permanent, but only for the current session.\n2.) Now we try to give the system some default brightness value after boot:\nFor that we ad a basic instruction to a file called '/etc/rc.local'. Open that file \nnano /etc/rc.local\n\nUse the arrow keys and ad the following line just above the 'exit 0' statement. The value '2000' should do but you can change that afterwards. Also this is for Intel GPUs only. For other brands the command would be different.\necho 2000 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nSave the file with < ctrl >X and the 'Y' key.\nMaybe we have to enable the rc.local service\nsystemctl enable rc.local\nsystemctl start rc.local\n\n3.) You can now exit the 'root' shell. Type...\nexit\n\n... and then 'Resume normal boot' from the UI.\n4.) If we are lucky you should now have some brightness in your Ubuntu system. You can now play with the '2000' value in a terminal with something like...\necho 2250 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nIf you found your desired value, change it in /etc/rc.local, to make it permanent (see above).\nsudo nano /etc/rc.local\n\nIndeed that doesn't yet solve your 'brightness key' problem, but you get a working system. I think that's a good start.\n\nA: This one finally worked for me and I cant believe I'm seeing ubuntu with a full brightness :D\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/731991/501740\nBut the only thing u have to notice is that you should remove ur 20-intel.conf file in /usr/share/x11/xorg.conf untill this works\n", "Q: Screen flickers during 3D gameplay on 15.10 So this is not the first time this has happened. I recently installed an Nvidia graphics card, but even before that the screen would flicker from time to time on the Intel HD graphics. Installing the card and the drivers only made it 10 times worse. I've tried installing compiz config and enabling \"Force full screen redraws\", that didn't work. It only happens after a short period of time playing a graphically intensive 3d game, and then it starts flickering every 2 seconds making any game unplayable. It never happens on the desktop. This has frustrated me to the point that I almost want to ditch Ubuntu and find a copy of Windows 7 (considering I just bought this card and I can't even really use it!). Could it be an overheating issue? Is there something else I can tweak in compiz to fix this? Could it be a wrong or incompatible driver? \nFor reference, my card is an ASUS GeForce GTX 750 Ti OC and the drivers were obtained via sudo apt-get install nvidia-352.\n\nA: Possibly this known bug.\nIn compiz config, try unchecking unredirect fullscreen windows and see if it makes any difference. This can be done by opening CompizConfig Settings Manager and clicking on Composite and then the appropriate toggle. Also, go back and select OpenGL and make sure Sync to VBlank is enabled.\nIf that doesn't help, make sure page flipping is enabled: open nvidia-settings > OpenGL Settings, and enable \"allow flipping\".\nDoes increasing GPU performance reduce the flickering?

Unfortunately I cannot see youtube like/dislike ratio because its font with this theme is almost white. This problem rarely concerns option bars on other sites.

Or maybe you could recommend me some other dark theme that would be good for my eyes – not too dark and with low contrast – and without any issues making some program unreadable because of its unsuitable colours?\n\nA: If you are using Xubuntu, open Theme Configuration. If you have only installed Xfce from another desktop environment, then you can paste sudo apt-get install gtk-theme-config in terminal to install. Launch the application and change the top category Custom highlight colors to your preferred colors. Log out and log in again. This should fix the issue on Ubuntu Software Center. \nTo fix the YouTube Like/Dislike text, go to the gtkrc file you downloaded with this theme. I installed for my testing by going here. Then I named the file .gtkrc-2.0 and placed it in my home directory for it to be activated on my system. However, you may have the file in another location. Open this file. Go to the line that starts with gtk_color_scheme (line 60 in my file). Change this fg_color: #EEEEEC to this fg_color: #686A6A or whichever darker color you prefer.

This allows you to quickly boot to your default OS, but provides the flexibility to boot into another installed OS when the need arises infrequently.\nIn order to achieve this, you should add the following line to /etc/default/grub:\n GRUB_FORCE_HIDDEN_MENU=\"true\"\n\nThen create this file in '/etc/grub.d/' named 31_hold_shift, make it executable, and regenerate the grub config file:\nchmod a+x /etc/grub.d/31_hold_shift\nupdate-grub\n\nThat should do the job!\nFind more GRUB Tricks here.\n\nA: While you can uninstall GRUB, that would mean you have to set up another bootloader and is probably not worth it. There is no reason to use another one since you just want the GRUB screen to be hidden.

Press Alt+F2 and paste this before hitting Enter: gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub.\nA text-editor window will open, showing something like:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=”`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`”\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash”\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=”\"\n\nRemove the two #s before GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET. Save the file, open a terminal and run sudo update-grub. Reboot and you should have no GRUB window show up.\nAlso set GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT to 1 to avoid potential problems.

Click the refresh button (blue circular arrow near the top right) and then click save.\n(NOTE: GRUB Customizer does not seem to support EFI/GPT based systems.)\nReboot and see no bootloader.\nSource: http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/06/ubuntu-1404-hide-grub-menu/\n\nA: All the other answers start good, advising you that GRUB is usually there whether you see it or not, you probably shouldn't start taking random potshots at it, and how to restore your system to the 'hidden GRUB' you (presumably) previously enjoyed.\nHowever, they end up going wrong - in making blanket statements that GRUB is always required, when this is just not the case. I guess they're oversimplifying on the assumption that your (XY) question is really 'How do I make things how they were before?', rather than specifically 'How do I destroy GRUB?'. But my concern is that, if not qualified, this response is counterproductive: rather than merely omitting to mention the alternative, they're outright stating there is no alternative.\nSo, for reference, I can say from everyday experience that Debian now ships with a UEFI stub compiled into its kernel, enabling the kernel to be directly booted without any middleman by your firmware, assuming it is a competent EFI-compliant firmware. This is not esoteric knowledge, though neither is it a default. Anyway, unsurprisingly, it looks like this ability is inherited and perfectly usable by Ubuntu, e.g.: How to boot load the kernel using EFI stub (efistub) loader?\nBut again, though this technically matches your question, you might not have been asking what you thought you were asking! You're best to combine this with the other (correct!) parts of the other answers, and decide whether (hidden) GRUB or EFI suits you. The usual disclaimers apply: Don't mess with EFI if you're not technically confident yet. Treat any thread like that link as an example only: customise exactly to the needs of your system. Enjoy!\n\nA: Do not try to remove grub, it is used as the bootloader for Ubuntu, just like the Windows mbr, which you just do not see.\nYou could try to install the program grub-customizer, which lets you define different settings for grub in a simple GUI. You could set the timeout to 0 and tell it to always boot the first entry, so you will directly boot Ubuntu without further input.\nI believe this is also what happens automatically when you install Ubuntu as the only OS.\n\nA: You would need a boot loader anyway. In case you don't like grub, there are others: see comparison of boot loaders.\nBut I wouldn't use a boot loader not supplied with the main distribution. It may give you many headaches in the future when you upgrade the operating system.\nIn case you want to clear a boot loader from MBR (including grub), use le --mmap-rw /dev/sda:0:218 and fill all the space with zeros. You would need LE (text editor). But this procedure won't install another boot loader for you, so the system may become unbootable, if a boot loader is not installed on another disk.\nIn MS-DOS, fdisk /mbr c: can restore DOS boot loader in the MBR.\n\nA: You cannot remove GRUB, this is needed, Windows just show some graphics - a picture. You need something to configure the OS with the correct drivers and set it up correctly. \nThe alternative is \"refit\" and \"refind\". This will show a grey screen with a penguin for Linux, and will allow you to select boot options with your mouse and hide the mess just as on Windows. These are open source projects, it is just to participate and make your own variant, including a neat graphic interface to Grub.\n", "Q: Why can I not sign in on Xubuntu? Recently, I have installed Xubuntu, mainly to run servers (even though I used the one with the graphical interface). When installing, I enabled both Home folder and Disk encryption. When I was trying to have no prompt to enter my user password, a problem occurred when trying to sign in. In order to sign in, I needed to know a password. I tried entering my old one, but when I do the screen flashes black for a second and brings me back to the logon screen. I can use the guest user, but no passwords work with my user, including my original one, and even leaving the box blank.\n\nFrom here, I do not know what to do. My goal is to move the server folder, located on the desktop, to a flash drive to keep the files. However, Home folder encryption takes over and prevents me from doing so. Now is the point where I paste all of my personal information and rely on the internet to solve it. Thanks!\n\nUser name (name of home folder): mralpacamilk \nDisplay name (what appears on logon screen): Alpacamilk\nReal name (what Xubuntu wanted for whatever reason): Henry Silva\nI have had a friend try to sort things out in recovery mode, but he has made little progress.\nHelp.\n\nA: There is an existing bug which causes this login loop issue. Please search it in this forum. I get rid of this kind of issues by undoing the last action and i try to do only action at a time so this way i can undo. Based on the information you have provided it seems that it is a fresh install so your best bet it to re-install. Otherwise as mentioned in the comment - try opening the other virtual consoles(Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F6)\n\nA: I too have faced similar problem. I tried to login and I get back to main screen again.\nTry this:\nCTRL+ALT+F1 to F6 any that is available for you\nNow you login with your user login.\nAfter that you will find in your home directory for that user a file named .Xauthority by, usually you will be on your home directory but you may want to visit it by doing cd ~\nls -la\nWith this you will see the list of files with the correct permission, and that problem occurs when it cannot write to that file. Just remove the file .Xauthority or something like that name and go back to your screen by pressing CTRL+ALT+F7\nTo remove sudo rm .Xauthority\nNow you should be able to login.\n", "Q: Behringer UMC204HD not working on Ubuntu 15.10 I have a Behringer UMC204HD audio interface.

Recently I've had to reinstall Ubuntu Server 15.10 64-bit after wiping my home server due to an insecure password-only SSH server sitting on it for too long. Now, I'm plagued with setting my machine up again and along with it is Samba shares. I'm able to get Samba to correctly share a folder publicly, but I'm currently looking to make only 1 private share available that can only be signed in from the one main user on the machine.\nTestparm gives no errors. Here is my smb.conf file.\nI've made sure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*My user account is a part of the sambashare group.\n\n*I have sudo smbpasswd -a <user> and sudo smbpasswd -e <user> for my username on the machine.\n\n*My username has permission to read and write folders and files on the folder the share is pointed to.\n\n\nTo make sure there are no errors, I've increased the log level in smb.conf and here is the output of an average sudo service smbd restart on /var/log/samba/log.smbd.\nWhenever I go to my Windows machines and go to my server's SMB shares, I see the share \"storage\" appear. Clicking on it makes it load for a tiny second and then it asks for authentication because access was denied. Then, I type in my server's username & password I set up with smbpasswd and it still says access is denied. What am I missing? \nNote: I've installed samba previously on this machine and then immediately purged it after this failure occured. Later, I reinstalled samba and I noted some things were astray. I corrected them and I'm back to this issue again.\n\nA: The CUPS errors are not an issue.  I get those also with my setup and I have no trouble accessing samba shares.\nIs your firewall turned on and if so, is samba being blocked?\nIs the dylanweber user also a regular login id on your system?  Have you tried using your regular login password (if different from what you set for samba)?\nIf you try to access the share directly from the linux box, does that work?  i.e. something like:\n> smbclient //1.2.3.4/storage\n\nfrom a prompt in the 1.2.3.4 host itself logged in as dylanweber\n\nA: The conclusion that I have reached is that I couldn't connect to my share because the version of Samba that is installed with Ubuntu 15.10 (Samba 4.1.17) had a bug that didn't allow it to properly authenticate users. My solution for this problem was installing Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and using Samba 4.1.6 along with it. Now Samba works flawlessly.\nNote: I retried with a fresh copy of Ubuntu Server 15.10 to validate my conclusion and it is clear that Samba 4.1.17 in Ubuntu Server 15.10 is buggy.\nMy recommended solution? Install Debian instead.\n", "Q: What kind of partition do I want to install Ubuntu on?

On the computer connected to the Internet, click the network icon in the panel and go to \"Edit Connections...\" at the bottom of the menu.\n\n2. Double click your Wired Connection (Leave your wireless connection untouched, the one connected to Internet and the one you want to share, as I understand)\n\n3. In the \"IPv4 Settings tab\", select Method: \"Shared to other computers\"\n\n4. Reconnect clicking on the Wired Network so it gets its new IP address. (The two computers must be connected by an ethernet cable for this step, so connect them now if you have not already.)\n5. Click on \"Connection Information\" in the network menu and write down the IP address and network mask (in my case it was assigned 10.42.0.1/255.255.255.0 but I do not know if that will always be the case)\n\nIn the client computer:\n6. Go to \"Edit Connections...\" and assign a \"Manual\" Method. Assign an IP assress in the same subnetwork (10.42.0.69 for example) and put the IP and network mask you wrote down in \"Netmask\" \"Gateway\" and \"DNS servers\"\n\n7. Reconnect to the network to let the new settings be assigned.\n8. Pat yourself in the back and surf away!!!\n\nA: OK I figure it out. It was simple what was I missing is the how to configure the Raspberry Pi eth0 settings. \nHere's what I done.. I did all of steps  1-5 as shown before now I went on to the pi (client side) and typed in\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces \n\nThen I edited that file to look like this. \nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 10.42.0.77\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 10.42.0.1\nbroadcast 10.42.0.255\ndns-nameservers 192.168.0.1 \nPretty simple.

But because I switch often between private and normal browsing, it can get annoying having to dig for a separate folder for all my downloads.\nHow did this happen and How do I change it back to using the default download folder?\nIf ever, can I set separate default download folders for these methods?\n\nA: Accidental fix. Long story short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the url: about:config. It will warn you that it's dangerous. Continue\n\n*Look for browser.download.lastDir. There's a search bar at the top.\n\n*Double-click the browser.download.lastDir row. A prompt will appear.\n\n*Edit as needed. Click Okay. Close your browser to refresh.\n\n\n\nFollowing this link in Mozilla's FAQ, I saw how to alter its variables. Unfortunately, the steps after that didn't correct it, so I searched for other variables.\nbrowser.download.lastDir contained the folder Firefox defaulted to, so I tried changing it. It worked.\nMy other questions haven't been answered yet so I'm open to other, more detailed answers.\n", "Q: Hide files from root in ubuntu My question would be a little bit silly, but who knows because linux is a very rich and sophisticated OS.\nIs there a way that a normal user in ubuntu can hide some files from root ?\nI know that the root has all privileges ans rights. But, if a simple user can keep files from root that would be awesome and very useful for me. \n\nA: You already found out that your administrator (aka root) has all powers to control the system. This includes read and write access to all files on your computer. So from file permissions alone there is no way to prevent root from accessing files in a user's HOME.\nIn order to prevent privacy abuse from root there are a few option only:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not grant root access to people you don't trust that they respect your privacy. As everybody can get root access we also need to make sure only trusted people have physical access to our machine.\n\n*Never store private data on the machine's internal drive or on a local network drive. Use an external medium such as a pen drive or storage in the cloud for that. Lock this drive away from nosy people. Do not store the password to the cloud storage on your computer.\n\n*Use encryption (e.g. ecryptfs) for private data. This will however only work in case your administrator allowed encryption on your account. Also, it will not stop root from deleting your encrypted files but at least they can't read them.\n\n*Do not underestimate the benefits from parental control on your computer. If root is your caring parents then there is all reason to always trust them.\n\n", "Q: (Trusty problem)When installing Ubuntu 14.04 with WUBI shows me a error!

Is there a security risk having fakeroot installed on my system?\nI can't find much more than was is provided in the manpage.\n\nA: Nope. \nfakeroot never has \"real\" root privileges. It is used for example while creating a debian installer. It is then to virtually install an application into the debian installer, not into your \"real\" system.\nA debian installer is actually nothing else but a scaled model of your system, with all the files, docs, manpages, possible libraries and executables inside it, exactly arranged like it will be \"projected\" on to your system if you run the installer.\nThe role as root of fakeroot is then limited to the environment of your .deb file, to be created. It has no privileges to act as the \"real\" root.\n", "Q: I want to install 64bit ubuntu onto my computer currently running 32bit ubuntu I have a viglen genie computer with an intel core 2 duo and 4gbs of ram and it can run 64bit. I currently have 32bit ubuntu and have just found out that chrome will no longer be supported on this and I need chrome. So can I just install 64bit ubuntu from the website and will it work?

Is it possible to make apps run from removable drive like the portable apps in windows? Is there any way of doing so?\n\nA: Maybe yes, maybe no. Insert the USB key, wait several seconds for it to  be mounted, then type mount. It will give you several lines of output, one of which applies to the USB key. On my system (YMMV) this is (for one of my USB keys):  \n/dev/sdb1 on /media/walt/ADATA UFD type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uid=1000,gid=1000,shortname=mixed,dmask=0077,utf8=1,showexec,flush,uhelper=udisks2)\n\nYou hope for the presence of the exec option, and the absence of the noexec option.\nRead man 8 mount to learn what these options mean.\nConsider your school's Acceptable Use Policy.

I have yet to see whether the ext4 partition OS might now even boot up. Doubt it.\nUnfortunately I am not sure at exactly what point access was fully regained, whether the first part of testdisk worked, or e2fsck  which followed it. I gave up some way through e2fsck .............regarding testdisk, one frustration was that it wasn't obvious to me beginner that this is a terminal operated programme, so I wasted loads of time trying to find the installed programme.\nHope this all helps someone.\n\n####################\n\ndetails................\nMade no progress using Ubuntu live CD and the suggested methods - the terminal tasks suggested did not make any progress with accessing/repairing the ext4 partition. A new hard drive was in order, I loaded up Ubuntu, and then looked further at the old hard drive. Its NTFS partition was still fine, but nothing would access the ext4 partition.\nHowever I then tried the test disk programme , and this went through various processes and suggested a certain way of using e2fsck . \nThen the ext4 partition became accessible ?????? so testdisk got me there I know not how, and I could copy all my data across to the new hard drive. \nI think I'm missing my bookmarks and passwords as I can't find them, but I have them elsewhere.\nOne problem suggested online that this can happen when the partition gets very full, but this doesn't appear to my case.\nKnowing very little about OS etc, I just imagine the ext4 format / top of the file 'tree' got corrupted. The disc only had max 2 bad sectors.\nI reckon upgrading through various Ubuntu versions over the years introduced some problems which I was ignoring, or maybe the hard drive has failed in this sector.\n\n#\n\nORIGINAL PROBLEM,,,,,,,I've been using Ubuntu for a few years on a laptop and external hard drive which has two partitions, one for back-up duties (still works fine) and one for Ubuntu.\nSuddenly Ubuntu 14.04 won't boot and I am doing this from Ubuntu on CD drive. The Ubuntu partition shown in Gparted has no file system or mount point defined, and is marked black.\n\n\nMy questions are what may have happened, is the data and Ubuntu OS in this partition likely to still be present or has this partition been cleared, maybe by malware (is that likely?)? How to proceed? I imagine it's not a simple matter of redefining its file system to ext4? \nMost of my data is backed up, and I have spent a couple of hours looking at this, although have limited knowledge of partitions and Grub etc.\n$ sudo e2fsck -n /dev/sda2\nFix?

The super-block is lost but the back-up super-block is still usable. You can try to fix the issue (see later), but you may lose data in the process. That's why you should back up the whole partition first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Perform a back-up to a suitably large target medium of your choice.

Then, to upgrade to newer versions and update the software of the clean install of the old and no longer supported one, I followed the instruction from the answer here: How to install software or upgrade from an old unsupported release?\nOnce I got to Ubuntu 15.10 I removed the kernel options by doing sudo gedit /etc/default/grub & and then sudo update-grub.\nHope this might help :D\n\nA: I hit the same problem and successfully installed 15.10 by setting only one boot option, nomodeset\nAccording to other threads, this option does the following.\nnomodeset\nThe newest kernels have moved the video mode setting into the kernel. So all the programming of the hardware specific clock rates and registers on the video card happen in the kernel rather than in the X driver when the X server starts.. This makes it possible to have high resolution nice looking splash (boot) screens and flicker free transitions from boot splash to login screen. Unfortunately, on some cards this doesnt work properly and you end up with a black screen. Adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded. \n", "Q: TAB key indents entire row instead of only text right of cursor The TAB key is giving me unexpected behaviour in the text editor Kate on Kubuntu 14.04.3 LTS:\nAction\nPress TAB key.\nExpected behaviour\nEverything to the right of the cursor indents.\nActual behaviour\nThe entire row (also everything left from the cursor) indents.\nSystem info\n\n\n*\n\n*Distro: Kubuntu 14.04.3\n\n*Qt: 4.8.6\n\n*KDE Development Platform: 4.13.3\n\n*Kate: 3.13.3\n\n*Kernel: 3.19.0-43-generic\n\n\nI have already triple-checked Kate's configuration but I was unable find anything related to this.

I created a new user account and I show ping speeds around 30ms, and browsing is fast. How can I find out what's wrong with my main account? \n\nA: Probably when the old user account is used to log in, the system launches automatically a bunch of daemons which are greedy in network resources.\nHere's some command that you can run to see if there's anything unusual that pops up:\nnethogs\nnetstat -anp\nps -ef \nnload\niftop\n\nI recommend to try nethogs first, to see if there's anything eating your bandwidth.\n\nA: If the average I/O rates for nload are different between the two accounts, it is likely something loaded at login for the original account.  Nethogs or iftop can help figure out what that is.  Is this true after reboot?  Is this for outbound or inbound ping to/from some standard destination?\n", "Q: Add the folder's name to all `.bin` files in that folder I have spent almost one day and a half searching for this but couldn't find an answer.\nI am looking to add the folder's name as a prefix to all files ending with .bin in that folder.\nSo, if the folder's name is ABC and it contains the files aa.bin, bb.bin, cc.bin, etc. then I need them to be renamed as ABC-aa.bin, ABC-bb.bin, ABC-cc.bin, etc.\nAlso, this folder ABC has subfolders, let's call them: ABC1, ABC2, ABC3, etc. which also have .bin files. For example ABC1 has aa1.bin, bb1.bin, cc1.bin, etc.\nI need that command to go through all folders and append that sub-folder's name to files inside it too. So, aa1.bin will be ABC1-aa1.bin, and so on.\nDirectory structure:\n.\n└── ABC\n    ├── aa.bin\n    ├── ABC1\n    │   ├── aa1.bin\n    │   └── bb1.bin\n    ├── ABC2\n    │   ├── aa2.bin\n    │   └── bb2.bin\n    ├── bb.bin\n    └── cc.bin\n\n\nA: You can do this by using find, basename, dirname and mv commands. For example like in this simple script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor f in $(find ABC -name '*.bin'); \ndo \n  filename=\"$(basename $f)\" \n  dir=\"$(dirname $f)\"\n  lastdir=\"$(basename $dir)\"\n  newname=\"$lastdir-$filename\"\n  newpath=\"$dir/$newname\"\n  mv $f $newpath\ndone\n\nHere I'm using find to recursively find all .bin files in ABC, then iterate over them and extracting the last folder name.

In far most situations, the pragmatic solution is to simply make the setup run automatically on startup (log in actually).\nHow to do that\nIn your situation, DisplayPort-0 obviously represents the left monitor, as we can see in:\nDisplayPort-0 connected 1920x1200+0+0\n\nwhere the last section, +0+0 is the x/y offset of the screen, as explained here.\nThe command to position a monitor looks like:\nxrandr --output DVI-0 --pos 1920x0\n\nIn commands, we should always position monitors from left to right, so the command in your situation is:\nxrandr --output DisplayPort-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DVI-0 --pos 1920x0\n\nHowever, we need a break\nIf we add the command to Startup Applications just like that, it will almost certainly run too early, and either break, or be overruled by incorrect local settings, called afterwards.\nThe complete command, to add to Startup Applications therefore should include a break of appr. 15 seconds:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && xrandr --output DisplayPort-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DVI-0 --pos 1920x0\"\n\nHow to add to Startup Applications\nOpen Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && xrandr --output DisplayPort-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DVI-0 --pos 1920x0\"\n\nNote\nPlease try the command below (without the break) first from a terminal, to see if it runs correctly:\nxrandr --output DisplayPort-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output DVI-0 --pos 1920x0\n\nAlthough I checked well, blind spots and typos are always possible :)\n", "Q: How to fix this API error Checking API: checkpublicapi-last\nChecking API: checkpublicapi-current\nChecking API: checksystemapi-last\nChecking API: checksystemapi-current\nout/target/common/obj/PACKAGING/public_api.txt:1966: error 17: Field android.R.style.TextAppearance_Material_Widget_Button_Inverse has changed value from 16974548 to 16974565\nout/target/common/obj/PACKAGING/public_api.txt:2011: error 17: Field android.R.style.ThemeOverlay_Material_Dialog has changed value from 16974550 to 16974564\nout/target/common/obj/PACKAGING/public_api.txt:2012: error 17: Field android.R.style.ThemeOverlay_Material_Dialog_Alert has changed value from 16974551 to 16974566\nout/target/common/obj/PACKAGING/public_api.txt:2120: error 17: Field android.R.style.Theme_Material_Light_LightStatusBar has changed value from 16974549 to 16974563\n\n******************************\nYou have tried to change the API from what has been previously released in\nan SDK.

Today I faced some problem with cp wildcard command option. I wrote in Terminal this command \ncp Downloads/[:alnum:]  test/\n\nHere, Downloads is the directory from where I want to copy alphanumeric character file to my test directory. But When I ran this command showed me:\ncannot stat ‘Downloads/[:alnum:]’: No such file or directory\n\nI want to know, how I can use above Wildcard Classes for cp command. And Also how I can use above Wildcard Character command. \nWildcards are\n * \n? \n[characters]\n[!characters]\n[[:classes:]]\n\nCommonly used classes are\n[:alnum:]-> Match any Alphanumeric Character\n[:alpha:] -> Match any Alphabetic Character\n[:digit:] -> Match any nummeral \n[:lower:] -> Matches any lowercase letter\n[:upper:] -> Matches any Uppercase letter\n\nHow can I use those Wildcard and its Classes?\n\nA: cp does not support any wildcards by itself. Expansion of wildcards and patterns is done by the shell, which is bash by default.\nIn any case, character classes are to be specified within [] - that excludes the [] already surrounding them. Like so:\ncp Downloads/[[:alnum:]] test/\n\nHowever, [[:alnum:]] will only match a single alphanumeric character. To match all filenames containing only alphanumeric characters can't be done with just the wildcards already listed. For more powerful filtering, look into the find command:\nfind . -regextype posix-extended -maxdepth 1 -regex '.*/[[:alnum:]]*'\n\nWithin bash, you can use extended globs:\nshopt -s extglob\ncp Downloads/*([[:alnum:]]) test/\n\n\nA: [:alnum:] actually matches a single character from the set :, a, l, n, u, m i.e. given\n$ ls\n_?_  123  7  a  abc  :file  fi:le  m\n\nthen\n$ ls [:alnum:]\na  m\n\nTo match a single character from the alphanumeric class [:alnum:] it needs to be [[:alnum:]]\n$ ls [[:alnum:]]\n7  a  m\n\nTo match a single alphanumeric character followed by zero or more arbitrary characters\n$ ls [[:alnum:]]*\n123  7  a  abc  fi:le  m\n\nTo match file consisting only of alphanumeric characters using shell globbing requires extended glob (extglob) syntax\n$ ls +([[:alnum:]])\n123  7  a  abc  m\n\n", "Q: Quickly execute commands without running out of memory I am writing a .Net application that runs on Mono.

For example:\nprocess.OutputDataReceived += (sender, a) => Console.WriteLine(a.Data);\nand replace this line:\nret = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd()\nwith this:\nprocess.BeginOutputReadLine();\n\nAs an alternative you might also simply try adding only process.BeginOutputReadLine() after ret = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd() in your original code (so only adding one line with the call to BeginOutputReadLine).

Depending on what you are running, I would say that is normal. The 69MB are without the cache portion which can be freed at any time when needed.\nTo see which programs are really using the most memory, you should sort by the RES column in htop (hit F6 for sorting).\nBut if you really have memory problems, you may also check if you have any tmpfs mounted. tmpfs resides in the page cache, so free doesn't report it as used memory and you might actually have less than 292MB.\n\nEDIT: Forking services such as Apache tend to use the most memory, especially when the number of client requests goes up. Try reducing the number of threads, maybe switch from prefork MPM to worker MPM (see http://codebucket.co.in/apache-prefork-or-worker/) or use a more light-weight server such as Nginx (see comments below this answer).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 - high ram usage I am writing because I have no idea what going on with my favourite os, Ubuntu 15.10 with the kde desktop.\nThe problem affect ram usage in normal  work (chromium/firefox browser with few cards and flash).

(2 Monitors) Hi everyone so I decided to change to ubuntu 14.04, although I've had some problems (most of which I was able to fix after researching), while I know that linux isn't windows, I want it to save window's positions and sizes. In windows it would save to registry and instantly resize the window in question when it would startup again but in ubuntu it doesn't do that, I've tried to use devilspie and compiz and kde etc but I need something which is automatic like in windows. I need this to be productive.\nFor example if I move firefox to my 2nd monitor and try to maximize it or use the hot corners (or something) when I close it and reopen it again it will startup on my main monitor. I don't want it to do this.\nIf ubuntu can't do this is there another distro I could use that has this feature?\n\nA: Yes, distributions running the KDE environment can do this... One can set positions for windows based on window class, name etc. It needs some practice though.\n", "Q: System directories on separate partitions shown on desktop as #.# GB Volume During the install of Ubuntu studio WW 15.10 (XFCE4), I put /usr/share and /var/www on separate partitions.  As expected they were added to fstab to auto mount on startup.  The strange thing is that the one mounted as /usr/share is on my desktop as \"#.#GB Volume\". It may not hurt anything, but is very annoying.  They are not mounted through /media, /mnt, or /home so they should not be on my desktop if I understand corectly.\nSo why is this happening, and how can I fix this odd behavior?  I do not want to hide all drive Icons from my desktop, I know how to do that, so save your time and please do not suggest it as a solution.\n\nA: Well this is embarrassing, but it helps to make sure you have the right UUID's in the right places in fstab:\nI added the UUID from the partition of /usr/share to another partition (near identical size) that I wanted mounted on startup through /media/..., so I had it in there twice, and got no errors or trouble by doing so!  So it seams you can mount partitions twice, at different mount points and with different names, which just may come in handy if needed.\nWords of advice:  Use partition labels for clarity.  When copying UUID's, check them, check them again, and check them one more time after pasting into fstab, or you may have a lot of work on your hands if the system doesn't boot.  I got lucky this time, checking twice was insufficient.\n\nA: If you are not planning on mounting those partitions in the future, you can create a udev file to hide those partitions from showing up.\nCreate a file in your rules.d folder.  I called mine 10-hide-partitions.rules\nsudo mousepad /etc/udev/rules.d/10-hide-partitions.rules\n\nand I added in the following to hide the partition.  (This one is assuming the partition is /dev/sdb1)\nKERNEL==\"sdb1\",ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\"\n\nafter the file is saved, run the udevadm to activate your changes\nsudo udevadm trigger\n\n\nIf you want to unhide those in the future, change the \"1\" to \"0\".\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: WiFi auto discovery works in Window 10 but does not in Ubuntu 14.04 I have successfully installed ubuntu 14.4 LTS alongside with Window 10 in my new Aspire E15 E5-573G-779S.

I didn't have to edit the grub like a lot of other solutions to this issue.

Googling it I found out that it means \"unstable\" distribution.\nSo what exactly do I have here? Unstable Debian 8? \n\nA: No, you have a distribution which is based on Debian sid / unstable, which is the under development release of Debian.\nThis means that being under development Debian sid / unstable is not guaranteed to be stable at all times; it has a very fast update cycle and it's likely that an update could break stability.\nIt must be noted that one of the characteristics of Debian has always been striving for stability (in fact it's one of the most popular distributions for production servers); calling it \"unstable\" makes sense especially in the context of a rolling-release distribution model where the user should expect things to break suddenly.\nBut that's not what you're using, you're using a  fork of Debian sid / unstable on which Canonical's developer worked to fix potential issues, potentially merging fixes released directly for Debian sid / unstable, in order to make a functional distribution.\nAddin to this, it must be noted that the update cycle on Ubuntu is way different, slower and safer compared to Debian sid / unstable: updates are first uploaded to the dedicated \"proposed\" channel, they are tested for about a week or less and only then they're uploaded to the \"updates\" channel.\nSo you're using a distribution based on the under development release of Debian, on which someone has worked in order to make it useable by the end-user, which has a way different, slower and safer update cycle.\n", "Q: What version Ubuntu should I download i will mostly be using ubuntu for afking multiple games, so my question is, should I get 14.04 or 15.10?\n\nA: Well, if you are going to be using it for developing or \"special\" things, go with 14.04.

Many thanks in advance.\n\nA: The command that adds the repository is\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:archivematica/1.4\n\nIf the add-apt-repository command isn't available on your system, the command won't work, and you will need to run\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\n\nand try again.

There are two ways to fix this. You can either switch to the default GNOME theme, or install Numix, which is sort of like a flat version of Unity.\nYou'll need to install the GNOME Tweak Tool first. Open a terminal and run sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool.\n\n\nUse the GNOME theme \nSearch for \"Tweak Tool\" and open it.\nGo to the Appearance tab. Change the \"Window\", \"GTK+\" and \"Icons\" dropdowns to \"Adwaita\". Relog or reboot and your theme should be GNOME's default. (No more theme issues)\n\n\nInstall Numix \nOpen a terminal and run\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:numix/ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install numix-gtk-theme numix-icon-theme-circle\n\nOpen Tweak Tool.\nIn the same fields as above, select Numix instead of Adwaita.

Sometimes when booting up, I get a message that \"/\" or \"/tmp\" could not be mounted, or else a disk error was detected and a disk check will start executing. Suspect that my old hard drive is beginning to fail. Is there a diagnostic that will indicate if it is the hard drive or the controller that is beginning to fail?\n\nA: If you suspect that your hard drive might be dying, I suggest running some kind of diagnostic software - but only after backing up all of your data! Sometimes this is built into the computer, and can be run by either navigating to the Diagnostic tab in BIOS,\n\nor there will be a key designated for this purpose, which you will have to press at startup.\n\nFor a more in-depth diagnosis, I personally recommend downloading the Ultimate Boot CD, which includes ViVARD - a low-level HDD diagnostic software, which runs on top of DOS.

It is about 13 years old and has the original Windows install.\n\nA: 256MB RAM  is a very little amount of RAM in these days. It's hardly enough to run any kind of modern GUI. Lubuntu  is probably the most lightweight distro of Ubuntu, using the LXDE desktop environment. If you're open to try another distro, there's always Puppy Linux, which needs very little resources\n\nA: I agree that it is very little memory in this day and age. So you may have trouble with Ubuntu. Try the lighter ones and see how you get on.\nIf you are keen to stay with Ubuntu though upgrade to the 512 and try running the live version from USB or cd. This will give you a good indication of how it will run and toy can go from there.\n", "Q: the packet flow from a network interface to a local process? help! I'm read Linux Iptables Pocket Reference. So I do not understand the figures presented. It says that packets travel through chains, and are presented to the rules one at a time and in order. \nThen for instance there is a figure for input for the corresponding tables and chains. \n- mangle : PREROUTING\n- nat : PREROUTING\n- mangle : INPUT\n- filter : INPUT\nI don't really understand. Does this mean that the packet in the mangle state, is presented to a rule, then the same packet goes to the nat table and is presented to a rule, to mangle and a new rule and so on? \nThank you for your help in advance. \n\nA: There is an excellent iptables flow diagram on @bodizazen's web site.\nYes, packets travserse the iptables \"chains\" as per the diagram. However, one must keep in mind some special cases. For example, the nat PREROUTING table is only consulted once per \"NEW\" connection, and thereafter subsequent packets traverse the path forged by the first one.\nA very good way to assist with learning iptables is to place logging rules, with unique identifiers, throughout your rule set, so that you get feedback on packet flow through the rule set for differing scenarios. Combine that with using a packet sniffer such as tcpdump or wireshark, to gain furhter insight into what is going on.\n", "Q: How do disable user list on login screen?

If we want to allow users to execute it with root privileges without having to type a password, we can make a rule like this:\nGROUPONE    ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/updatedb\n\nNOPASSWD is a \"tag\" that means no password will be requested. It has a companion command called PASSWD, which is the default behavior. A tag is relevant for the rest of the rule unless overruled by its \"twin\" tag later down the line.\nFor instance, we can have a line like this:\nGROUPTWO    ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/updatedb, PASSWD: /bin/kill\n\nAnother helpful tag is \"NOEXEC\", which can be used to prevent some dangerous behavior in certain programs.\nFor example, some programs, like \"less\", can spawn other commands by typing this from within their interface:\n!command_to_run\nThis basically executes any command the user gives it with the same permissions that \"less\" is running under, which can be quite dangerous.\nTo restrict this, we could use a line like this:\nusername    ALL = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/less\n\nIf you are simply wondering what kind of privileges are defined for your username, you can type:\nsudo -l\n\nsource of article\n", "Q: text between 2 words with some lines before patterns how can I find lines between two words with 3 lines before START_WORD in sed or grep or ...\nfor example output from a command is:\nmy name is\nMansour\nand I confuse to\nuse sed\nor grep for\npiping my command output\nto get \nmy ideal output\n\nand I want my out after piping the command with sed or grep on START_WORD=command and END_WORD=ideal:\nand I confuse to\nuse sed\nor grep for\npiping my command output\nto get \nmy ideal output\n\n\nA: You can do:\ngrep -Pzo '(?s)\\n\\K([^\\n]*\\n){3}[^\\n]*command[^\\n]*\\n.*?\\n[^\\n]*ideal[^\\n]*(?=\\n)' file.txt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-P enables Perl Compatible Regex, -z makes the input data separated on ASCII NUL rather than usual newline, -o lets up take only matched portion\n\n*(?s) is DOTALL modifier, this enables us to match newline (\\n) with . token\n\n*\\n\\K([^\\n]*\\n){3} matches \\n at first and then discards the match \\K, ([^\\n]*\\n){3} matches three lines before line containing command\n\n*[^\\n]*command[^\\n]*\\n.*?\\n[^\\n]*ideal[^\\n]*(?=\\n) matches all lines starting from line having command till the line containing ideal\nExample:\n% cat file.txt\nmy name is\nMansour\nand I confuse to\nuse sed\nor grep for\npiping my command output\nto get \nmy ideal output\n\n% grep -Pzo '(?s)\\n\\K([^\\n]*\\n){3}[^\\n]*command[^\\n]*\\n.*?\\n[^\\n]*ideal[^\\n]*(?=\\n)' file.txt\nand I confuse to\nuse sed\nor grep for\npiping my command output\nto get \nmy ideal output\n\n\nA: Another way using Perl:\nperl -ne 'BEGIN{ my @buffer } unshift(@buffer, $_); splice(@buffer, 4); if(/\\bcommand\\b/) { print(reverse(@buffer)); while(<>) { print(); /\\bideal\\b/ && exit } exit }' file\n\n\n\n*\n\n*n: causes Perl to assume the following loop around your program, which makes it iterate over filename arguments somewhat like sed -n or awk:\nLINE:\n  while (<>) {\n      ...             # your program goes here\n  }\n\n\n*-e: may be used to enter one line of program.\n\n*BEGIN{ my @buffer } unshift(@buffer, $_); splice(@buffer, 4); if(/\\bcommand\\b/) { print(reverse(@buffer)); while(<>) { print(); /\\bideal\\b/ && exit } exit }: inserts the current line at the start of a buffer and truncates the buffer to a length of 4; if the current line contains the word command, prints the buffer in reverse order and iterates through all the remaining lines printing them; if a printed line contained ideal or the end of file had been reached, exits.\n\n\n% cat file\nmy name is\nMansour\nand I confuse to\nuse sed\nor grep for\npiping my command output\nto get \nmy ideal output\n% perl -ne 'BEGIN{ my @buffer } unshift(@buffer, $_); splice(@buffer, 4); if(/\\bcommand\\b/) { print(reverse(@buffer)); while(<>) { print(); /\\bideal\\b/ && exit } exit }' file\nand I confuse to\nuse sed\nor grep for\npiping my command output\nto get \nmy ideal output\n%\n\n", "Q: Load full screen image on boot and then close it Is there any way (maybe with ImageMagik or something) to load a full screen image from a shell script and then close it?\nI have a media PC that loads kodi, mythTV and a few other things. I was hoping that rather than show the desktop etc, I could hold off loading kodi until everything is ready, and just show a full screen image rather than the desktop. So the shell script (that would be in the startup items) would look something like:\n#!/bin/bash\n#first load the image full screen\ndisplay -options here ~/Pictures/loader.jpg\n\n#do other stuff here and sleep if required\nloadstuff\nsleep 10\n\n#close the image\ndisplay -close orwhatever\n\n#load kodi\nkodi &\n\nI currently have everything working, the only issue is it sits on the desktop for 5sec (while another application, AndroMouse runs) and then loads kodi, which then waits for mythTV to start before loading the PVR plugin.\nI want to not show the desktop (if I don't load AndroMouse you never see the desktop, goes straight to Kodi), instead I want to show a full screen loading image, and I will just get Kodi to wait loading until myth is done.\nHow can I load the image full screen before anything else (before as much as possible) and then take the image down again when I get to that part of the script?\n\nA: OK, for now I have something that works, if someone comes up with a better solution (and explains why it is a better solution) I will accept that answer.\nSo I use eog (Eye of gnome), and to launch it use this command:\neog -f -w -g ~/Pictures/loader.png 1>/dev/null 2>&1&\n\nSo this loads the the image loader.png from the Pictures directory in the home directory into eye of gnome. It uses the options of -f (full screen), -w (single window mode) and -g (not a gallery) as it loads. Single window mode then allows you to launch it as many times as you want (to bring it back to the foreground) without opening it for a second time.\nThen there is the \"1>/dev/null 2>&1&\" after it. This basically puts all errors to the one output and pipes that output to NULL so that no errors are fed back to the script making the call (as this causes issues with that script). The & at the end just makes it run its own thread so your not waiting for it to close before going on to the next part.\nWhen you want to get rid of the image, you can just use the call:\npkill eog\n\nNOTE: This will kill any instances of eog, so make sure you are not using eog anywhere else at the time (or any scripts etc that have eog in the name).\nSo to put this together in a sample .sh file, you could do:\n#!/bin/bash\n#set the image to use for the loader\nloadImage=~/Pictures/loader.png\n\n#load the loader image\neog -f -w -g $loadImage 1>/dev/null 2>&1&\n\n#load any other apps required\n~/scripts/andromouse/andromouse.sh 1>/dev/null 2>&1&\n~/scripts/startMyth.sh 1>/dev/null 2>&1&\n\neog -f -w -g $loadImage 1>/dev/null 2>&1&\n\n#launch kodi over the image and then get rid of the image\n~/scripts/startKodi.sh\nsleep 5\npkill eog\n\nexit\n\nThis will put the image up, start whatever background programs etc you need, launch Kodi, wait 5 seconds and then close the image. The reason for waiting the 5 seconds is to make sure Kodi is on the screen before getting rid of the image. Kodi loads over the top anyhow (as long as you don't make the call to eog after the launch Kodi command).\n", "Q: How to Copy my entire Ubuntu OS into new laptop for installing along with all data and programs installed What I require is to make an exact copy of my existing Ubuntu installation along with all data and applications into a new laptop.

Please check if this is the case first. If not, we need to find another identifying string.\nHow the script works\n\n\n*\n\n*Once per two seconds, the script checks if VPN is running by checking if the sctring <OpenVPNserver> is in the output of:\nroute\n\n\n*(Only) if so, the script checks if the application is running, with the command:\npgrep <application>\n\nand kills it if so, with the command:\nkill <pid>\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nimport time\n\napp = sys.argv[1]\n\ndef check_ifrunning():\n    # check if connection is up or down\n    get_routeinfo = subprocess.check_output([\"route\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n    if \"<OpenVPNserver>\" in get_routeinfo:\n        try:\n            pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", app]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n            subprocess.Popen([\"kill\", pid])\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n            pass\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(2)\n    check_ifrunning()\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*First open a terminal, run VPN like you are used to and check if the string <OpenVPNserver> occurs in the output of the command\nroute\n\n\n*If so, Copy the script above into an empty file, save it as prevent_run.py\n\n*Test- run the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/prevent_run.py <processname>\n\n(I tested it for example with the command python3 /home/jacob/Bureaublad/prevent_run.py gedit)\n\n*If all works fine, add it to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add.

After searching online, I installed Samba and connected my other Windows pc with my Ubuntu desktop.\nWhen I shared files from the server to my PC, I had permissions errors. After looking around, I found that a chmod 777 on my media folder (movies and series) unlocked it. \nSince then, I searched a bit more about the permissions (777 in particular) and I realized that this opened the read write and execute options for everyone. \nMy question is whether 'everyone' specifies the people on my network, i.e. me and my wife, which would be no fuss for me because I know she won't mess up anything, or if 'everyone' goes out to EVERYONE, hence I have opened Pandora's box and I need to shut it off fast. \nIf the second is the case how do revoke the chmod 777 on that folder without causing any harm?\n\nA: Everyone means everyone that is able to visit your system from walking up to the machine to anyone outside on the internet visiting a website you host, or ssh tunnel you set up to your system. Or abuse a backdoor in your router (Netgear, NMX300 1.5.0.11 as an example). \nThe way to revoke it is by executing the same command with less privileges. In general \"750\" for directories and \"640\" for files can be enough. You can combine the \"chmod\" with a \"find\" so you can alter these settings based on if it is a file or a directory. \nYou issue these 2 commands from the directory where you need to change anything below that directory: \nfind . -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \\;\nfind . -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \\;\n\n(-type f is for files, type d is for directories)\n\nA: \"Everyone\" means code running as any user on your machine both human users and server daemons.\nMost server daemons have access controls of their own. So making something 777 doesn't generally open it to the whole world but what it does mean is you lose defense in depth. If you are (for example) running a webserver and the web server has a security flaw they can read and write your files.\n", "Q: ubuntu 15.10 default editor doesn't work for sftp remote files I installed a different text-editor in Ubuntu 15.10 but nautilus (and nemo) still open files with gedit...\nIn the \"file properties\" -> \"Open with\" there is already setted as default.\nI'm trying to open sftp files from nautilus.\nI already tried with leafpad but the result is exactly the same.\nWhat I must do?\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: For we it works when doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*right click on the file\n\n\n\n\n\n*choose \"open with...\" from the contextual menu\n\n*choose \"other application\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*click on \"View all applications\" button\n\n*pick up Sublime Text\n\n\nDoes it works for you?\nAnother solution is to use the file property dialog box.

Is there any other option.\n\nA: Well, there are several options to access Ubuntu GUI from a Windows machine...\n\n\n*\n\n*Teamviewer is pretty good, secure and user-friendly but it takes HUGE amounts of RAM on the Windows Machine (never bothered to look on the linux part but I guess it's not much better).\n\n*VNC (real, tight, tiger...) is incredibly lightweight, fast and easy to use but, because of it's pretty weak security, it should only be used within well-secured LANs\n\n*X2go is, IMHO, a pretty good compromise and my personnal favorite (thought it does NOT work correctly with Unity, but LXDE, MATE or XFCE will work perfectly, please make sure you install one before you continue).\nNote that the Windows client is 32bit and won't work on 64bit-only architecture (Itanium...) but that's kinda specific.\n\n\nHere is a small Howto deal with the somewhat tricky installation of X2go for Ubuntu Trusty (14.04 LTS), based on my own experience (ymmv)\nBefore even starting, check your /etc/apt/sources.list file with your favorite text editor (sudo it, of course).\nMake sure that, among the deb http://whatever.ubuntu.something/ubuntu trusty lines, at least ONE must end with main universe.\nIf you're not sure, or if no line seems to match and you freak at the idea of messing up , just add the following line:\ndeb http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main universe\nSave and sudo apt-get update\nNow, let's start\nFirst, make sure you can add the repository:\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n(this should tell you last version is already installed but better be sure than sorry)\nNow add the repository\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:x2go/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nNow, let's install X2go:\nsudo apt-get install x2goserver x2goserver-xsession\nIf you have installed LXDE, you may add the x2golxdebindings package (there is also a x2gomatebindings for MATE, but not yet for XFCE, which is not a very big deal anyways).\nThe X2go Windows client installer can be downloaded here (there's also clients for Mac OS X if you need it):\nhttp://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start \nConfiguring the client is easy: server address, username and session type (LXDE, XFCE or MATE ar recommended: others are note working proprely, as said before).\nYou will probably have to accept a SSH key on your first connection.\nNOTE: upon connection your client may get an error stating stdin is not a valid TTY.\nIn that case, get on the server and sudo edit your root's .profile and locate a single line stating mesg n.\nDelete that line and replace it with the following:\nif 'tty -s'; then\n  mesg n\n  TTY=\"tty\"\nelse\n  TTY='not a tty'\nfi\nSave, exit and\nsudo /etc/init.d/sshd restart\nto apply changes.\nShould work\n\nA: Install x11vnc. Here is an installation guide for it:\n\nIt is possible to share your X desktop, in a Windows way with x11vnc: install it with `sudo apt-get install x11vnc and run it with\nx11vnc -display :0\n\nx11vnc will print something like\nThe VNC desktop is:      escher:0\nPORT=5900\n\nNow you can simply connect to your desktop with vncviewer on port 5900.\nIt is even possible to connect the viewer automatically (very useful for bypassing firewalls) with:\nx11vnc -display :0 -connect host:port\n\nwhere host has a listening viewer on port, for example ultraVNC supports this feature.\nNotice that it is important to deactivate any 3D software on your desktop as x11vnc obviously cannot transport OpenGL graphics.\nIt even has a graphical interface.\nx11vnc -gui\n\nAlso notice that it would be very easy to make an automatic remote control script for assisting people on Linux. On your side, open a port in your firewall and run vncviewer in listen mode. On the client side, send him a shell script that checks if x11vnc is installed and runs x11vnc -display :0 -connect you:your-port.\n\n", "Q: Mouse scrolling weird/unresponsive in virtual box I'm using virtual box 5.0.14 and I've installing guest additions and the extension pack.

My pen broke and ict delivered a new pen. But the wrong pen. An inking pen (number 7 in the Wacom settings panel) which has no buttons at all.\nBut I like the pen. It's easy, robust and better for drawing. But I cannot map mouse buttons and mouse wheel options to the buttons on the tablet itself.\nSo, after some searching, it turned out it's possible to use \nxsetwacom \n\nOk, nice. So it took a while and was able to bind all I wanted (not necessarily to the most logical buttons, but that seems to be a bug). \nNext boot: settings gone. Only the settings set in the Unity Settings Panel were still there. Odd. You can set 'Send Keystroke', 'None', 'Switch Monitor' or 'Show On-Screen Help'. With 'Send Keystrok' you cannot map mouse clicks or mouse wheel (which would be ideal for the ring..).\nI could use the Wacom Settings panel from Unity if it were possible to set mouse clicks and scroll wheel functions. \nThat's not possible.\nSo, I was wondering, is there a way to see the configuration file from the Unity settings and/or which config file does it use? So I could set the settings straight into that file. I don't seem to be able to find it...\n\nA: No, you have to call your script that set buttons by hand or automatically every time you connect your tablet.\nI have a script that I published in Wacom button and mouse button setting; to execute it automatically when the tablet is inserted:\ndrop in /etc/udev/rules.d/ the file 99-wacom_local.rules\nwith content:\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"056a\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"0084\", RUN+=\"/home/romano/software/scripts/wacom_set_xournal_auto\"\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"056a\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"0302\", RUN+=\"/home/romano/software/scripts/wacom_set_xournal_auto\"\n\n...and fine-tune your codes for your tablet id, that you can obtain with lsusb (and obviously the path of your personalization script). \nReferences here: http://www.techytalk.info/udev-rule-to-run-script-after-plugging-in-usb-device-on-ubuntu-linux-operating-system/ \nYes, not user-friendly at all. \n", "Q: I can't get the `cp` command to work In the terminal, when I issue the cp command, it states:\nThe program 'cp' is currently not installed.

I'm using Ubuntu 15.10. I have noticed a weird problem. \nWhen running a rsync command embedded in a shell script (as root) with --exclude={} options, rsync works and excludes paths as it's supposed to when I launch it as root via \n./rBackup.sh\n\nHowever, when I run it as root via \nsh rBackup.sh\n\nthe exclude directory options do not carry over, and it infinite loops when backing up the drive it's backing up to in /media/. Why?\nEdit - this is not a sh / bash difference - or shouldn't be. I have #!/bin/bash as the first line, so when running via \"sh *.sh\" it should use the bash interpreter - at least, in theory.\nScript is as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nStandbyMount=\"/media/astump/sdb2\"\nmount /dev/sdb2 $StandbyMount\nrsync -aAXv --exclude={/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found,/etc/fstab,/boot/grub/grub.cfg} --delete-before / $StandbyMount\numount $StandbyMount\nrm -fr $StandbyMount\n\n\nA: When you run\nsh rBackup.sh\n\nthe script rBackup.sh is being run by sh (dash) which does not support brace expansion.\nOn the other hand, when you do\n./rBackup.sh\n\nthen the #!/bin/bash first line specifies the exact interpreter to use. It happens that bash supports brace expansion.\nIf you don't include a valid executable in the shebang line, you are simply running the script under the current shell you are in (or sh depending on the shell implementations).\nExample: From bash:\n$ cat scr.sh \necho {bar,spam}\n\n$ sh scr.sh \n{bar,spam}\n\n$ ./scr.sh \nbar spam\n\nMy login shell is zsh. Here are some points to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*While at zsh, ./scr.sh is being sent to sh(dash)\n\n*While at bash, ./scr.sh is being sent to bash\n\n*While at ksh, ./scr.sh is being sent to ksh\n\n*While at dash, ./scr.sh is being sent to sh (dash)\n\nTo be on the safer side always try to mention the desired interpreter using shebang (first line of the script) e.g.:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n\nA: Keep in mind that sh actually calls dash, which is limited compared to, say, Bash.\nAs was observed by @Serg in a comment on the question, the curly braces are being interpreted as inputs to dash, possibly, which is why it won't work.  This is why it's failing - Dash doesn't do Brace Expansion.\nYou're probably expecting the system to use Bash style interpretation.  If you are using a default shell of bash then executing the script with ./rBackup.sh will, I believe, execute it in that running shell.\n\nI think you're expecting that this script will be processed by Bash, which won't work when you do sh.\nSo let's do a couple things differently here:\n(1) Define #!/bin/bash at the beginning, to make it use Bash when executed directly.\n(2) chmod +x rBackup.sh - This will set the executable bit\n(3) Execute the command only with ./rBackup.sh or bash ./rBackup.sh or bash rBackup.sh.  This will ensure Bash is used to interpret the function in all cases; since it defines to use #!/bin/bash at the beginning of the file if you did step 1, it will try and use Bash when executing the script.\n", "Q: Cannot find ld when non-root user I have an autocompile program available on a website that I am running.

I attempted to make bootable USB drive on the Debian box by running as root the command `dd if=/path/to/ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-i386.iso of=/dev/sdb'.  \nThis did create a bootable drive that started the Ubuntu installer on the Dell.  There was an Ubuntu splash screen and the color-changing dots, after which the installation failed in two different ways.  The first way was that the screen showed a black-and-white, elongated checker-board pattern and drive activity seemed to cease.  No questions were ever asked by the install program.\nThinking that the ISO was specific to the Thinkpad, I downloaded the same file on the Dell and wrote it to the pendrive using the site and EXE program Universal USB Installer.  This failed in a screen that was poorly rendered in the top half with text \"Username\", \"Password\", and \"Remember me\" and static on the bottom half.\nI've searched for any forum posts with the keywords \"latitude d620\" and \"failed install\" and all I find are a few posts about wifi driver issues.

If that doesn't work (as it did for me), press Ctrl+Z, then run kill -9 %1 a couple times to kill it off for good.

Run the Ctrl+Z and kill -9 %1 thing above to get back to the prompt.\n\n*Run dpkg --configure -a, and observe it hangs with the same Started Braille Device Support. message as apt-get upgrade. However, Ctrl+C works this time to return to prompt.\n\n*Search around for \"ubuntu started braille device support\". Find out from this debian accessibility page that it has to do with brltty.\n\n*Run apt-get remove brltty, maybe it'll make the problem go away.\n\n*Rerun dpkg --configure -a and notice that it still hangs, but this time, there's no message about Started Braille Device Support. OK.\n\n*Run strace dpkg --configure -a, and observe that the process is stuck on a wait4(...) call to a subprocess.\n\n*A couple strace lines upwards, note that the process writes the file /var/lib/dpkg/info/apport.postinst (or something similar, IIRC).\n\n*less the above file, and see it's attempting to restart a boot service. Posit that since we're in recovery mode and the init system hasn't run to completion, that's going to be awkward.\n\n*Run pstree, and see that dpkg --reconfigure -a did indeed fork to a bash thing, which then forks to perl, and finally systemctl, which does restart boot services, and may be confused.\n\n*Note that the postinst script doesn't have set -e in it, so maybe we can kill the hung command inside of it, so the shell script finishes and dpkg moves on.\n\n*Open another screen prompt, run killall systemctl, switch back, and see that dpkg did indeed move on. Great. It's stuck in the same place again though, on a different package.\n\n*Run killall systemctl again until dpkg exits.\n\n*Run apt-get dist-upgrade again, see that it says everything is up to date. \n\n*Cross my fingers, and reboot.\n\n\nMiraculously, the system recovered, and so far has no issues.\nSo, it's not a complete reduction (why does systemctl hang in recovery mode?), nor is it likely generally applicable, but this hack and the process to discover it may help somebody who arrives at this page through a web search like I did.\n", "Q: Out of Memory Issue I am running Ubuntu 14.04LTS on a Dell PowerEdge R730 with 32 GB of RAM and an Nvidia K80 GPU..  I have a python script that runs for a long time, but really just makes a bunch of relatively short-lived system calls to other programs (some of which use CUDA extensively in case that matters)..  Other than the overarching python script, the individual system calls only run for about 45 seconds a piece, and the python script itself doesn't \"maintain\" anything - it just does the system calls and iterates - not any storage of results, etc..\nAs I watch the program run and monitor memory usage with \"top\", I see the reported \"free\" memory go down over time..  I understand this isn't usually a concern due to caching being employed.  Eventually, though, the machine hangs and doesn't respond in any way (i.e. no mouse cursor movement on console, no response from remote terminals, etc)..  When this happens, I have to hard reboot the system, and things are back to normal, and I can pick up where I left off, until it hangs again..\nAnother point of interest - after enough reboot-and-restarts the program finally completes..  Again, after this, there is nothing of significance running on the system, however, the gnome-system-monitor and top both report almost full memory usage, and trying to run other (minimal) commands are often \"Killed\" by the kernel..  Checking the system logs, it reports \"out of memory\" which seems to indicate that the memory being used is not cache but memory that is actually \"claimed\".  The question is - by who?  Checking all the memory utilities that people have mentioned on this and other forums, no processes claim to be using much memory..  \nI've read reports of kernel memory leaks, and that's what I want to claim, but it just seems unlikely..  \nQuestion:  How can I determine what is claiming all the memory?  I'd like to be able to determine if its in the kernel or if its some process that running.\nSupporting Infomation:\nuname -a:\nLinux machinename 3.19.0-47-generic #53~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jan 18 16:09:14 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nlscpu:\nArchitecture:          x86_64\nCPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\nByte Order:            Little Endian\nCPU(s):                8\nOn-line CPU(s) list:   0-7\nThread(s) per core:    2\nCore(s) per socket:    4\nSocket(s):             1\nNUMA node(s):          1\nVendor ID:             GenuineIntel\nCPU family:            6\nModel:                 63\nStepping:              2\nCPU MHz:               1200.351\nBogoMIPS:              5993.09\nVirtualization:        VT-x\nL1d cache:             32K\nL1i cache:             32K\nL2 cache:              256K\nL3 cache:              10240K\nNUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-7\n\nPrior Reading and understanding:\n  I've read through a ton of posts about understanding Linux's memory usage and reporting.. I understand that when programs like top report very little memory \"free\" it is not necessarily a problem because much of the \"used\" memory is cached, and actually having your RAM full of cached stuff is good..  I believe, however, that this is not the issue that I am seeing, because if it were cache it seems like programs would be able to make use of it.  The fact that the kernel is stepping in and killing new processes and dmesg is reporting the system is \"out of memory\" seems to indicate memory is being occupied in a non-cache way, but it doesn't seem to be being reported in any memory analysis tool I have tried..\nUpdate:  Based on an answer below, I looked at /proc/meminfo when things were starting to go poorly, and while I don't know what all these mean, there are a few that seem .. suspect..  \"DirectMap2M\" seems way problematic and \"VmallocChunk\" too, although less so...\n> cat /proc/meminfo\nMemTotal:       32828728 kB\nMemFree:          166568 kB\nMemAvailable:     100656 kB\nBuffers:            6520 kB\nCached:            27416 kB\nSwapCached:          300 kB\nActive:            17904 kB\nInactive:          16076 kB\nActive(anon):        360 kB\nInactive(anon):      212 kB\nActive(file):      17544 kB\nInactive(file):    15864 kB\nUnevictable:          32 kB\nMlocked:              32 kB\nSwapTotal:      33452028 kB\nSwapFree:       33317332 kB\nDirty:                 0 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:           484 kB\nMapped:            23276 kB\nShmem:               144 kB\nSlab:             559236 kB\nSReclaimable:      60016 kB\nSUnreclaim:       499220 kB\nKernelStack:        8864 kB\nPageTables:        10132 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    49866392 kB\nCommitted_AS:    1143048 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:      358064 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34342563088 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:         0 kB\nCmaTotal:              0 kB\nCmaFree:               0 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:    32637928 kB\nDirectMap2M:    18446744073709318144 kB\nDirectMap1G:     3145728 kB\n\nUpdate2 Just ran things again and had the cmd \"free\" get captured every 15 seconds..  I watched the free column go down as the program ran until it reached a very low value (about 190000) and when it reached that level, the program hung and everything started going very slowly..  I ctrl-c'ed the program after it hung for a bit and eventually the terminal responded and took me back to a prompt..  However, \"free\" still reports about 190000 in the free column and even general use (just typing in a terminal) is very slow - no program is currently running.  Looking at /proc/meminfo, the \"DirectMap2M\" field is crazy again..  I did capture the contents of /proc/meminfo regularly as well and can take a look at how things changed over time.\nFYI: here's the output of \"free\" command when things hung up:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:      32828728   32636496     192232          4       7368      22972\n-/+ buffers/cache:   32606156     222572\nSwap:     33452028     205160   33246868\n\nHere's a plot of the DirectMap2M value from /proc/meminfo over time.  After the right-most point in the plot, it went to the ridiculous huge value - looks like an underflow..  A little bit of googling found others with an underflow issue here..  I don't know what DirectMap2M represents though..\n\nUpdate 3:  Still fighting this.. Some recently discovered info to add:\nWe've got it down as much as we could to this:\n#include \"cublas_v2.h\"\nint main() {\n  cublasHandle_t handle;\n  cublasCreate(&handle);\n  cublasDestroy(handle);\n  return 0;\n}\n\nEvery time we run that on the Dell T630 with the NVidia K40, we see DirectMap2M go down.  If we do it enough, we see the underflow issue and the machine has to be rebooted..  We also have a Dell R730 with an NVidia K80 that shows the same behavior..\nInterestingly, we have yet another computer (its a laptop with an NVidia GTX980M) running the same Ubuntu kernel and we do not observe this behavior when we run the above..  \n\nA: A good place to start is to track the statistics in /proc/meminfo, this has a considerable amount of detail on global memory utilisation.  I suggest capturing the output from /proc/meminfo periodically (say every 30 minutes or so) and one can then examine this to see where the memory allocation growth is occurring.  From that, you will have at least some idea on where to look next.\n\nA: We experienced the same problem with CUDA jobs running on Debian Jessie machines with GTX 970 and GTX 980Ti GPUs. Your test case also caused our machines to run out of memory within minutes.\nWhat eventually fixed this annoying behavior for us was to install the most current beta driver from nvidia - version 364.12 at the time of writing. It appears to be independent of the Linux kernel (we tried several) and the CUDA version (we also tried several). This appears to have been a bug in the nvidia driver itself that was fixed only recently.\n", "Q: ntp.conf error. unexpected T_String, expecting T_EOC Having a problem with my NTP server.

This question is also related.\nSo, when my WiFi is on and connected and I run nmcli nm I get:\nRUNNING         STATE           WIFI-HARDWARE   WIFI       WWAN-HARDWARE   WWAN      \nrunning         connected       enabled         enabled    enabled         enabled   \n\nIf I then close the lid (sleep) and open it again (wake up) and run the command again, I get:\nRUNNING         STATE           WIFI-HARDWARE   WIFI       WWAN-HARDWARE   WWAN      \nrunning         disconnected    disabled        disabled   enabled         enabled   \n\nSo the WIFI-HARDWARE and WIFI statusses changed from enabled to disabled.\nRunning man nmcli gives options I can use with nmcli nm and shows that I can switch WIFI on using nmcli nm wifi on, however if I run this it doesn't change the status of WIFI-HARDWARE or WIFI.\nI think I can use a bash script and nmcli to fix this, but am not quite sure how. The original question says the following script:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase \"${1}\" in\n        resume|thaw)\n        nmcli nm sleep false\n                ;;\nesac\n\nshould be placed in /etc/pm/sleep.d, this does however not fix my problem.\n\nA: I was having the same problem on 16.10 where my Wifi would not reconnect after resuming.

I have a multi threaded Java program.\nIdeally it should run once and successfully terminate.\nUnfortunately, sometimes one of the threads crashes, such as by throwing\nDivisionByZeroException.\nSince the program is useless unless all threads are running, I would like to completely restart JVM (and the program) whenever one of the threads is down.\nQuestion:\nhow do I write a shell script which would do that?\nThe pseudo code for the shell script that I am looking is:\n#bin/bash\nwhile (true) {\n   sudo java -jar MyProgram.jar\n   if (MyProgram.terminatedWithoutExceptions) { // How to write this part?\n       finish;\n   } else {\n       shutdown JVM;\n   }\n}\n\n\nA: One of the more basic relationships between a program and the parent shell is the concept of an \"exit code\". This is a simple integer that —by convention— lets the shell know there was a problem.\nZero is \"everything went fine\", anything else is \"omghoustonproblems\". Again this is just a convention. Some things (eg grep -q ...) use the exit code to indicate if there was a match. Grep ran without error, but it's using the exit code to signal something else here.\nAnyway, I assume if your Java app blows up to the point where it's segfaulting, or something else, it doesn't exit cleanly. So by extension the exit code it sends back to the parent shell is not zero. That makes it really easy to test:\nwhile true; do\n    sudo java -jar MyProgram.jar\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        // it exited cleanly, do something good\n    else\n        // it crashed out, do something else\n    fi\ndone\n\nIf you want to exit the while-loop in one of those if clause-sides, insert a break.\nIs running the Java program as root really a great idea? Who knows. I don't know who this outer script is being run as  so no judgement at this point but consider refactoring it out if you can.\n\nThe above is accurate but re-reading your question you might want to change how you pool your threads. It's been ~13 years since I did any threading work in Java and that was just academic but a number of things occur to me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Divide-by-zero problems are avoidable by validating input.\n\n*They're also catchable. Don't let them crash the thread. Catch, log and move on.\n\n*A thread runner that lets threads crash without starting a new one is a rubbish one. Find something more robust.\n\n\nThe best solution isn't going to be cleaning up when things go wrong, it's going to be stopping them getting that far in the first place. It can be done.\n", "Q: lightdm package upgrade fails with exit status 30 Running an upgrade on my Ubuntu 15.10 box recently failed when updating lightdm.

Does anybody know if they are compatible with Ubuntu? If yes, will it supoort 4K resolution (3840x2160)?\nUPDATE: I don't need in high performance as I don't play games.\n\nA: The main issue here is bandwidth. According to this source which goes into detail about dasiy-chaining multiple displays using one DisplayPort 1.2 output shows that it will only support one 4K (3840x2160) display due to bandwidth issues. Taking this into account, DisplayPort 1.2 has an effective bandwidth of 17.28 Gbit/s whereas USB Type-C (USB 3.1 Gen2) has a maximum bandwidth of 10 Gbit/s. This suggests that USB Type-C lacks the required bandwidth to run more than one display at 4K resolutions.\nThere is also the GPU to consider, according to product page for the ASUS GL552VW the GTX 960M has 2 Gigabytes of GDDR5 and at the time of writing I am using two displays on Ubuntu 15.10, one is an ultra-wide @ 2560x1080 and other one is 4K @ 3840x2160 and the memory usage on my GTX 970 is 1207MB. With your proposed setup you'd be running three 4K displays @ 3840x2160 each and the display on the laptop which is 1080p, this would certainly over-strips the 2 Gigabytes of GDDR5 easily.\nAt this juncture you are best looking for a laptop with two mini displayport and one HDMI connector providing the GPU is capable of powering all those displays.\n", "Q: How to configure tracker-extract so it has a higher nice value?

IE chmod 766 would lock you out of the folder if you were not the owner. or chmod +xwr /folder. Another example would be dxwrxwrx-r, would give group and owner read write and access to the directory and everyone else just read access. However, if you drop the 'x' at the end so its dxwrxwr--r, you will lock everyone out of the directory, but owner and group would be good. The -R means its recursive so it does it all the way down, for both files and directories. Use sudo find /var/{directory} -type f -print -exec chmod 664 {} \\; to only change the files and not the directories inside the folder. And depending on what you want to do with permissions, I normally do chmod 775 on the directories, and then do the above find for the rest. \nsorry to also fix the command you listed, sudo chmod a=rw -R /mnt/rdisk should be sudo chmod a=xrw -R /mnt/rdisk or sudo chmod 775 -R /mnt/rdisk and then use the find function up top to fix the permissions on the files so they all are not executable. \nI didn't see the edit originally, trying to find out now, why the folders are disappearing upon restart. \nThis is another tutorial that seems to be better written with screenshots and explanations, which maybe a bit better. \nhttps://www.howtoforge.com/samba-server-ubuntu-14.04-lts\nand another helpful one.\nhttp://www.krizna.com/ubuntu/setup-file-server-ubuntu-14-04-samba/\nHopefully those help get you over your rough patch. \nThe document from the website you were looking at. \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1hFw1YnH9s-1Y9M4VPLgPOOjm1iH6PJOHefg5NhGC4oA/edit?pli=1\nI was incorrect, there is no difference between a NAS and a NFS.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is installed on my second SSD. But when I start my PC it only boots Ubuntu and no boot menu appears. I can not get into Windows 7 anymore.\nIn the BIOS, boot option priorities, I can only choose between my CD/DVD drive and the SSD, where Windows (edit: sorry, I said Ubuntu, but it's the SSD, where Windows is installed) is installed. That's weird. What should I do?\n\nA: Try this    \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nFor more details, refer this link\nPlease make sure that both Windows and Ubuntu are installed in EFI mode.\nAlso disable secure boot in BIOS.\n\nA: First of all : You have to install Ubuntu in the same mode as Windows is installed.  \nWhen you have installed Windows in EFI mode, then do this with Ubuntu as well.  \nSecond : When there is no boot menu to be seen, disable GRUB hidden timeout.  \nOpen a terminal and execute:\nsudo apt-get install gksu  \n\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub  \n\nPlace a # in front of GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 - so that it reads now : #GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 \nSave the changed file and execute:\nsudo update-grub  \n\nNow you should see the boot loader on start, there should be a Windows entry in the boot menu.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a GPT partition table without using EFI boot? I'm planning to install a new Ubuntu system on an empty hard drive with more than 3TiB of volume. In order to fully utilize the drive, the regular MBR partition table can not be used.\nHow do I set up a GPT partition table in the Ubuntu installation? The manual installation option only offers ways of setting up certain partitions, not a general partition table, if I am not mistaken. How do I make sure that the installer will not use the usual MBR partition table?\nAlthough my motherboard uses UEFI, there is no special reason for me to use another bootloader than the regular grub that I am aware of (except if it is easier to install on a GPT drive or significantly faster/more advanced). All guides I have found so far focus mainly on the mechanics of U/EFI boot.\nWhat steps do I have to take to basically set up a regular manual Ubuntu installation, but with a GPT partition table instead of MBR/grub? I assume the selection for the bootloader installation is also different in this case?\n\nA: GPT partition table is specially used for Hard Disks sizes greater than 2TB.\nThe partition table is independent of the BIOS mode (i.e Legacy or UEFI).\nTo create a GPT partition table--\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the live USB or live CD containing Ubuntu.\n\n*Click on TRY UBUNTU , so that you can create partition table manually.\n\n*Open GParted Partition Editor.\n\n*On the top of GParted Menu bar , click on Device --> Create partition Table.\n\n*Select GPT from the drop down list and click on Apply.\n\n\nNow to verify the Partition Table-\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type the command:\n\n\n\nsudo su \n\n(to execute further commands as super user since some files are read-only)\n\nparted -l\n\n(to list all the partitions)\nIf the above command doesn't work , then try specifying the device as:\n\nparted -l  /dev/sda\n\nThere you will see that the partition is GPT.\nNow install Ubuntu as usual , installation will not rewrite the partition table (partition table remains GPT only) but new partitions are created.\n", "Q: Error: Can not save config file in Linux I am trying to edit a configuration file so called config from /etc/selinux/config in Oracle linux.

Permission Denied!\n\nI am doing it all in a Oracle VM VirtualBox.\nPlease help me fix this.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Here are the steps you need to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to /selinux and from file menu choose open in terminal\n\n*Now when you are in terminal window type su and press enter. It will ask you for a password. Enter it.\n\n*go to your /selinux directory use cd command (you may be aware of that)\n\n*type ls to check whether config file is showing or not.

In my desktop - the RedisLabs Enterprise Cluster stops if i restart but in case of my laptop it is not?\nHow to stop RLEC services?\nThe only difference in both of them is that laptop - I have upgraded the kernel version to 4.2.5 while Desktop it is still 3.1 or 3.2\nLast time I fixed this problem by uninstalling RLEC altogether.\n\nI can kill some of these processes but it's not helping much.\n\nA: Nothing in the official documents from RedisLab.

After upgrading form Ubuntu 14.10 to 15.10, it seems that changing gnome-terminal preferences using gconftool-2 is no longer supported. I guess this issue is related the Gconf to GSettings migration.\nNow, I would like to change some of my old scripts ( since they are broken in Ubuntu 15.10 ) to work with dconf/gesettings instead of gconftool-2.\nAs an example, on Ubuntu 14.10 ( gnome-terminal version 3.6.2 ) I could set the number of columns in the Default profile using:\n$ gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/default_size_columns \\\n            --type=int 140\n$ gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/use_custom_default_size \\\n            --type=bool true\n\nNow, in Ubuntu 15.10, typing:\n$ dconf list /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/\n\ngives\nprofiles:/\nschema-version\n\nwhereas\n$ gsettings list-relocatable-schemas | grep Terminal\n\ngives\norg.gnome.Terminal.SettingsList\norg.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile\norg.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Keybindings\n\nThe above output confuses me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is there a /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/ path for dconf but no org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profiles (note the trailing s) schema id for gsettings? Also, see  Shouldn't dconf-editor and gsettings access the same database? for more information.\n\n\nStill in Ubuntu 15.10 (using gnome-terminal version 3.16.2), if I run:\n$ gsettings list-keys org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/ | grep default\n\nI get:\ndefault-size-rows\ndefault-show-menubar\ndefault-size-columns\n\nso there is a default-size-columns key that could (?) correspond to the default_size_columns key in Ubuntu 14.10, but there is no use-custom-default-size key corresponding to the use_custom_default_size key in Ubuntu 14.10. This also confuses me.\nAlso, if I try running:\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/ default-size-columns 150\n\nand open a new gnome-terminal the setting of default-size-columns seems to have no effect since the terminal still opens with 80 columns..\n\nA: The syntax to be used with the gsettings command is described in \nGNOME Terminal Frequently Asked Questions.\nFirst you need to find out the identifier of the profile you want to change. For example, the identifier of the gnome-terminal default profile can be obtained from schema org.gnome.Terminal.ProfilesList. \nThen change the desired keys of path /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:UUID/ of schema org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile: for this profile.\nNote the colons in the above path. It will not work if they are omitted.\nHere is a script that use the above to set default-size-columns of the default profile:\nprofile=$(gsettings get org.gnome.Terminal.ProfilesList default)\nprofile=${profile:1:-1} # remove leading and trailing single quotes\ngsettings set \"org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:$profile/\" default-size-columns 150\n\n\nA: Anatoli's shorter versions did not give me the current value of the column width setting, they returned 80 even though the terminal had been set to 120.\nBut Hakon's method worked perfectly.\nTo get the \"path\" use dconf-editor to locate the profile and click on the profile name and you can then \"Copy current path\" - see attached screenshot\n", "Q: I may have uninstalled everything I ran sudo apt-get autoremove and watched as literally everything including Software Center was slowly removed. I'm new and was slow to stop it in time. Now when I boot in my desktop shows just my background.\n\nA: when you see your desktop press Ctr+Alt+F1 and run\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo reboot\n\nThis will reinstall the desktop and its application set including software center.\nIf you can't run the command because you also removed the package manager then I am afraid reinstalling Ubuntu is your only option.\n\nA: Please use the same media(live USB) to install Ubuntu all over again(it will be easy) as grub, partitions and everything is already done.

While you may attempt to do something else, it is NOT supported.\n\nTo upgrade from 14.04 LTS, then either wait for 16.04 LTS (April 2016) or try a new install of 15.10 on a separate partition/drive (or spare platform).\nDo not attempt to upgrade from 14.04 LTS directly to 15.10.\n\nA: I had one of these too. I would go with lubuntu on these machines. Problem is, that the Pentium M CPU in the nc8000 doesn't have the PAE feature, required with newer versions of Ubuntu.\nI would wait for 16.04 and do a system upgrade. This is the best (only) way to go. A new installation will be more complicated because of the (mentioned) missing PAE feature in your CPU.\n\nA: If you have a USB flash drive laying around, you could always use it to install Ubuntu that way. Please note that this will start a fresh installation, which may overwrite your files, depending on how your partitions are set up. \nDownload the ISO for your architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). Fire up the terminal on your Ubuntu computer, insert your flash drive, and type in sudo parted and enter your root password. Then type print devices. This will output all storage devices connected to your system. Look for a device which matches your flash drive's capacity. It will have a name like this /dev/sdx, where x will be a letter from a-z. Open up another terminal, and navigate to your Downloads-folder, using cd Downloads. Then type sudo dd if=NameOfIsoFile.iso of=/dev/sdx. \nThis will write the ISO image to the flash drive, and will DELETE ALL EXISTING DATA on it. There will not be a progress bar of any sort - just the flashing underscore, which will continue to flash until the operation is complete. \nI hope this will come to help. \n", "Q: Grub2 fallback with 14.04 ... need How-To \n*\n\n*Ubuntu server 14.04 efi-gpt disk with three partitions, 1=boot,\n2=main, 3=recovery\n\n*I want: default boot on gpt2, grub fallback to gpt3, and grub-reboot to reboot into recovery from main.\n\n*What I get is no boot at all, just an instant reboot loop.\nI am a bit confused by the GNU docs.

Here is a guide that might be helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*To get the disk right use gparted to create a GPT disk table, then\ncreate a smallish Fat32 partition with the flag set to \"boot\" and a\nmount point /boot/efi. (the mount point is conventional, but I advise\nfollowing convention). \n\n*Add your other partitions as required, but root\npartitions won't have the boot flag as they normally do. \n\n*After installing Ubuntu, you'll find that Grub has set up all partitions it\ncould find for its boot menu. You may not want this, or you may have\ncustomizations.\n\n*Check /etc/fstab to make sure the /boot/efi mount command is there and the filesystem to make sure there is a /boot/efi mount point.\n\n*Advice: before you run update-grub make backups of /boot/grub, /etc/default/grub, /etc/grub.d and have a bootable flashdrive or some method  of mounting your new partitions so you can fix them when your changes fail to boot.\n\n*There are only a few things you need to change in /etc/default/grub, the majority of your changes should be in /etc/grub.d/40_custom plus chmodding the 10* 20* 30* scripts as needed to prevent them from doing their thing. \n\n*You can cut&paste the menu stanza(s) from /boot/grub/grub.cfg into 40_custom \n\n*Beware Grub( maybe EFI?) counts the disks from zero ( hd0) and the partitions from one.\n\n*Run update-grub to create the grub.cfg file\n\n*You don't need to do anything with the Fat32 boot partition\n\n*Beware: I got a problem on a system with two bootable flashdrives and a HD where the HD used the boot EFI partition off the flashdrive instead of on itself. This is all about having extraneous drives connected- try to disconnect anything that you don't want to change.\n\n*Beware: if you are saving and restoring multiple drives, you'll have to reset the UUIDs using tune2fs, else you'll get a collision.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 install fail I am using legacy boot.  I install server 14.04.3 but when I reboot I get nothing.  It never boots and never gives up and tries netboot, it just hangs, black screen.  It appears to be a hardware issue as the ssd boots fine and works in an older machine.\nI just confirmed that if I install server 14.04.1 from USB it works fine and boots but unfortunately hangs partway through the boot process.  Again the SSD boots fine and works as expected in the older machine.\n\nA: To me, it sounds like a hardware issue, especially since you say it works just fine when used in another computer.\nAre you able to verify that the SSD is indeed showing up in BIOS, and that your boot order is set up correctly? \n\nA: I have found the answer.  Firstly I was using a pxe boot server to do the install.  The pxe server was using a base install from 14.04.1 and upgrading.  When I installed directly from USB using server 14.04.1 the install would hang after its first reboot.  Even though apt-get upgraded it to 14.04.3.  It would work OK on old hardware.\nAfter trying a direct install using 14.04.1 and 14.04.3 from ISOs, I found that only a direct install from 14.04.3 would work on this hardware.  \nOn further investigation I found that the problem was the nouveau driver.

Hence I didn't do anything, hoping to get some advice here first. \nMy question: Is the Clonezilla wizard asking for target first and source second, so that the first device I put will be the one whose data will be destroyed?\nAlternatively is there some other way of backing up? For the PC partition (this is a dual boot machine) I use 'DriveImage XML', which is really fast (and you use the Knoppix LIVE CD for restoring). Something like that for Linux would be great.\n\nA: When using the Clonezilla disk-to-disk option, you will first be prompted for a source drive, then the target drive. The target drive will be overwritten and all information on it will be lost. \nThis is in contrast to the other option, disk-to-image, where you are first asked to select a target device which the image will be saved at.

Kubuntu? Ubuntu? If you are running Kubuntu, you can try to kill and restart the plasmashell as well. Try killall plasmashell or kill plasmashell then restart it, using kstart plasmashell. \nYou can do so by changing to one of the terminals, using CTRL+ALT 1 to 6.

I am stuck on Ubuntu 14.04 and upgrading to 15.10 is probably not an option. The highest version of python supported by Ubuntu 14 is 2.7.6.\nThis is very old.  I want to install a newer version.  \nI understand that all I need is a .deb version of the software that I'd like to install. I think I just need to find a server that has this and added it to the list of repositories (/etc/apt/sources.list) and then apt-get will magically do the right thing.\nHowever, I am going to want to break the rules and install newer versions of other software too. The more often I do this, the more likely bad things are to happen of course. However, I suspect that there are MANY people in my shoes who want to do the same thing. So maybe there is repository for rule breakers like myself can use to replace the official Ubuntu repositories?\nDoes such a magical repository exist?\nIf I add it to /etc/apt/sources.list, will apt-get install python give me a newer version of python than is available via the official repositories?\n\nA: Using the newest python version\nIt is not recommended to change the python version of your system (i.e. with apt-get update python), since many scripts rely on a specific version. You can brake your system and it may cause problems with future updates. Instead, you may want to have a look at virtual environments as answered here.\nUsing python 3\nAccording to the Ubuntu 14.04.5 manifesto, python 3.4 is now included with trusty by default. You can use it with the command: python3 <path-to-some-optional-script>.\nReplace the official repositories / Maintain packages\nThere is no such thing as the mentioned magical repository. However, there are Personal Package Archives instead, providing newer package version (also triggered by a apt-get update) and are maintained by the community. There is a question covering this topic on SE here.\nYou can also download .deb files with a newer version and use the tool gdebi to install them. However, you will need to take care of newer versions when using local .deb-files.\n\nA: apt-get install python3\n\nthis should do it. remember python3 takes input as string and used function to parse it to another format.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu+KVM support an old Intel QuadCore Q8300 + Asus P5QPL I am trying to convert this machine into a mini VM server\nThe processor is Intel Q8300 QuadCore which IFAIK supports virtualization. \nThe motherboard is Asus P5QPL-AM.\nIt has Intel G41 chipset, X4500 acccelerator, integrated Gbit Lan\n8GB memory + SATA SSD drive\nIn the BIOS I see an option to enable HW Virtualization\nMy question is whether KVM on Ubuntu will support this processor, and will it support para-virtualization on a win10/ubunutu GuestOS for accelerated network & storage & video performance\n\nA: Interestingly there are different versions of the Q8300 CPU.

If i can log in the system with the live cd and get root access then any on can do the same , so my question is how to stop anyone using live cd to get access to my system , if that is possible .  \n\nA: I assume by 'your system' you mean your already installed OS as opposed to the Live CD.\nThe only way I can think of would be to use full disk encryption with a strong password over the partition(s) that contain your OS. If someone has physical access to your system (ie. can insert a CD or their own hard drives) then this really is the only way to prevent unauthorized access.

When I display the boot options and select the SSD ('Legacy'), UEFI says it's not bootable (Ubuntu installed in UEFI mode).\nHow can I fix this? (Reinstallation is an option)\nContext\nUpgrading 14.04 to 15.10\nI had some minor quirks with the installed 14.04 and wished to upgrade. I just used the settings so that Ubuntu would upgrade to the latest version, which worked. But I did not have any network available.\n15.10 Fresh install, legacy mode\nI went for the clean install (USB stick, Unetbootin) and that's when I think I made my real mistake: selecting the Erase disk and install Ubuntu option.\nSince then, it does not boot. I was able to boot it manually from boot menu, but saw that the UEFI section under which Ubuntu was previously visible has now disappeared.\n15.10 Fresh install, UEFI mode\nI tried reinstalling it in UEFI mode, but no luck. I was afraid the system scraped a partition used for boot, but no, an efi partition is present (Ubuntu actually mentioned he would write an ESP partition before doing the partition changes).\nBooting in Legacy mode is no longer an option (obviously...).\nThe BIOS (updated to the latest version Dell supplies, from November 2015) does not seem to see the UEFI partition. When going through the settings and trying to add a BOOT option, though, I can see the Ubuntu part, but it fails to be added.\nAnd now?\nIs there any right way to fix it?\n\nA: I ended up fixing this slightly differently on Elementary OS, but it should apply to other operating systems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Elementary OS in UEFI mode as normal.\n\n*Reboot to find that you get a black screen.\n\n*Reboot into the USB disk that you used to install the OS.\n\n*When grub comes up and prompts you with the \"try elementary\" option, hit c and drop to the grub command line.\n\n*Use ls to try and determine which one of the available drives and partitions is the one you just installed /root onto. This may not be possible if you went with full disk encryption, but I just encrypt my /home. Once you find that out, set it to your root in grub. For me, it looks like this: set root=(hd1,2).\n\n*Use the elementary provided grub config to boot into your Elementary OS install: conffile /boot/grub/grub.cfg. If that file doesn't exist then you probably picked the wrong drive/partition in the previous step.\n\n*It should boot into Elementary OS. At this point, you can take out the USB stick and it should work just fine.\n\n*(possibly optional) Drop to a root shell and create the file that was mentioned in the other answer: sudo touch sudo touch /boot/bootx64.efi\n\n*Update grub: sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot into the dell bios\n\n*Navigate to the boot sequence screen\n\n*Add an option, call it Ubuntu (or whatever)\n\n*Tap on the three dots to select the efi file. You should be able to pick EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx.efi or something like that. The other answer had you picking shimx64.efi, but I assume grub won't update that.\n\n*Go to the advanced boot options menu\n\n*Disable the legacy ROM option. For some reason I have to do this or I get the black screen again.\n\n*Save it, apply, restart, win.\n\n\nIt persists too.

Some of the features may be broken or incomplete. For this reason, its use is discouraged for any purpose other than testing or debugging:\nppa:george-edison55/nitroshare-dev  (Click here for instructions on using PPAs.)\nThe commands for installing NitroShare from the development PPA are similar to the ones for the stable PPA.\n\nUse the Binary Packages\nBinary packages (DEBs) are provided for Ubuntu 14.04+. They can be downloaded from the official NitroShare website:\nhttp://nitroshare.net\nOnce the DEB package is downloaded, you can launch it to open the Software Center to complete the installation.\n\nBuild NitroShare from Source (difficult)\nIf you are really ambitious, you can build NitroShare directly from source. First, you will need to ensure that all of the packages needed for building NitroShare are installed. To do that, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev libgtk2.0-dev \\\n  libappindicator-dev libnotify-dev\n\nVisit this page and grab the .tar.gz download for the latest release (0.3.0 at the time of writing).

In my case, the Cron sets FROM: root and TO: root, that I would like to change to normal email address.\n\nA: There are a couple of settings in ssmtp that can be manipulated to allow a change in the 'From' field of emails:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a setting within /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf. By default the system selects the 'From' address but this can be altered by unchecking the FromLineOverride line:\n# Are users allowed to set their own From: address?\n# YES - Allow the user to specify their own From: address\n# NO - Use the system generated From: address\n#FromLineOverride=YES\n\nBy 'unchecking' I mean remove the hash mark at the beginning of that particular line.\n\n*There can be settings within /etc/ssmtp/revaliases to allow a specific 'From' line from each user. The example given in revaliases is reasonably unhelpful:\n# Example: root:your_login@your.domain:mailhub.your.domain[:port]\n# where [:port] is an optional port number that defaults to 25.\n\nBut the man pages gives a much more explicit example:\nA reverse  alias  gives  the From: address placed on a user's outgoing\nmessages and (optionally) the  mailhub  these  messages  will  be  sent\nthrough.

See this question for more details.\nIf you want to upgrade (after the downgrading) to 15.10, it can't be done directly, according to the answers here. You have to upgrade to every release in between, to 14.10, 15.04, and finally 15.10.\nI recommend simply removing your new 16.04, and installing 15.10. Recently, I asked how to upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04, and I was advised to do a clean install. That is only one release apart.\nSo even though a clean install is quite a process, it seems to me it's less of a hassle than downgrading and upgrading in baby steps.

What probably happened. My friend bought 4TB HDD in USB dock case, it can be used even under Windows XP as he says. The case is broken now and I can't confirm that yet.\nWhen he broke the socket, he simply pulled the disk from the native case and put that in Trekstor case. And probably Trekstor controller wrote an MBR to the disk somehow.\nWhen I try to run HDD with my Unitek dock, it shows in gnome-disks as 4 TB drive. When I try my friend's Trekstor case it shows only 2 TB storage device!\nSo I assumpt my Unitek dock is compatible with GPT and I want to use it for recovery.\nNow, what I can see on the disk (plugged via Unitek).\nOn Linux, there is classic MBR, 500 GB unknown partition and 3,5 TB free space.\nOn Windows 7, MBR, 500 unknown GB partition AND TWO unpartitioned spaces (WTF?).\nAnd what is most important, on Linux gpart can't see even broken GPT file, only MBR:\n# gdisk \nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.10\n\nType device filename, or press <Enter> to exit: /dev/sdb\nPartition table scan:\n  MBR: MBR only\n  BSD: not present\n  APM: not present\n  GPT: not present\n\nProbably the disk was shipped formatted as one 4 TB big NTFS partition, under GPT partition table.\nMaybe I can copy GPT table (the disk beginning and the copy at disk ending) from someone that has identical drive, using dd command? If not, how to fix it, and how to see is there a copy od GPT at disk ending? Can i back up the GPT table over that MBR, taking data from disk ending?\n\nA: The problem is solved.\nWell, fixing the broken USB socket in the original Seagate USB case did the trick.\nBut when I put the disk into the case, I again saw nothing in disk managers – just empty, unpartitioned disk. Searching for partitions again in testdisk worked once more. The GPT partition table has been found again and saved. The difference is, whole partition could be now seen then under any OS – Linux and Windows XP, 7, 10.\nConclusion: probably the Seagate case has some internal and writable flash/EPROM memory to save its own GPT (it's one kilobyte if I understood that well), and it treats it as HDD sectors, pushing real HDD sectors after own memory.\nThe data was not touched when I swapped disk because the partition was preceded and followed by two 8-megabyte unpartitioned spaces, so there was much place to wrote GPTs or any other trash.\nThat's the only explantation I can imagine for now.

I just built this new computer and wanted Ubuntu on it, but there's a bit of a learning curve...\nI have a 32GB SSD (sdb) that I would like to be just for booting and other important system things,\nand a 256GB SSD (sda) that I would like to throw documents, games, and other files and media into.\nCurrently, everything is on the 32GB, and every time that I make a partition on the 250GB, I am unable to move any files over because it says I do not have permission, which is emotionally hurtful because I just made it and have administrator status.\nI downloaded a couple of games, and they play and run well, but everything is on the 32GB, which is running out of room, as I probably should have seen coming.\nSo how do I get the games and downloads and such fluff (home directory?) to the bigger SSD, and have new downloads and docs default to there as well?\nI appreciate all help in advance.\n\nA: I believe you just want Ubuntu and NOT Windows at all.\nIn this case when the Installation is happening - go ahead with the default options - it will create single root '/' partition and another one 'swap' and then you are good to go.\nYou might want to change your partition size later and for that you can install gparted\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nAnd if needed make use of LVM. For your current needs I will just say keep things simple.\n\nA: Way back at the start of my Linux journey, I used this guide:\nhttp://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-partplan/\nIt still forms a good basis for what you want to do but do bear in mind that it's 16 years old.  Details like the type of partition you're using will be different, e.g. ext4 not ext2.  Using a GUI tool like Gparted rather than some of the command line options may well work better too.\n", "Q: connect (e.g ssh) with graphical interface to Linux machine I am trying to connect from my Ubuntu machine at home to my work machine which has Ubuntu too.

My laptop runs Ubuntu MATE and I want to have remote access to it (like when I'm not at home). Can I access it from another machine running Windows? How?\n\nA: Access throught ssh\nIf you want a terminal access to your laptop, you can use SSH. For that, you need to install ssh server on your laptop and have an ssh client on your Windows machine.\nOn you laptop, install ssh server (and client)\nsudo apt-get install ssh\n\nOn your windows machine, you can use a tool like putty.\nIf you need an access to transfert file, you can use WinSCP. Using the same tool on server side.\nAccess throught VNC\nIf you prefer have a remote access to your desktop (more visual), you can use VNC.\nIn this case, install vino. It is a VNC server.\nsudo apt-get install vino\n\nAnd use a VNC Desktop Remote Viewer like vinagre, or RealVNC on Windows.\n\nA: I've had success remotely logging in over a local network using xrdp.  http://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=5382\nAs per suggestion, here's more detail on how to install and use xrdp including some customisation.

For example, for UK source a file called km-0809.ini.  Ensure permissions/ownership are correct using sudo chown/chgrp user file.\n\n*Also in /etc/xrdp, edit startwm.sh to comment out the line . /etc/X11/Xsession and add a line lxsession.\n\n*Edit /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini to amend port=-1 to port=ask-1to enable the ability to select already running sessions.\n\n*In /usr/share/xrdp customise ad24b.bmp and xrdp24b.bmp as required. Example, legal warning/notification in ad24b.bmp in a 140x140 size file.  The other file can contain any suitably sized background image.  As above, ensure ownership/permissions are correct.\n\n*Perform a restart of xrdp before attempting a login.  sudo service xrdp restart\n", "Q: How to install sbt in its latest version in Ubuntu 14.04?

I would like to find out the cause of the crash. I will describe how it looks like when it crashes and what I can see in the syslog. I would like you to tell me how to proceed with finding the cause.\nHow it looks when it crashes\nSometimes it would freeze within one our of a restart, some other time within 2 days. E.g. when this latest freeze happened, after restart I just started some ordinary applications like a browser and a terminal, left it alone for an hour and when I got back to it, I noticed that it did not respond to anything. Not even to alt+ctl+F1. The only thing I can do at this point is to keep the power button pressed until it turns off.\nWhen the freeze happens, I usually notice, that the notebook is a bit warmer then it should be. If I immediately restart and check sensors then I can see temperatures like 70 degrees Celsius which is not extreme but much higher then normal operation temp which is around 50. \nsyslogs\nI have checked the /var/log/syslog, this is what I found to be the latest log lines before it crashed.\nchrash1:\nFeb 10 15:01:39 bpgergo-notebook kernel: [26093.242080] nouveau E[   PIBUS][0000:01:00.0]

After initial install of my OS one of the first things I did was install Google Chrome (google-chrome-stable) from the Google website. Everything was good, it showed as an option in System->Details->Default Applications menu and I set it as default browser. A few days later, here I am looking at my Default Applications menu and Google Chrome is nowhere to be found. My default has reverted to Firefox. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the google-chrome-stable package but to no avail. How can I get Google Chrome to reappear as an option in Default Applications list?\n\nA: I solved it! Somehow I had a corrupt google-chrome.desktop in my ~/.local/share/applications/ folder. I found the file in /usr/share/applications/ was valid. After deleting the bad one in my ~/.local/share/applications/ folder, logging out and back in, everything is back to normal. I can select Google Chrome from Default Applications and everything is golden.\n\nA: You should be able to set Chrome as default browser directly from Chrome settings. Have a look at the icon on top right of any Chrome tab (the three lines) and then Settings --> Default browser. \n", "Q: Upgrade vs dist-upgrade vs apt-get install linux-headers-generic I am running Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS\nI wanted to know the difference between the three commands here\napt-get upgrade\napt-get dist-upgrade\napt-get install linux-headers-generic-xxx\n\nMy goal is to get the latest libraries for each package that I have on my server. \nUpdate:\nWe were running 12.04 on all our VMS, some are stuck at 12.04.3 and I would like to bring those to 12.04.5 from the command line without breaking anything.\nOn another note, I know that 14.04 is the latest one, and I should run a do-release-upgrade. But will it break things?\n\nA: apt-get\nFrom Debian:\n\nupgrade\nUpgrade will attempt to gently upgrade the whole system. Upgrade will\n  never install a new package or remove an existing package, nor will it\n  ever upgrade a package that might cause some other package to break.\n  This can be used daily to relatively safely upgrade the system.\n  Upgrade will list all of the packages that it could not upgrade, this\n  usually means that they depend on new packages or conflict with some\n  other package. dselect or apt-get install can be used to force these\n  packages to install.\ninstall\nInstall is used to install packages by name. The package is\n  automatically fetched and installed. This can be useful if you already\n  know the name of the package to install and do not want to go into a\n  GUI to select it. Any number of packages may be passed to install,\n  they will all be fetched. Install automatically attempts to resolve\n  dependency problems with the listed packages and will print a summary\n  and ask for confirmation if anything other than its arguments are\n  changed.\ndist-upgrade\nDist-upgrade is a complete upgrader designed to simplify upgrading\n  between releases of Debian. It uses a sophisticated algorithm to\n  determine the best set of packages to install, upgrade and remove to\n  get as much of the system to the newest release. In some situations it\n  may be desired to use dist-upgrade rather than spend the time manually\n  resolving dependencies in dselect. Once dist-upgrade has completed\n  then dselect can be used to install any packages that may have been\n  left out.\nIt is important to closely look at what dist-upgrade is going to do,\n  its decisions may sometimes be quite surprising.\n\n\nTo get the latest updates of the installed packages do:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nThe command\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-xxx\n\nwill install the specific kernel for the version you specify in place of xxx\n", "Q: X Server Starting Window Manager (Compiz-Standalone) Cursor is Black X I'm running ubuntu server 15.10 using compiz as my window manager.

However my cursor is a black X when I am hovering over the black screen. If I launch a terminal and hover my mouse over it, it turns to a regular cursor. Any idea why this would be happening. \nNote: I have another system, that as far as I know is configured the same, and the cursor behaves normally. \n\nA: Figured it out, for some reason this system is requiring me to set the cursor name in my .xinitrc. So I added this line to my .xinitrc. \n xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr\n\nWhats weird is my other system does not have this line in it's .xinitrc and the cursor is behaving normally.

Sometimes, after resume from suspend the monitor starts flickering from time to time. After restarting the machine everything works fine again. Is there anything I can do about this?\nUpdate:\nI upgraded to 16.04 and I use the Kubuntu backports. The issue is still present.\n\nA: Sounds like a graphics driver issue. Intel HD Graphics drivers are installed on Ubuntu by default. \nYou can attempt to use a different set of newer but stable graphics drivers:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nYou could of course use the bleeding edge PPA, but I wouldn't recommend it.\n", "Q: Server rebooting unexpectedly In the past month, I've noticed that our Dell PowerEdge T630 (Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS) server is rebooting unexpectedly (Jan 29 were manual reboots):\n$cat /var/log/wtmp.report | grep boot | grep -v 'Jan 29'\nreboot   system boot  3.13.0-77-generi Wed Feb 10 09:00 - 13:59  (04:58)\nreboot   system boot  3.13.0-76-generi Wed Jan 27 09:01 - 10:47 (2+01:45)\nreboot   system boot  3.13.0-74-generi Tue Jan 19 10:34 - 10:47 (10+00:13)\nreboot   system boot  3.13.0-74-generi Wed Jan 13 09:02 - 10:47 (16+01:45)\n\nSo, of all the unspecified reboots, they all (with the exception of Jan 19) seem to be taking place every other Wednesday at around 9:00am (UTC-6).\nI've looked through all the usual suspects (/var/log/kern.log, /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/dmesg, /var/log/syslog, etc), but can't find any sort of reason for the reboot.\nI'm running Fail2ban on the server; whenever I do a manual reboot, I'll get an automated email from Fail2ban saying SSH has been stopped, and then another email saying it has started back up.  Interestingly enough, when these unspecified reboots occur, I only get an email saying SSH has started back up (that is, I don't get one about SSH shutting down).\nDoes anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this?  This server is only used by us, and certainly isn't being pushed to it's limits in any capacity.  The server is running a traditional (Apache) LAMP stack, along with SSH, and various other things like python and what not.\n\nA: I discovered that it was a power issue associated with our building.

You can also open Microsoft Word (doc, docx) files in LibreOffice Writer.\nYou can choose whether you save the files you create in LibreOffice Writer, as Microsoft Word files, doc or docx, or save them in the native odt format of LibreOffice. Beware though, that some of the formatting may not be preserved, when saving LibreOffice Writer files as Microsoft Word files, and vice versa.\nI have often worked with the same documents in both Microsoft Word and LibreOffice LibreOffice, and don't recall running into any problems, moving between the applications.\nWhat I have said also applies to spreadsheet documents, in Excel and Calc, as far as I can remember.\n", "Q: The system is running in low-graphics mode after installing I have installed Ubuntu on a separate ext4 partition.

These are RedHat examples, but the concept is the same.  A \"service tomcat stop\" both stops the apache process and the deletes the accompanying .pid file.  A reboot was not removing the .pid file.  What I ended up doing at first was manually stop and restart tomcat after the server came back up.  Later I modified the startup script to do an automatic shutdown first.  It would give me an error if it tried to stop something already down, but the webserver started up afterwards just fine.\n", "Q: Ubuntu fails to \"Suspend\" If I try to \"Suspend\", the screen turns

resolved after a restart, but what could be the possible causes? There wasn't any USB device connected.\n\nA: In your BIOS setup there can be a setting to Wake on LAN or Wake on USB. If these are on turn them off and see if that fixes the problem.\nI've also found that a bad USB cable connected to a powered-hub can generate error messages in dmesg but I'm not sure if that would wake up the system.\nUpdate February 8, 2020\nThese lines in your log file:\nRunning hook /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/60_wpa_supplicant suspend suspend:\nFailed to connect to non-global ctrl_ifname: (null)  error: No such file or directory\n/usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d/60_wpa_supplicant suspend suspend: success.\n\nAre perhaps the reason /lib/systemd/system-sleep/wpasupplicant was created as described in this discussion.

The original question How do I migrate currently installed Ubuntu to a Virtual Machine? was insightful, but with the improvements and developments in systems like Vagrant or Docker, perhaps Clonezilla is becoming archaic for replicating development environments. I think it's worth revisiting.\nMy impressions about Vagrant and Docker with respect to this topic:\n\n\n*\n\n*Vagrant. Good for creating virtual machines in which to run your code. However, if you have an existing Ubuntu machine with lots of configurations, etc... seems like there is no way to export the setting of this machine to a vagrantfile?\n\n*Docker. Seems to be good for running your app anywhere where docker is installed, but not developing your app anywhere. I might be wrong on this, which is why I am asking. If your main dev machine breaks, is having a docker container enough to get back up and running quickly in a development environment?\n\n\nQuestion: Can Vagrant or Docker replace Clonezilla for dev machine cloning onto virtual machines? If so, which one would you choose and could you give some key points about implementation in this case?\n\nA: Sure but they're different approaches to roughly the same thing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Clonezilla (et al) involves taking a complete bootloader-through-application image. It's big and there's no de-duplication. If you have 50 instances of a similar stack, take a full backup of each and store 50 full images. You store a load of stuff that is easily replaceable.\n\n*Docker installs on stock Ubuntu (installable from a CD). Each container can be based on a public image. You overlay your irreplaceable data over the top. That's all you need to back up. In the previous scenario that means there are now 50 base copies of Ubuntu you don't have to back up.\n\n\nTo restore the first you just need to get your image and burn it. To restore an entire Docker stack you need to reinstall Ubuntu, Docker, grab the [tiny] Ubuntu base image and then reinstall your layers and configuration. You can —and should— automate the buildout process (Chef, Puppet, etc).\nThe long term ramification is simple: disk space. You can back up your Docker app a billion times in the same space as your Clonezilla images... At the cost of complexity.\n\nSidebar: While I'm mentioning automation, there is a third school of thought that just uses Chef/Puppet to automate the installation and configuration of Ubuntu installs. You end up with full installs so none of the runtime memory/storage benefits Docker affords you, but small backups and easy replication.\n\nContainers are a good idea. Containers and layers are probably an even better idea. I'm still yet to implement them in anger but I'm only just starting to see the benefits of LXC so it won't be long, I'm sure.\nAnd in your case don't forget you can use both backup techniques at once if you're unsure. That's to say, you can take a Clonezilla image of a Docker host (and still keep backups of your private Docker images elsewhere)\n", "Q: Ubuntu first timer trying to boot from USB on an old Celeron M machine I've been at this for a couple of days now,  and have made some progress thanks to many of the questions and answers here.  \nFirst, the machine info:\n\n\n*\n\n*elo ESY15A1 all-in-one POS touchcomputer\n\n*CPU: Celeron M 1Ghz \n\n*graphics: integrated\n\n\nSteps taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created 14.04 USB boot disk using UUI\n\n*adjusted BIOS to boot from USB\n\n*initially I would get a grey screen with a cursor... and then blank and nothing. Except, apparently, it was still trying to install in the background, it was just that the monitor was off\n\n*using TAB at the Ubuntu install screen and adding NOMODESET to the (kernel?) line got me a lot farther, but I'm stuck again. \n\n*Sidenote: simply adding nomodeset doesn't help at all. Backspacing through 'quiet splash' before adding nomodeset gets me one result (full log of the boot/install process before it dies - see video below) and moving the cursor back past quiet splash before adding nomodeset gets me another result: the screen with 4 dots \n\n*in either of the above cases, I eventually end up on a blank screen that stays that way indefinitely. However, if I hit ctrl-alt-del, the screen comes to life to show the install shutting down and the system restarts. is there any other keystroke I could try here to kick start something other than a reboot?\n\n*it doesn't appear to make a difference if I choose 'install' or 'try' Ubuntu.\n\n\nFor your viewing pleasure, I recorded the whole process in the hopes that someone would see a clue to the problem. https://youtu.be/ikISzmkPTtc\n\nA: When I look at the specs of that touchcomputer, you probably don't have enough RAM to run a recent version of ubuntu.\nI would go with lubuntu.\nYou will find the lubuntu install iso here.\n", "Q: Dell Inspiron 15 5559 problem at shutdown and logout (Intel Skylake and AMD Radeon R5 M335) I have a brand new Dell Inspiron 15 (5559) laptop with an Intel Skylake i7-6500U CPU and an AMD Radeon R5 M335 graphics card. I'm running elementary 0.3.2 which is based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and I figure the problem might not be exclusively related to elementary which is why I also post my question here.\nInstallation of freya 0.3.2 seems to have worked quickly and without problems. However, I cannot shutdown the system without having to use the power button. The shutdown process stops at a line that looks like this:\n[2969.600864] init: wait-for-state (plymouth-shutdownlightdm) main process (14172) killed by TERM signal\nI've tried a fix that involved editing the grub menu and seemed on point, but it didn't work. Now I suspect it might have to do with the graphics card (not sure though) because when I shut down the machine, the following happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*for a split second, there is a graphical glitch - it looks like a rectangular part of the desktop wallpaper is moved and shifted\n\n*the following screen appears: \nlog out output pt. 1\n\n*after a split second, the next screen appears: \nlog out output pt. 2\nThere the shutdown process stops. When I hit the power button, the machine powers down (I don't have to hold the button). I can't post the output right now because I'm new to askubuntu and not yet allowed to post more than two links.\nSo far I have used the Xorg open source drivers for AMD cards that came with freya, although the system mistakenly identifies the graphics card as being an AMD Sun XT (Radeon HD 8600M series). When I switched to the proprietary fglrx driver that shipped with the system, I could merely boot into a black screen with a colored line at the top.\nIrrespectively of the AMD drivers, when I have a look at the info tab in the system settings, it says \"Graphics: Intel Corporation Device 1916 (rev 07)\". When I run lspci -nn | grep VGA, the output is:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:1916] (rev 07)\nThe problem also occurs at logout, but in this case the process stops at the screen in the first picture.\nAny ideas? I'm a bit confused...\nEDIT 1:\nNow I have experienced the shutdown/logout to stop at the first graphical glitch without going to the output screens, too. In that case, I have to force quit and power down by holding the power button.\nEDIT 2:\nNow there's an error message at startup that seems to be related to the problem. I can't post the output right now because I'm new to askubuntu and not yet allowed to post more than two links.\nThe entry under \"Unreportable Reason\" (strangely the only one in German) translates to: \"This is not an official elementary package. Please remove all third-party packages and repeat the process\"\nWhat could that mean?\nEDIT 3:\nI thought fglrx drivers had been included in the system installation because in the additional drivers tab I had an option for that. However, searching for fglrx in synaptic revealed that apparently there are no such driver packages installed.\nSo the problem might as well be related to the Intel graphics chipset that apparently is run right now?\nAny ideas for help are greatly appreciated!! I already have posted this in the elementary stack exchange, but no replies so far... :(\n\nA: I found the solution. The problem is a driver issue with the Intel Skylake graphics chipset. You can solve it by upgrading to kernel 4.3 and upwards. For instructions to update to kernel 4.4 see here: http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/01/how-to-install-linux-kernel-4-4-in-ubuntu/\nThe only problem is that now there are some random graphical glitches appearing from time to time. It is kind of annoying, but doesn't affect functionality in any way. I guess the drivers for Skylake graphics aren't fully developed yet.\n\nA: Ok. I had the same problem with my dell 5559. Fixed this problem by opening the terminal and type the following command.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nFind the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nand change it to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi=force\"\n\n\n*Type sudo update-grub in terminal\n\nA: OK, so the problem can be solved much easier than installing a new kernel - namely by activating the proprietary drivers for AMD Radeon graphics card (called fglrx). You can choose between fglrx and the open source xorg drivers in the additional drivers tab of the update settings. After fglrx has been installed, the problem doesn't occur anymore.\nSo it looks like either the Xorg drivers - which are activated by default - do not work with an AMD Radeon M335, or the problem is the Intel Skylake graphics chipset because the AMD card isn't detected/activated at all without the fglrx drivers (this might be the case because when I ran \"lspci -nnk | grep \"VGA\\|'Kern'\\|3D\\|Display\" -A2\" the AMD Radeon card wasn't detected at all, but I can't tell for sure).\n", "Q: mbp Ubuntu 14.04.3 mouse/trackpad scrolling I installed Ubuntu on my mbp (dual boot w el capitan via rEFind) and I'm not getting scrolling by default nor do I see it in Mouse & Trackpad How can I get mouse scrolling working again?\nNotes:\n$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\nRelease:    14.04\nCodename:   trusty\n\n$ xinput; dmesg | grep pnp; uname -r\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Apple Inc.

Starting with the 4.2 Linux kernel support for this newest type of trackpad from Apple was added. Before then you'd need to compile and install your own kernel module for it. Support for it is pretty good but overly sensitive in my opinion. When I hover my fingers just above the trackpad it registers activity. In OS X however, I have to actually touch it before it registers are activity.\n\nA: You might get some traction by first checking synclient -l to see if VertTwoFingerScroll is set to 0 and, if so, you can try switching it on with synclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\n", "Q: How can I verify that my graphics card is used correctly when playing games I recently installed steam on my laptop to play some games but the experience is not that good. I don't play a lot but with the computer I use I would have expected something better. I am getting really low frame rates even on low resolutions.\nMy computer is a Lenovo Y50-70:\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor: Intel® Core™ i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz × 8\n\n*Ram 16Gb\n\n*Graphics card: GeForce GTX 860M\n\n\nI want to confirm that my actual graphics card is used and not the intel integrated one. When I check system details it says \"Intel® Haswell Mobile\". Another question on this site has this answer for how to find the model of the computers graphics card. If I run that command the output is Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller\nHowever the full output of that command also shows NVIDIA Corporation GM107M [GeForce GTX 860M] as \"3D controller\". \nThe low frame rates in the games makes me question whether my graphics card is actually used. What can I do to confirm it is? Or is gaming that bad on linux? \nAfter problem solved:\nI reinstalled the nvidia drivers (which I already had installed) and suddenly it worked. Games play much better now. When checking system details it now says \"GeForce GTX 860M/PCIe/SSE2\" for \"Graphics\" so if your proper graphics card is not listed here, chances are that is is not installed correctly.\n\nA: Check the Additional Drivers app. If Nouveau is selected, Intel graphics are most likely being used for games and videos. You can switch to using NVIDIA by selecting one of the proprietary driver options and clicking Apply Changes.\nThere may be multiple versions to select. Ignore the -updates options, since those are experimental and not fully tested. Use them only if the other proprietary options don't work for you. If there are still a couple proprietary options, start with the newest version.\nOnce you install the proprietary drivers and reboot, you will be using NVIDIA, but full-time, meaning less battery life. You can open the NVIDIA X-Server Settings app, go to PRIME Profiles and switch to Intel, but that switches everything over, and requires you to relog.\nAs an alternative to the PRIME Profiles, there is an app called Bumblebee, which acts like the Windows NVIDIA Control Panel, allowing you to select which programs you want to run on which card. It should be available from the Software Center. Be aware, though, this program may not be very stable. I currently have it on my Ubuntu 15.10 installation and have no problems so far, but I haven't really tried it out. Other people have reported that it completely breaks the system or just doesn't work in the first place. It's a hit-or-miss situation. You're welcome to try it.

You can write a simple bash script that copies all the desired files from one computer to another (you should consider using SSH-keys to avoid entering the user's password every time that you want to coy files).\nMy approach would be to have a menu with the option \"copy data from\". You can list the laptops/PC's and select the one that is going to update the rest.  \nPlease note that you can also use any cloud solution like dropbox/drive, etc. to sync both personal and config files.\n\nA: For data synchronization, you should take a look at rsync.

I am a relative newbie who used Ubuntu 12 a few years back on an old Dell to install Bitcoin Armory for Cold Storage. When recently deciding to retrieve a coin, I also took it out of storage, i.e. plugged in a WiFi card to upgrade into Ubuntu 14.04. However, when rebooting, I experienced the /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 screen, and when the OS advances to the login screen, the mouse and keyboard lag are over a minute, making the system unusable. \nAs I've had time to research the over the past two weeks, it's obviously an encryption issue resulting from upgrading all recommended app and system components. However, this old Dell only has 1GB of RAM, and most solutions assume you can get into the system to fix it, so this newbie has struggled to learn to use a LiveCD to mount my install and get this far:\nI was surprised that Cryptswap is already installed on my impacted instance.

How can I add permissions to allow for write and read access and not removed the folder? \n\nA: Write and removed permission in the linux system is same . If you set your folder permissions to writable , it can be removed . To secure your folder from everyone , I suggest you to type this command :\nExample folder is /home/drajat : \n\nchmod 700 -R /home/drajat\n\nIf you want to set your folder only read for everyone type this command :\n\nchmod 744 -R /home/drajat\n\nInfo :\nnumber 7 = its code to sent the system to make my folder is accessible(read only) , writable, and executable only for the owner(you) .\nnumber 4 = its code to make your folder read for everyone , but they can write/removed and executable all file in your folder.\nnumber 0 = its code to make every user and group in your system can't access , read and executable your folder .\n\nA: Why are you concerned with the removal of the folder?\nRemoving of a folder can only happen when it's empty.

Can we install Ubuntu without a swap area? I bought a new Lenovo B50-80 laptop with 4GB RAM, 500 GB HDD preinstalled with Windows 7 Professional. I would like to install Ubuntu alongside the existing Windows 7. For that when I tried to create a new partition using the Disk Management, it is not allowing me to do it. I'm getting an error message that I cannot create more than 4 partitions. I was able to shrink the C: volume and create unallocated space. But the unallocated space is showing as unusable in Ubuntu installation.\nI tried to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy / take back up of the Lenovo D: which has the Lenovo applications and Drivers. And delete the D:  \n\n*Now, we have a new One unused partition of 25 gb unallocated space for installing the Ubuntu.  \nI tried to install Ubuntu in the unallocated space of 25gb. Since it is a single partition, Ubuntu is asking me to create another partition allocating 4gb for the swap area. When I try to do that, the remaining 21gb space is becoming unusable (Since, the Windows partition does not allow more than 4 partitions).\nMy question is can we install Ubuntu in the unallocated space of 25gb in a single partition? Is Swap area partition necessary? Can we install Ubuntu without a Swap area? Can Swap area be allocated as file space instead of a separate partition? What will happen if I install without a swap area? \n\nA: You don't really need a swap partition. In our times computers have 4GB of RAM or more. That is normally enough for daily use. \nBut... If you do RAM heavy tasks your machine might run out of RAM... and crash. \nIn my opinion a good solution for you is to install Ubuntu on that single partition an add maybe 1GB of swap as a swapfile.\nHere is a good toutorial for that...\nUbuntu Linux Create and Add Swap File Tutorial\nAnother solution would be to enable zRam. Look here... How do I use zRam?\n\nA: Swap partitions do two things: they can provide an overall speed boost by freeing up memory for more cache, and they can prevent rare disastrous out-of-memory situations where the system will start killing processes without warning.\nIf you have tons of RAM, you probably aren't needing it for a speed boost - it'll almost never be utilised.  But it is still a good idea to have it for the other purpose: just in case you run out of memory completely.  This can still happen even in these days of 8GB+ RAM, ie due to a rogue process, or a very memory-heavy process such as an image editor.\nYou don't need to use a partition.  It is possible to have a swap file instead of a swap partition.  Just don't set up any swap partition, and then set up a swap file later.\n\nA: No, you don't need a swap partition, as long as you never run out of RAM your system will work fine without it, but it can come in handy if you have less than 8GB of RAM and it is necessary for hibernation. For more information see this question: Do we still need swap partitions on desktop? \nHowever, you can get around the 4 partition limit by creating an extended partition, and then creating a swap partition and a default partition (these \"sub\" partitions appear under the extended partition and are called \"logical\" partitions). This will be an option when you create your partitions in the installer. Check out this related question: My disk already has 4 primary partitions, how can I install Ubuntu?\n\nA: Agree to all the above answers. Nowadays no essentially when you have lots of RAM(16 or 32 GB etc...). In my 32 GB RAM Desktop the swap partition is not being used to a great extent. I kept it as I am working with lot of Bigdata Hadoop and NoSQL which are in general Java based and can result into OOM(Out of memory errors). So just in those kind of scenarios it's good. It never hurts to keep it and if you feel it is not being used then simply merge it to '/'\n\nA: It depends on what you are running on your system.\nIf you are creating content, it is probably a good idea to still have swap space allocated, so if you do run out of RAM, your processes will just get slow instead of being killed and potentially losing work.\nIf your machine is just running programs, then you don't need or even want swap space. I design and build many kiosk-like display systems that fit this usage exactly. I'd rather like a process to die suddenly than be slow because then I can detect that condition and correct it.\nAs has been said before, you can allocate swap files on your root filesystem after installation if you have run out of main partitions. You might also be able to create an extended partition as one of your main partitions that can overcome the 4-partition limit if you have a disk that is MBR-based. GPT disks don't have the 4-partition limit.\n\nA: Thank you all for the suggestions and inputs. With all your help, I was able to successfully Install Ubuntu 14.0.4 LTS alongside Windows 7 Professional.  My Laptop is Lenovo B50 80 with 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD preinstalled with Windows 7 Professional.\nI'm summarizing what I did below, so that it may help others. \nAs mentioned in the question, I tried to shrink the C: Volume using Disk Management in Windows and allocated some space to install Ubuntu.\nBut, when I tried to install Ubuntu in the unallocated space, it was showing as unusable. (It is because Windows does not allow to create more than 4 partitions)\nFinally, this is what I did :\nSteps to Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 in Lenovo B50 80 :\n\n\n*\n\n*The Windows has two drives/ partitions : (Windows C: and Lenovo D: ) other than the 2 hidden partitions for One Key Recovery.\n\n*The Lenovo D: is 25 GB and has Applications and Drivers folders. We can take a back up of that. ( In a flash drive or by copying it to the C: ).\nI believe all the Applications and Drivers are available in the Lenovo website and it can be downloaded. So, I went ahead and deleted the D: partition. So, now there is an unallocated space of 25 GB.  Ubuntu needs only 6 GB space for installation. So, 25 GB is more than enough.\nBut if you think you need more space allocated for Linux. You can shrink the C: upto 200 GB and it will merge with the already unallocated 25 GB. So, now you will be having a single partition of unallocated partition of 225 GBs.\n\n\n*Now restart the system with Live USB Ubuntu Flash Drive. Select Try Ubuntu.\n\n*After Ubuntu is loaded. Click Install Ubuntu.\n\n*The installation window opens. Select the Language. Click Next/ Continue\n\n*There will be options like \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" . But in my case, Ubuntu did not detect Windows 7, so, I got only the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase the disk and install Ubuntu\n\n*Something Else.\n\n\n*Choose \"Something Else\" and click Continue. You will get the Partition screen.\n\n*Now you will be able to see all the partitions with the Windows drives and the free space of 225 GB.\n\n*Select the Free space and click + at the bottom to create a new Partition.\nFirst, create a partition for Swap Area with 4 GB space. So, Give Size as 4096.\nChoose the type of Partition as  \"Logical\"  instead of \"Primary\". Select \"Use as\" as Swap Area.\nClick Ok.\nNext we can use the remaining free space for the rest of the Linux installation.\nAgain Select the Free Space and click + at the bottom.\nSize will be having the remaining free space size by default. Choose the type of Partition as \"Logical\" instead of \"Primary\".\nSelect \"Use as\" as \"Ext4 Journaling File System\".\nSelect Mount Point as \" /\" .\n\n\n*Choose your hard disk \"/dev/sda...\" for \"Device for boot loader Installation\" Option.\n\n\nClick \"Install Now\". You will get a warning pop up that the two partitions you created now will be formatted.\nClick Ok and continue with the Installation.\n\n\n*The Installation will be completed successfully and it will ask you to restart the system.\n\n*Go ahead and restart the system.\n\n*Remove the Live USB flash drive before rebooting.\n\n*The system will sometimes boot to Windows or Ubuntu. You will not get the GRUB loader.\nIf your system boots to Windows by default and you don't see Ubuntu. Shut down and reboot with Live USB again to Ubuntu.\nIn my Case, the system restarted to Ubuntu.\n\n\n*Now we need to install the Boot Repair to fix the grub. So, Open the terminal and give the below commands one after the other:\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n\n\n*Boot Repair will open in GUI format. Just follow the given instructions and complete the process.\n\n\nThe GRUB will be successfully fixed.\n\n\n*Shut down and restart the system. You will be seeing the GRUB to choose Ubuntu or Windows to boot.\n\n\nA: Actually if you did its better. As others has said its ok. If you didn't unless you know that you won't run out of ram. But in case if you needed. You can reserve a pen drive to  the swap.

Is it possible to have a desktop login password that's different from the password used for super user permissions, like for example when you are installing software or running a command with sudo or something that needs super user access?\n\nA: Yes, sudo uses PAM and PAM supports configuration for each application.\n\nAuthentication and logging\nThe sudoers security policy requires that most users authenticate themselves before they can use sudo. A password is not required if the invoking user is root, if the target user is the same as the invoking user, or if the policy has disabled authentication for the user or command. Unlike su(1), when sudoers requires authentication, it validates the invoking user's credentials, not the target user's (or root's) credentials. This can be changed via the rootpw, targetpw and runaspw flags, described later.\n...\nrootpw\nIf set, sudo will prompt for the root password instead of the password of the invoking user when running a command or editing a file. This flag is off by default.\ntargetpw\nIf set, sudo will prompt for the password of the user specified by the -u option (defaults to root) instead of the password of the invoking user when running a command or editing a file. Note that this flag precludes the use of a uid not listed in the passwd database as an argument to the -u option. This flag is off by default.\nrunaspw\nIf set, sudo will prompt for the password of the user defined by the runas_default option (defaults to root) instead of the password of the invoking user when running a command or editing a file. This flag is off by default.\n\nSo yes, it is possible to change the password behavior. Be sure to test this out thoroughly. A mistake is easily made, locking you out of your system.

Based on the hardware specs I have below, is there a specific process that any of you would recommend for me to get the correct drivers installed and operational?\nHonestly at this point, I'm really wanting as specific of instructions as I can get because I'm frustrated at this whole process.\nHardware specs:\n\nFROM LSHW\n\nH/W path         Device     Class          Description\n======================================================\n/0                          bus            Motherboard\n/0/0                        memory         7867MiB System memory\n/0/1                        processor      Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3570K CPU @ 3.40GHz\n/0/100                      bridge         Xeon E3-1200 v2/3rd Gen Core processor DRAM Controller\n/0/100/1                    bridge         Xeon E3-1200 v2/3rd Gen Core processor PCI Express Root Port\n/0/100/1.1                  bridge         Xeon E3-1200 v2/3rd Gen Core processor PCI Express Root Port\n/0/100/1.1/0                display        Tahiti LE [Radeon HD 7870 XT]\n/0/100/1.1/0.1              multimedia     Tahiti XT HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 7970 Series]\n/0/100/2                    display        Xeon E3-1200 v2/3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller\n/0/100/14                   bus            7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB xHCI Host Controller\n/0/100/14/0      usb2       bus            xHCI Host Controller\n/0/100/14/1      usb1       bus            xHCI Host Controller\n/0/100/14/1/1               input          Razer BlackWidow Ultimate 2013\n/0/100/14/1/2               input          Razer DeathAdder Chroma\n/0/100/16                   communication  7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1\n/0/100/1a                   bus            7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2\n/0/100/1a/1      usb5       bus            EHCI Host Controller\n/0/100/1a/1/1               bus            Integrated Rate Matching Hub\n/0/100/1b                   multimedia     7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller\n/0/100/1c                   bridge         7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1\n/0/100/1c.3                 bridge         7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 4\n/0/100/1c.3/0               storage        ASM1062 Serial ATA Controller\n/0/100/1c.4                 bridge         7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 5\n/0/100/1c.4/0    enp5s0     network        NetLink BCM57781 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe\n/0/100/1c.5                 bridge         7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 6\n/0/100/1c.5/0               bridge         ASM1083/1085 PCIe to PCI Bridge\n/0/100/1c.7                 bridge         7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 8\n/0/100/1c.7/0               bus            ASM1042 SuperSpeed USB Host Controller\n/0/100/1c.7/0/0  usb4       bus            xHCI Host Controller\n/0/100/1c.7/0/1  usb3       bus            xHCI Host Controller\n/0/100/1d                   bus            7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1\n/0/100/1d/1      usb6       bus            EHCI Host Controller\n/0/100/1d/1/1               bus            Integrated Rate Matching Hub\n/0/100/1f                   bridge         Z77 Express Chipset LPC Controller\n/0/100/1f.2                 storage        7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family 6-port SATA Controller [AHCI mode]\n/0/100/1f.3                 bus            7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller\n/0/2             scsi0      storage      \n/0/2/0.0.0       /dev/sda   disk           120GB Samsung SSD 840\n/0/2/0.0.0/1     /dev/sda1  volume         99MiB Windows FAT volume\n/0/2/0.0.0/2     /dev/sda2  volume         127MiB reserved partition\n/0/2/0.0.0/3     /dev/sda3  volume         111GiB Windows NTFS volume\n/0/2/0.0.0/4     /dev/sda4  volume         449MiB Windows NTFS volume\n/0/3             scsi1      storage        \n/0/3/0.0.0       /dev/sdb   disk           1TB WDC WD1002FAEX-0\n/0/3/0.0.0/1     /dev/sdb1  volume         931GiB Windows NTFS volume\n/0/4             scsi2      storage        \n/0/4/0.0.0       /dev/sdc   disk           1TB WDC WD10JPVX-22J\n/0/4/0.0.0/1     /dev/sdc1  volume         511MiB Windows FAT volume\n/0/4/0.0.0/2     /dev/sdc2  volume         927GiB EXT4 volume\n/0/4/0.0.0/3     /dev/sdc3  volume         3681MiB Linux swap volume\nNOTE: I'm not sure why it's listing two models of Radeon, but I have the 7870.\n\nA: The first one is your GPU, the second is the HDMI audio output.

Internet connection fine. sudo apt-get install fluidsynth doesn't work I'm trying to download Fluidsynth. When I attempt to download it via Software Manager, it gives me this message:\nFailed to download package files. Check your internet connection.\n\nAs you can probably tell, my internet connection is just fine. No issues or anything. I then searched for another way, and found the sudo apt-get install solution. It didn't help, and gave me this message at the end of a wall of text:\nE: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?\n\nI then attempted sudo apt-get update, and upon running, a massive wall of text appeared, I noticed some errors throughout it as it scrolled up quickly, and in the end it gave me this message:\nE: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nAll variants of \"fix-missing\" that I tried weren't recognized, though I doubt that it would be much help either way. \nI really want to get Fluidsynth and I've had this problem before with things like Kdenlive and Openshot as well. I found the Fluidsynth website and downloaded the latest version, and it came in a .tar.bz2 file that I extracted, and found a bunch of files that I have no Idea what to do with. I did, however, open and read the READMEs, but they gave me no insight as to how to open or run the synthesizer. I tried:\nsudo apt-get install fluidsynth\n\nagain and got this message: \nfluidsynth is already the newest version.\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 280 not upgraded.\n\nI could really use some assistance, please.\n\nA: If you're having trouble with errors during sudo apt-get update, that could be a server being down temporarily or permanently. You could try changing the main software source download server to another source. \nSee: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Download_Server\nUnder \"Download from\", change from main server to other, and either click the \"select best server\" button or choose the one that looks nearest to your location. \nOnce you get a clean update try installing again. \nHowever if you already received \"fluidsynth is already the newest version\" Then that should mean it's installed. Perhaps one of the attempts you made actually worked and you hadn't noticed. \nTry running it either from terminal or from the dash menu.\n", "Q: How to add KRename to context menu How do I add KRename to the context menu so I can select files and use right click to rename them from the contextual pop up?\nI want to do this to make bulk or batch renaming of files faster so I don't need to open up KRename and manually navigate to the folder each time when I already have the folder I want to work with opened.\n\nA: Solution For KRename 4.0.9 - Nautilus-Actions 3.2.3 - Ubuntu 14.04\n1. First you will need KRename, of course.\na - Open software center, search for krename, install it.\n(or sudo apt install krename in terminal)\n2. Next you will need the Nautilus Actions Configuration Tool.\nThis application allows you to customize commands to add to your context menu (the pop up when you right click on a file)\na - Open Ubuntu Software Center\nb - Search for and install Nautilus-Actions Configuration tool\n3. Now you want to open Nautilus Actions Configuration Tool.\na - On your sidebar click to open \"Dash\", the top-most icon (by default) which allows you to search your computer for installed applications.\nb - Search for nautilus actions and click to open the Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool.\nc - Click Define New Action (top left-most icon with the green +)\nd - The Action tab should be open. For Context label enter Bulk Rename With Krename or anything that best describes this command to you.\ne -  Click the command tab. For path enter /usr/bin/krename\nf - For parameters enter %B\ng - Check that Working Directory is %d\nh - optional - put this custom command at root of context menu (save yourself extra mousing to open)\nh1 - Click the Edit Your Preferences Icon (wrench/screwdriver)\nh2 - Uncheck Create a root Nautilus-Actions menu and click okay\ni - Click File -> Save\nj - Exit program\nk - You may have to log out of your user account and back in for the setting to take effect. You may even have to reboot, I forget.\n4. Test it\na - open a folder with files you want to rename\nb - select some of them\nc - right click on selected files, you should see the option Bulk Rename With Krename (or nautilus actions -> bulk rename with krename)\nIf done correctly it will open up KRename and the selected files will be automatically added to work with more fasterer.\n", "Q: Mysql installation failed Mysql server is failed to start suddenly, so I just uninstalled it and tried to reinstall again.

In fact, if you do not have any extension in chrome, but you have adware, than it is not an extension but a software that is running on your machine.. There is software for example, that installs itself and then infects all browsers. Even if you delete a supposed extension, it will keep coming back. So in case chrome remains clean, here is what you can do: \n\n\n*\n\n*Revise your files and folders to see if there is anything that you don't remember or have not installed. \n\n*Check your System Monitor to see if there is any suspicious process or service running.

Full access to internet and network.  I then shared the Wired Connection using Ethernet cable to feed another computer .  Using the computer with full access, I have changed the settings in the \"network settings\" Wired to \"Share to other Computers\" as it says to do so in the many tutorials.  The computer receiving the shared ethernet works, but only has partial access.  \nThe Computer receiving the Shared Ethernet can remote into any computer on the network, including make changes to routers computers and modem but does not have internet access.\nNetwork settings Wired says its connected, all with all the proper ip and gateway matching the shared computers ip.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions, i dont understand why it only has local, but no internet\n\nA: Assuming it is something wrong with what you have done, here is what works for me.\nWe are going to configure the PC in the machine shop that receives WiFi to be a gateway and configure other devices to use this gateway to access the internet.\nHere is the guide I followed. Though it is written for Arch Linux, I have tested it on Ununtu 14.04. So here it goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a script named start-gateway.sh with the following content.\nsysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -j ACCEPT\nThe script assumes that the interface which has internet is wlan0 and you need to forward packets from eth0 (your ethernet interface) to your WiFi connection. So please confirm if these are the names of the interfaces from ifconfig output.\n\n\n*Make the script executable and you are done:\nchmod u+x start-gateway.sh\nWhenever you need to start the gateway, execute the script with root privileges when connected to the WiFi:\nsudo ./start-gateway.sh\nNow all you have to do to get internet on other devices connected to the Ethernet LAN is to set the manually set IP configuration on those devices, giving the gateway as the IP address of your new gateway. Set DNS information correctly too. If you don't have a local DNS, use the one provided by your ISP, OpenDNS, or GoogleDNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4).\nThat should do the job.\n\nA: Easy fix for Ubuntu 19.04:\nAfter setting up your wired sharing connection, just install the net-tools:\nsudo apt install net-tools\n\nThen it will do the internet connection job for you.\n", "Q: Would it be possible to save gedit backup files in a \"specific\" Folder?

The reason is you are trying to layer the same network layer on top on the first. Typically, you can tunnel L2 (ethernet) over tunneling protocols like L2TP or GRE etc. So you will have to create full L3 stacks on your bond0 and bond1 and layer a tunneling protocol on top of it to make them look like L2. At that point, you should be able to bond the two links.\nYou are best off with doing a bonding of all 4 interfaces into a single bond.

I would like to make a scheduled task on the machine to restart tomcat7 every 2 days.\nFor now I use sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 restart, is there an easy way to implement this?\n\nA: You can use a cron job for this. Create a shell script with these:\n#!/bin/sh\n/etc/init.d/tomcat7 restart\n\nThen set up a job in the crontab:\n0 0 */2 * * root my_script.sh\n\nThis will run the script at midnight, every two days.\n\nThis will \"solve\" your immediate problem. However I suggest to fix your application running on Tomcat, it is hardly ready for production, if it needs restarts like this.\n\nA: The cron package is the normal tool for scheduling events on your system. You can put actions into your user's crontab with the crontab -e command. Although as you need to use sudo to execute the init.d script, this won't work unless you've set up sudo usage with no password for that command.\nMy suggestion is that you edit the root crontab, by doing sudo crontab -e, and enter the line:\n30 6 */2 * * /usr/bin/service tomcat7 restart\n\nThis will restart tomcat7 at 6:30am every 2 days. If you want a different time, just alter the first two numbers. The command probably looks different to what you'd expect, but in 14.04 the correct way to use scripts in /etc/init.d is to use the service command.

But if I close the lid while my pc is starting up or shutting down, it goes to sleep. Any idea what causes this?\n\nA: The setting only affects the logged in user.

On Ubuntu 14.04 I have done this to get the latest postgres:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'\nwget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen I installed version 9.4:\nsudo apt-get install postgresql-9.4\n\nHowever it seems I have now three versions:\nsudo service postgresql stop\n\n * Stopping PostgreSQL 9.3 database server  [ OK ]\n * Stopping PostgreSQL 9.4 database server  [ OK ]\n * Stopping PostgreSQL 9.5 database server  [ OK ]\n\nHow can I keep only 9.4 and uninstall the other ones?\nThanks\nUPDATE:\nAs suggested in comments I have uninstalled 9.3 and 9.5.\nBut when I do this:\nsudo service postgresql status\n9.3/main (port 5432): down\n9.4/main (port 5434): online\n9.5/main (port 5433): down\n\nSo far so good, but when I switch to postgres:\nsudo su postgres\n\nand do a psql, I get an error:\npsql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory\n    Is the server running locally and accepting\n    connections on Unix domain socket \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\"?\n\n\nA: Different versions of PostgreSQL are located in the packages postgresql-9.*. \n\n\n*\n\n*So you should remove your two packages:\nsudo apt-get purge postgresql-9.3 postgresql-9.5\n\n\n*Then you should remove unnecessary config folders:\nrm -r /etc/postgresql/9.3/ /etc/postgresql/9.5\n\n\n*And from /var/lib/ folder if you have:\n/var/lib/postgresql/*\n\nI hope it will help you.\n\nA: Adding answer very late but might help people here. \nShort answer: Error indicates postgres configured on wrong(not default) port. Use the right port\nLong answer: \nWhen you installed multiple version of Postgresql, all of them started running postgres clusters on different port. In your output, following postgres versions are running: 9.3 --> 5432, 9.4 -->5434, 9.5 --> 5433. \nsudo service postgresql status\n9.3/main (port 5432): down\n9.4/main (port 5434): online\n9.5/main (port 5433): down\n\nYou can uninstall the other versions using sudo apt-get purge postgresql-9.x where 9.x is your version however in your case the version(9.4) which was present on your system is configured to run on port 5434. Thus the error Is the server running locally and accepting\n    connections on Unix domain socket \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\"? perfectly indicates that psql by default trying to connect to port 5432 which no longer has any postgres attached. \nTwo solutions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either use psql -p 5434 i.e port option(-p/--port) in psql command.\n\n*Or configure your postgres server port configuration value in /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/postgresql.conf to serve on 5432.

I thought that would just consist of mapping the encrypted partitions, and then the usual dd, but no...\nThese are the partitions/devices involved:\n/dev/sda: Old disc, with encrypted partition\n/dev/sda1: FAT32 with boot flag\n/dev/sda2: EXT2, containing some EFI and grub stuff\n/dev/sda3: LUKS partition I want to clone (about 460 GiB);\n           contains a swap and an ecrypted EXT4 with about 20 GiB used\n/dev/sdc: New SSD\n\nFor a start, I simply copied /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 to /dev/sdc{1,2} using gparted, which seemed to work (both mountable). Then, I created a fresh EXT4 partition suffiently large to hold the contents of the encrypted EXT4 on /dev/sdc3, and a new swap on the remaining space on /dev/sdc4. \nI then decrypted /dev/sda3 with\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 crypt1\n\nand copied over its contents, using\nsudo dd if=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root of=/dev/sdc3\n\n(where /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root contains the original root partition and can correctly be mounted). This finishes after the 19 GiB or so that are actually in use on the encrypted partition.\nFrom that point one, something seems to have failed; I can't mount /dev/sdc3 afterwards, as it seems to be broken. \nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdc3 /mnt\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdc3,\nmissing codepage or helper program, or other error\nIn some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\ndmesg | tail or so\n\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fsck /dev/sdc3\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\nError reading block 60325888 (Invalid argument).

There seems to be involved something with a wrong size. Maybe I need to resize the encrypted stuff first?\nSo, can I somehow fix this? Or, what should I do alternatively to achieve the same thing -- essentially cloning the encrypted EXT4 root onto the SSD and get a bootable, unencrypted copy of the old system? (If resizing and then cloning the whole of /dev/sda with encryption turns out to be significantly easier, I could do that too; my original assumption was that cloning it unencryptedly will get me around the whole encrypted-resizing-hassle...)\n\nA: It turns out the whole thing is easier than I thought. Motivated by @Xen2050's comments, I was able to essentially just rsync the whole system onto a fresh install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot with a live stick\n\n*Install a fresh Ubuntu onto the new disc (using a separate efi boot partition)\n\n*Mount the new Ubuntu's root partition to /mnt/new-root\n\n*Decrypt the old system via cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdXY crypt1\n\n*Mount the old root partition by mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root /mnt/old-root\n\n*Copy everything: rsync -aAXv --exclude={\"/dev/*\",\"/proc/*\",\"/sys/*\",\"/tmp/*\",\"/run/*\",\"/mnt/*\",\"/media/*\",\"/lost+found\"} /mnt/old-root /mnt/new-root\n\n*Edit the fstab in /mnt/new-root/etc/fstab to contain the UUIDs of the partitions on the new disc (can be obtained via gparted)\n\n\nAnd surprisingly, that's all. Restart, and you can boot from the new disc, with everything the same as before (just without encryption and faster).\n", "Q: LibreOffice, GTK3, and Lubuntu 14.04 LTS OS: Lubuntu 14.04.3 LTS fully updated\nKernel: 3.13.0-77-generic\nI've just installed LibreOffice Version: 5.0.4.2, Build ID: 1:5.0.4~rc2-0ubuntu1~trusty1 like this:  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-5-0\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\n\nI also installed libreoffice-gtk3 like this:  \nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-gtk3\n\nBut LibreOffice is still using gtk2.

That should fix your problems. \nJust follow the instructions here for easy ways to switch to Ubuntu\nEdit with details if computer does not automatically boot from CD or stick:\nEnter Bios (watch out for this message during start up about which F-key to press, maybe F12?) and change the boot order so that CD or USB stick are preferred over your hard drive. Save these changes and reboot. In case your computer cannot boot from a USB stick, try a CD. (This may be the case for old computers)\n\nA: Hot normally a problem, if you have access to a working pc and a dvd burner.\nReburn the ISO inage on an new DVD-R blank, or erase the existing DVD-RW disk anf reburn it.  I'v encountered many \"hidden\" errors in optical disks that can clobber you good, but just redo and try again.\nBut you may not even have to fo that.  Use a lens cleaner and soft cloth or tissue and wipe the shiny underside of the disk clean, leaving no streakmarks, spots, or fingerprints behind.   Only handle the disk by its edges like you would carry a small turtle by clenching the edges of its shell with one hand and keeping it level.  If it is too wide to hold this way, use the edges around the inner hole. either with an outer edge or spread two fingers in the hole to provide a wedge against dropping.  Windex or a bit of mild detergent should work nicely, just get it all off after cleaning and leave no waterdrops on the surface.\nOnce you boot up the ISO, you can either go to Try or right into Install.  If you go to Try, you can mount the partition you were trying to and examine it for hour user accounts and contents.  WE are going to save that by not reformatting the partition during the install.  If you want to play safe, you can copy the folder /home to a different drive or partition first.  Uou probably will have to open a terminal throu Dash (top icon on left side) and type in \"te\".\nYou then click on Terminal.  With that open you type in seither sudo -i, and after the Enter key, you type in nautilus and another Enter key.  Now the File Manager (Nautilus) can do things the normal user can't.  you can also access the mounted partitions and drives by doing a cd /m*/*/ command.  This puts you where a dir command shows you the partition and drive names for those that are mounted.type in cd , and you are in the base or root point on that drive.  It's base to us now because it is not active, but when you install to it and boot up, it becomes the new root.\nA dir or ls command here shows you all of its system folders and a few files.  \n\nMore software can be installed at this point if you have enough RAM, but it is all temporary, and the amount that can be added is restricted to the amount of RAM you have.  It all goes away when you reboot.  You can write to a device at this point and that will last. \nI use to advise people they could use the command rm -r ./[!h]* and wipe out everything except the only folder that begins with \"h\", that being /home/ where all user accounts and data reside.  But you really don't need to and it is safer not to.  In fact the whole process of using the Terminal was not necessary, but back then I did not know that.  It was part of my learning curve at the time.  Maybe you learned something to.\nIn fact, we did not have to Try the LiveCD at all, but could have gone right to install.  But this way, you can use the laptop while the install is taking place, to get on the internet and check your webmail, visit Facebook, or go back to Dash and type something like \"ma\" to being up the majongg game, or \"so\" to get and idea of what software you can install after the install is done.  Otherwise, the ten or so minutes required for the install just gives you a short slideshow of what you get with your new install.\nIt comes down to the install method you pick once the Installer begins running.  You will be asked questions like if you want it to reformat the whole DRIVE, not just this partition, and it will then install a new logical volume manager scheme if you allow this.  That wipes out everything on the drive, which I don't want, but you might.  And if you have multiple partitions or want to keep Windows, you don't want this either. You will not be able to repartition the drive later once you are under an LVM either, without starting over from scratch.  I prefer to use Ext4 for each partition and set them up with a tool like gparted or use the install process itself to add, delete, or resize partitions when I get to that point.  Note that if you elect NOT to reformat, you must user the same same format type and not resize the partition.  You only want to change from \"Do Not Use This Partition\" and designate it as root by selecting /.  But you can't do any of that under this choice.\nThe second choice will divide the drive up between Windows or other installed OSes and create a new partiton just for itself.  That means converting existing partitons to new structures and mappings to retain their content, and that takes a real ling time and can have problems.  \n\nThe ONLY way I will install a LiveCD is to use the last, \"Something else\" process.  This is where YOU make the decisions, not a piece of software.\nIt takes a bit more expertise, but you can get online help. But before this point, you will be asked if the Installer can unmout mounted drives.  Say yes. as your intended partition is still mounted.  There are circumstances where you should say no id installing from an ISO image of a LiveCD that is on a partition, but that is not the case when it's being done from an actual CD or DVD disk.  While in Try, you could right-click on the partition icon and do a unmount and avoid this message, but if you forget, it gets taken care of here. \nYou reach a point in the process then where you see all the attached drives and all the partitions.  Only the first drive may appear on the acreen, but in the upper right portion of the inner window is a small scroll list where you can pick a different drive instead, if you have more than one.  Warning though:  If you pick a USB drive, make sure you also pick it to be the destination for the grub installation.  That is in the little space where you see the .../sda displayed.  If you change /sda to point to the USB drive/partition, the boot process will ONLY WORK properly when that USB drive is plugged in.  If you screw up and it gets changed, don't worry.  Reboot into the install you want to be the normal one by having the USB drive plugged in for the boot to work, and once in the desired install and having your Desktop up, open a Terminal and type these commands to fix the problem:\nsudo update-grub; sudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThis will switch the primary install choice to that partition.  If you have the USB drive still installed, it will bew picked up as a alternative.  Unplug it and it won't be.  But if leftin, your next bootup when the USB drive is out will cause grub to complain and wait a time for you to decide to insert it by hitting \"m\" first, or to skip it if you hit \"s\" instead.  That little bit of aggrevation and loss of time never gets better.\nBut to get the same treatment on the USB drive, you have to have it installed and targeted with the sudo grup install command, but have its /dev/ name replace the sda in the ... /dev/sda command above.  Note that you might accidentally pick a partition like /dev/sda1, which it will do, but complain about what isn't there, and you can't normally boot up this way anyway.  So best not to.\nIhe installer for Ubuntu will create the /home folder and minimal user account under the name you gave it IF THEY ARE MISSING.  But if you already have them there, it will leave them intact WITH ALL YOU USER DATA AND FILES UNDISTURBED.  Everything related to the system folders are deleted.  You cannot add new folders under /home because that is limited to one or two user accounts.  BUT YOU CAN ADD NEW FOLDERS AT THE ROOT OR / LEVEL, and they will survive as well.  Ihis is important, because as super user (sudo , sudi -i, or even sudo su root), I have the power to do this, or take other steps as described below\n:\n    sudo mkdir /hold; sudo cp -rfp /home/ /hold/ \nThis is a complete copy using reiterative, force, and preserve privileges options of all user accounts to the backup /hold folder.  Good for later recovery efforts if you mess things up in the future, but you can still get into the partition.  Of course /hold could be on a different partition, so this could be a safeguard both ways and you could in effect have cloned installs or even the same user stuff under different installs, a good way to see if you might want to move up or sideways to another Linux distro in the future.  \nThe alternative approach is to use dd (duplicate drive) or rsync.  With dd, the older method, the two drives have to have the same exact geometry as to cylenders, tracks, sectors, and all that.  rsync is a powerful tool, but has a weakness in that it wants to keep the newest version of any files copied. In other wors, it goal is to syncronize two or more PCs as to certain or all folders and files. You want that ability with cp, you add the -u (update) flaf to the -rfp to make -urfp.  The order of these flags is not a problem, so if you want to make a word like -furp or -purf, it still works fine.\nThe problem with cp is that you find it is weak on wildcards, and has no other include or exclude abilities.   The same weakness is shared with dir, ls, and stat.  But find, tar, grep, and rsync are among the commands that separate file name/type from path in the initial request and also add in include and exclude directives (find not so much though, as it requires these to be individualized on the command line, possibly led by standalone -o to express OR rather than assumed AND, and possibly preceded by ! or ^ to indicate NOT.  An example of find would be:\nfind \\/ a ! b -o c\n\nExpressions are resolved in a left to right order,and wild cards are allowed.  Other operators like -readable -excuatable -type f -purge and [-delete can also be used, and effect results up to that point.  -ourge is a misnomer in that it would be better named -avoid or -skip.  Because that is whar it does.  =purge really means skip certain folders and their content in terms of subolder and files.\nAnd find does not always get it right as to what you are looking for, but it only checks particulars about the folders and files. so is fast and gives you details the others don't check for,  It's not absolute about distinguishing whether a file is binary specific or actually one of the many text types, so its results need to be captured to file with >, >>, | tee files(s), or | tee -a files(s) and checked further.  In Windows, there are three methods for detecting types:  The letters after the last period in the file name are its extension, and/or the first word (2 chars) that make up the start of the file.  Those are the primary ways.  But under Windows, they added associations in the Registry where certain extensions map to one or more applications.  Then the user decides which of these to actually use.  That one then takes precidence in the future, becoming the new default for that user.\nWhile some extensions from the DOS days are considered traditional, these were always two alphas, meaning letters, which are 26^2 in number or 676 in all, from AA to ZZ.  If you consider lower case as being different, you could have 52^2 or 2,704 types.  Seems like a lot, but real plain jane text files can have any two characters present, and even binary files can\npossibly match up. Further, DOS and Windows treat upper amd lower case letters the same, which limits it to the initial 676 combinations.  So you pretty much have to see if the related app (program) recognises it or not, or be on a witch hunt for what program it might fit to, and there are thousands of programs out there.\nBut even in unknown or misadentified file types, and with the MacOS and Linux that assume no extension association for the most part, something has to show whether a file contains primarily text, usually in Unicode or ASCII, but possibly EBCDIC and other forms.  The first decision is whether it is a 16-bit (word) code like Unicode, or whether it is only 8-bits like ASCII or EBCDIC (an old IBM mainframe code).  For Unicode, you first check every other byte to see if there is consistency there or not.  If so, you then scan the other odd bytes and see if they match a text pattern like ASCII or if Unicode,a different written language as specified by the other 8 bits.\nSounds complicated, but actually it does not take too many tests like this on a file to see if yes, it is a written language of some kind, or no, it is a binary file.  It is the ratio of visible symbolic codes when compared to non-visible codes in the possible language under consideration.\nBut even as a binary file, it may conform to certain known types.  Through a process of trial-and-error, you could effect a program that can identify a likely binary type and even a possible doc or spreadsheet type, regardless of presence or absence of an extension, and even recover the text groups that appear in that file and put them in a new text file for further study.  In other words, if your partition got really hammered, as long as you can recover parts of the file, you can get most of your text back, simply because text has to follow certain rules.\nIf you encrypted your files, which is a excellent idea because otherwise you are at risk of malware reading them to get personal data, You probably  have a high degree of certainty of their protection.  But it can never be 100 percent certainty that you are completely protected. As long as you alone have the encryption key, even the average hacker can't get to your data.  But to the above average hacker, you have merely presented him with a challenge. This is because we are talking software here, and there are numeouseways to attack software, and the internet leaves a door open for the attackers to get in.  And often if they don't come to you, you can be lured into coming to them.  And either you open the files and read them into RAM where they are again plain text, or they master how you do this by observing and recording you doing your thing , then send that info back by the internet.  Ehen they are ready, they can hit with you with a hidden process to use your exposed steps and load up other encrypted files and harvest them for information and send that back as well.\nYou have the encryption key, but not the method of encryption used.  You could run into serious problems when attempting to work from a LiveCD to recover encrypted files and folders.  A part of the reason is that under the LiveCD, you are always ubuntu.  But when you made the encryption methos your default, you were your username.  If that is a factor, you may have deep problems which only becoming your username with the same encryption key can resolve.  This is all theoretical, as I've not used encryption myself.\nThis is because the encrypt/decript could be enhanced in some way with information related to that specific install or user. like incorporating the same UUID and hidden password into the key process. This would make the folders and files unreadable if just copied to an alternate drive or uploaded to a pirate's PC via the internet.  What's being used, and how it's being used, are simply not known at this point.\nTokeep it from being too restrictive on the user, What you probably have insteads is an encrypt/decript process that just uses the key you come up with and maybe your username.  It it included your password as well, then you lose the option to change your passwords on occasion.  However, that does not rule out physical characteristics of the PC, such as name, model number, and/or serial number in the creation of a complete enctyption key.  That increases security, but really limits where the files and data can reside and be accessible.\nIt may be futile anyway.  Encryption is just software, and anything that is software can be hacked by anyone who is expert at it and puts enough effort at it.  And when the same software is used worldwide and is publicly available, even documented to help developers, the task is not so much about unraveling the code, vur is more a question of which libraries, modules, APIs, and programs are handling the encryption/decryption process.  And in memory the contents of those files is revealed, so they can just steal it from there if they want.\n0And they can even implant their own coded processes to  re-encrypt everything with their own key and negotiating a ransom electonicly so you can get your files back by purchasing the key from them.  No guarantee they will actually send you a key or that it is the right key.  There is no honor among thieves, and another transmission may be their undoing, so you aren't likely to get your files and data back even if you pay.\nThey go after anybody, as they share their methods with others of like mind, and what eventually entraps them is the money trail.  The monwy has to get back to them somehow, but that is a major undertaking in its own right, trying to track down money transfers over the internet, and they attack once and move on, setting up new accounts for the purpose.  There are three things you can do for better protection:  (1)  Back up your user accounts frequently, and keep older backups in case recent ones prove to be no good.  (2)  Put your backups somewhere else, like on USB drives, other computers, or in cloud storage.  Somewhere that if this PC gets hit, you can recover your content from another location.  USB drives are particularly good if you only use them for backups and keep them disconnected otherwise.  (3)  Get off WiFi and Bluetooth and other transmissions.  If it's in the air, they can get it.   Go wireless and through an ISP, get behind firewalls, and hope that is enough.\nMalware protection works, to a point:  That point being, it can only protect you from what has been discovered about these attacks, the development of \"signatures\" (pattern recognition), the propagation of those signatures (often once a week, not every hour or every day), and the time taken bu the user to run the full scans needed to see if ANY of the files on you system had been been infected by the newest viruses detected.\nAnd since no one company's product does all things well or have the same signatures, you get 3 to five of the best, give each an allotted time for\nfull scans, and hope the overlap catches maybe 98% of the KNOWN bugs out there.  But there are always new ones showing up.  Fortunately, most of the new ones are adaptations of others, and share pretty much the same signatures, so it is maybe a bit better than it sounds.\nMe. I got off Windows over a decade ago because it is the biggest PC software target in the world, and people who stick to it don't even know that they have great alternatives in Linux like Ubuntu.  In the 7 years I've been on Ubuntu, I've had only five scam emails reach me where someone wanted my personal data.  My ISP , Cox.net, trapped the rest.  Then Thunderbird warned me the addresses given and URL given were bogus, but did not directly show me the real address.  On the other hand, Slimjet, a free and top-knotch web browser,  not only warned me again, but showed me the bogus URL link and opened and sent a report for me to people who investigate these matters.\nI wasn't going to provide any peraonal data, but I quickly determined that the account was closed, possibly as they had already taken one fish and had quickly moved on.  Or maybe the complaints before mine had brought the law quickly on the scene.  But the email address was from an email provider in Britian, which shows you how widespread the threat is now.\nYour safety is in keeping essential data off your pc or hand-help where intruders can find it.  Or use unconventional ways of storing or coding it so that it escapes detection.  The better known your methods are, the more likely that information will be taken from you, because the better known and more prevalent approaches will be attacked first.  That's one reason Windows had become so vulnerable.  There are other reasons related to Windows, but more on that further down.\nI also sometines do two installs, one behind the other, for the same user.  After the first install, I use Try again and get into the sudo mode and move /home to /keep or /house.  So you still have the raw user account mas\nde, but not in /home anymore/  I avoid format by using Something else again and make exactly the same account again in the new .home created. and \n\nDifferent things to try, different ways to manage and attack the problem.  The big thing is, Linux allows this by  the separateness of /home as it leaves it alone it already there, and the LiveCD gives you real Linux power even on a CD or DVD.  Windows is a purely propretary product designed to only work from the PC where originally installed. and while there have been efforts at CD and DVD workarounds, you can't really master Windows because it is prohibited by law.  If you do a reinstall, it sets up new accounts under prior names and hides the old accounts and their contents.\nAn Administrator can work around this, but it is a pain in the neck.  And if you do the reinstall just to get control back, you lose all the added patches, fixes, and added software you once had, because the Registry is virginized again. An administrator can back up the Registry against the possibility of future corruption. but that's planning ahead, a task that has to be kept up as new software is added. Or after the Registry is cleaned.  Or purged by malware protection software.  The Windows' solution was to let the user set a number of saved recovery points, so you can go back to a better time.  That helps, but I find it a less than favorable solution.  First, it eats up drive space to save what Linux calls a \"snapshot\".  You can do the same thing in Linux, but I never bother.  Too many easy workarounds from the command line.\nSo with Windows, you have days of catching up again, and its almost as bad.  If you revert to the initial install from the hidden D: drive, which cannot be done piecemeal so that your settings, added software, and personal files and data are saved.  If you somehow keep your personal data intact, you have days of gradually getting Windows patches and bug fixes  downloaded and installed, with frequent reboots. Many shutdowns are held up because windows does not implement all the updates until the end, and you are warned not to power off Windows while this is going on. Occasionally they pull these dixes together into an SP. which I think of as a Super Patch.  It's a big collection of previous patches so that you just need to be that one, then do a reboot, and you are caught up to that point.  There are few if any actual enhancements in terms of new features or capabilities, as these are all reserved for the new release scheduled somewhere in the future.  And you will normally have to buy that new release when it comes out.  Your release is old news and will soon cease to be supported.  Win10 was an exception when it came out, because Win8.x was so vad that many people paid to revert to Win7 instead of waiting.  They were so angered that they were not included in the Win8.x replacement that they exxentially forced Microsoft to relent and credit them with a free upgrade to Win10 if they could prove their PCs had initially had Win8.x installed on it.  But now I've heard many prefer Win7, which has less in the way of annoyances on it. Miceosoftis out of touch with what people want or need.  It is geared to give them what Microsoft thinks it can persuade them to buy,  If you wanted a good stable Windows, you could have stopped at Windows 2000, or at worse, WinXP.  WinXP was a restampted version of Win 2000 with stiff license verification and validation added so that they could beat down counterfeits coming out of Asia.\nOnly verified installs could get Windows patches, and they made sure of this by forcing IE to be recognized as an integral part of Windows, then making sure only IE could poll for and get the fixes.  They even forced Windows to prove itself as valid, and otherwise display a warning that it was not the real thing on the screen of cloned or pirated copies.  Not easy to do when it isn't even real Windows, but they found a way.\nLinux is entirely different.  I get new releases and patches about twice a week, and it is only when the kernel, or core, is enhanced and recompiled on my own PC is a reboot indicated, and that can be delayed until later.\nA typical automatic update is over in less than 10 minutes, ans shutdowns are close to immediate.  When I reboot, I have full choice as to whether I use the most recent compile or an earlier one.  And it is all free, the download, the install, the upgrades, everything.  Anything where money is involved is either a request for a small donation or a small fee, of a few dollars when the appearance of 3rd party software choices is asked for by the user.  Not the numdreds of dollars needed for upgrading Windows and buying other new software that \n\nSo you made the right move to Linux, which is very pointed at meeting user needs, not craven desires.  \n\nIf Linux gives you any problems, just ask for help as you did.  You will find it in spades.  Most are short, but having heen in your shoes a few timea, this is the summation of my experience and what you can do to help yourself.  If too long or detailed for some minds here, I can place on a cloud and supply a link back.  Those interested enough can follow the limk.  Those not interested can skip it.

While installing Ubuntu on a Mac, should I install it under EFI or BIOS?\nI'm using rEFInd, trying to install Ubuntu 15.10 \n\nA: Most of the installation process is identical for EFI-mode versus BIOS-mode installations. They differ in three ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*When booting the installer in BIOS mode, you can boot either 32- or 64-bit versions of Ubuntu, at least if you've got a 64-bit CPU. In EFI mode, you can install only 64-bit versions of Ubuntu, and that only if you've got a 64-bit EFI (which most Macs do). If you have a rare Mac with a 32-bit EFI, things get complicated.\n\n*If you install in EFI mode, the installer will set your EFI System Partition (ESP) to be mounted automatically at /boot/efi. If you install in BIOS mode, this won't happen. This detail can be changed manually after installation.\n\n*The installer will install a boot loader to match its own boot mode. (An exception is if you launch into \"try before installing\" mode, open a Terminal, and type synaptic -b. In this case, no boot loader will be installed.)\n\n\nIMO, installing a 32-bit OS on a 64-bit CPU seldom makes sense these days. One notable exception is some fairly early Intel-based Macs, which have 32-bit EFIs. Thus, the first point is unimportant for most users. As noted earlier, an exception is if you've got one of the rare Macs with a 32-bit EFI (from roughly the first year of Intel-based Mac production).\nThe second point is easy to change, and so doesn't bear much consideration, provided you understand how to edit /etc/fstab. If you don't understand this topic, see this page.\nThe boot loader issue is the big one. To launch a BIOS-mode boot loader, Macs require that your disk use an MBR partition table or a GPT with a hybrid MBR. OS X is normally installed to GPT, which means that if you're dual-booting, you'll need a hybrid MBR to dual-boot with a BIOS-mode boot loader. Please read the link earlier in this paragraph. It describes hybrid MBRs in more detail, including why they're so DANGEROUS. For this reason alone, I strongly advise against using a BIOS-mode install of Ubuntu if you're dual-booting with OS X.\nIf Ubuntu is to be the only OS on the computer, though, you can use a straight-up MBR (with no GPT) and install in BIOS mode. This is likely to work better than an EFI-mode installation, but it will limit your options if you subsequently decide you want to dual-boot after all. It will also make it harder to update the computer's firmware, should that ever be necessary.\nGetting back to dual-booting, if you install Ubuntu directly in EFI mode, it will try to install an EFI-mode version of GRUB. This may work fine, and may enable you to dual-boot with OS X by using GRUB's boot menu. This configuration will bypass rEFInd (unless you re-install it). I've seen reports of this configuration not working, though; the system will boot straight to either OS X or Ubuntu, making it difficult to boot the other OS.\nIf you want to keep using rEFInd, the safest approach is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode. It doesn't matter if you do this in BIOS mode or in EFI mode, except for the comment about whether your ESP will be mounted automatically when you're done.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Type ubiquity -b. This will launch the Ubuntu installer. The -b option tells it to not install GRUB.\n\n*Install Ubuntu regularly. Be sure to use ext4fs, not another filesystem. (If you really want to use another filesystem, you can, but that complicates matters slightly. Post back with details if you need further advice on this point.)\n\n*When you're done, reboot. rEFInd should appear (if it's already installed) or the computer will boot straight to OS X (if rEFInd is not already installed).\n\n*In OS X, (re-)install rEFInd. This step exists solely to ensure that the EFI filesystem driver for ext4fs is installed. You could instead install that driver manually yourself. (You could also manually install another EFI filesystem driver, if that was necessary.)\n\n\nThe result of this procedure is that, when you reboot, rEFInd should come up and give you the option of booting either OS X or Ubuntu. One caveat is that the Ubuntu option will require some tweaking if you use a separate /boot partition. You can boot on a one-time basis by hitting F2 or Insert twice, rather than Enter, once the Ubuntu option is selected. You can then add ro root=/dev/whatever, where /dev/whatever identifies your root (/) filesystem. Once you've booted Ubuntu, run the mkrlconf script that comes with rEFInd.

I have an annoyingly complicated find command I've cobbled together that I pipe to rsync with the intention of copying files and syncing new versions. I'm trying to write something that is efficient enough to be run in cron.\nfind /home/archive/dir1/ -not -path '*/\\.*' -ipath \"/home/archive/dir1/*/*document-name*\" -type f \\( -iname \"*.ods\" -o -iname \"*.pdf\" \\) -print0 | rsync -v --delete --files-from=- --from0 / /home/user/newdir2/\n\nThe idea is that it goes into a huge directory, pulls out the files that have filenames with document-name in the path.\nThe problem is it doesn't just copy files, it recursively copies all directory structure, when I simply want a all files returned from find to be collected into this separate directory.\nI get exactly the result I want with:\nfind /home/archive/dir1/ -not -path '*/\\.*' -ipath \"/home/archive/dir1/*/*document-name*\" -type f \\( -iname \"*.ods\" -o -iname \"*.pdf\" \\) -exec rsync -avz --delete {} /home/user/newdir2/ \\;\n\nTrouble is this spawns a billion rsync instances to do something that a single file list ought to do, probably not great for cron.\nIE, this:\n/home/archive/dir1/New1/New1 document-name.ods\n/home/archive/dir1/New2/New2 document-name.pdf\n/home/archive/dir1/New3/new3-DOCUMENT-NAME.ods\n...\n/home/archive/dir1/New9234/New9234-document-name.ods\n\nBecomes:\n/home/user/newdir2/New1 document-name.ods\n/home/user/newdir2/New2 document-name.pdf\n/home/user/newdir2/new3-DOCUMENT-NAME.ods\n...\n/home/user/newdir2/New9234-document-name.ods\n\nAny suggestions on improving my command welcome.\nI have tried using exclude in rsync, but I do not think it's the right solution.\nHow can I efficiently sync all of these files?\n\nA: I do not think there is a much more efficient way then finding files and execute a single instance of rsync. Any attampt to pipe a list of files into rsync will result in a maintained directory structure. \nOne alternative (if you can constraint the find pattern) is to use:\nrsync -d --delete --include=*.pdf --include=*.ods --exclude=* /home/ms/archive/dir1/**/. /home/ms/newdir2/.\n\nThat will sync all pdf/ods-files of (sub-)directories with the folder /home/ms/newdir2/ without maintaining directories in a single rsync-structure.\nYour given example (in case document-name or DOCUMENT-NAME) would be solved by using:\nrsync -d --delete --include=*document-name.pdf --include=*DOCUMENT-NAME.pdf --include=*DOCUMENT-NAME.ods --include=*document-name.ods --include=*DOCUMENT-NAME.pdf --exclude=* /home/ms/archive/dir1/**/. /home/ms/newdir2/.\n\n", "Q: Changing Xscreensaver's Video Player from mpv to VLC The official documentation for xscreensaver gives an example of how to play videos as a screensaver:\n\nInstall mpv and add something like the following to the `programs' preference in your .xscreensaver file:\n\n \"My Movie\"  mpv --really-quiet --no-audio --fs --loop=inf  \\\n                 --no-stop-screensaver                      \\\n                 --wid=$XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW                 \\\n                 $HOME/movies/*.mp4                       \\n\\\n\nThat's all well and good, but I would love to have one less dependency on my system (namely, mpv).

I'm sure it's happened to everyone some time....\nI was installing something with Ubuntu Software Center, a lot downloaded, but it crapped out half way through the installation with errors to the effect of the app is out of date and missing parts.\nFor one thing, I don't know where apps download to when using USC, when I download things, I put them in their own folder. \nIs there an app to clean up fragments? Terminal commands? \n\nA: Good advise above.  USC is best noted for showing possible matches to needs in categories or by partial names or term matches.  For instance, you can type in py or python and find out lots.  Or tex, text, edit, editor, or combine tex ed and get a host of possible matches.  You even have a star rating system, whether it is already installed or not, and under More, a brief breakdown on what it is or does,  And if you download a deb file from someplace, USC will seek to install it for you.  But under some conditions, USC craps out or gets hung, forcing st least a logout to get it to close.\nSo you have aLternatives, like apt-get, aptitude, and synaptic.  Only apt and apt-get, and USC come as part of the Ubuntu install as far as I know.  The other two can of course be installed.  Synaptic rivals USC in giving you choice, but is not quite as generous with details and user ratings.  \n\nApt adds more functionality to apt-get and apt-cache  it allows searches, show,list, and install as options.  The search finds pattern matches like as you get in USC and synaptic, but from the command like.  Since you can have multiple reeminals in separate windows, with copy-and-paste, you can take the colored name in the search window and do a show in another window or a list in a third,  you can even do an install ina forth window,\nUnfortunately, in the latest 14.04 release, apt reports it does not have a stable CLI (command line interface) and cannot work properly with any pipe symbols like >,>>, or |.  Under test, this proved to be an understatement.  It tanked in each case.  I will miss this feature until it returns,  Meanwhile usc is doing its job.  The thing about USC is that you can queue more installs and removes while one is in progress before uour sudo rights time out.  \n\nIt can be a bit difficult to maneuver up and down the possible candidates list.  It sort of jams when you near the top going up, or near the bottom scrolling sown.  A part of the problem could be a hyoersensative rouchpad on my laptop.  What haooens most often is the focus on the list got dropped even though one of the list items appears to be still selected.  Try selecting it or a different entry again with the mouse and use the up or down arrow key to continue your journey up or down the list.\nLoaded packages generally show up in Dash or the main menu selections if using a Gnome-session-Manager alternative like Metacity.  I like Metacity as it gives me a lot of direct control over directories or files; at least at the user account level.\n", "Q: i cannot install eclipse plugin for openframeworks?

It does this by\n  comparing SHA-1 hashes of important files with known good ones in\n  online databases, searching for default directories (of rootkits),\n  wrong permissions, hidden files, suspicious strings in kernel modules,\n  and special tests for Linux and FreeBSD.\nThe tool has been written in Bourne shell, to allow for portability.\n  It can run on almost all UNIX-derived systems.\n\nchkrootkit\n\nchkrootkit (Check Rootkit) is a common Unix-based program intended to\n  help system administrators check their system for known rootkits. It\n  is a shell script using common UNIX/Linux tools like the strings and\n  grep commands to search core system programs for signatures and for\n  comparing a traversal of the /proc filesystem with the output of the\n  ps (process status) command to look for discrepancies.\nIt can be used from a \"rescue disc\" (typically a Live CD) or it can\n  optionally use an alternative directory from which to run all of its\n  own commands. These techniques allow chkrootkit to trust the commands\n  upon which it depends a bit more.\nThere are inherent limitations to the reliability of any program that\n  attempts to detect compromises (such as rootkits and computer\n  viruses). Newer rootkits may specifically attempt to detect and\n  compromise copies of the chkrootkit programs or take other measures to\n  evade detection by them.\n\n", "Q: How to share external hard drive over wifi? I have an external Hard Drive connected to my pc running ubuntu 15.10. I wanted to share the data on it over my home wifi network to access it using android phones. I tried various methods using samba but non of them worked for me. Please provide step vise instructions to do it. \n\nA: Samba is not directly required for your Ubuntu to Android file sharing.\nIf you create a normal folder on your external drive and set it up for sharing using the built-in file sharing permissions of Ubuntu. This is found by right-clicking on the desired folder in the Ubuntu 'Files' program and clicking on 'Local Network Share'. This opens a pop-up box that allows you to initiate the 'Folder Sharing'. So long as your network is secured, allowing 'Guest Access' on this screen would make it easier to access from the Android phones. \nOnce the folder sharing is setup from Ubuntu, you can navigate to this folder from your Android devices. I personally use 'ES File Explorer' for this. on 'ES File Explorer' you can navigate to the 'Network' tab and search for connected computers using the icon at the top of the screen. Once the desired computer has been located, you can click on it to initiate the connection and provide access to the shared folder.\nHope This Helps,\nT3CHI5\n", "Q: After installing Lubuntu in dual-boot with windows 10, I cannot access windows anymore I installed the latest version of Lubuntu (which I also want to change to normal Ubuntu in the end) on a LENOVO ideapad (don't know how to get details on the laptop on lubuntu) but I cannot access Windows anymore.

Additionally changing the UEFI boot settings to allow for Legacy boot gave me a working 15.10. \nI thought 15.10 was supposed to be UEFI enabled/friendly/etc.\nMy main question is: What should I have done to have it boot in secure boot mode? \nBut before that I'd like to know briefly whether I should care.\nEDIT: After reading Rod Smith's response:\nThis got complicated, in that many things went wrong with high unreliability. \nI booted the USB and always found the /sys/firmware/efi folder, so I'm not sure how it let me install with CSM the first time.\nHowever, when I set up my own partitions, including a 650MB one at the beginning for EFI, it would fail to install. I got the following error window in the Ubuntu installer:\nThis machine's firmware has started the installer in UEFI mode but it\nlooks like there may be existing operating systems already installed using\n\"BIOS compatibility mode\". If you continue to install Debian in UEFI mode,\nit might be difficult to reboot the machine into any BIOS-mode operating\nsystems later.\n\nIf you wish to install in UEFI mode and don't care about keeping the\nability to boot one of the existing systems, you have the option to force\nthat here. If you wish to keep the option to boot an existing operating\nsystem, you should choose NOT to force UEFI installation here.\n\nNeither of the Proceed / Go back buttons did anything. Nor did the close window \"x\" icon, and the main install window had no non-grey buttons. So the installation hung there.\nRebooting and trying again, the USB live installer failed with a kernel panic. I tried many times, and reliably I could only boot of a USB drive once before it would no longer work.  I had to recreate the USB drive each time I wanted to boot from it.\nIn the end my solution was to use the installer's default partitions (still without a separate /home folder, after all these years) whereupon I had a bootable installation.\nI then went back and started over (remaking the USB) and added some partitions, and the new installation still booted fine.\n\nA: Eduardo Cola's comment is correct. To elaborate....\nYour problem almost certainly had nothing to do with Secure Boot. (As a side note, Secure Boot is just one optional feature of EFI firmware.) Secure Boot problems almost always manifest as an inability to boot into anything Linux-related, including the GRUB boot loader itself. Typically, if there's a Secure Boot problem, the computer will skip booting GRUB, sometimes displaying an error message about a Secure Boot violation. Occasionally you'll get to GRUB but won't be able to boot a kernel.\nWhat happened to you is that you installed using the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), aka \"legacy boot support\" or a similar phrase. The CSM permits booting BIOS-mode boot loaders. That feature must have been enabled in your firmware -- but it's possible that the settings were confusing. For instance, your system might enable BIOS-mode booting from external media even if it's set to favor EFI-mode booting from hard disks. If you then selected your USB flash drive or CD-R via a menu description that did not include the string \"UEFI,\" it would have booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. This normally works OK because the computer will then boot the hard disk in the same way; but it sounds like your firmware may be designed with an option to permit BIOS-mode booting from a USB drive but not from a hard disk. It's possible that there's a firmware option to control this behavior, but I can't be more precise because there are no standards for firmware user interfaces, and every manufacturer seems to like to go their own way on such things. For more on the CSM and how it can cause problems, see my page on the subject.\nThe easy path for you is to continue booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. There are few downsides to this, although you should be aware of the boot mode for certain types of future activities, like if you want to install a second OS or update Ubuntu via a boot from an external medium.\nIf you want to convert to EFI/UEFI-mode booting, I recommend you begin by studying your firmware's boot options. Read its manual and try to decipher what any options related to boot mode may mean. Unfortunately, this can be quite difficult, because the meaning of these options is usually poorly described. Set the computer to at least support EFI-mode booting, and plan to set it to prohibit BIOS-mode booting once you get the system converted, to avoid future problems like this. You can then convert the system to boot in EFI mode. There are two approaches to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-install Ubuntu -- You can wipe the disk clean and start fresh. (sudo sgdisk -Z /dev/sda will erase the partition table on /dev/sda in a fraction of a second, which is good enough.) You must be sure to boot the Ubuntu installer in EFI mode. Drop to a shell and check for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi after you've booted the installer but before you begin the installation process. If that directory is present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode. If you find you've booted in BIOS mode, reboot and select some other boot option until you succeed.\n\n*Convert the existing installation -- You can install any of several EFI boot loaders for Linux to boot in EFI mode. (See my page on EFI boot loaders for a rundown of what's available.) That's easier said than done, though. Most EFI-mode installations use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), but your disk probably uses the older Master Boot Record (MBR) system. In theory, you can boot from an MBR disk in EFI mode, but this practice is very rare, so I don't recommend it. Instead, you should convert from MBR to GPT with gdisk, as described in the gdisk documentation. You'll probably also have to create an EFI System Partition (ESP) on the disk. (I recommend you make it 550MiB or a bit larger.) This will probably necessitate shrinking at least one partition, which you can do with GParted. You can then install a boot loader to the ESP. Boot Repair can do this relatively painlessly; or you can boot with a CD-R or USB flash drive of my rEFInd boot manager and then install it by installing its Debian package or PPA.\n\n\nIf this is a really fresh installation, re-installing will almost certainly be easier. (I'd find converting easier, but that's only because I know my way around these procedures very well.)\nIf you want to use Secure Boot, you may; most of the preceding steps will work with Secure Boot either enabled or disabled. One exception is rEFInd: The USB flash drive and CD-R images I distribute won't work with Secure Boot enabled, so you'll need to boot with it disabled. You can still use Secure Boot with rEFInd, but you'll need to jump through some extra hoops and enable it after you've installed rEFInd. (Alternatively, you can re-install or convert your existing system and get GRUB working, then install rEFInd. If you install rEFInd from a working Secure Boot setup, the installer will detect and use the Shim program installed with GRUB.)\n", "Q: VirtualBox unable to open VM after update When trying to open my XP VM with virtual box it says:\nThe device helper structure version has changed.\nIf you have upgraded VirtualBox recently, please make sure you have\nterminated all VMs and upgraded any extension packs. \nIf this error persists, try re-installing VirtualBox(VERR_PDM_DEVHLPR3_VERSION_MISMATCH).\n\nResult Code: \nNS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)\nComponent: \nConsoleWrap\nInterface: \nIConsole {872da645-4a9b-1727-bee2-5585105b9eed}\n\nWine is also broken.(see my other Question)\nIf I can't get one of them working I will have to switch to Windows.\nPlease help.\n\nA: I suspect you have a mismatch between extpack and VirtualBox version.

For me it did the job in ubuntu 15.10 x64 and libreoffice 5.1.0.3.\n\nA: I assume that you upgraded manually, using the installation file from LibreOffice.\nBut you should wait until LibreOffice 5.1 is available in the LibreOffice Fresh PPA.  \nThis usually does not take a very long time after a new LibreOffice version release.\nWhen you do it this way, integration with the Ubuntu Unity menu bar will work fine.  \nTo add the LibreOffice Fresh PPA to the repositories, open a terminal and execute :  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa  \nsudo apt-get update\n\nWhen the new LibreOffice edition arrives - you can upgrade to version 5.1 as usual :  \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nLibreOffice PPA description :  This PPA will have what the Document Foundation calls \"LibreOffice fresh\", the latest release of the newest series (but no alpha/beta releases).\nLibreOffice 5.1 release notes : This is the first release of the 5.1.x branch of LibreOffice which contains new features and program enhancements. As such, the version is stable and is suitable for all users.

Disable \"Start Dropbox on system startup\".\nIf you use saved sessions, make sure dropbox is not an item in them: Start the session, run dropbox stop and thereafter save the session.\nCreate an init script for dropbox by running this once in terminal as regular:\necho 'description \"Dropbox\"\nstart on desktop-start\nexpect daemon\nexec env DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS= dropbox start -i' >\"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-$HOME/.config}/upstart/dropbox.conf\"\n\nNote: In 12.04 you have to store the file in \"$HOME/.init\", instead. In 14.04 the directory is deprecated. See Upstart documentation.\nNote: env DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS= could be replaced by dbus-launch in the above.\nNow you can start dropbox by\nstart dropbox\n\nThen icon should be visible.\nThe service will be started automatically after next login.

This has been working for weeks, and reboots in under 1 minute. All was well, until I installed Amavis, via Ubuntu's apt-get install packages - now a reboot takes exactly 30 minutes, every time.\nWhen running, everything works. I've checked logs, and no glaring issues. Clamav is working, mail sends & receives, and CPU usage fluctuates between 0% and 0.5%.\nMy theory\nI've narrowed the problem to the clamav-daemon by process of elimination. The only new install was Amavis, which added new daemons. If I stop them all (amavis, clamav-daemon, and clamav-freshclam), then rebooting is instant. If I stop just clamav-daemon, rebooting is instant. But if I keep it running and stop all the others, reboot is 30 minutes again.\nThis is completely repeatable, and the wait is always exactly 30 minutes. This makes me think Clamav is waiting for user input, with a 30 minute timeout.\nI can see the processes for Clamav are running with \"--foreground=true\". This makes me think Amavis intentionally does this to capture output, but isn't expecting a prompt during reboot.\nFrom htop:\n\nMy logs\nNote: /etc/init.d/sendsigs has report_unkillable enabled to catch unkillable processes, and /etc/default/apport is enabled.

Apparently swap space is disabled at a point during the shutdown sequence when there is not enough free RAM to load the remaining data from the swap space back into RAM. Running fewer services (i.e. not running clamav-daemon) probably avoids this situation, which is why you don't see the problem then.\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1031158 explains why swap space is disabled during shutdown. The solution is probably to make sure the things that eat the most memory have stopped before swap space is disabled during shutdown. This can probably be solved by specifying dependencies in systemd units, but I haven't figured this out yet.\nAnother solution would of course be to add more RAM, so that swap isn't used so much. :)\n", "Q: Grub 2 Problem - Removal not working! Hello everyone, here is my problem\nWhen I boot up my computer, I go straight into Grub 2. I know that if I type exit it will quit Grub 2. But for some reason it goes back into Grub 2, and I type the command in again and it exits again. At this point it does take me to the Windows (10) boot loader, which then let's me boot into Windows. Recently I thought enough was enough (I want to make my computer dual boot OS X and Windows), and decided to try and remove Grub 2 for good. \nSo, I then made a Windows recovery media. Booted into it and selected \"repair Windows\" or something similar. Then went into the advanced options and eventually I got to the console where I typed bootrec.exe /fixmbr and bootrec.exe /fixboot which both returned a \"successful\" message. But when I restarted my computer, minus my recovery media, Grub 2 appeared again but it was only one screen this time. I tried the same process as before to remove it; but the problem still persisted. \nWhat previous happened\nAt some point last year, I decided to install Ubuntu. Which I successfully did, and all was well for a month; until I decided I really don't need Ubuntu. Then I went into Windows and deleted the Ubuntu folder. And I know I should of used some kind of uninstaller to remove Ubuntu but I hadn't used it in about a week. And since then Grub has been haunting my computer, it's literally like Ubuntu  giving me the finger and say \"you don't get rid of me that easily\". And I was content Kathryn's haunting, and just keep typing in exit every time Grub raised its head. \n\nI think it's somethings to do with my partitions. I have had a quick look and on the drive that I installed Ubuntu on, which also carries my Windows install, I can see three partitions. Two are unnamed, and one has a property called \"EFI\", so my guess is that's the heart of the problem. Unfortunately it won't let me touch it.., properly due to Windows being on the same drive. \nAnyway, hope you can help \n                  Thanks for reading\n\nA: So you deleted the the partitions of ubuntu os.

[2] is https://web.skype.com/en/ that I haven't tried yet.\nIs it correct that there is no newer version than 4.3.0.37 for Linux?\nCan I do something to avoid Skype complaining over this?\n\nA: Microsoft no longer updates the version of Skype for Linux with new features (because they put all the new features in the Windows version because they want you to install Windows), and as that is a reasonably recently implemented feature the Skype version for Linux does not support it.\nSo your best bet is to either:\n1. Click the link it provides you in the first message in order to view the image online.\n2. Use the web version of Skype.\n3. Get the other person to send it as just regular file (if there is no option to do so either get them to change the extension to something which won't be recognized as an image or get them to convert the image contents to hex or something and just shove that in a txt file so that when you receive it you can convert it back to an image and view it - it will all depend on how Skype determines on whether or not it is an image).\n4. Use WINE or PlayOnLinux to run the latest version of Skype (I tried this before and could never get this to work though - if you do it with WINE it doesn't have the necessary fonts, and if you do it with PoL, the installer just fails).\n5. Switch from Skype to a different program which does still properly support Linux (personally I would highly recommend that you switch to Tox which is a great new privacy focused program with many different clients for many different devices. You can install Tox (I would personally recommend qTox (GUI) or Toxic (CLI) as they are great clients) by following the appropriate instructions for your OS here).\nBut I don't think there's much else you can do about it other than install Windows and view it in the latest version of Skype there (queue \"BOO\")...\n\nA: At the moment it seems that Microsoft is offering and actively developing a new \"Skype for Linux\". \nOn the linked webpage it says\n\nImportant notice: All Skype for Linux clients version 4.3 and older will be retired on July 1, 2017.

I'll call these files Bad files.\nMy home partitions are encrypted, and this action overwrote my current .ecryptfs information.\nAll of the original encrypted files are still there, along with the copied Bad files. I'll call these files Good files - they are the newest files, that I'm trying to recover.\nThe Good files do not get decrypted. I'm guessing ecryptfs has a database over what files it should decrypt.\nSo my home directory is flooded with ECRYPTFS_FNEK_ENCRYPTED files and folders.\nI haven't changed my password, and it looks like I have a recorded passphrase as well.\nNow, one of these encrypted files is the only copy of a video of my son standing for the first time. It happened quite recently, and it hasn't gotten backed up yet.\nSo I'm going to spend some time trying to decrypt these files.\nNow, what I'm wondering is this:\nDoes anyone know how to decrypt these files one by one?\nAnd, with a bit more hope added, is there any way to scan the .Private folder and add all files?\nEDIT:\nI just realized I've changed UID's since the \"bad files\" were made. Not sure if there's a solution in that fact.\n\nA: *\n\n*First, if the data's important I'd make a backup copy of everything before attempting to restore (& overwrite) any more files.\n\n\nIf I understand correctly, you've overwritten only some of your encrypted home files, with old backup copies from a different user & system? I'm not sure if or how well this can be recovered... \nEach time an encrypted home is set up with eCryptfs it uses a new (pseudo) random \"MOUNT passphrase\" which is encrypted (wrapped) with your login passphrase. Using the same login passphrase on different systems wouldn't help with decrypting files if the wrapped-passphrase file has been overwritten or lost, since each encrypted home is supposed to have a different mount passphrase. (The ecryptfs-migrate-home script advises to record the mount passphrase ASAP, but I don't think most users see the warning if Ubuntu automatically sets up their encrypted home).\nIf you've only set up the encrypted home once and have been copying that to each new system, they all should use the same mount passphrase. But then I'd kind of think that all the files should already be decrypting correctly...\nIf you have a backup copy of the wrapped-passphrase file from that same system, or the actual mount passphrase, then the following should work to decrypt some files...\n\n\n*\n\n*Try the ecryptfs-recover-private program/script, it will search for any .Private folders (or a specified folder) and attempt to find a wrapped-passphrase or mount passphrase and decrypt the files.\n\n\nIf it doesn't work as-is, you could try using a backup copy of the wrapped-passphrase file for that user & system, it should have the correct mount passphrase.\nOr, if it has trouble finding the wrapped-passphrase file, you could always run ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase on the correct wrapped-passphrase file, then use the resulting mount passphrase with ecryptfs-recover-private.\nAll of the eCryptfs tools should work well from a live dvd/usb, or just another user on the same system, but I'm not too sure what they do if there's multiple encrypted (.Private) folders. And most of the tools are just bash scripts, so if you want more details or to try it yourself just take a look, for example with less $(which ecryptfs-recover-private)\nAnd there's also the verbose option that could be used with mount directly, it might have some info on why it's not decrypting a few files, but it also warns \"Do not run eCryptfs in verbose-mode unless you are doing so  for  the  sole  purpose  of development,  since  secret values will be written out to the system log\" so I'd only try it when running from a live DVD/USB (where log files are only in RAM & lost on reboot).\n", "Q: Continuous scrolling with mouse thumb buttons?

This does work, though:\n.xbindkeysrc:\n\" ~/src/but_10.sh \"\nb:10\n\nand but_10.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nxte 'key Up'\nsleep 0.3\nwhile [ $(xinput --query-state 9 | grep -e \"button\\[10\\]=down\") ]\ndo\nxte 'key Up'\nsleep 0.05\ndone\n\nNo idea why this works, while xte 'mouseclick 4' doesn't. I'd REALLY like to get it to work that way.\n\nA: @mohkamfer Yes, if you have found a way to make that work. I'm still using the workaround i listed, using 'key Up' and 'key Down'. I would prefer to emulate the scroll wheel.\n", "Q: Force update from unsigned repository I'm using an unsigned repo in Ubuntu 16.04 from Debian multimedia:\ndeb http://www.deb-multimedia.org jessie main\n\nTo install deb-multimedia-keyring, I'm running:\napt-get update && apt-get install deb-multimedia-keyring -y\n\nThis gives an error:\nW: GPG error: http://www.deb-multimedia.org jessie InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 5C808C2B65558117\nE: The repository 'http://www.deb-multimedia.org jessie InRelease' is not signed.\nN: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.\nN: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.\n\n\nA: You can bypass some important safeguards by using the following option:\n--allow-unauthenticated\n\nFrom the man pages for apt-get:\n--allow-unauthenticated\n    Ignore if packages can't be authenticated and don't prompt about\n    it. This can be useful while working with local repositories, but\n    is a huge security risk if data authenticity isn't ensured in\n    another way by the user itself. The usage of the Trusted option for\n    sources.list(5) entries should usually be preferred over this\n    global override. Configuration Item:\n    APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated.\n\nBut be a little cautious about using this option more widely, the safeguards are in place to protect your computer not limit your freedom...\nEdit\nFrom newer versions of Ubuntu, instead of --allow-unauthenticated, --allow-insecure-repositories can be used.\nIn order to perform an update the command would be this\nsudo apt-get update --allow-insecure-repositories\n\n\nA: If you are trying to get a package from a repository where they packaged the keys and include them within the repository and no where else, it can be very annoying to download and install the key/keyring package using dpkg, and very difficult to do so in an easily scriptable and repeatable manner.\nThe below script is not recommended if you can install the keys from a keyserver (as recommended in another answer using apt-key adv) or if you can download them from a trusted source via https and install using apt-key (eg wget https://trusted.key.site/my-trusted-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -), but if you don't have ANY other way, you can use this.\necho \"deb http://your.repo.domain/repository/ $(lsb_release -c -s) universe\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/your-repo-name.list\n\nsudo apt -o Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories=true \\\n-o Acquire::AllowDowngradeToInsecureRepositories=true \\\nupdate\n\n## if the 'apt update' above fails it is likely due to previously\n## having the GPG key and repository on the system, you can clean\n## out the old lists with `sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/your.repo.domain*`\n\napt-get -o APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated=true install repo-keyring-pkgname\n\n## If you ever run `sudo apt-key del your-repos-keyID`\n## you may have to `sudo apt remove --purge repo-keyring-pkgname`\n## Update should run without the GPG warnings now that the key is installed\n\napt-get update\napt-get install somepkg-from-repo\n\nI originally put this together because i3 in their sur5r repo does this, but then I found out their keys are in the keyserver.ubuntu.com list,  so I can just sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E3CA1A89941C42E6 and avoid all the extra package hassles.\n\nA: \nN: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user\nconfiguration details.\n\nanswer:\n\n*\n\n*ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d\nnext try removing them using\n\n\n*sudo rm -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/{output of 1}\ndo it for each\neg: sudo rm -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wireshark-dev-ubuntu-stable-focal.list\nthen try\n\n\n*sudo apt update\n:)\n\nA: This is somewhat duplicating an existing answer but --allow-insecure-repositories and --allow-unauthenticated only worked in certain combinations. Here for example with the insecure deadsnakes repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\nsudo apt-get update --allow-insecure-repositories\nsudo apt-get install python3.9* --allow-unauthenticated\n\n\nA: You can get the PUBLIC_KEY from the keyserver and add it into apt-key. Assuming the keyserver is pgpkeys.mit.edu, you first need to type in:\ngpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key KEY_IN_ERROR\ngpg -a --export KEY_IN_ERROR | sudo apt-key add -\n\nReplace the key KEY_IN_ERROR with the one in your error message, i.e. 5C808C2B65558117.\nAlso, if you are really interested in adding an unsigned repository, you can add the a flag in the desired repository entry in the sources.list like this:\ndeb [allow-insecure=yes] http://www.deb-multimedia.org jessie main\n\nThis is really useful if you want to fine tune your security settings for an individual entries. \n\nA: You can set options in your sources.list (located at /etc/apt/sources.list):\ndeb [trusted=yes] http://www.deb-multimedia.org jessie main\n\nThe trusted option is what turns off the GPG check. See man 5 sources.list for details.\nYou can either edit the file within the terminal with vim ( or whatever you prefer) or any non-terminal editor like gedit.\n\nA: Another generic solution would be\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 5C808C2B65558117\n\nNote: I didn't test the solution with this repository but I did it with Skype repository and it worked just fine.\nAnother solution specific to your case is to install the keys\nwget http://www.deb-multimedia.org/pool/main/d/deb-multimedia-keyring/deb-multimedia-keyring_2012.05.05_all.deb -O deb-multimedia-keyring.deb\nsudo dpkg -i multimedia-keyring_all.deb\n\nAs described in the full walk through Here\n\nA: This is kind of late to the table, but I only ran into this yesterday. Upon installing from the .iso for 18.04 LTS, obtained from ubuntu.com, I encountered this issue and also, ifconfig and other network tools were not installed. Wifi did not work.\nThis was on a Lenovo X140e laptop, the kind that is preloaded with Windows and given to someone who completes a computer course.\nI reinstalled a few times without better results, perhaps because the definition of insanity applies. I then put 16.04 LTS on a stick and installed that. I had to fool around with BIOS settings to install. Interestingly, network apps were installed and wifi found connections. I got the same message (repository is unsigned, etc.) at first from Software Updater, but then it told me there was a new release and asked me, did I want it.\nI gave it a try and now everything works in 18.04. Make of that what you will. I would like to add that none of the other answers on this page worked. That is why I contribute this \"solution.\"\n", "Q: Should I format all my drives, internal and external to ext4? Finally ready to remove my Win7 partition on my Ubuntu Gnome system. I have 3 internal drives with music, movies, and pictures that I will be backing up and formatting. Should I format all my drives to ext4 from now on, instead of the good old fat or NTFS ? \n\nA: Ext4 is Ubuntu's default and supported filesystem. If you're going to use your drives only with Ubuntu or other Linux systems, the answer is yes: The best choice is formatting them as ext4.\nBut you need to have in mind that some systems (such as Windows) do not support ext4 natively and you may get into trouble if you need to install Windows some day. \n", "Q: Help with major software issues after unlicensed windows 7 install over Ubuntu I am overseas right now and purchased a new Dell laptop that was supposed to have Ubuntu installed, it has the Ubuntu sticker I was told the product does not have recovery CDs. \nAnyway I am not familiar with Ubuntu and did not even know about the operating system so I asked if they could install windows 7. I found out it's not a licensed windows 7 and I have been going nuts trying to install a bunch of drivers and stuff just to get things working right, everything is running so slow.\nI am wondering if them installing windows is the cause of all the driver and other problems,and if reinstalling Ubuntu will fix them? If so where do I reinstall it since I don't have a CD of the program? \nPlease help I am getting so frustrated. The place I got it from is not a major store just a kind of backstreet place,so I need to figure this out on my own.\n\nA: When you buy a computer with Ubuntu pre-installed you either get a DVD with the operating system on it, or it will be on a recovery partition or you are told to download it yourself and burn the download to a DVD. The last option works if you have a system with an internet connection and a DVD burner. The one before that works but you need to check your hard disk if there is a recovery partition and figure out what keys you need to press during boot to get it activated.\nComputers with Ubuntu pre-installed are generally NOT sold with a Windows license. Ubuntu can run on very old hardware. A machine that is sold with Ubuntu might have hardware in it that Microsoft does not support or no longer supports so Windows 7 is not possible to run on it (Microsoft would like you to buy the newest hardware to run their latest product) \nSo yes, your problems will fix itself if you re-install Ubuntu. You might also get a working machine installing an older Microsoft product (like Windows XP. I am not saying that an obsolete operating system is a good option though). \n", "Q: Ubuntu freeze on shutdown with AMD graphics card I installed dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 LTS along with Windows 10 on a new DELL laptop (15 5000 series) with AMD Radeon R5 M335 graphics card.  Ubuntu will freeze on shutdown.   The GRUB boot menu has an option of booting from the Linux 3.19.0-49-generic recovery mode.    When I boot from this recovery mode and select “resume normal boot” in the follow-up menu, Ubuntu could be started and shut down without problem.   \nI tried various solutions suggested on the websites by adding reboot = bios in the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line (e.g. http://mylinuxexplore.blogspot.com/2011/11/solved-ubuntu-doesnt-shutdown-properly.html ).    They do not work for me.   \nI also tried to replace the default X.org driver for the AMD/ATI graphic with the fglrx driver.  This crushed the system and I had to reinstall Ubuntu. \nI do not mind booting  from the recovery mode, but I would like to know the cause of my problem.  Could the X.org driver have issues with the AMD R5 M335 graphics card?  \nIf you know a better solution, please let me know.     \n\nA: After I posted the question, I began to google on AMD Radeon graphic card.   I came across a webpage mentioning that the stable Linux Kernel 4.4 just released in January, 2016 has featured numerous AMD GPU additions on AMD graphics processors.    I followed the instructions given by http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/01/how-to-install-linux-kernel-4-4-in-ubuntu/\nto install Linux 4.4 in Ubuntu.    Ubuntu no longer freezes.

You should open an issue on github.com and request it. Since this is obviously (haha) a Debian package, you can follow https://debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/build.en.html to build it.\n", "Q: xbox one stream to linux based pc I just want to know if I could stream xbox-one related things onto Linux?

And through that, you know, use the official XBox app.\nWish there were a native way, though.\n\nA: Unfortunately this isn't possible to stream directly from Xbox One to Linux directly. As mentioned above, you could stream to a Windows device and then relay that to Linux via some remote desktop/streaming software.\n\nA: Can't comment yet (don't have enough rep) so this isn't exactly a solution, but I read here about xbox-smartglass-nano, which does what you're asking.

So, now I have command line access but login is still stuck.\nI purged nvidia*, and when I reinstalled 352.63 version it gives me the following error:\nBad return status for module build on kernel: 4.2.0-27-generic (x86_64)\nFrom now on, all apt-get give me similar error to above and I can't install anything but I can delete just fine.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing .Xauthority file and reinstalling lightdm, have also chown it, permissions seem fine.\n\n*Reinstalling nvidia driver which obviously fails as mentioned above.\n\n*Reinstalling ubuntu-desktop\n\n*Reinstalling the kernel 4.2.0-27 gives the same error as above.\n\n\nThings that are currently wrong:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel seems messed up, because all those errors relate to kernel?\n\n*Nvidia driver and login stuck in a loop.\n\n*Since the driver isn't working, the screen is all messed up with low resolution.\n\n\nI really don't want to reinstall the OS, anyone know what I can try? Will greatly appreciate any ideas!\nLog file for nvidia driver error: make.log (idk how to share a file, sorry!)\n\nA: I have fixed this people! If you installed or updated nvidia driver and it somehow broke your ubuntu and made it stuck in a login loop do the following:\nYou need terminal access, try tty first by Ctrl + Alt + F1 so if you don't even have that maybe use installation disc to get access, you can easily mount your system using the installation disc and use the terminal to fix your system.\nThen check /var/log/nvidia-installer.log and see if you had a compiler issue during the installation. It should say ERROR and then explain how it tried to find a gcc version but was unable to locate the desired one.\nProblem is, you need gcc-5.1.0 to install nvidia-driver but you need gcc < 4.9 to run Nvidia's nvcc. Which is what I was doing, I had my gcc switched to an older version when I attempted the installation. So, just switch back to gcc-5.1.0 using update-alternatives and purge and reinstall the nvidia driver. It should fix this issue!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 doesn't shutdown after installing Cinnamon I changed my Ubuntu interface from the classic Unity to Cinnamon and after that shutdown doesn't work properly.

I have installed kubuntu 14.04.3 in my laptop, when I check the version of kde its shows as follows,\n\nWhen I tried sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neon/kf5 in terminal, am getting response as,\nCannot add PPA: 'ppa:neon/kf5'.\nPlease check that the PPA name or format is correct.\n\nI wish to update kde into Plasma 5. How to solve it ? \n\nA: Neon has been replaced by Kubuntu CI (https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ci/+archive/ubuntu/stable). In any case this is a release for KDE developers. There is also a new KDE Neon project which can serve to install up-to-date KDE, but is currently also only available as unstable release (and not intended for Kubuntu 14.04).\nhttp://neon.kde.org.uk/download\nThe solution is to update your Kubuntu to version 15.10\nhttp://www.kubuntu.org/news/kubuntu-15-10/\nwhich will give you a Plasma 5 version already.\nThen you may add kubuntu-backports ppa to get recent bugfixes. The above mentioned KDE Neon project can then also be installed through a ppa, but be aware that this controversial project just started and stable releases are not yet available. \nPossibly related question: Now when there is no neon/kf5 ppa, how can I install KDE 5 in gnome Ubuntu 14.04?\n", "Q: gnome-online-accounts (GOA) with Xubuntu? 1) Is there some alternative to gnome-online-accounts (GOA) for use in Xubuntu?\n2) If I install gnome-online-accounts in Xubuntu it pulls in the following dependencies\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  apg cracklib-runtime cups-pk-helper dconf-cli dleyna-server gir1.2-ibus-1.0 gkbd-capplet\n  gnome-bluetooth gnome-control-center gnome-control-center-data gnome-control-center-shared-data\n  gnome-online-accounts gnome-settings-daemon gnome-settings-daemon-schemas gnome-user-share ibus\n  libcanberra-pulse libcheese-gtk23 libcolord-gtk1 libcrack2 libdleyna-connector-dbus-1.0-1\n  libdleyna-core-1.0-3 libgnome-bluetooth13 libgnomekbd-common libgnomekbd8 libgoa-backend-1.0-1\n  libgupnp-av-1.0-2 libgupnp-dlna-2.0-3 libibus-1.0-5 libpwquality-common libpwquality1\n  libtelepathy-glib0 libwacom-bin libwacom-common libwacom2 mousetweaks nautilus-data realmd\n  ubuntu-system-service \n\nIt doesn't look fun and my question is if you can foresee any problems with having these dependencies installed in Xubuntu (15.10)?\n\nA: Took the plunge and installed the gnome-online-accounts.

Yes, it sounds weird. Since 2 days, Ubuntu is showing a \"New Mobile Broadband (GSM) Connection...\", which does not exist. I tried rebooting many times and double checked everything.

Coupled with a data subscription, this is very useful in zones where there is no Wi-Fi.)  You usually find the SIM by removing the battery slot.\nProbably Ubuntu detected the SIM after an OS update and is now showing the option on Network Connections.

I want to do it daily so I plan to use crontab. My question is: if a job is missed (say the backup is scheduled for a time when the laptop is turned off) will it be executed as soon as possible? or it will simply be missed?\n\nA: Since you specifically asked for it:\nQueue failing or missed backup jobs, even if the computer is asleep or off\nWhen running backup jobs on the server, it would be relatively easy to retry (queue) failed jobs, since we may assume the server will be the \"stable\" factor. Queue -ing missed backups can be done by routing the cronjob to a script, creating a queue whenever the backup fails. \nWhen the jobs run on the client however, the story is slightly different. When we run the job from cron, how do we notice a job failed? Since the job was not initiated if the client computer is sleeping or switched off, things would get far more complicated to set up from cron.\nTherefore, if you want to run scheduled backups, making sure failed or missed jobs will run on the first occasion, I would suggest not using cron at all.\nSetup scheduled/queued backups in a single file\nThe solution below is a relatively simple to set up, by the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write, and test, an rsync backup command. Use grsyncif you are unsure about how to do that.\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, give it the name (e.g.) of the backup job, like:\nbackup1.py\n\n\n*In the head of the script, make appropriate settings:\n#--- enter the working rsync command below\nrsync = \"rsync -r -t --progress -s '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test2' '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test1'\"\n#--- set backup time interval below in hours/minutes\ninterval = [0, 10]\n#--- set message True if you'd like a warning if a job failed (else False)\nmessage = True\n\nEnter the rsync command between double quotes, like in the example.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the script with a unique_name.py\nThat's it. From the start time of the script, the backups will run exactly after each interval. If the job fails, it is queued (retried once per minute) until it can be run succesfully. After that, the new backup is set on the exact scheduled (next) time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Subsequently, test- run the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/script.py\n\nIf all works fine, add it to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\npython3 /path/to/script.py\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\nimport datetime\n\n#--- enter the working rsync command below\nrsync = \"rsync -r -t -s '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test2' '/home/jacob/Bureaublad/test1'\"\n#--- set backup time interval below in hours/minutes\ninterval = [24, 0]\n#--- set message True if you'd like a warning if a job failed (else False)\nmessage = True\n#--- set the max- size of the logfile below (n- lines)\nmaxlog = 100\n\n#--- don't change anything below\nbackup_id = os.path.basename(__file__).split(\".\")[0]\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndatefile = home+\"/next_backup_\"+backup_id; logfile = home+\"/backup_log_\"+backup_id\nprint(datefile, logfile)\ninterval = (interval[0]*3600)+(interval[1]*60)\nfailed = False\n\ndef failed_message():\n    # shows a zenity message if a backup failed\n    subprocess.Popen([\n        \"zenity\",\n        \"--info\",\n        \"--text=\"+backup_id+\" failed\\n\"+\\\n        \"See \"+logfile]) \n\ndef readable_t(sec):\n    # converts epoch time to readable date & time\n    return datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(sec).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n\ndef currtime():\n    # returns current (epoch) time\n    return int(time.strftime(\"%s\"))\n\ndef sync(failed):\n    # performs the rsync command, on errors: writes to log and shows message\n    try:\n        subprocess.check_call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", rsync])\n        set_next(planned, interval, currt)\n        return False\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        if failed == False:\n            open(logfile, \"+a\").write(readable_t(planned)+\" failed\\n\")\n            if message == True:\n                failed_message()\n        return True\n\ndef next_run():\n    # reads current queue file, creates it if it doesn't exist\n    try:\n        return int(open(datefile).read())\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        currt = currtime()\n        open(datefile, \"wt\").write(str(currt))\n        return currt\n\ndef set_next(lastr, interval, currt):\n    # creates the next queue, maintains the log file\n    nextrun = lastr\n    while nextrun <= currt:\n        nextrun += interval\n    open(datefile, \"wt\").write(str(nextrun))\n    newline = [readable_t(lastr)+\" succesfully finished on \"+\\\n                        readable_t(currtime())+\"\\n\"]\n    try:\n        limited_lines = open(logfile).readlines()[-maxlog+1:]+newline\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        limited_lines = newline\n    with open(logfile, \"wt\") as log:\n        for l in limited_lines:\n            print(\"4\")\n            log.write(l)\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(60)\n    planned = next_run(); currt = currtime()\n    if currt > planned:\n        failed = sync(failed)\n\nFurthermore\n\n\n*\n\n*The script keeps a logfile, named after the backupscript.\nThe maximum number of lines, to keep in the logfile, can be set in the head of the script:\n#--- set the max- size of the logfile below (n- lines)\nmaxlog = 50\n\nAn example\n\nIn the example below, the script is set to backup every five minutes, starting from 11:10 a.m.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first two (11:10, 11:15) run succesfully\n\n*The third one (planned 11:20) fails, due to the fact that the laptop sleeps. The job is queued and executed slightly delayed. The job finishes at 11:27, the next scheduled backup runs on 10:30\n\n*Then, the job, scheduled at 11:35 fails, due to the fact that the server is not available. If you set message = True: \n\n\n*The job is queued and successfully runs later, at 11:41:44\nand so on\nHow to reset the start time of the backup?\nSimply delete the queue file in your home directory of the corresponding backup job (starting with next_backup_) the current time will the be the new start time of the cycle.\nHow it works under the hood\n\n\n*\n\n*When the script starts up, the first backup is created (starting within a minute from startup of the script).\n\n*When the job is finished, the script creates a queue file, timed at the (start) time of the finished job + the set backup interval.\n\n*Once per minute, the script checks if the queue file is \"over time\", comparing the current time to the queued time. If so, the script runs the backup job, creates the new queue and so on. \nWhat happens if the laptop (client) is switched off? \nThen the latest created queue file is not refreshed (overwritten) by the script, so it will run the delayed backup on the first occasion after starting up (or waking up) of the computer.\nHow is the next backup queue created after that?\nThe next backup is always calculated in whole steps of the backup interval, and will always be \"in phase\". In other words; if the first backup was made on 12:00 p.m., and you set the interval to [24, 0], the next backup will always be queued at 12:00 of the next day.\n\n\nMultiple backup jobs?\nThe script sleeps most of the time. If not, it only looks into the queue file once per minute. SInce means nothing to your system, it is very well possible to run multiple backup jobs, each with their own log & queue file, at the same time. Since both the log- and queue file are named after the script's name, all you have to to is to give each of the scripts a unique name\n", "Q: boot-repair not working on hp elitebook 2170 I bought a second hand hp elitebook 2170p, windows 7 preinstalled.

Search your output for efibootmgr results. (There are three such examples, the last of which is the final state and shows an Ubuntu/GRUB entry, hence my statement that it should be working.) If it's not working at this point, I have several suggestions, which you should try in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try updating your firmware to the latest version. This may get you clear of bugs in some EFIs. Note that you'll have to re-run Boot Repair once you've done this.\n\n*Try going into the firmware setup utility, locate an option to reset all the settings to their defaults, and use it. With that done, try running Boot Repair again.\n\n*(Perhaps not an option for you, given that it's a secondhand computer....) Return the computer for a refund, because it's defective. If you bought it new, I'd say to also write to the manufacturer to say why you've done so. Note that by \"defective\" I don't mean \"sample defect,\" I mean \"defective design.\"\n\n*Copy your boot loader to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the ESP. This is most easily done by launching the Boot Repair tool, entering the Advanced menu, and picking the option to copy the boot loader to backup filenames. (I don't recall the exact phrasing of the option, but it should be obvious.)\n\n\nIf you get to #4, it will probably work acceptably on a single-boot installation, but that's a hackish workaround for a buggy firmware that's likely to fail sooner or later if you dual-boot with any other OS.\n", "Q: Sound card not detected I have installed ubuntu 14.04 on new computer.

But new favorites that I've added since a couple of weeks, are lost everytime I restart the computer.\nWhere is the text file storing the list of Favorites in Xubuntu's whisker menu?

I've had this combination of Ubuntu/e20 for about half a year before switching to Bodhi. (It might have been e19, not 100% sure anymore.) Everything's fine, except ... I loved that one wallpaper, but I can't seem to find it again. \nThe picture was a horizonless close-up of a piece of rock, really just the surface. Its colour was a dark brown that was almost red, like the stone was rich in iron, and it seemed have a raw surface, similar to sandstone. Iron ore maybe? \nI downloaded at least 20 Ubuntu wallpaper packages that didn't sound too esoteric, I looked up e17-stuff.com, and I ran several search engines on a dozen different combinations of the wallpaper's theme. But seeing the number of Iron Man, kitschy zen art and rock music fans out there, googling for [[iron, stone, red, rock] free] wallpaper gave very different results than what I was hoping for.\nHow can I find that picture? If it was not Ubuntu, but Enlightenment, where can I find out which packages/picture sources they use?\n\nA: It was indeed an enlightenment wallpaper. In the Bodhi forums, someone found it in /usr/share/enlightenment/data/backgrounds/Brown_Rock_Hi.edj\n", "Q: How to autorun a ruby script in Ubuntu?

Recently when I purchased a new notebook (Lenovo B40-70) I decided to install Debian Jessie, however I have some issues with the built-in microphone not producing any useful sound and none of the solutions posted on Q&A boards or Skype forums helped me. Additionally, the video playback is choppy when I watch HD or even non-HD videos on YouTube or VLC.\nI never faced such issues in Ubuntu because I switched to proprietary drivers when I had problems with display (on my old HP Pavilion G6). Therefore I'm considering switching to Ubuntu GNOME 15.10, and my question is twofold.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will there be similar issues in Ubuntu GNOME - display and microphone? It would be kind of you to share your suggestions.\n\n*I have huge data on my /home which I mounted on a separate partition and I do not have an external disk at present to store a backup. What precautionary steps do I have to take in order to get Ubuntu installed without wiping my data?\n\nA: I'm thinking of doing the same thing and switching to Ubuntu 16.04 for pretty much the same reasons. I haven't done so yet, so I cannot comment on the first part of your question.\nWith regard to your lack of an external backup, it should not be a problem. I'm assuming you know your way around /etc/fstab, given what you've set up. Ubunt, as with most modern Linux variants, allows flexible use of existing partitions. All you really need to do is make sure the partition containing /home is not touched during the install. You'll be asked how you wish to partition your hard drive. You should choose \"custom\". Then simply ensure that the new install doesn't touch the partition with your data. Afterward you can mount your old partition, though I would avoid mounting it as /home, since the new /home will have a number of invisible files required by your new O/S. You might try mounting it as a subdirectory of your new /home. \n", "Q: Installation problem with metalink I am trying to install Ubuntu and  have downloaded and opened the ISO file.

I've just installed claws mail. Setting it up was not easy, but thanks to this sit I've managed to retrieve my mails. Only, html mails are just displayed as plain text so i've installed fancy plugin and under settings -> preferences -> display messages -> i've deselected 'display html messages as text' and selected ' If possible display html messages with plugin'. \nUnder the settings for fancy plugin 'display embedded messages' is also selected but still the same: hml messages are just ugly text. \nWhat did i do wrong?\n\nA: It works. Once you enabled the above mentioned setting, open the HTML mail by double clicking it. Then you can see small buttons on the right side of the mail window when you move the mouse pointer over that, it shows \"text/html\". Click it and then you can view HTML enabled mails.\n\nA: I had some success with Configuration>Preferences>Message View>Text Options>Render HTML-only messages with plugin if possible. I had to un-check enable loading of remote content in the fancy plugin, click apply, then travel back to text options, check that, click apply, then travel back to fancy, check Enable, click apply, and it worked.

Can I tell steam in which of the monitors to use the full screen mode?\nThanks\n\nA: Since this thread still has no accepted answer:\nA simple solution with Ubuntu 18.04 and possibly any later version that uses Gnome desktop is to just start the game (in full-screen mode). Then press the \"Super/Windows\" key and just drag and drop the game to whatever monitor you want to play on.\nNo need for \"Big Picture\" mode or anything at all.\n\nA: My solution: Launch Steam in \"Big Picture\" mode (click the controller icon in the top right), then wait for it to open. After it loads, press the \"Super\"/\"Window\" key (in between ctrl and alt) to show all open windows, then click & hold on Steam and drag it to the monitor you want to play on. When you launch the game, it will open on the same desktop/monitor.\nI remember seeing an option to choose the output monitor at one point, but I just checked again and I cannot find it. That option may have been in the Windows Steam client...\n\nA: The easiest way is to set the second screen as the main screen.\n", "Q: Wifi not working in ubuntu My wifi is not working.

You could rename the file to have a shorter file name.\nOr you could try the below command which forcefully truncates file names (from this answer on Unix & Linux):\nls | cut -c1-20 | column -c\"${COLUMNS:-80}\"\n\nIf you wanted you could make a special alias to execute this with lc, for example, by adding the following to your ~/.bash_alisaes file:\nalias lc='ls | cut -c1-20 | column -c\"${COLUMNS:-80}\"'\n\nHowever that alias won't allow you to pass flags like -l or -a, so instead you could make a script ~/bin/lc and make it executable with chmod +x ~/bin/lc:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nls $@ | cut -c1-20 | column -c\"${COLUMNS:-80}\"\n\nKudos @steeldriver for discovering the issue in the comments above.\n", "Q: Authorization problems after VNC uninstalling on Xubuntu 12.04 I had setup vnc through vncserver script http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/vnc4server.1.html .This script were launched under the root.

I want to install libxml2. So any one tell me how i can install it. What i need to do to install libxml2 in my laptop. I am almost new to Linux, using it at least from 5-6 months.\n\nA: This tutorial will tell you exactly how to do it: https://geeksww.com/tutorials/libraries/libxml/installation/installing_libxml_on_ubuntu_linux.php\nIn summary, the steps are just the same as any other software installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate where you can get the latest version of the software. (From google, libxml2 webpage is here: http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html. From there, you can find the ftp location where you can download the software. Notice the latest version available).\n\n*Download that latest version's .tar.gz file using wget, and extract it using tar command.\n\n*Compile and install the software by typing these terminal commands from within the extracted folder:\n./configure\n make\n sudo make install\n\nUpdate: Another way to do it, per the hint from David Foerster's answer, is to simply use apt-get to install the package for you rather than compiling and installing it yourself. The package you want here is probably either libxml2 or libxml2-dev. You can search for the package you want by typing \n  apt-cache search libxml2\n\nInstall the package using the typical apt-get method:\nsudo apt-get install libxml2\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install libxml2-dev\n\n\nA: There's a libxml2 package for that. You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install libxml2\n\nIf you want to compile software from source based on libxml2 you need the development files:\nsudo apt-get install libxml2-dev\n\n\nA: Find the name of the package you want to install with dpkg -l libxml\\*.

It outputs through the Intel adapter anyway and does only hardware acceleration.\nYou can install a proprietary driver in System Settings -> Software & Updates -> Additional Drivers (nvidia-352), or in terminal:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\n\nBoth methods do the same.

If you have already paid the $4.00 for the service and can't use it i would file a report to the service provider. We cant help you recover your money we have no control over this. \nHowever before sending a report i would make sure you have followed the the guides recommend by whatsapp. That is listed below or here is the page.  \nFrom whatsapp\nHere are the needed commands. Start with typing \nSudo apt-get install python python-dateutil python-argparse\n\nin your command shell. Then you will need to get the main program to get WhatsApp running. You will need to input this into your command shell\nType:\nwget https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup/archive/master.zip\n\nOnce the program has downloaded, you will need to be in that directory to unzip the file. If you do not have an unzip utility, then you will need to download and install that. To do this, just simply type \nsudo apt-get install unzip\n\nin the command shell.\nOnce this is done you can now unzip master.zip. Type \nunzip master.zip\n\nto unpacked this zip file. After that has finished unpacking, then you are ready to start the install process. Change directories into the working directory by typing \ncd yowsup-master/src\n\nOnce there, you will need to rename the main configuration file. To do that, you must type \nconfig.example yowsup-cli.config\n\nInto your command shell. Now you must edit the config file. For this, you will type \ngedit yowsup-cli.config\n\ninto your command line interface.\nWe are now onto step two of the install process. The first thing in this step will be editing your config file. You should now be in your editor. Find the line that says “\nphone=xxxxxxxxxx\n\nOnce you find this line, enter your own phone number with country code. At this point, you will save your file and exit Gedit. Now you will need to change the permisions of your config file. Type \nsudo chmod +x yowsup-cli,\n\nthis will give your user account permisions to run the file. Now you need to run Yowsup by typing ‘\n./yowsup-cli –requestcode sms –config yowsup-cli.config\n\nThis will request an authorization code for your app. The code will look like “XXX-XXX”. Before you close the terminal, you will need to save the information that was outputted. To do this press shift and c and save the file as \nyowsup.txtpidgin-2.8.0\n\nNow that you have the backend done, it is time to work on the messaging app. For this, we will be using Pidgin. We will need to install pidgin and a plugin for Whatsapp. First, you will need to open another command line interface. To install the repository for the plugin that is needed, you will need to type \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:whatsapp-purple/ppa\n\nAfter that you will need to type \nsudo apt-get update\n\nOnce the system is finished updating the repositories, you will then need to install Pidgin and the Whatsapp plugin by typing \nsudo apt-get install Pidgin pidgin-whatsapp\n\nThis install will take a moment or two to complete.\nNow you re ready to run Whatsapp messaging. From your dropdown menu, select WhatsApp and input your information. You can find the needed information in the text file you saved earlier. You will need to input the phone number with country code and your password. The password that you will need may look like “pw: longpassword“. One last note, your WhatsApp on your phone should not be used at the same time as WhatsApp on your computer.\n", "Q: Give web sever directory full permission I managed to change DocumentRoot directory form /var/www to /home/user/www and working fine except the problem that I can not copy/paste or even delete any file without root access.\nSince I use SASS compiler software in which some files are compiled and outputted within the project directory.

(you will definitely want umask if you do this, otherwise you may be changing ownership and permissions frequently as the web server will own the files it creates).\nmake all files read and write including the directory (possible security implications with chmod and -R recursive flag so use it cautiously)\nchmod g+rw -R /path/to/directory\n\nNow if the files are created by the webserver itself they usually only have write access to the owner and read to the group. To resolve that matter you will need to look into umask as mentioned above and get directions as to where to set the umask and the correct setting your for your specific application. \nFor apache 2 (ive used nano as i find it the easiest editor in terminal).\nnano /etc/apache2/envvars\n\nadd to end of file: umask 002\nsave the file.\n\nservice apache2 restart\n\nThis was found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/428416/setting-the-umask-of-the-apache-user and should probably be the accepted answer submitted by patrick fisher\n", "Q: Sony Vaio Ubuntu installation won't boot afterwards It may seem like a duplicate question, but it's not.

How can i recover my Windows 10 and correctly duel boot my computer?\n\nA: Are you using GRUB? i.e you get a list of options to boot to .. Ubuntu .. Windows etc.\nIf you're at that point and windows is listed then the issue is probably with windows; as that menu just passes control over to the windows bootloader. So there's no issue with Linux.\nThe windows repair can be problematic at most times, like never finding a problem and just wanting to reboot. You might be able to boot into Safe mode to try find the issue. Just keep hitting SHIFT after you choose windows basically, it's a pain to get sometimes.\nBe aware that if you repair or have to reinstall Windows it might overwrite grub so you'll only be able to boot windows until you reinstall GRUB again.

Below two options to solve the issue, which is most likely the result of a bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*The (background) script below (option [1.] should automatically move the TV screen (in your case: HDMI-0) to the right of your main screen, if it was connected after being disconnected.\n\n*The keyboard shortcut does the same, but manually after connecting (switching on) the TV.\n\n\n1. A background script, automatically setting the second screen\nThe script is written in such a way that it takes the screen you want to appear on the right (the one that is disconnected now and then) as an argument (see explanation below). Therefore, it works with any combination of screens, you only need to enter the name of the right screen into the command. The script will find the resolution of the left screen, for correct positioning.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\n\"\"\"\nThis script is a fix for what is presumably a bug, causing the secundary screen\nto appear on the left side instead of the right side of the \"main\" screen.\nRun it in the background.\n\"\"\"\n\n#--- set your secundary (right) screen below\nsec = sys.argv[1]\n#---\n\nscr_id = sec+\" connected\"\n\ndef get_xrandr():\n    return subprocess.check_output(\"xrandr\").decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef get_setup():\n    # returns output of xrandr if secundary monitor was connected (else None)\n    get_xr = subprocess.check_output(\"xrandr\").decode(\"utf-8\")\n    if scr_id in get_xr:\n        return get_xr\n\ndef get_xshift(xr):\n    # find connected screens (lines)\n    mons = [l for l in xr.splitlines() if \" connected\" in l]\n    # get name and x-size of main screen\n    left = [l.split() for l in mons if not l.startswith(scr_id)][0]\n    return [(left[0], s.split(\"x\")[0]) for s in left if s.count(\"+\") == 2][0]\n\ncheck1 = []\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(4)\n    check2 = get_setup()\n    if check1 != check2:\n        # on change in monitor setup:\n        if check2 != None:\n            # if secundary monitor was just connected\n            print(\"run setup\")\n            x_shiftdata = get_xshift(check2)\n            cmd1 = [\"xrandr\",  \"--output\", x_shiftdata[0], \"--pos\", \"0x0\"]\n            cmd2 = [\"xrandr\",  \"--output\", sec, \"--pos\", x_shiftdata[1]+\"x0\"]\n            for cmd in [cmd1, cmd2]:\n                subprocess.call(cmd)\n    check1 = check2\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as screen_set.py\n\n*Test- run it with the secondary screen as an argument with the command:\npython3 /path/to/screen_set.py HDMI-0\n\n(since HDMI-0 is your secondary screen)\nDisconnect (switch off) the TV and connect it again, it should appear on the right side.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to Startup Applications, with a little break: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n /bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && python3 /path/to/screen_set.py HDMI-0\"\n\nNow it should be solved.\n2. Alternatively; a keyboard shortcut\nThe background script adds practically nothing to the processor load, and will not be noticed whatsoever. If you however would prefer a keyboard shortcut to an (automatically working) background script, add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"xrandr --output DVI-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output HDMI-0 --pos 2560x0\"\n\nwhich will do the same, but manually: Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"xrandr --output DVI-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output HDMI-0 --pos 2560x0\"\n\nExplanation; the background script\n\n\n*\n\n*Once per four seconds, the script checks if the TV is connected by checking if the string HDMI-0 connected is in the output of the command xrandr.\n\n*(Only) if there is a change in the state: False -> True, the script runs the command (in your case):\nxrandr --output DVI-0 --pos 0x0 && xrandr --output HDMI-0 --pos 2560x0\n\nwhich arranges your screens from left to right, as explained here.\nIf your screen resolutions are different however, the script looks up the correct figures and the name of the main screen. As long as you use the secondary screen as an argument, it works fine.\n\nA: I have an ATI R5 card that never saves my graphics layout for my three monitors using xfce4-display-settings. ARandR should solve your issue. Install by typing the following in terminal: \nsudo apt-get install arandr\n\nUse ARandR to configure your screens, save it to a script (Layout > Save As), and set it to run as a Session and Startup > Application Autostart item. (You may need to set it to sleep 5 first before running the layout script.)\nIf you have two different layouts that you use, you can configure each of those with ARandR. Then you can run one script or the other depending on which layout you want. Or, better yet, you could assign each to their own keyboard shortcut if so desired.\n", "Q: How easy is it to get Linux.Ekoms.1?

Not much of a \"trojan\"...  \nAnd from what I found out you have some more problems getting it to run.  A lot of the Ubuntu users probably do not even get it to build due to an old used libc. Besides you needing to use an end of life Ubuntu you also need to kill pulseaudio yourself for the trojan to be able to use it. You also need to disable compositing yourself or the only screenshot it takes is a desktop image.\nAnd now for the kicker: the group/person that detected this trojan does not disclose where they found it, do no even provide the source code but they are willing to sell you an anti-virus software for you to use!\nB O G U S.\n", "Q: What is \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 19019?

I have an Asus Zenbook UX32VD with the following specs:\n -13.3\" 1920x1080\n - 4 GB RAM\n - 500 GB HDD + 24 GB SSD\n - Nvidia 620M GT (1GB) + Intel HD 4000 graphics 1.9Ghz Core i7 (3517U)\n\nI want to install Ubuntu on an SSD. Is it possible? Which is the best version for my computer?\n\nA: Everything should be fine. I don't see anything special, so there should be no problem. Like others have said, your SSD is a little small, but Ubuntu can actually be configured to boot Ubuntu off of the SSD and have all your data on the 500GB drive.\nSince you do have NVIDIA, I recommend installing Ubuntu 15.10. NVIDIA can be troublesome on Ubuntu, so it's usually best to have the newest version of Ubuntu. You will pretty much have to update to the next version of Ubuntu every six months, but that's an easy process. If you really don't want to upgrade every six months, and would like that frequency to be decreased to every two years, go with 14.04.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu on the SSD and make sure all your data is on the HDD, here's the process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Rufus if you're on Windows and use it to burn the Ubuntu ISO you downloaded (Get 14.04 or 15.10 from here) to a USB stick.\n\n*Reboot your computer and boot from the USB stick.\n\n*Choose the Try Before Installing option when prompted.\n\n*Search for and open GParted.\n\n*Use GParted to format your SSD as ext4 (this will wipe any data on the drive so make sure your stuff is backed up).\n\n*Go to the dropdown in the top right and select your 500GB drive.\n\n*If you have any partitions on it, use the Move/Resize tool to make it smaller. If you can, free up at least 150GB for Ubuntu.\n\n*Make a new partition in that free space, formatted as ext4.\n\n*Click the Apply button and let the changes be made.\n\n*Now, open the Install Ubuntu app on the desktop (you can close GParted).\n\n*Click through until you are either prompted with options on how to install Ubuntu, or are met with a partition selection screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you get the options, choose Something Else...\n\n*If you get the partition screen, continue on.\n\n\n*On the partition selection screen, right click the SSD and click Properties. \n\n*As the mountpoint, choose /. Also select the Format option and select ext4 and the filesystem type. Click Done.\n\n*Go into Properties of the partition you created on the 500GB drive and make the mountpoint /home. You do not need to format this partition again.\n\n*Click Continue in the setup and Ubuntu should install.\n\n\nNOTE: You may have a problem getting into setup, as you have NVIDIA. You might be greeted with a screen of scrolling text with the word Nouveau among other stuff. If this happens, follow the steps below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and boot back into the USB stick.\n\n*On the selection screen, highlight the Try Before Install option, but don't hit Enter. Instead, press e.\n\n*Use your arrow keys to bring the cursor to the end of the line beginning with linux.\n\n*Press SPACE and type nouveau.modeset=0.\n\n*Press F10 to boot into setup and follow the steps above.\n\n\n\nOnce you have Ubuntu installed and running, you may notice that the NVIDIA card isn't being used (low performance in games/HD videos). To fix this, open the Additional Drivers app and select a proprietary NVIDIA driver. I recommend against using the -updates option(s), as these versions are experimental and not fully tested, but you're welcome to try. Instead, choose the latest non -updates version. Click the Apply button and enter your password. Reboot and you will have NVIDIA be the default card for everything.\n\nEDIT: Another note.\nIf your computer came with Windows 8 or later, you may need to turn Secure Boot off. It's not probable, but possible that it will get in the way. If you want turn it off, the setting will be in your BIOS settings. \n\nThat should be it. Your computer should run Ubuntu without issue. If you do have a problem, come back and ask here on Ask Ubuntu (do a little research first, as your question may already have an answer).\nAny questions about my answer: just comment and I'll do my best to help :-).\n\nA: My proposal\n\n\n*\n\n*SSD is supported in Ubuntu 16.04/... well if it is the standard SSD provided in the Zenbook.  \n\n*Keep Windows 10 in your system\n\n*Install the latest Long-term-release Ubuntu (now 16.04) as dual-boot in your system\n\n\n*\n\n*the manufacturer supports firmware/... updates in Windows 10; the laptop was designed for Windows 10; Linux support is missing much    \n\n*all Ubuntu versions will have some limitations without firmware updates; you can possibly fix/glue some of them without the updates but the updates of the manufacturer are the safest ways; however, the manufacturer says that you should not do firmware updates unless something is not working properly because it has its own risks\n\n\n*Note the NVidia GPU requires Bumblebee project's adjustments for Optimus, but may still have issues etc in power consumption/... Your integrated Intel GPU will work fine. \n\n\n*\n\n*Upstream's (Debian) documentation about your NVidia GPU and hardware here and its confirmation in Ubuntu wiki where only installation manual for 12.04 and 13.04, but adapt for 16.04. \n\n*Power consumption issues in NVidia GPU with Ubuntu here, \n\n\n\nA: The answer depends on what you plan on doing with ubuntu. 24GB is a bit small for a fully usable Ubuntu. But if you only use it for Mails or something like that, it might suffice.\nAccording to versions: Ubuntu has two different versions. LTS-Versions like 14.04 have longer support and you don't have to worry about the ending of support in the next time. Newer Versions come with shorter support cycles until a new LTS version is released.\n\nA: Based on your configuration you can very well install Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.

The two are connected via a DVI cable that was supplied with the monitor. \nI dual boot Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with Windows 10, and Windows has no problem running at 60 HZ, 100 HZ, 120 HZ, and 144Hz. There's even a simple interface for changing this setting.\nSo, is there a way to change the refresh rate in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Have you tried this?\nxrandr --output DVI-I-1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 120.0\n\n", "Q: nvidia-settings crashing after selecting a display After a fresh first install of ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my computer I had some issues with nvidia, especially with the nvidia-settings.

I removed Windows XP. Is there a way to optimize Ubuntu to get it to run faster?\nI have 1.1gig of memory and the cpu is a pentimento 4 2.4GHz.TIA\n\nA: 15.04 has reached its end-of-life date and thus is no longer supported. It's probably better to get either 14.04 or 15.10.\nSince your computer is pretty low-spec, something like Lubuntu might be better for you. Lubuntu is Ubuntu, but with a different desktop environment. Instead of Unity, you get LXDE. It looks very different, but it's specifically made to run on computers that aren't very modern, or are just very low budget.\nIf your computer can support 64-bit, don't get 64-bit Ubuntu. It won't perform very well.\nThe installation process is pretty much the same as normal Ubuntu.\nLubuntu 14.04 (32-bit): http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/14.04.3/release/lubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso\nLubuntu 15.10 (32-bit): http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/15.10/release/lubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso\n\nA: In your case I will suggest for for lightweight Ubuntu aka lubuntu.

The configuration is stored in \n\n~/.config/transmission/settings.json\n\nFind and change the \"umask\" value. Note that the json format uses decimal notation, so take a look at the table and find a value for the new umask (ex: 22)\nUmask   Created Files       Created Directories\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n000     666 (rw-rw-rw-)     777     (rwxrwxrwx)\n002     664 (rw-rw-r--)     775     (rwxrwxr-x)\n022     644 (rw-r--r--)     755     (rwxr-xr-x)\n027     640 (rw-r-----)     750     (rwxr-x---)\n077     600 (rw-------)     700     (rwx------)\n277     400 (r--------)     500     (r-x------)\n\nthen in a terminal:\n#echo $((8#022)) \n18\n\nFinally change the umask value to 18\n\nA: Transmission, at least as a daemon, has the option to run a script on completion of a torrent. You should be able to tell this script to chmod to 664 upon completion. From there, the files should be accessible, and writable from your main user.\nYou could make a script that contains these lines:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash    \nchmod -R 664 ${TR_TORRENT_DIR}\nexit 0\n\nYou then make that script executable, and place it somewhere where transmission-daemon can access it, like /usr/local/bin or something.\nThen you tell transmission-daemon to run the script upon torrent completion. You can either do this by GUI, or to have this line in your /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json file:\n\"script-torrent-done-filename\": \"/usr/local/bin/your-script.sh\", \n\nAnd that should be that. The concept of the script-torrent-done is rather powerful, I use it to sort torrents into movies/music/etc according to its content, but that's a rather longer script :)\n\nA: You should read up on ACL, it allows you to add additional permissions, like add permissions for your main user.\nfor e.g sudo setfacl -d -R u:gael:rw /home/transmission allows your user to read and write to that directory. -d is default which means files created in that directory will have those new permissions. Usually you use -m instead of -d. Run with -m to apply to existing files.\nYou could make a script to run the setfacl command on completion to ensure all files are correct, As Sverker suggested;\n", "Q: Is it ok to add a new harddisk with existing data onto an ubuntu? I have a hard drive dedicated to a specific media folder on my Host Window PC and wondering is it ok to just put it onto the Ubuntu server... Or would it be better to just get a new drive and transfer over the files?\n\nA: Ofcourse you can do that there is no issue at all. In fact some of the folks even share the swap partition between Linux and Windows.\nAs you can see in my Ubuntu Desktop - I have two drives(one i added later). Both the hard drives have Windows as well Linux.\n\n\nAnd this is how they look(appear) in the sidebar of Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.3\n with the exact Volume label of Windows. You can access them right from there.\n", "Q: Connect 2 computers remotely I'd like to know how to connect 2 Ubuntu computers a desktop and a laptop so that from the laptop remotely i can use sudo permission on the desktop\n\nA: You can run a remote desktop server on your desktop pc (vino-server) and connect to it with remmina on your laptop.  You will be able to do anything on the desktop that you could do if you were sitting there.\nIf all you want is command line access, as AzkerM stated in a comment, you can run an ssh server on the desktop and connect to it from your laptop.\n\nA: Adding to what is mentioned in the above answer.\nOne can use Vino without encryption also\ninstall dconf-tools:\n\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nstart dconf-editor from the command line and go to org->gnome->desktop->remote-access and toggle the require-encryption item to unchecked.\nIf desktop sharing was enabled prior to changing the setting, then execute the following from the command line:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false\n\nIf desktop sharing was not enabled prior to changing the setting, then enable desktop sharing.\n", "Q: Cannot update ubuntu 14.04 server with latest kernel version I am attempting to update Ubuntu 14.04.

I have 250gb ssd, 6x 3tb hdd and 16gb memory.\nI partitioned ssd;\n16gb swap, 30gb /, rest of /home\nraid 6 for hdd and no spare, no swap just ext4 /home\nI will use this server for store all my media and files also backup.\nI would like to know if this setup is good and if there is better setup please advise me\nThanks\n\nA: I would advise making the following changes:\nUse your SSD for the OS\n\nYou have tons of hard drive space with your HDDs. Therefore, I would use the entire SSD for your / partition.\nAlso, I would move your swapdrive off of the SSD because, well, SSDs aren't the best for swapping.\nSimilarly, I would move your /tmp folder off of the SSD.\n\nSet Up LVM\n\nYou have six hard drives available. Set up a LVM system spanning the six full HDDs. This will act similar to a RAID, but will offer you slightly better performance and will allow you to define more partitions faster. All in all, LVM is a Good Thing™.\nIf you want to use a RAID-like striping setup, there are ways to do that, but they're not the simplest. However, I'm guessing that you're using RAID as a form of backup. This is a very very very bad idea. RAID has never been and will never be a replacement to backing up.\nOn your LVM system, I would create a 16GB swap partition. From there, assign another 100GB to /tmp so you can have a reliable tempdriver without murdering your SSD. Send the rest to your /home partition, or even better, a specific partition for storing files (maybe /files?).\n", "Q: (Ubuntu 15.10 64bit) Missing :i386 dependencies libglib2 and libgtk2 when I try to install certain 32bit programs like in this case Wine, from the Software Center or from the WineHQ repository, or for example PCSX2 I get errors for missing dependencies.

I opted for Ubuntu Server over the likes of FreeNas as in the future I'll be able to use other features and expandability that FreeNas doesn't have. (eg web server and VM Server)\nI will be running the OS boot drive separate to my drive array which will be constructed of 3 x WD Red drives in RAIDz1.\nThere is a spare MLC SSD laying around from a previous build, barely used, I was considering using it for L2ARC cache just because why not. However I am unsure what are the consequences of the SSD dying in relation to the greater array, will it just default back to the speed of the pool or will it render the entire pool useless?\n\nA: An L2ARC failure shouldn't affect a ZFS pool content.\nAll data read from the L2ARC is checksummed so in case of any invalid data or missing data, ZFS fall back to retrieving the data on disk blocks.\nHowever, depending on the kind of failure and the times spent by the drivers or the hardware to assert there is actually a failure, there might be a significant time lost.\n", "Q: what kernel version for 14.04.3 What version of kernel should be available for running Ubuntu 14.04.3?

Now when I start it after login it doesn't show anything. Right click is also disabled and only the splash screen appears with wallpaper. I'm using Ubuntu 15.10. When I log in to a guest session, my own user or gnome desktop the same thing happens.\nWhat could be the problem and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to got to tty and log in, now run this \ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\nthen\nsetsid unity\n\n", "Q: One single command to update everything in Ubuntu? I know that there are three command to update and then upgrade the whole system, these are:\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt update: Fetches the list of available updates\n\n*sudo apt upgrade: Strictly upgrades the current packages\n\n*sudo apt full-upgrade: Installs updates (add or remove packages), equivalent of dist-upgrade\nIs there a super-upgrade command that combines all these commands to one?\n\nA: If you are annoyed by too much typing, you can define yourself an \"alias\". This can be done e.g. by adding a line to the end of your $HOME/.profile like this:\nalias sau='sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade'\n\n(of course you can replace \"sau\" by something else -- for me that's an acronym to Sudo Apt-get Update). After saving the file, open a new shell (or \"source\" the .profile again running . $HOME/.profile. Now you can always simply type \"sau\" to do the complete job. Works great for me with multiple machines.\n\nA: sudo apt install unattended-upgrades\n\nThis is the best line yet.   All the other solutions, you have to type the one line over and over again every day.    This is truly the one-command solution.  See official apt documentation from Ubuntu!\nBy editing the .conf files of this package in /etc you can set the frequency of update, install, clean, autoremove...\nOr simply and email including A notification that an update is available with the list of package names.\nA nice little log file is generated with each change, and I imagine a little script could be written as a GUI extension to pop up in the desktop notifications too (off-topic).\n\nA: There are 3 decent choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could create a script something like the following:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nCall it something like update.sh and place it in /usr/local/bin and then make the script executable by running:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/update.sh\n\n\n*Another method would be to create a bash alias (in ~/.bashrc) or wherever you normally store your aliases:\nalias update='sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'\n\n\n*A final method would be to simply string the 3 commands together on the commandline:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nA few choices...\nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*Combine apt-get update and apt-get upgrade in one command\n\nA: Unfortunately, the two commands have to be executed separately.\n\nA: We can have a one-liner command (no need to scripts, just copy-paste)\nsudo apt update -y && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt clean -y && sudo apt autoclean -y\n\n\n*\n\n*update - updates the list of packages but do not install\n\n*upgrade - install new versions of packages if new versions are available\n\n*full-upgrade - performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the system as a whole (fixing bad dependencies then)\n\n*autoremove, autoclean and clean - clean old packages which are not needed any more\n\n*option -y does not request for permission on every step\n\n*&& states that it just runs the next command if the previous was successfully executed\n\nAlias\nYou can also create an alias. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases\nalias upev='sudo apt update -y && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt clean -y && sudo apt autoclean -y'\n\nRun source ~/.bashrc to fetch your new alias, and now simply run\nsudo upev \n\nnote: I chose upev for UPgrade EVerything, but you may chose anything you want.\n\nA: \nIs there a super-upgrade command that combines all these commands to one?\n\nWell.. bad news is that no, there isn't. Good news though is that here I've put together one.\nAnd to go on with the idea of simplification I've turned its creation into a \"single\" command line. So here it is:\necho \"sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo apt -y dist-upgrade && sudo apt -y autoremove && sudo apt autoclean\" > update && sudo mv update /usr/local/bin/update && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/update\n\nNow, whenever the need for updating arises you just type update in the terminal, input your password and voilà.\n\nThis might look like one of those incomprehensible things you only copy-paste from. But it doesn't really have to be ! \nSee it's actually quite simple, so..\nWhat this is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Every update command (and then further commands) were concatenated using && (including apt autoremove to remove no longer used dependencies).\n\n*-y was added to every apt command that would otherwise prompt for a positive answer to perform its actions.\n\n*echo was placed in front of the command and the line was surrounded with \"\" so its characters wouldn't escape.\n\n*> was used to redirect/write echo's output (our line) to an \"update\" file. \n\n*The file is moved to /usr/local/bin/ so it is executable from anywhere. Writing on this path requires superuser access which is why it's not possible to do it in the step before.\n\n*The file was turned into an executable using chmod.\n\n\nA: Just copy-paste the following alias command and execute it:\nalias fup='sudo apt-get -y update;sudo apt-get -y full-upgrade;sudo apt-get -y autoremove; sudo apt-get -y autoclean'\n\nNow, running fup will automatically do all the jobs defined in the alias.\nIf you need to use this frequently, do the following.\n\n*\n\n*Create a file named .bash_aliases in your $HOME directory. You can do that form the terminal with the following command:\ntouch ./.bash_aliases\n\n\n\n*In the .bash_aliases file paste the alias command mentioned above.\n\n\n*Now save the file and exit.\n\n\n*Edit your .bashrc file to export your .bash_aliases file. So run:\ngedit .bashrc\n\nand paste the following code at the end of file:\nif [ -f /home/abhyam/.bash_aliases ];then\nsource /home/abhyam/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\n\n\n*Save the file and exit.\n\n\n*Run:\nsource .bashrc\n\n\n\n*Now you can run the command fup to fully update and upgrade your system anytime.\nThe benefit of creating the .bash_aliases file is that you can also create custom aliases in that file for other actions and that it will automatically get sourced each time you open a terminal.\n\nA: I found this thread looking for the same treasure. In case anyone is still interested, I've been working on a git project which runs through the same commands.\n#!/usr/bin/bash\n    RED='\\033[0;31m'\n    GREEN='\\033[0;32m'\n    PURPLE='\\033[0;35m'\n    NC='\\033[0m' # No Color\n\n#Region --- Updates\n    echo -e \"${PURPLE}RUNNING: sudo apt update --fix-missing${NC}\"\n\nfor i in {1..100}\ndo  \n    sudo apt clean\n    sudo apt update --fix-missing\n    status=$?\nif test $status -eq 0\nthen \n    echo -e \"${GREEN}SUCCESS: sudo apt update --fix-missing${NC}\\n\"\n    break\nelse \n    echo -e \"${RED}FAILED: sudo apt update --fix-missing${NC}\\n\"\n    sleep 1m\nfi\ndone\n\n#Region --- Upgrades\nfor i in {1..100}\ndo  \necho -e \"${PURPLE}RUNNING: sudo apt upgrade -y${NC}\"\n    sudo apt full-upgrade -y\n    status=$?\nif test $status -eq 0\nthen\n    echo -e \"${GREEN}SUCCESS: sudo apt upgrade -y${NC}\\n\"\n    break\nelse \n    echo -e \"${RED}FAILED: sudo apt upgrade -y${NC}\\n\"\n    sleep 1m\nfi\ndone\n\n#Region\nfor i in {1..100}\ndo  \necho -e \"${PURPLE}RUNNING: sudo apt autoremove -y${NC}\"\n    sudo apt autoremove -y\n    status=$?\nif test $status -eq 0\nthen \n    echo -e \"${GREEN}SUCCESS: sudo apt autoremove -y${NC}\\n\"\n    break\nelse\n    echo -e \"${RED}FAILED: sudo apt autoremove -y${NC}\\n\"\n    sleep 1m\nfi\ndone\n\n#Region --- Exiting BasherUpdate\n    echo -e \"${PURPLE}Exiting BasherUpdate...${NC}\\n\"\n    exit 0\n\nNote that I used a loop on the apt update command because I was getting mirror sync in progress errors and wanted it to keep trying. Hope this helps and let me know if you have suggestions!\n\nA: Found this elsewhere:\n    sudo -- sh -c \"apt update && apt upgrade -y\"\n\nCan also alias this to use 'upgrade' in your ~/.bash_aliases with something like:\n    alias upgrade=\"sudo -- sh -c 'apt update && apt upgrade -y'\"\n\nand do a 'source ~/.bash_aliases' to make it work\n", "Q: Wi-Fi not detected I have just loaded Ubuntu 15.10.

If I use an other theme like Adwaita resizing is possible on all four sides! I only have this problem with nautilus, all other Applications are fine!\n\nMaybe an border is to thin to hit it on an HD Screen (1920x1800px)?!\n\nIn Adwaita the Cursor switches to \"resize\" on all four sides!\nHow can I resize the Nautilus window in the Ambiance Theme?\n\nA: Ambiance is designed for Unity and does not work good with CSD windows.

But the thing is I have completely shutdown Windows but I'm still facing this error. Can somebody tell me why am I facing this error. I am using Windows 10\n\nA: As far as I know Windows 8 does not really shutdown, but uses some kind of hibernation (fastboot) by default (even if you think you have shut down windows properly).\nUbuntu is detecting this hibernation file created by fastboot and therefore refuses to mount the windows partition writeable - with good reason. Otherwise you could do changes on this partition which Windows would not detect.\nFrom my point of view there are two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable fastboot in windows: How to enable / disable fast startup in Windows 10? or How to disable or enable Fast Startup in Windows 10\n\n*use the windows partition readonly (that is not writable) in Ubuntu: there you need to adjust the config file /etc/fstab and add the parameter ro for this partition. Further reading: How do I correctly mount a NTFS partition in /etc/fstab?\nI clearly recommend to disable fastboot, especially if you have not modified /etc/fstab before.\n\nA: Well I don't know why I was facing this error but I turned off the hibernation mode and the windows partition is now mounting \n\nA: This problem has 3 Solution:\n1.Login to your Windows 10 and Restart it (Don't Shutdown).Now, login to Ubuntu.Your partition will be mounted\n2.Disable Fastboot form Windows 10\n3.Remove Windows and use Ubuntu as a single operating system\n", "Q: Install mobile partner using super user I am trying to install mobile partner of Huawei Technologies.

I installed MariaDB server to my machine. While setting up, I was met with the problem of whether I should have it enabled all the time, as the documentation I follow suggests with these steps:\nsudo yum install mariadb mariadb-server \nsudo systemctl start mariadb.service  \nsudo systemctl enable mariadb.service\n\n\nA: From the systemctl manpage:\nenable NAME...\n   Enable one or more unit files or unit file instances, as specified\n   on the command line. This will create a number of symlinks as\n   encoded in the \"[Install]\" sections of the unit files. After the\n   symlinks have been created, the systemd configuration is reloaded\n   (in a way that is equivalent to daemon-reload) to ensure the\n   changes are taken into account immediately. Note that this does not\n   have the effect of also starting any of the units being enabled. If\n   this is desired, either --now should be used together with this\n   command, or an additional start command must be invoked for the\n   unit.\n   ...\n   Enabling units should not be confused with starting (activating)\n   units, as done by the start command. Enabling and starting units is\n   orthogonal: units may be enabled without being started and started\n   without being enabled. Enabling simply hooks the unit into various\n   suggested places (for example, so that the unit is automatically\n   started on boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged\n   in). Starting actually spawns the daemon process (in case of\n   service units), or binds the socket (in case of socket units), and\n   so on.\n\nEssentially, enable marks the service for starting up on boot, and start actually starts the service immediately.\n\nA: systemctl start and systemctl enable do different things.\nenable will hook the specified unit into relevant places, so that it will automatically start on boot, or when relevant hardware is plugged in, or other situations depending on what's specified in the unit file.\nstart starts the unit right now.\ndisable and stop are the opposite of these, respectively.\nThis means that when you first install MariaDB, you might want to run systemctl enable mariadb.service to enable it so it starts on boot. You might also want to run systemctl start mariadb.service, or just reboot, in order to start MariaDB. To stop MariaDB, run systemctl stop mariadb.service (it will start again on next boot or when you manually start it). To disable it so it doesn't start on boot anymore, run systemctl disable mariadb.service.\nUpdate:\nAs noted in gerardw's answer, starting from version 220, released in may 2015, both enable and disable started to take the optional --now switch in order to also start or stop the unit, depending on the used command.\nTo both disable and stop a unit with the same command, use systemctl disable mariadb.service --now. Similarly, to both enable and start a unit, use systemctl enable mariadb.service --now.\nSource: systemctl man page\n\nA: As of systemctl version 220, enable and disable support a --now switch to start / stop services concurrent with the enabling / disabling.\ne.g. systemctl --now enable foobar.service\nUse systemctl --version to check your installed version.\n", "Q: gnome-terminal starts with \"grep: write error: Broken pipe\" message I am running Ubuntu 14.04.3, it's uptodate.

Only thing you need to worry about is 3rd party drivers (like for the graphics card; if you have a nVidia in 1 and an AMD in the other it will result in problems). Remove those before the move and re-install them on the new system. \nThe same method is possible by using cat (in the old days that would be dd) and cloning the data. You can clone a disk from sdb to sdc with (again 1st delete the 3rd party drivers to avoid problems) ...\nsudo sh -c 'cat /dev/sdb >/dev/sdc'\n\nSo put the hard disk from the new system into the old one and copy away.

Behind it there is a LAN with laptops, tablets, smart TVs, etc.\nI would like to use VPN on my TV, but there is no such option in the TVs software/firmware. So I thought that maybe its possible to setup VPN connection on my Ubuntu router and redirect all traffic from TV to this VPN connection. ONLY FROM THE TV. Traffic from other devices, as well as traffic from Ubuntu itself, should use original connection. \nIs it possible to do?\nMy VPN provider is NordVPN.

The machine boots up until the lock screen, then it errors out if you try to log in. Thanks again!\n\nA: I cannot reply as comment because I don't have enough reputation so I'm going ahead and answer, just giving you some options to try, that I hope will be useful.\nFirst, you will need some way to download from the net. Since you are asking here I assume you have that.\nFrom your problem PC press Ctrl-Alt-F1, login and type:\napt-get install --reinstall --print-uris -qq unity ubuntu-desktop\n\nHopefully, you will get the URIS of the packages you need, that you can download elsewhere and transfer via USB to your problem PC. I'll post the ones that I got:\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/u/ubuntu-meta/ubuntu-desktop_1.325_i386.deb\nhttp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/u/unity/unity_7.2.6+14.04.20151021-0ubuntu1_i386.deb\nLet's say you copied them to your home folder, then (as before) from the terminal:\nsudo dpkg -i ubuntu-desktop*.deb unity*.deb\n\nEDITED: I added you need to change runlevel.\n", "Q: My computer running Ubuntu crashed and doesn't remember my login password My computer crashed and doesn't remember my login password. I have already tried resetting my password the way where you go in to grub but that didn't work. I would be happy with any solution even if it involved completely resetting the computer and losing all files. Also I am not too familiar with the terminal so explain things.\n\nA: You should be able to use grub to choose one of the recovery options, this should give you a root terminal. (This is from memory! So might not be correct)\nif you're root then the prompt should end with a # so you don't need to use sudo.\nTo verify that you can change the users/passwords etc type cat /etc/passwd if this shows a list of usernames then you should be able to run the command passwd <username> which will prompt for a new password. If you don't get cat to show anything you will need to look up how to mount the root partition in recovery mode\nYou might have to look at usermod & useradd if you want to create a new user to login with. \nIf you do create a new user, run sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> so that user can use sudo\nThink I'll go familiarise myself with recovery while you try that..\n\nA: Does answering my question close the discussion? Going to the grub menu and selecting recovery mode and then going to root allowed me to get back on with \"useradd \"\n", "Q: Internet connectivity drops upon installation I'm dual booting Ubuntu Mate with Windows xp (just to keep a few things) it installs just fine but as soon as I restart it after it won't connect to the Internet either by WiFi or by ethernet.

Some subfolders get converted, some not, some only partially.\nEven if I start the shell script in all 27 first-level subfolders, only part of the files get converted.\nWhat could be the problem?\n\nA: If you don't have line breaks in the names of your files or folders you should use a while instead of a for loop:\nfind -iname \"*.wmf\" | while read file; do\n    uniconvertor \"$file\" \"${i%.wmf}.svg\" \ndone\n\nThis avoids problems with spaces in names and with too much arguments when expanding the ...\n\nA: You must surround your find ... command with $(  ) to substitute the output, thusly:\nfor i in $( find . -type f -iname '*.wmv` ) ; do ...\n\nHowever, you're causing Bash to produce (and store internally) a list of 120,860 filenames before you process the first one. Also (you haven't described the format of the filenames), this technique mishandles filenames with Spaces in them, e.g. A Big File.wmf.  \nRead man find, especially, about --print0, read man xargs, especially about -0, read man bash and wrap your command in a script that runs uniconverter on each of its arguments, and use something like:  \nfind . -type f -iname '*.wmv' -print0 | xargs -0 thescript \n\nBe sure to read man bash and be very aware of any Spaces in your filenames.\n@steeldriver: TQ for pointing out my error. Reading man bash shows:  \n Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the  literal  value  of\n       all  characters  within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \\, and,\n       when history expansion is enabled, !.

If you're running a script, that script's bash process is a child of your current interactive shell.

I want to dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu, I already have win 7 installed in C drive\nThe question is can I install Ubuntu on unallocated space after the E drive? I mean this space is not behind C drive.\nWill it dual boot? is there any risk on the drives before the unallocated space?\n\nA: We usually refer to \"Unallocated space\" as a part of a disk without any filesystem. So, technically, no, you can't install Ubuntu in an unallocated space.\nBut Ubuntu's installer (called Ubiquity) has a step which lets you partition/organize/format your disk. In Linux, drives, disks and partitions are not named with letters (unlike Windows), but with kernel-created special device files, inside the /dev directory. The first, main hard disk of a computer is usually represented by a file named sda. Its partitions are represented with the same name, but with numbers. For example, the first partition of the first hard disk is named sda1.\nWhen you run Ubuntu's installer you'll need to format the partition where you want to install Ubuntu as ext4. Ext4 is the default filesystem for Ubuntu and most GNU/Linux systems, just like NTFS is Windows' and HFS+ is OSX's. You'll also need to set the filesystem's root's mountpoint to be in that partition.\nIf you choose \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" or \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows\" everything will be done automatically, but you won't be able to choose how much space will be allocated to each system: it will be 50-50.\nIf you choose \"Something else...\" you'll be able to make your own partitions (including separate ones for /home, /var, /boot or any other directory), but have in mind that this is an option recommended for advanced users.\n\nA: Yes, you can and it will dual boot. All you need is any unnallocated space of roughly 25Gb or more (15Gb is enough for root for a desktop).\n\nis there any risk on the drives before the Unallocated Space?\n\nMessing with partitions is always risky. I would always advice to make a backup of important data. \nIt is always best to use a system that you understand to create \"unallocated\" space in it. That way you have a clear indicator when installing another system into that space.\n\nA: Simply, maximum 3 partitions and 1 un-allocated space required before installing Linux or Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nIf above per-requisite will match, you can overcome the problem. \n\nA: What other partitions are co-located with E: ?\nYou should install Ubuntu to a \"primary partition\", and even if you use LVM, you should create a linux swap partition somewhere (1).  \nYou should also think about leaving some unused space at the end of the disk, just for contingency if you need to rescue the system in the future (2).\n(1) is for live distro booting if and when you need to.\n(2) is for putting an additional distro on the disk (for bootloader re-write, file recovery, say).\nBe mindful that if E: is not the boot disk, removing or re-writing the boot disk will prevent Ubuntu from booting.\n", "Q: Printers setting disappeared, cannot manage printers, ubuntu 14.04 I was following these instructions to install canon mp495 network printer on ubuntu 14.04. \nThose instructions did not work, so I went back to manually install it via the printers setting in ubuntu's system setting.\nHowever, there is no printers option anymore. It is simply disappeared.\n\nWhat has happened and how can I get it back?\n\nA: Please verify if system-config-printer-gnome is installed.

I just bought a laptop (MSI GE62 2QD) and installed ubuntu. My problem is that the battery runs out very fast. Is there some way to switch to a power-saving mode when for example browsing the web and then switch to performance mode when playing a game?\nI read somewere that the graphics card draws a lot of power and the drivers on Linux aren't able to automatically disable it when not needed like in Windows. I am using the proprietary Nvida driver from the additional drivers list.\nI have tried opening NVIDIA X Server Settings and under PRIME Profiles select Intel (Power Saving Mode). This didn't seem to help much and it's very anoying having to reboot the computer each time I change these settings (just logging out didn't seem to be enough).\nMy question is, how can I save battery on my laptop when I do not need full performance?\n\nA: have you tried installing bumblebee? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\nafter installation you can run a program with a discreet graphics card with \"primusrun\" at the beginning of the command, but just with usual stuff without the command the whole laptop will just run on the intel graphics.

As hard as I'm sure he tries, he can only break Ubuntu about once a year.\nHe has an external hard drive for his music. If I plug it in after booting and logging in, it works fine.

The UUID is correct, as far as I can see.  /media/external does exist, and as far as I can tell, it has the correct permissions (owner is root, but other users can read and write).\nThe one other potential curveball is that the computer is a Dell workstation with a slight BIOS issue.

Is there any out there? Is there a GUI terminal that provides clickable buttons for commands, such as apt-get update or apt-get autoremove or apt-get upgrade, instead of typing all the time? \n\nA: Well you mentioned apt-get commands, so You could just use Ubuntu update-manager (that's more or less gui for apt-get) and I'm pretty sure there are others like synaptic for example. \nOn the other hand, there is no such thing that You are describing for ALL commands acessible from terminal (imagine, my ls /usr/bin | wc has 2186 entries, and that's not all that's possible. And what about all arguments You often need to pass to some program? Like ls -l ~/Music or chaining commands with pipes? \n\nA: No there is not one of such tools. Different graphical tools will perform specific command line instructions. Like \"software updater\" handles apt-get instructions you also have ...\n\"Task manager\" that handles processes (command \"ps\"). You can view process, changes niceness, kill a process etc. \n\"Nautilus\" that handles file manager commands. Like \"ls\", \"cd\", create/delete files or directories (\"touch\", \"mkdir', \"rm\"). \nThere is a graphical tool for editing Grub, for mounting, for burning DVDs (where command line is a simple \"dd\" command).\nThe 1st 2 will probably cover most of the commands you will need to type. \nGnome terminal (or similar) is a lot more handy to have for any command with any of its options.

A terminal is something where you type into and not where you click on something.\nThere are millions commands it wouldn't even possible to make it graphical. But the more general things can be managed through Ubuntu's settings witch are graphical. \nIf you just need it for managing packages there is synaptic or you could also use the Ubuntu software center which is preinstalled. \n", "Q: Geforce 7300 LE - Nvidia 304.131 driver crashes in ubuntu 14.04 32bit I have an old Dell Optiplex GX280 whith a PCIe card Nvidia Geforce 7300 LE.

I can't close any files I have open. The only way I can run commands is by using xterm. I still have access to my files, which is a good thing because I have programming assignments and other related school documents I can't afford to delete. I've tried everything to restore unity desktop. when I run apt-get install ubuntu-desktop I'm always receiving \nCould not find Platform independent libraries prefix\nCould not find Platform dependent libraries exec-prefix\nE: sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\".\n\nI don't have much time to invest in finding a fix. What is the best alternative in getting my system up and running again, considering I don't want to delete my school files?\n\nA: 2 possible ways. The 1st is a generic method that will take the same time as a normal install and will always work. \nBoot a live DVD. During the partition setup do NOT tick ANY of the \"format\" checkboxes and have the system install. Mount the partitions to the names you currently have and set it up with the same username. \nThis will overwrite any system related file, leave all your configuration files and leave your /home/ as it is.\nMind though: making a backup is always the preferred method. You can do that from a live DVD too (take a blank DVD and use Brasero to burn your files or use a stick to copy files over to it). \n\nYou might like to try this first: \"Could not find Platform independent libraries prefix\" will show up when you are missing /usr/lib/python2.7. \nThis should be a fix for that:\ncd ~/Downloads/\napt-get download python2.7 python2.7-minimal libpython2.7\nsudo dpkg -i python2.7_*.deb python2.7-minimal_*.deb libpython2.7_*.deb\n\nAfter that you should also be able to do a sudo apt-get install -f ubuntu-desktop to get a working desktop. Just to be sure that you installed the most up to date python packages, run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\nYou can do the commands on another Ubuntu machine or download the files using a browser and then copy them over to the system you want them installed. The 3rd command installs it.\n\nA: First, you need an Ubuntu Live media. It's the same CD/DVD/USB used to install it. Also get a spare flash drive/external drive/CD/DVD to make the backup. If your installation media is a USB drive, you can make a second partition out of it to keep your files. \nWe'll also need some information, such as your Ubuntu partition name. Consider some factors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you have a separate /home partition? If so, discover its name.\n\n*If you don't have a separate /home partition, discover the root (/) partition's name.\nThe \"name\" is the path to the partition's special device file, something like /dev/sda1. You should know it at this point. Take note of it.\nBoot into your Live media and insert your backup drive. We'll need to discover its \"name\", too. To do it, you can run df -aTh in a terminal. You will find information about mounted filesystems, find your backup media and take note of it. Again, it should be something like /dev/sdb1.\nIn a terminal, run:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt`\nreplacing /dev/sdXY with Ubuntu's partition name. Then\nsudo umount /dev/sdAB\nreplacing /dev/sdAB with the backup media.\nsudo mkdir /backup\nsudo mount /dev/sdAB /backup\nsudo mkdir /backup/ubuntu_backup\nsudo cp -rf /mnt/home /backup/ubuntu_backup\nThe above command may take some time, since it's the actual backup.\nWhen it finishes, the backup is ready. Make sure by running nautilus /backup/ubuntu_backup and making sure all you home folders and files are there. Run:\nsudo umount /mnt\nsudo umount /backup\nYou can proceed to reinstall Ubuntu from the Live media you're currently running, formatting the old Ubuntu partition Make sure you create your admin user with the exact same name you had before. When it finishes, reboot to the Live media and not to the installed Ubuntu OS. From the Live media, in a terminal, run:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\nsudo umount /dev/sdAB\nsudo mkdir /backup\nsudo mount /dev/sdAB /backup\nsudo rm -rf /mnt/home\nsudo cp -rf /backup/ubuntu_backup/home /mnt\nagain, the above will take a bit of a time. It's copying the backup to the freshly installed system. \nWhen it finishes, simply reboot into Ubuntu and all your files (including Desktop icons) should be there.\nNOTE: the backup won't keep your installed apps/software. You should take note of them to reinstall later.\nNever remove Python. It's essential for Ubuntu core functionality. As a rule of thumb, never delete anything that comes with Ubuntu.\nHave a nice day.\n", "Q: Bash script not recording So, here i am, playing with some bash scripts, and there is something that doesn't work:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nscript -c \\\nsudo apt-get update &&\nsudo apt-get upgrade &&\n\nexit\n\necho \"(Not important for the question)\"\n\nI want to run the usual update and upgrade stuff, and also record the output, but when i run the script, it only says that the script started to record in apt-get, shows the usage of sudo ( usage: sudo -h is the first line ), and says that the sript is done. After that it starts the sudo stuff.\nWhat do i need to do in order to record the output of the update&upgrade task? In general, how can i record the output of an entire shell script?\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you can use the following:\n#!/bin/bash\n\napt-get update &> update.log\napt-get -y upgrade &> upgrade.log\n\necho \"all done\"\n\nSave this script as run_updates.sh, make it executable with chmod 755 run_updates.sh and run it with sudo ./run_updates.sh.\nIf you want to save all output in one file, remove the &> updates.log and &> upgrades.log from the script and run the script as sudo./run_updates.sh &> run_updates.log\n\nExplanation of the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get update &> update.log runs apt-get update and saves the output in update.log\n\n*apt-get -y upgrade &> upgrade.log runs apt-get upgrade and saves the output in upgrade.log. The -y prevents apt from asking to continue (it assumes \"yes\")\n\n\n\nA note on redirections:\nYou can use the redirections below to \"send\" output from a command or script to a file.\n\n\n*\n\n*&> redirects STDOUT and STDERR\n\n*> or 1> redirects STDOUT\n\n*2> redirects STDERR\n\n\n\nA note on sudo:\nThis is probably the reason why you got errors. When running a command that needs sudo in a script, it is a good idea to put the command without sudo in the script and run the script with sudo. Otherwise, you would have to give your sudo password to the script in some way, which is bad.\n\nEdit:\nIn the following code, the output of both apt commands is redirected to update.log. The double > (>>) is used to append data to a file (instead of replacing it)\n#!/bin/bash\n\napt-get update &> update.log\napt-get -y upgrade &>> update.log\n\necho \"all done\"\n\n\nA: In general, to log the output of the entire script, redirect the output of the entire script:\nexec &> some.log\n# Or, when using `/bin/sh`:\n# exec >some.log 2>&1\n\nThe exec builtin is often used to change the open file descriptors or add new file descriptors (the sources and destinations of input and output) for the shell.\nFor example, given example.sh:\n#! /bin/bash\nexec &> some.log\nls foo\necho foo\n\nOn running:\n$ ./example.sh\n$ cat some.log\nls: foo: No such file or directory\nfoo\n\nIf you want both output to screen and to a file, use tee with process substitution:\nexec &> >(tee some.log)\n\n\nA: No need for a script, just do it in one line using Bash redirections and tee:\n{ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade ; } |& tee output.txt\n\nIn case you want to append the output to an existing logfile, add the -a option after tee.\n\nTo explain what it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*{ ... ; } groups the ... commands inside, so that the output redirections we will perform apply to all commands and not just the last one. Please pay attention on the space after { and before } as well as on the semicolon ; after all commands! (thanks @kos for telling me to avoid spawning a subshell)\n\n*sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade are the example commands we want to run and record here. You may exchange this whole part with whatever you like. \n\n*|& (the \"pipe\") redirects both output streams (STDERR/standard error and STDOUT/standard output) of the command left of it to the STDIN (standard input) of the command on the right. (thanks @muru for teaching me about the & to redirect both STDOUT and STDERR)\n\n*tee output.txt copies everything it reads from STDIN to STDOUT and also saves it to output.txt. If the target file already exists, it will get overwritten silently. You can append to the file instead if you use tee -a output.txt.\n\n", "Q: Right click to paste in terminal At work I'm using putty to connect to a lot of Red Hat / CentOS machines and I love the fact that selecting a text means copy and right click means paste.\nCan I set Ubuntu's default terminal to do the same?\nEdit: Thanks for the answers, but they are not exactly what I am looking for. While both are valid, I was actually looking for a way to use the functionality without using another terminal. So everything should work via the default gnome terminal.\nI am not sure it's possible, but I'll try my luck and start a bounty on this...\nEdit: Thank you guys for your answers and sorry for the late reply but I was out over the week-end. I'll check the \"selection/middle mouse button\" solution tonight and come back to you.\nThe patch solution sounds also promising.\n\nA: Let me expand on my original answer a little bit. Technically, the default terminal emulator, the gnome-terminal does not have this functionality and there's no way to set it as far as I know or have seen from researching online. Therefore the answer to your question \n\nCan I set Ubuntu's default terminal to do the same?\n\nis basically, no.\nOn the other hand, putty is actually also available for Ubuntu, and that is the simplest , least-effort solution if you want a specific behavior. Do sudo apt-get install putty to get it.\nThere is however a few compromises that you can adopt, and they exist the way they are for historical reasons. The graphical environment under Unix/Linux X server has something known as selections, think of them as multiple clipboards - primary, secondary, and \"clipboard\". The second selection is when you highlight text and use ShiftInsert or middle mouse click to paste. Middle mouse click is scroll wheel click on mouses, and on touchpads - right and left click pressed together. \nThere are solutions with other terminals but since you request gnome-terminal specifically, the answer still remains , no, there's no other way.\n\nA: I found this patch by Tomi Valkeinen: Gnome-terminal patch for putty-like right mouse button paste \nLet us know if it works for you. \nEdit: I went ahead and checked it myself.

An icon for it pops up on the left side of the screen, and if I hold alt and hit tab, it will show up in the list of available programs. Right clicking on it while holding alt will show what the launcher should look like, and clicking on it will cause the active window to lose focus, but will not bring the launcher into focus. The launcher is absent from the Master+W screen, and attempting to resize/maximize the window from alt-space causes Unity to seize up for a moment before returning to normal function.\nAnyone have a clue what's going on?\n\nA: Just realized the problem. Had an Oculus Rift plugged into a USB port, and apparently this screws with graphical programs if and only if you had it plugged in at startup, whether or not it has been given power.

I know it sounds scary, but I promise it is not. Here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install virtual box: sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\n*Run virtual box: virtualbox command.\n\n*Click on \"New\". The default will be Microsoft Windows, I believe. Choose the correct version.\n\n*Click through the wizard. It is very simple. For RAM, it depends how much your system has. For Windows, maybe give 4GB RAM if you can afford.\n\n*At some point, you will need to select the Windows install image. This should be an .iso that you have saved on Ubuntu somewhere of your Windows installation disk. That is the .iso that you want to boot to when you first start the virtual box that you created.\n\n\nHopefully you don't need Windows for long :). It is such a great feeling when you no longer depend on that last program. But I know it is difficult and sometimes beyond your control. I just wish you good luck that the day arrives.\n\nA: There are some of the stuff you will need Windows so I will say better to have Windows. If you install some image in VM Player - it has limited license of 6 months and not everything works as expected within O/S image.\nOther option - buy an inexpensive Windows laptop - there are many within $400 range.\nBest bet is to install Windows along side Ubuntu.

I have tried formating the partition as fat32, hfs, and ext4 but each have problems reading/writing on one or the other OS's. How would I go about doing so?\n\nA: Depending on your needs you should try the NTFS1 and ExFAT2 file systems. They're both well supported in Linux and OS X3 (with FUSE on both ends) and don't suffer from the problematic limitations of the FAT family.\nIf you need help formatting your partition with either of them, give me a comment and I'll look for or write some instructions. You should be fine with the usual tools (mkfs, Gnome Disks, GParted), though.\n\n1 NTFS works out of the box on Ubuntu.\n2 Install exfat-fuse to give Ubuntu the ability to mount ExFAT file systems and exfat-utils to create and manipulate ExFAT file systems.\n3 For instructions on how to use FUSE to mount NTFS and ExFAT file systems on OS X please refer to our sister site AskDifferent or other online resources as they would be off topic here.\n", "Q: Where is an icon on the Kubuntu desktop stored?

So, I recently secured my root log-in and all sudo requests with 2-factor authentication.

Basically, I want to make sure that this can't happen, and it will still ask for the root password if you try to su root or sudo su.\n\nA: Add \nDefaults rootpw\n\nto your sudoers file. This will have \"sudo\" ask for a \"root\" password and not the \"current user\" password. You can use a \"group\" to restrict this to that group.\nManual.

['31.25.89.27']\ndarya2.irandns.com.   ['31.25.89.27']  \nas far as I see from DNS. And I guess that's not your system?\nSo, if you want to configure your domain on your system (with your webmin) you have to delegate domain properly to your system - so DNS knows where to look for your domain's configuration. Now apparently it doesn't - hence it doesn't see your MX server.\nThen, if I didn't miss something looking briefly - you define your MX as mail.karshenasan-nezam.com, but you don't have type A record for mail.karshenasan-nezam.com.\nAnd also - if you're trying to run the mail server on your home broadband, even more - as virtual guest, you'll have to make sure that port 25 is properly forwarded from your public IP to your internal private IP (192.168.something.something) - (adsl and/or virtual switch of your hypervisor)\nI think that would be anyway a good start for you with investigating the issue.\n", "Q: Boot process stuck on Started Light Display Manager I installed bumblebee and TLP.

As Python is located in the main repository, we should first try to activate that repository (again) and update the package lists:\nsudo add-apt-repository main\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAs you got an invalid signature (BADSIG) error, we completely remove all package lists and re-download them. Also in case the error prevented it from working, we try to enable the main repository again.\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nsudo add-apt-repository main\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow the new apt-cache policy python output shows the correct version available from the server, so we can now force the downgrade of our package python to the required version:\nsudo apt-get install python=2.7.5-5ubuntu3\n\nWe then need to clean the locally cached wrong 3.5 version and just empty the entire package cache therefore:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nThen we let it try to upgrade all remaining packages and hope for the best:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nA: The basic steps are:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow that the package lists have been updated we can upgrade to the latest versions with the apt-get upgrade command:\nsudo apt-get -y upgrade\n\nOnce the packages have been upgraded, we can install Python 3.7. This is done with the apt-get install command:\nsudo apt-get install -y python3.7\n\nOnce the installation is complete, we confirm that it was successful by calling Python 3.7 and printing out the version number:\npython3.7 -V\n\n# expected output\nPython 3.7.3\n\nNow we have successfully completed the installation of Python. Since we want to work with other Python packages in the future, we can now install the package management program PIP. For this we execute the following command:\nsudo apt-get install -y python3-pip\n\nIn the following, we make sure that Python 3.7 is the latest python3 version. To achieve that we set a symbolic link to python3.\nsudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.7 /usr/bin/python3\n\nOnce PIP has been installed we have to update PIP. Unfortunately we have to do this manually although we have just installed PIP, cause the installed version is pretty old, so yes, this step is necessary:\npython3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n\nOnce the installation is complete we also confirm this by calling the version number of PIP:\npython3 -m pip -V\n\n# expected output\npip 19.2.1 from /home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)\n\nNow we are still testing if we can actually install libraries with PIP.

So, I have Ubuntu 14.04.2 and when I type the command \"sudo apt-get upgrade\", it upgrades my Ubuntu to 14.04.3. \nI don't want 14.04.3 because it has problems for me such as the infamous login loop and the Ubuntu Software Center saying \"Software can't be installed or removed because the authentication service is not available\" (But that's not the question that I'm looking for the answer). I had none of these problems with 14.04.2 and I had to reinstall it everytime I accidentally upgraded it to 14.04.3.\nI need to use the \"sudo apt-get upgrade\" command to upgrade complete the installation of Mesa-11.1.2 and other stuff but I don't want to upgrade my system to 14.04.3.\nSo, again, my question is, how do I block Ubuntu 14.04.2 from upgrading to 14.04.3 so that I can use the command \"sudo apt-get upgrade\" without upgrading to 14.04.3?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You could try doing it piece-meal by specifying after upgrade what program you want to upgrade:\nsudo apt-get upgrade yourprogram\n\nA: Ubuntu will automatically upgrade to a newer version once it becomes available (e.g. 14.04.2 -> 14.04.3) by 3 alternative ways.\n\n*\n\n*by upgrading normally (as anyone would do) through Update Manager\n\n\n*by running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade or sudo do-release-upgrade on a Terminal window\n\n\n*by running sudo apt-get upgrade, as you described above\nIn order to stop Ubuntu from upgrading to a newer release accidentally, you can do it in 3 ways:\n\n*\n\n*Whenever Update Manager prompts you to upgrade to a newer release, install ONLY the updates.\n\n\n*Avoid running any commands such as: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade or sudo do-release-upgrade / sudo do-release-upgrade -d.*\n(Note: The -d switch is for upgrading to an Ubuntu release which is under development.)\n\n\n*If you want to run sudo apt-get upgrade in order to upgrade a package, you should better consider using sudo apt-get install your-package . (This will not conflict with older/existing/installed versions of the package. I have tested it and it works very well.)\nFor example, if you want to upgrade Firefox 55 to Firefox 57 (Quantum), you should run the following command in a Terminal window: sudo apt-get install firefox .\nLeaving 14.04.3 aside, you can upgrade directly to 14.04.5, which is the latest point release of Trusty Tahr. It may ran slow on my PC (do not think that is is generally slow, my PC is slow), but it served me well for the 2-3 months that I was using it. It never had an issue.

I have resolved by logging in as root:\nsu root\n\nthen setting the dirty bytes to a set number (I guess the default setting 0 actually doesn't give any cap to how much should the writing cache be large), by typing:\necho $((16*2048*2048)) > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_bytes\necho $((48*2048*2048)) > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes\n\nI chose that size as a good compromise and the issue is now resolved.\n", "Q: I would like to unzip as different file name Ok i need to extract a zip archive named 'example.zip' but i would like to extract it as a different file name, not 'example' being my folder name, how could i extract a zip archive using unzip called 'example.zip' and extract it as the folder name 'examplefold'\n\nA: By default, unzip extracts the content of the archive directly into the current directory.\nYou can specify a different target directory where to extract the files using the -d option:\nunzip example.zip -d /path/to/wherever/you/want/the/archive/to/get/extracted\n\n\nOr if the archive itself contains a folder example which you want to extract to the current directory, but with a different name, you must manually rename it to examplefold afterwards:\nunzip example.zip && mv example examplefold\n\n\nA: Assume that you have some zip files with these names:\n2.zip, 25.zip, 45.zip, ..., 10352.zip\n\nAlso, in each zip file there is a folder which is called tmp. I will write a bash file (say zz.sh) with this content:\nfor zipName in 2 25 45 65 85 110 264 1000 10352\ndo        \n    unzip $zipName.zip\n    mv tmp tmp_$zipName \ndone\n\nThen run the file by:\nbash zz.sh\n\n", "Q: Setting up automated ubuntu 15.10 installation using preseed and USB The ubuntu documentation on preseeding is quite vague. I am struggling to load my preseed file which is located in the root directory of my usb drive. If any one can provide me tips, links or tutorials it'd be appreciated. I'm using Ubuntu Desktop 15.10 (Wily Werewolf). \n\nA: while looking around for the 15.10 preseed entries..happened to land up at \nhttps://github.com/RobertCNelson/netinstall/blob/master/lib/wily-preseed.cfg\nhope this helps..\nIn the process of testing the suggestions in above link...\n", "Q: (Ubuntu 15.10 64 Bit) Similar errors when running wine/steam/aapt - newline unexpected, expecting \")\" I'm getting some similar errors while running aapt from Android-Studio,\nRunning wine via playonlinux (haven't tried normal wine yet) or when trying to install steam. Perhaps with other programs as well, though I haven't tested them all.\nAfter a bit of googling I haven't found a viable solution.\nHere's an example from aapt in Android-Studio:\nAAPT err(Facade for 1508687752): /home/xxx/Android/Sdk/build-tools/23.0.2/aapt: 2: /home/xxx/Android/Sdk/build-tools/23.0.2/aapt: Syntax error: newline unexpected (expecting \")\")\n\nThe errors in wine and steam are similar, it's always syntax error and that it's expecting \")\" or that \"(\" is unexpected.\nI've also tested it with a script:\n#!/bin/bash\necho 'test'\narray=(1 2 3 4 5)\necho ${array[*]}\n\nwhich gives me the same error when running with sh.\nWhen I'm running it with bash or \"./\" it works fine.\nWhat's the cause of this problem and what can I do to fix it?\n\nA: Okay, so many people don't know this, but by default Ubuntu links /bin/sh to dash, not bash. You can check this with the following:\nls -l /bin/sh\n\nThe dash shell does not support arrays as bash does as explained here.\nYou can check what shell you currently have open with:\necho \"$SHELL\"\n\nThat said, it's very odd that pre-packaged programs would be encountering that error. I would expect them to already start with #!/bin/bash if they needed it.\nYou can edit the scripts in question to include #!/bin/bash at the top.\nIf a script does not have a \"shebang\" line (the #! and etc. at the top) then the current shell is the default for using ./ for execution. You can change your login shell with chsh followed by your password when prompted and /bin/bash when prompted. You will have to relog.\nIf that doesn't help, you could also change the symlink (this probably won't break anything, but YMMV):\nsudo rm /bin/sh\nsudo ln -s bash /bin/sh\n\n", "Q: My USB flash drive became completely bricked I turned my 16 GB USB stick into LiveUSB for Kali with dd.

It can't be mounted and when I try to format it again I get the warning:\n\nWhat am I supposed to do. Can it be rescued?\nEdit: I have created the Liveboot and tried to format the USB both within Ubuntu. The problem is related to ubuntu and I don't agree that it is off-topic.\n\nA: I have been able to solve the problem.\nI have tried to format it on Windows too but the problem persisted.

I was searching and trying some stuff but nothing has worked so far.\ntl;dr: How do I turn on the Caps Lock LED without enabling Caps Lock?\n\nA: You can get a list of all controllable LEDs by checking the content of the virtual directory /sys/class/leds:\n$ ls /sys/class/leds/\ninput5::capslock  input5::numlock  input5::scrolllock\n\nOn my system, there are only the three keyboard LEDs. If your output looks different, make sure you use the correct names instead below!\nEach file is a symbolic link to a directory holding several properties of that LED:\n$ ls '/sys/class/leds/input5::capslock'\nbrightness  device  max_brightness  power  subsystem  trigger  uevent\n\n\nThe only thing which is important for us is the brightness file content.\n\n\n*\n\n*0 means the LED is off.\n\n*1 means the LED is on. (Assuming the max_brightness file holds the value 1 - on special keyboards the LED might maybe support multiple brightness values?)\n\n\n\nWe get the current LED state by checking the brightness file's content (it's currently off):\n$ cat '/sys/class/leds/input5::capslock/brightness' \n0\n\nTo switch the LED on, we must set that file's content to 1:\n$ echo 1 | sudo tee '/sys/class/leds/input5::capslock/brightness'\n1\n\n\nTo switch the LED on during every boot, you might want to append the command below to your /etc/rc.local script. It will be executed as root, therefore we don't need the sudo tee but can use Bash output redirection:\n$ echo 1 > '/sys/class/leds/input5::capslock/brightness'\n\n", "Q: dolphin create service menu for all files I want to create my own service menu entry in dolphin, that will appear for all file/directory types.

Depending on the guest's state this will lead to issues or even data loss.\nFor some people the guest additions will take care of most, others can't hibernate a host at all when a guest is running.\nWe should therefore put the guest in savestate mode before we hibernate a host.\nPutting a guest to savestate can be done from the command line or a script.

I had an DELL Inspirion N-5030 which I used till yesterday. Today I purchased another Dell Inspirion 15 (3000 Series). The previous was installed with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and this laptop is installed with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The previous hard drive is encased as external HDD Now by Mistake I had a protected folder created by Ubuntu 14.04 in previous laptop. Currently while trying to open that particular folder, I am unable to get access into it. How can I retrieve that folder? Other folders are accessible till now.\n\nA: Check folder permissions with: \nls -l /folder/path | grep foldername\nResult will be like that:\ndrwx------\n\nFirst d is mean that this is a directory. rwx is mean access flags: \n\"r\" : read allows the user to list the directory contents;\n\"w\" : write allows the user to write, modify and delete files in this directory;\n\"x\" : executing allows the user to enter into this directory;\n\"-\" : flag is rest.\nThe first triple is relate to root, second to owner and third to other users.  To change access right you may use chmod utility. \nchmod XXX /path/to/folder\n\nwhere XXX determine wishful rights to set. \nFor make XXX you need to know that\n0 mean reset\n1 mean executing\n2 mean writing \n4 mean reading\nCalculate XXX is very simple. It's just an addition of required rights. For instance if you need read and write access you need calculate 2+4=6. If you need all access 1+2+4=7.\nSo, chmode 754 is mean that:\nroot (7) have accesss to all (1+2+5=7)\nowner (5) have access to execute and to read (1+4=5)\nother users (4) have access only to read\nOf cource, this utility must be executiong as root. So, use\nsudo chmod XXX /path/to/folder\n\n", "Q: Access a print queue on a Windows print server on a different network I'm running Ubuntu 15.10.

Here is a good guide: How to add a printer in gnome-shell\nI think I managed to solve my problem. In order to avoid storing the password in plain text in /etc/cups/printers.conf I need it to prompt me for my AD username and password every time I want to print something, which is what I want.\nAs far as I have figured out there are two important lines in /etc/cups/printers.conf that are relevant for my problem.\nAuthInfoRequired username,password\nDeviceURI smb://domain/print.mycompany.net/printqueue_ps\n\nI need the AuthInfoRequired line in order to be prompted for my username and password.\nIf I specify my AD username on the URI line then it will still ask me for my username and password but apparently just ignore what I type, resulting in a failed authentication. I originally figured that if I specify my username but not my password then I will only have to provide my password every time I want to print something. Apparently it does not work this way. It always defaults to my Ubuntu username and not my AD username. I have not figured out a way of fixing this.\nPlease note that you have to stop CUPS whenever you want to edit /etc/cups/printers.conf manually.\n$ sudo service cups stop\n$ sudo nano /etc/cups/printers.conf\n$ sudo service cups start\n\n", "Q: I need some basic help installing ubuntu dual boot windows 10 I'm facing some difficulties installing Ubuntu in dual-boot with 10.\nThis is my actual partition schematic:\n\nHow can I install Linux?\n\nA: There are a lot of ways to install Ubuntu along side windows.Please do a brief search on google for it.

During linux installation all of us are asked to install bootloader somewhere. For example we have following partitions:\nsda\n sda1\n sda2\n sda5\n\nFirst sector (512 bytes) is MBR with 446 bytes for boot loader. Second sector belongs to sda1 (first partition). BIOS loads bootloader located in MBR.\nSo if we install loader to sda the logic is simple: those 446 bytes is our loader (or part of loader which loads full loader from another place) and this loader offers us to load desirable OS.\nBut what does it mean to install loader to sdaX? \n\n\n*\n\n*The loader in MBR won't be updated (First 446 bytes of sda won't be touched)\n\n*Only part of loader would be installed to MBR (the parts which loads loader from sdaX MBR)\n\n\nA: First, your question is about BIOS-mode booting. This is on the way out. It's still relevant for many computers, but we're in a transitional period during which it's imperative that one not make assumptions about the boot mode. The up-and-coming boot method uses the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) or its version-2.x variant, Unified EFI (UEFI).\nSecond, the BIOS boot loader should really limit itself to the first 440 bytes of the MBR, not the first 446 bytes. Those extra six bytes are used as a serial number for the disk. Although I've heard some BIOS-mode boot loaders spread into that area, doing so is a bit dangerous, and you shouldn't try overwriting that area yourself (say, with dd to erase an unwanted boot loader), since some tools may rely on the serial number remaining unchanged.\nThird, /dev/sda1 does not normally begin on the second sector of the disk (although it could). Most partitioning tools today assign sector 2048 as the first sector of the first partition (which might or might not be /dev/sda1). In the past, sector 63 was used for this purpose, but the standard has shifted to 2048 because of changes in hard disk technology. The space between the MBR and the first sector allocated to a partition is officially unallocated/unused, but in reality it may be used....\nFinally, when you install GRUB to the MBR (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb, or whatever), its code actually goes in several places, including the MBR, the officially-unallocated space between the MBR and the first allocated sector, and files in /boot/grub (assuming an Ubuntu installation). When you install GRUB to the Partition Boot Record (PBR) of a partition (/dev/sda1, /dev/sdb3, or whatever), some of those locations change, and GRUB must then be launched by another boot loader that resides in the MBR. In the past, this type of configuration was common so as to leave the DOS/Windows boot loader in the MBR and manage the earliest stages of the boot process in the traditional DOS manner of setting a \"boot flag\" on the partition you want to boot. GRUB 2, however, prefers being installed to the MBR, so this is the most common way to do it today (on BIOS-based computers).\nAs noted earlier, none of this applies to EFI-mode booting, which is the more common way of booting newer computers. (Since Windows 8, most new computers have shipped configured to boot in EFI mode.) With EFI, boot loaders are ordinary files on the EFI System Partition (ESP). Boot code does not go in the MBR, in the PBR, or in unallocated space before your partitions. Information on what file to use as a boot loader goes in the computer's NVRAM, which can be manipulated (in Linux) with the efibootmgr utility.\n", "Q: Phone is recongized in Ubuntu but cannot be found in dev/sdb I have a LG v10 and when I plug it into Ubuntu 12.02, it is recognized and Ubuntu says it's mounted but when I run ls /dev/sd*, it's not listed.

(I can't uncheck the checkbox manually).\nI've also tryed (several times) to pick \"try ubuntu\" and get access to my files from there, so that I can back them up and then make a clean installation, but the only partitions I see when \"trying ubuntu\" are the 65gb (sda5) and OSDisk (sda1).  \nThat's it.\nSo, if any one can help me either getting access to my files or re-installing ubuntu without formatting the partition, I'd appreciate it a lot!!!!\n\nA: Your Ubuntu partition has been deleted. You may be able to recover it, but the problem is that Windows is hogging all four of your disk's primary partitions. (Side note: Based on the absence of an obvious EFI System Partition (ESP), I'm inferring that this is a BIOS-mode installation with a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table.) To fix the problem, you should first be aware of some risks and take some precautions.\nBasically, your Linux filesystems are probably intact in the unallocated section of the disk; however, any attempt to recover those filesystems runs a risk of accidentally overwriting at least some of the data. The best way to protect yourself from such an accident is to first back up the disk. To do this, you'll need a disk that's at least a little bit larger than your current one. Boot to an Ubuntu live image, mount the target disk, and then use dd to copy the original disk:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/lots/of/space/sda.img\n\nThis backs up /dev/sda to /path/to/lots/of/space/sda.img. (Note that it's conceivable that your current disk will become /dev/sdb or something else if you boot with a backup disk attached. Double-check this detail. Also, of course, you should adjust the of= value to point to wherever you've mounted your backup disk.) With a backup in place, you can try to recover your data from the original disk with greatly reduced risk -- if something goes badly wrong, you can restore the original by swapping the if= and of= parameters in dd.\nThe usual tool for recovering lost partitions is TestDisk. You can use it to see if it can find your Linux partitions. If so, TestDisk should be able to restore them; however, I'm not sure if it will be able to overcome the fact that Windows is now hogging all four of your primary partition slots. If TestDisk can't convert at least one partition from primary to logical form, you can do so with my FixParts program, which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu. Read the FixParts documentation to learn how to do this. Alternatively, you can delete one partition, if you can find one that's empty or that contains data of no value. Be aware that converting from primary to logical form can be risky because Windows will boot only from primary partitions, so if you convert the wrong partition from primary to logical form, you won't be able to boot Windows.\nIf TestDisk can't recover an entire partition, you may be able to recover individual files with PhotoRec. This process will be much more tedious, though. The last time I checked, PhotoRec didn't recover complete filenames or directory structures, so you'll spend a lot of time looking at files to figure out what they are and rename them appropriately.\nAs a side note, you're probably in this mess because you used logical partitions before, and Windows partitioning tools have long-standing bugs related to logical partitions, which frequently cause logical partitions to go missing or be damaged. This is one of the reasons I greatly prefer EFI-mode dual-boot installations, because they use GPT rather than MBR partitions, which don't cause so many problems.\n\nA: You should burn a clean ISO image of Ubuntu(i suggest LTS 14.04.3) via Universal USB Installer. Make sure secure boot is disables and Windows 10 fast start up and hibernation is turned off.\nThen finally install Ubuntu in the free space only(84.5 GB) \n\nA: Thanks a lot for all the help!!!\nSo, what I ended up doing is using FixParts (through ubuntu on a live usb) to convert the partition from primary to logical.\nAfter that I ran \"Boot repair disk\" from a live usb and ran the \"recommended repair\" which fixed my grub menu.\nVictory!!!!!\nThanks all!

The advantage of getting software from PPA is that you get automatic updates, which doesn't happen if you install from a Debian (.deb) package.\nAbout security, there isn't much difference between one method and another. If you install an X package through PPA using apt-get, what happens is basically the download of its .deb and its installation with dpkg.\nSo, overall, it's better to use PPA over manual installation, due to automatic updates.\n", "Q: how to merge 3gp audio files? Any software available for joining/merging multiple 3gp audio files in lubuntu? All available online softwares are for Windows/Mac only.\n\nA: OK, seems like command line programs are not an option for you.

With it you can merge, cut, record, apply effects and do hundreds of editions in audio files. It also supports video files (the audio is extracted) and has great integration with most desktop environments (including drag/drop). It also encodes/exports your projects stunningly fast (even in higher qualities).\nIt's available for Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.\nFortunately, Audacity is in Ubuntu's official repositories, so you can install it using the Software Center.

How can I force the correct resolution on that display without having to resort to something that will be lost after a reboot or that will most likely cause trouble with future updates?\n\nA: Generally it is recommended to use the NVIDIA drivers from the official Ubuntu repositories.\nBut when there are problems with these drivers, you can install the latest official NVIDIA drivers.\nThis often leads to properly working graphics - especially on very new hardware such as your GTX 960.  \nNVIDIA lately released the final long-lived branch drivers version 361.\nThese drivers already are available in the Proprietary GPU drivers PPA.\nRemove the currently installed drivers - open a terminal and execute :  \nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*  \nsudo reboot \n\nInstall the latest official stable drivers - open a terminal and execute :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-361\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: NVidia graphics driver cannot detect second monitor I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my ThinkPad W520 with a NVidia Quadro 1000M graphics card.

Can an infected USB infect my PC through sudo and/or home if it is under sudo (like cleaning it with sudo sgdisk --zap-all dev/sdb, sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb, or even looking/changing partitions through parted and/or gparted)? For example, a theoretically infected or md5sum-mismatched Linux pendrive with malicious boot code that would automatically execute under booting the live USB?\n\nA: Highly doubtful. Linux doesn't have autorun feature like Windows does, so whatever is on USB drive is just data - passivelly stored, without any ability to act. With Ubuntu , USB drives get mounted automatically through Unity desktop's dbus methods to /media/USERNAME folder, file permissions being assumed as the current user and that's it. \nThere is however something known as udev rules, which are frequently used as sort-of autorun feature, for instance to run a specific script once a usb device is connected. This has to be set on your system, so in other words  unless someone has tampered with your system first (either locally or remotely), there is no potential for malicious action from the USB itself.\n", "Q: Burning CD or DVD always fails at 100%.

I tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a user user1 inside the container\n\n*Edited pool/lxc/mycontainer/config and added:\nlxc.mount.entry = /pool/mydataset mnt/mydataset none rw,bind 0 0\n\nWhen I start the container the dataset is mounted, but ls -la /mnt/mydataset in the container shows nobody:nogroup instead of user1:user1, which means all files are read-only.\nAny idea how to get the correct permissions in the mounted directory?\n\nA: If indeed mycontainer is unprivileged, then its owner might not have access to the path /pool/mydataset. Users in unprivileged containers have their uid offset on the host by the container-owner uid, so user1 inside the container isn't the same as user1 on the host.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can check what user on the host owns the container with sudo ls -l /pool/lxc | grep mycontainer (sudo might not be required, depending on /pool/lxc's permissions, but ls should be safe enough to run as root either way. Going forward, omit sudo where desirable if permissions make that possible). For example, I get\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 100000 100000    5 Apr 22 11:37 mycontainer\n\nshowing that the uid and gid of the container's owner is 100000 (we see a uid instead of a name since the user doesn't exist on the host).\n\n*Test /pool/mydataset's permissions with sudo ls -l /pool | grep mydataset (or sudo ls -l /pool/mydataset for its contents).\nIf you want the files to be writable from within the container, you just have to make sure whichever user inside mycontainer you want to be able to write to /pool/mydataset has permissions to do so on the host. E.g., root on mycontainer has uid 100000 on host, and if user1 in mycontainer has uid 1001 (test with id user1 from within the container) then on the host its uid would be 101001.\n\nYou might do that by allowing everyone on the host to write to /pool/mydataset with\nsudo chmod -R o+w /pool/mydataset\n\n(note: this will add permissions recursively inside /pool/mydataset), or perhaps better to make sure users in group user1 have write permissions (set it recursively with sudo chmod -R g+w /pool/mydataset if not), then add the owner of the container to group user1 with\nsudo usermod -a -G user1 <username>\n\n(In my case above, we saw that no user on the host owns the container, so we should first create a user with uid and gid 100000 with\nadduser --no-create-home --uid 100000 --disabled-password --disabled-login <username>\n\nOf course, you might wish to give permissions only to user1 inside the container, so create a user with its host uid and add that to group user1 on host, e.g., 101001.)\nYou can also go nuclear and give ownership of /pool/mydataset to mycontainer's root with\nsudo chown -R 100000:100000 /pool/mydataset\n\nbut that could mess with other users on host accessing the data.\n\nOnce you've done that, the mount you set should allow write permissions inside mycontaier, as desired.\n", "Q: How to purge lightdm users list?

It seems like you have a bad memory module, the machine pauses just waiting for the hardware to correct this error by itself. You may need to try to remove or replace the memory at your first CPU, second channel and first slot. Please refer: https://serverfault.com/questions/569289/server-freezes-completely-in-unknown-condition\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Thank you for reminding me to finish this !\nIndeed, after looking at the lines, I noticed that:\nslot:0 was the problem.\nAssuming it was bad memory, I took it out (Slots are allocated by your motherboard, or at least in mine, slot zero was slot 1 of the mother board) \nThus I took it out, tested for 48 hours, and no errors appeared. \nSent the RAM to warranty, got a new one back. \nAll is perfect in wonderland ! \n", "Q: trying to dual boot ubuntu 15.10 with windows 10, new dell xps 9350 I just got a new dell laptop with win10 installed. I want to dual boot with ubuntu (have done that on a couple of desktop machines) but I'm running into a problem.\nI'm using this guide\nI am able to boot into the usb with the installation iso no problem, I select \"try ubuntu\" and that is all ok. \nI hit install ubuntu, and when I get to the 'installation type' section, the options are all blank. \nIn gparted, the only visible drive is the 8gb usb drive that contains the installation iso, the system drive is not visible. \nThe tutorial says I should be given the option of installing alongside windows and sizing the partition, but there is nothing available in that \"installation type\" dialog. \nUpdate\nstill having issues. I disabled fast startup and hibernate, here is my bios boot selection: \n(was not connected to network and unable to save screenshot)\n\nhere is the screen during my attempt to install ubuntu from the live usb iso\n\nand here is what shows in gparted (again from the live usb iso):\n\nI found this doc and have been going thru it. I was not able to determine how to disable the intel smart response technology. \nAlso, as per the tutorial in the link above, I shrunk the volume in disk management in win 10. So I now have a smaller windows partition and half the drive unallocated. Not sure if that is a problem or not.\nI also tried creating a usb installer from the 14.04.3 release, same result. Used the utility linked to in the answer below. Same result.\nDo the options shown here look ok as per the answers/comments below?\nother resources\n\n\n*\n\n*This Q on askubuntu discusses reinstalling windows in sata/ahci mode (my machine is a dell xps 9350)\n\n*Another tutorial on dual boot, specific to xps. Says to update bios (which I did) and to be connected to internet during install. Does not mention ahci\n\n*another askubuntu q with some links to resources\nfurther updates\nI changed the sata config mode to ahci, that allowed me to install ubuntu and boot into it, but I was not able to boot back into windows.\nI then downloaded a win10 iso, and did a clean install with the bios set to ahci. (had to download wifi driver)\nI then tried to install ubuntu. In gparted, I still only saw the usb drive, but during the ubuntu install I had the option to \"install alongside windows boot manager\". \nThe install process went forward ok, but when I went to restart, I just went straight to windows, there was no grub menu. \nthanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*Disable secure boot in BIOS.\n\n*Also make sure that you are installing Ubuntu in EFI mode as Windows\nis also installed in EFI mode.\n\n*Turn off hibernation and fast boot from Windows\n\n*Check your ISO image. If possible use Universal USB Installer as in this link\nWhen downloading Ubuntu - I will suggest go for LTS release - current one is 14.04.3 specifically Desktop - 64 bit(if your machine is 64 bit). Very soon(in April, we are going to get 16.04 LTS)\n\nA: Y'know, Windoze is SO slow at booting that, instead of actually killing the system and shutting down the computer, it enters an hibernation mode. This is the so-called \"fast boot\". When Windows is hibernating, basically nothing can be done to its partition, and that's probably the reason why the installation options are greyed out. You should disable Windows' fast boot first. \nUse the following link to do it (from inside Windows): \nhttp://www.windows10update.com/2015/05/windows-10-tutorials-66-how-to-enable-or-disable-fast-startup/\n", "Q: How can I read a HPFS/NTFS (Bootable) partition on Ubuntu (15.10)? I would like to read the contents of an old hard drive that is formatted as a HPFS/NTFS (Bootable) partition; I'm not sure if the bootable part makes a difference. I have tried to mount the drive but cannot. How can I read this drive?\nWhen using sudo fdisk -l, the drive shows up as:\n:~$ sudo fdisk -l\nDevice     Boot Start       End   Sectors   Size Id Type\n/dev/sdf1  *       63 488392064 488392002 232.9G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nAttempt using mount:\n:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdf1 /mnt/ntfs1\nmount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdf1,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail or so.\n\nAttempt using ntfs-3g;\n:~$ sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sdf1 /mnt/ntfs1\nNTFS signature is missing.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sdf1': Invalid argument\nThe device '/dev/sdf1' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS.\nMaybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a\npartition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?\n\nEdit:\nAttempt using mount -t exfat:\n:~$ sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sdf1 /mnt/ntfs1\nFUSE exfat 1.1.0\nERROR: exFAT file system is not found.\n\nfsck report:\n:~$ sudo fsck -f /dev/sdf1\nfsck from util-linux 2.26.2\ne2fsck 1.42.12 (29-Aug-2014)\next2fs_open2: Bad magic number in super-block\nfsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...\nfsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/sdf1\n\nThe superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4\nfilesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4\nfilesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock\nis corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:\n    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>\n or\n    e2fsck -b 32768 <device>\n\n\nA: To begin, NEVER run fsck on a partition when you don't know that doing so is the right course of action. The problem is that fsck is a repair tool, and as such, it's likely to write data to the disk. In your case, you applied it before you even knew what filesystem was in use on the disk. This is extremely dangerous, since the repair tool might have become confused and made matters worse rather than better. Such an outcome is unlikely, but possible. You probably did no harm, but there's a slim chance that you've done more damage to the disk by using fsck on it.\nTo learn what sort of filesystem is on the disk, use blkid, as in:\n$ sudo blkid /dev/sdb3\n/dev/sdb3: UUID=\"493344495F520D15\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\nOf course, your output is likely to be different, but this example does show an NTFS volume. If you get no output whatsoever, that means that blkid couldn't identify the filesystem, which in turn means that it's very badly damaged. If there is output but TYPE= shows something other than ntfs, then that means that it's not an NTFS volume. Maybe the output will be obvious and you can proceed from there, or maybe you'll need to post back with details for more advice.\nWith the filesystem known, you can use filesystem-specific mount tools, and possibly repair tools. You've already tried mounting with the likely tools (NTFS and exFAT). The type code for the partition (0x07) was once commonly used for HPFS, but that would be likely only if the disk had been used with OS/2, and you say it was used with Windows 7.\nBefore using potentially destructive repair tools, it's wise to do a low-level backup, as in:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdf1 of=/path/to/lots/of/space/sdf1.img\n\nThis command backs up /dev/sdf1 to the file sdf1.img in /path/to/lots/of/space/. Be sure that there's enough free space to hold the entire partition -- about 233 GiB in your case. Making this backup will give you a way to recover if a repair tool makes matters worse, as does sometimes happen.\nMy hunch is that the disk uses NTFS but that it's damaged and/or was not properly shut down. If so, you must first repair it with Windows tools. The Linux ntfsfix utility is poorly-named; it does only the most minimal checks and then flags the disk as needing attention in Windows. There is no Linux support for NTFS in fsck, so you should not try to use fsck on an NTFS volume.\nIt's also conceivable that there's something more exotic going on. For instance, the disk might have been used in a RAID array, in which case you might not be able to recover anything without the other disk(s) from the same array. (Specifics would depend on the type of RAID used and other details.)\nIn a worst-case scenario, you may be able to use PhotoRec to recover individual files.\nOne more point: In your comments, you said you ran GParted on /dev/sdf1. This is useless -- and even potentially dangerous. /dev/sdf1 is the partition, but GParted is meant to be used on the whole disk -- that is, /dev/sdf.\n\nA: In my case, this issue was resolved using dislocker as I had a windows 10 bitlocker locked hard drive.\n", "Q: Lenova Thinkpad power button does nothing I have installed Ubuntu on many computers, both desktop and laptop, and the power button opens the power menu asking what to do.

In order to do that, I did this:\nI opened CMD and then put: bcdboot C:\\Windows in it.\nNow, the problem I'm facing is that Windows 10 directly loads up when I start my PC, no GRUB or Windows bootloader :(\nHow to fix this?\nPS: I use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: at first install the free software 'EasyBCD' (current version is 2.2) in your windows 10 system. Then run it. In EasyBCD, click on \"Add New Entry\" and select \"Linux/BSD\" and change the type to \"GRUB 2\" and name it \"Ubuntu\". And then Click on \"Add Entry\". Go to \"Edit Boot Menu\" and click on \"Save settings\". And then you are good to go. You can also change the order of boot menu during power up from the \"Edit Boot Menu\" option.\n\n\nA: This usually happens when you install windows on a machines with Ubuntu as Windows replaces the GRUB with it's own boot-loader. And by running bcdboot you have done the same. You need to update GRUB in order to get back to Ubuntu. Then you'll be able to use both Windows ans Ubuntu from GRUB.

Attempting to change your Windows installation from MBR to GPT is looking for unnecessary head aches.  I have Win10 machines and everyone of them Windows installed in Bios/legacy mode, all 4 machines were Windows 7 upgrade to Windows 10 installs.

I am looking for a native Evernote client for Linux. NixNote not meet my expectations. I heard about a new application, which is normally installed on Ubuntu Touch. It is called the \"Notes\" before \"Reminders\".\nAfter installing from software center of Ubuntu, click on the application icon does not start (notes-app), in the case of reminders app white window opens.. I tried to use the \"notes-app, reminders-app\" in the terminal, flashed the message \"command not found\".\nHence my question. Can I use this app in Ubuntu 15.10 or just on Ubuntu Touch?\nI wanted to test it in terms of usability, m.in creating indexes notes. I often use this feature. I'm thinking of buying the expected tablet software ubuntu, which convinced me the ability to connect to the monitor (portable pocket desktop fluid and responsive).\nI often work with electronic notebook and the possibility of using the tablet on the big screen and the computer next to my dream. Now I use an old laptop with Windows on board - only for Evernote.\n\nA: Where does the app run?\nYour question whether this app can be used on Ubuntu 15.10 or just on Ubuntu Touch can be answered with the fact that in general it can run on both the desktop version and the tablet version, and on Ubuntu 15.04 the app works just fine (I ran the app today on 15.04) and on my bq Aquaris (which should be running Ubuntu Touch 15.04) it is running to.\nHowever, on Ubuntu 15.10 it crashes and on launchpad there is a bug report for notes-app describing the problem of not being able to launch the app on desktop.\nGeneralization\nIn general however, Ubuntu Touch apps can be run on the desktop, if one has the required libraries of Ubuntu Touch installed, which should be possible in most cases.\nLaunching using an terminal\nYou said that you tried to start the app in the terminal, however that you failed. The reason is that the apps are a set of QML and similiar files, not typical compiled elf binaries, which must be interpreted by an compatible program. To run the app in terminal, you can either use gtk-launch which launches the application using its *.desktop files. The commands for the apps you named would be\n$ gtk-launch com.ubuntu.reminders\n$ gtk-launch notes-app\n\nor you can directly use the interpreter qmlscene, e.g.\n$ qmlscene /usr/share/notes-app/NotesApp.qml\n\n\nI hope I could help you with this answer, and that the answer is acceptable. Sadly I don't know a simple solution to your problem, nor do I use the the apps much, so I can't help much.\n", "Q: Can't Edit Music Metadata On Samba Share I have a music library shared over samba.

The only thing I can think of is that the id3 tagging programs used by Clementine, EasyTag, etc. aren't properly handling the path to file string\n/run/user/1001/gvfs/smb-share:server=myserver,share=music%20on%20myserver/Artist Name/[1997] Album Title/02 Song Name.mp3\nI know when I tried to open up one of the samba share folders with pyRenamer it tells me the directory is invalid.\n\nUpdate:\nPerhaps some progress.\nI installed id3 and attempted to modify a tag using the command line, I haven't been able to come up with any useful diagnostics from the other programs as of yet.\n[20:25]myuser@mydesktop:~\n$ cd /run/user/1001/gvfs/smb-share:server=myserver,share=music%20on%20myserver/Artist Name/[1993] Album Name/\n\n[20:27]myuser@mydesktop:/run/user/1001/gvfs/smb-share:server=myserver,share=music%20on%20myserver/Artist Name/[1993] Album Name\n$ id3 -l 01\\ Song\\ Name.mp3 \n01 Song Name.mp3:\nTitle  : Song Name                       Artist: Artist Name                   \nAlbum  : Album Name                      Year:     , Genre: Rock (17)\nComment:                                 Track: 1\n\n[20:27]myuser@mydesktop:/run/user/1001/gvfs/smb-share:server=myserver,share=music%20on%20myserver/Artist Name/[1993] Album Name\n$ id3 -y \"1993\" 01\\ Song\\ Name.mp3 \nid3: fopen: 01 Song Name.mp3: Operation not supported\n\nSo the question has become, why isn't fopen supported on the shared files?\n\nA: I haven't exactly found an answer but did come up with a workaround.\nPreviously I wasn't mounting the Samba shares on startup, I had browsed to those shares through Nautilus via 'Connect to Server'. After connecting to them once I bookmarked the locations and mounted them by opening Nautilus and clicking on the bookmark. This would automatically mount the share to /run/user/1001/.....\nI liked that solution because it meant I wasn't auto-mounting shares that I wasn't planning on accessing.\nI was however able to edit the meta-tags after remounting the share to more of a normal path.\nsudo mount -t cifs -o user=mediamanager //myserver/music\\ on\\ myserver /home/myuser/Music/Music\\ on\\ Myserver\nMy guess is that the id3 tag editing tools weren't able to handle the path name /run/user/1001/gvfs/smb-share:server=myserver,share=music%20on%20myserver/ but I'm not certain. As I've shown above, even when I manually navigated to a folder containing mp3's id3 failed, I'm not sure the path should have any effect there.\nFor now it appears that if I want to edit any meta-tags I will have to either manually mount the shares when I need to or have them auto-mounted via fstab.\n", "Q: how can i convert a .jar to ubuntu-freindly code? i am trying to figure out how to convert a .jar minecraft file into Ubuntu-friendly. the problem is, that Ubuntu does not recognize java.\n\nA: First, add the Java repository:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen, install the Java runtime:\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nOnce that's done, make sure that Minecraft has the permissions to launch:\nchmod +x Minecraft.jar\n\nThen, launch Minecraft like so:\njava -jar Minecraft.jar\n\nFrom this point on, you should also just be able to double-click on the Jarfile.\n(src)\n\nA: You hava to install Java JDK or Java JRE.

I just wiped my hard drive and installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu! I got it all warm and cozy, but then I found out about how my microphone did not work in Ubuntu when I have my headphones plugged in, and my dreams were crushed... Anyway, here is my problem, my headset microphone is broken and has been for a while, but I need my microphone for skype. I cannot use my speakers with skype because I live in a house with other humans, and I am not so great with the whole \"hearing thing\". I need to use my internal microphone along with my headphones, but PulseAudio wont have it... I do I get PulseAudio to allow me to use my Internal microphone with my headphones?    TLDR: internal microphone and headset wont work together because PulseAudio requires that the headset works exclusively with the broken microphone on the headset. How do I get PulseAudio to accept and strengthen the friendship between my internal laptop microphone and my headset?\n\nA: Install PulseAudio Volume Control from Ubuntu Software Center, which has a lot of options to choose from.\nAfter installing, in application's \"Output Devices\" tab choose your headphones and in \"Input Devices\" tab choose internal microphone. By pressing green button you can choose which device will always remain as default (device which is not selected will be default, not the opposite)\nYou can also choose settings per specific application, start Skype call and go to \"Recording\" tab where you can select internal microphone and in \"Playback\" you can select headphones.\nAdditional option is to choose suitable profile in \"Configuration\" tab.\n", "Q: Steam not working in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS i386 Steam doesn't seem to work on my Ubuntu 14.04\nI installed steam using sudo apt-get install steam\nand open it using steam\nHere's the log:\nryzokuken@ubuntu:~$ steam\nILocalize::AddFile() failed to load file \"public/steambootstrapper_english.txt\".\n[2016-02-16 01:37:02] Startup - updater built Nov 25 2013 18:07:05\nLooks like steam didn't shutdown cleanly, scheduling immediate update check\n[2016-02-16 01:37:03] Checking for update on startup\n[2016-02-16 01:37:03] Checking for available update...\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Download failed: http error 0\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file tenfoot_misc_all.zip.b9c015520018655499338cfc2c3a3159e28bbe14 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file tenfoot_dicts_all.zip.c74a3a9beb77a280cfd8761b901a80ed0f6a3173 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file tenfoot_fonts_all.zip.505590f6014431a95a9750073e466372f3e98d88 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file tenfoot_ambientsounds_all.zip.20ccff954777943069dd2c57576216f5f1db7389 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file tenfoot_sounds_all.zip.843f5376c132f306d1b21dc564b3fe2057104e24 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file tenfoot_images_all.zip.1784c1309339550c71fd577c7db309892a675074 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file tenfoot_all.zip.a4dc0ed3ca1a4d603fb6913907df318eb957273d missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file resources_misc_all.zip.6b98785251045457e56ce493e4974efc336c1912 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file resources_all.zip.d4f565b83152b9018d059896aaf8525cdbdb5964 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file strings_en_all.zip.9dc3fdb2c7b61fc8754b4635077f35e3a3611e94 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file strings_all.zip.6312352791737e2e929a9eb23ab39fb078be39ae missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file remoteui_all.zip.ba22fb168ed139d9979cdd1cefbd911e3ed3529c missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file public_all.zip.903c1663eeeea9339119d1dd349be100198a0582 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file bins_ubuntu12.zip.506ba970ef5abb73af12c47455906cf793827131 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file bins_pub_ubuntu12.zip.ebcdfc2a165395d488ef60caf3c3077f3901e777 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file bins_sdk_ubuntu12.zip.c6fb0b1fa5ce3f1576e5d426db4f652913eb1794 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file bins_codecs_ubuntu12.zip.97633922c0d11a1cdd9a059924187deff71bddd6 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file bins_misc_ubuntu12.zip.09a87cc6ade2e51d6d2bd73d51368ab20abedbd5 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file webkit_ubuntu12.zip.b8914fd00cec2e3adea3f015777a740b431baa56 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file miles_ubuntu12.zip.58ed79e82eff221812f19312c287218e60573807 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file sdl2_ubuntu12.zip.89ec28c977e24ebab035610b0f6d119bf3e5ff0d missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file steam_ubuntu12.zip.8745630cc886d5834e6228ad60aea0d095eaaea5 missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file runtime_part0_ubuntu12.zip.c29ba2cbbfa2ca89bd12b96bd7bd31c07c1314ec missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Package file runtime_part1_ubuntu12.zip.bbf1802326f84fbf05f4b8983b7ea6d091aad63c missing or incorrect size\n[2016-02-16 01:41:18] Downloading update (0 of 307,302 KB)...\n[2016-02-16 01:45:33] Error: Download of package (tenfoot_misc_all) failed after 0 bytes (0).\n\nI have had similar problems in all my earlier installations.

Hopefully, it may be helpful to someone else later on.\nSo what I figured out was that one of the PPAs has broken my graphics drivers and thus Unity couldn't function. Basically, I have carelessly enabled too many PPAs and thus couldn't figure out what was the culprit. I spent a lot of time uninstalling and then installing Xserver, lightdm, various desktop environments and everything else I figured could be related to the problem so it was pretty clear that there was an underlying problem with the graphics driver. Funnily enough, Openbox did work but I guess it's because it's such a minimalistic DE. \nIn the end I opted to reinstall Ubuntu whilst keeping my /home folder intact. This was a pretty easy solution and I wish I had done this after the first 1-2 hours of digging inside Ubuntu since it's relatively effortless. For people that wish to go the same route, make sure you use the same username and password for your new account as you did with your old one and mount your old home partition as /home without formatting it. \n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 14.04 on a USB drive I tried to install Ubuntu 14.04 on a USB drive using Startup Disk Creator, but I get this error message:\nAn uncaught exception was raised:\nE:Syntax error /etc/apt/apt.conf:4: Extra junk at end of file\n\nWhat does it mean?

Monitor mode is a Wi-Fi concept that doesn't apply to wired networks.\n\nso that i can capture wired traffic too on wireshark?\n\nOn a wired network, if you want to capture traffic that's not being sent to or from your machine, you need to put the adapter into promiscuous mode; Wireshark (and tcpdump) default to doing so, so you'd have to do something special not to put the adapter into promiscuous mode.\nHowever, most Ethernet networks are switched, and, on a switched Ethernet,  it's not sufficient to turn on promiscuous mode; you also have to arrange that the switch send you other hosts' traffic.\n\nA: Very tough  , untill u do something with ur ehernet cable and router to listen to the air packets broadcasted by access point/another router in range , the conept of monitor mode seems to be compatible with the case where your nic is capable of listening to all broadcasting of destination Mac address ND its associated packet. Basically ,  ur router seems to be handling a private network of URS.. if you want to listen to the packets broadcasted for a Mac addresses under ur own private network via Ethernet cable , then , it would only be possible , if ur own machine nic could be set to monitoring mode ...so when ur router broadcast data to ur local private network , ur machine could consume that , but hold on  ... The packet will be consumed already ND forward ing of braodcast could be stopped ,if another machine before you  is an expected reliever of that packet as it's mac match with packet Mac ,  on wifi side , the router throws the packet in the air , ND devices that come into the range of that packet could recieve it considering the device nic should be developed with intention of listening to monitor mode of each packet broadcasted and for connected wires , router does not need to throw packets in the air , as recieve is connected to router via Ethernet cable ...so router sends that data in wired direction devices\n", "Q: Can't use terminal any more after editing bashrc file Last time when I added JAVA_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/open-jdk\" (java path could be different)\nsource /etc/environment (and this too ) at the end of bashrc file. when i saved and exited, Terminal keeps asking for password all the time , though I am putting correct password ..

One irritation is no sound for system events, although sound works for iPlayer/YouTube or stand-alone files through e.g. VLC. I am very new to Ubuntu so not sure how to diagnose problems, although I have been messing with computers since the mid seventies. \nI have found various threads on the web but none of the solutions seem to work. My sound is via HDMI using a Radeon HD 5400/6300 series card on an HP desktop PC. I have PulseAudio Volume Control installed. Under 'Playback' system sounds are set to 140% and mute is off.\nI don't know if this is a clue, but I noticed when I click the desktop speaker symbol and go to 'Sound Settings...' then 'Test Sound' then click the 'Test' buttons (in my case Front Left and Front Right) the initial part of the sound is missing on the first click, but then it works Ok for both buttons. If I leave it for 10s or so then try again, the sound is clipped again. For example the first time I press the 'Front Right' button, all I hear is \".......ight\". I suspect this behaviour could be the cause of the problem since system sounds usually tend to be fairly short. Also, in Thunderbird if I click Play to test the new message sound, nothing is heard for the first press but subsequent presses work - until there is another delay.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Well, after 2 weeks of trying countless suggestions on various forums I only succeeded in making it worse - losing all sound and the speaker icon off the top bar. Finally, on the point of reinstalling Ubuntu from scratch, I tried \nsudo apt-get install unity\nIt didn't appear to do anything, at least according to the terminal response, but as if by magic, all my sound problems were solved. I now get system event sounds without the first bit being cut off, sound from YouTube, audio players etc. (all via HDMI). Hope this helps some other poor desperate soul.\n", "Q: Is it possible to recover data stored on hard drive with windows with ubuntu live? Like in the topic of this post - my boss turned off his PC (quite an old one, based on a Pentium 4, 32 bit) while Windows XP was performing a system update. And of course Windows lost some important files. Now the computer is not starting any more (after Windows XP loading screen, it goes dark and nothing is happening). So, as an Ubuntu and Debian user, I have an idea - I could make a USB stick with a 32 bit version of Ubuntu 15. I could then boot into the Live install version.\nWill I have an access to hard drive on this PC? \nThe reason is that there is a folder with all of the invoices and other quite important documents. \nThank you in advance AskUbuntu!\nBest wishes, Raph.\n\nA: You can recover your data using Ubuntu live. Follow these steps :\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu live.\n\n*Mount the partition that contains the files to be recovered.\n\n*Copy the files to any other external storage.\n\n\nIt is possible and I have tried it for myself.\n\nA: You may find it easier to simply mount the drive in another Windows computer, where it will appear as Drive E: (or whatever).  Even if the system files are corrupted, preventing Windows from booting, there's no reason to suppose data files are also.   An adapter, with various types of hard drive connector leading to a USB plug is cheaply available, and should be part of every computer trouble-shooter's toolkit.\nAlternatively, use an XP installation disk to boot into Recovery Console, and try the routine steps to repair Windows.\nIf at all in doubt, take this job to someone more expert. You can do harm.\nIf you are your boss's computer adviser, why on earth didn't you make sure he ran regular backups?\n\nA: Yes.\nWindows uses NTFS as the default filesystem. Ubuntu uses ext4, but has native support for a wide variety of other filesystems, including NTFS (with the ntfs-3g driver).\nWhen you run Ubuntu from a Live media you'll be able to access Windows' drives from the file manager, using the left \"devices\" bar.\nBut considering the specs of your boss's computer, you'd have way better performance at recovering the files by using a less resource consuming Ubuntu flavor, such as Lubuntu or Xubuntu. Since it's a simple recovering job, I'd recommend Lubuntu for its smaller size.\n", "Q: How can I connect to wireless printer Epson XP-225? I'm trying to set up a Wi-Fi printer Epson XP-225. I've gone to system settings (unity-control-center), selected \"Printers\", then \"Add\" and then \"Network Printer\". I don't see the printer listed there and when I select \"Find Network Printer\", I am asked to enter the host, but I have no idea what to enter here.\nI have installed the Linux driver provided by Epson (http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/du/02/DriverDownloadInfo.do?LG2=EN&CN2=&DSCMI=43353&DSCCHK=9f26e5cbd41612f9e38f91537c63c82d18c401e9).\nWhat should I do? I'm quite lost.\n\nA: A printer that attaches wirelessly is given an IP address by the router. Check your own Ubuntu machine from the terminal:\nifconfig\n\nYou will see the IP address your own computer has on the network. It may be, as an example, 192.168.0.15. Likewise, your printer has a different IP address of its own. You can find the address by pressing the 'network status' button on the printer. This is explained on page 14 here: http://content.etilize.com/User-Manual/1028142396.pdf\nA network status page will be printed that will give you, among other things, the needed IP address.\nThen add a network printer as before and use the Device URI of: ipp://192.168.0.11:631/lpr but substitute the IP address you found from the printer for my example 192.168.0.11. The port number, 631, needs to be specified as that is the port number that the CUPS printing system uses. \nThen you can go forward with the configuration, select the make, model and driver and print a test page.\n\nA: I managed to get it work just installing drivers (they gave couple errors though as I am running 16.04 and some newer softwares), installing scanner program from Ubuntu´s Applications and last editing following SANE file through terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/sane.d/epson.conf\nAnd I did add there my printers static ip settings (autodiscovery in case that you use DHCP on your router):\nnet 192.168.2.2 (Check yours from the printer)\nnet autodiscovery\nI had also epson2.conf file and you may want to edit that too if not working or just to be sure. Just add the same line(s).\n\"SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) is the linux way of scanning. sane supports a great many scanners, and the community around SANE adds support for more scanners all the time. By and large, most supported scanners are plug and play simple (plug them in and your ready to scan). However, some scanners will require manual installation.\"\n\nA: *\n\n*Uninstall existing xp225 printer.\n\n*Re-install and when you get the option \"connect by wifi or usb. \n\n*Select wifi.\n\n\nIt asks to insert usb cable this enables you to connect to the printer.  It then searches for the router.\nSelect your router. Then it asks you for the wep code or password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert wep code or password then it does sync up.\n\n\nJust follow the remainder of the install & asks to remove usb cable.  I had the same problem as many users but this does work.\nBonus when set up was complete, I plugged usb cable in and it worked fine to my pc. Best of luck.  \n", "Q: Cannot open mailbox /var/mail/: Permission denied Why can't I read mail with the mail command?  \n(There's almost certainly a problem with the mail-stack-delivery configuration, either postfix or dovecot, or both, but I should still be able to at least read that there's no mail from the CLI.)\nthufir@mordor:~$ \nthufir@mordor:~$ ls -l /var/mail\ntotal 0\nthufir@mordor:~$ \n\nmuch extraneous detail to follow:\nthufir@mordor:~$ \nthufir@mordor:~$ swaks --to thufir@localhost\n=== Trying localhost:25...\n=== Connected to localhost.\n<-  220 mordor.bounceme.net ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)\n -> EHLO mordor.bounceme.net\n<-  250-mordor.bounceme.net\n<-  250-PIPELINING\n<-  250-SIZE 10240000\n<-  250-VRFY\n<-  250-ETRN\n<-  250-STARTTLS\n<-  250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES\n<-  250-8BITMIME\n<-  250 DSN\n -> MAIL FROM:<thufir@mordor.bounceme.net>\n<-  250 2.1.0 Ok\n -> RCPT TO:<thufir@localhost>\n<-  250 2.1.5 Ok\n -> DATA\n<-  354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>\n -> Date: Tue, 16 Feb 2016 05:01:02 -0800\n -> To: thufir@localhost\n -> From: thufir@mordor.bounceme.net\n -> Subject: test Tue, 16 Feb 2016 05:01:02 -0800\n -> X-Mailer: swaks v20130209.0 jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/\n -> \n -> This is a test mailing\n -> \n -> .\n<-  250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 305E2540242\n -> QUIT\n<-  221 2.0.0 Bye\n=== Connection closed with remote host.\nthufir@mordor:~$ \nthufir@mordor:~$ mail\nCannot open mailbox /var/mail/thufir: Permission denied\nNo mail for thufir\nthufir@mordor:~$ \nthufir@mordor:~$ ll /var/mail/\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 root mail 4096 Oct 21 08:49 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 13 root root 4096 Oct 21 09:07 ../\nthufir@mordor:~$ \nthufir@mordor:~$ sudo apt-get install mailutils\nReading package lists...

If you could show us, that would go some distance to let is know which it is in this case.\nThat's not to say that there aren't cases where a command really is too long, it's just really rare in practice, certainly when copying and pasting! If you are hitting this wall, look at xargs per Eduard's answer.\nIf it's one command with added newlines, remove the newlines.\nFormatting on the internet isn't always perfect. Some websites (and authors) use poor tags for code and that can mean that some things get split onto multiple lines, breaking them. A simple example is running ls on two directories getting truncated:\nls a_really_long_directory_name\nanother_really_long_directory_name\n\nThe simple answer here is just removing that newline:\nls a_really_long_directory_name another_really_long_directory_name\n\nBut you can also escape the newline with a backslash as the last character on the line:\nls a_really_long_directory_name \\\nanother_really_long_directory_name\n\nIf it's multiple commands that you want to run all together, not as you paste, bung them in a script and run that when you're ready.\nIf \"the command\" actually looks like:\nls a_really_long_directory_name\nls another_really_long_directory_name\n\nThat's two commands. When you paste them in each newline character is going to force that line to run. That's how most shells work in Ubuntu. If you want to bunch them together you can paste them into a file (let's call it myscript) and then tell bash to run those commands:\nbash myscript\n\nYou don't have to mess around with crunchbangs and execute permissions, you just tell bash which file to open and run. You can do those things if you want to but they aren't necessary here.\n\nA: The length limit is rather long, you can check it with:\nxargs --show-limits\n\n(see What is the maximum length of command line arguments in gnome-terminal?)\nSo there are probably new lines between the comments. You can check it by first pasting it into gedit and make sure it has only one line, then you can paste it in the terminal use Ctrl+Shift+V \n", "Q: How to quickly access shared files in Ubuntu 14.04 from Windows XP in VirtualBox? In my PC, running on Ubuntu 14.04, I have installed VirtualBox, and then Windows XP SP3 in it as the guest. I have also installed Guest Addition, mainly for accessing files in any of the several partitions in my HDD from the Windows, and I have been successfully doing so. The snag, however, is that my method for doing this seems way too roundabout (Windows Explorer>My Network Places>Entire Network>\\VBOXSVR...etc). So my questions are two:\n    1. Can anyone suggest a quicker way?   2. And,paradoxically, the shared folder cannot be accessed by going directly to My Network Places but only via Windows Explorer. Why?\n\nA: Windows sometimes doesn't see other machines, something to do with NetBIOS broadcasts?!. it should always be available through direct \\\\IP_ADDRESS in explorer (note the 2 backslashes). You can also access it using the PC name \\\\VBOXSVR.\nThis info here is windows 7 but its the same process, Just add the required shared network path as a Network drive so you can just access it with a drive letter in future.\nI think it also helps if both machines are set to the same Workgroup name.\n", "Q: Execute commands on a remote servers by 2 scripts Currently I am using SSHPass in a script to connect to a remote server:\nsshpass -p PASSWORD ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no USERNAME@1.1.1.1\n\nand to execute any command remotely, I use:\nsshpass -p PASSWORD ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no USERNAME@1.1.1.1 \"COMMAND\"\n\nI am planning to separate the connection step in one script (conn.sh) and the commands in another (cmd.sh).\nI tried this way:\ncmd.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nls -ltr\n\nconn.sh:\n#!/bin/bash    \nsshpass -p PASSWORD ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no USERNAME@1.1.1.1 \"$1\"\n\nAnd execution after giving both scripts \"chmod a+x\":\n./conn.sh cmd.sh\n\nBut it gave me error:\ncmd.sh: command not found\n\nI even tried to replace $1 with the path to cmd.sh, but it gave me this error:\nsh: /home/myhome/cmd.sh: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: The reason it fails is that when you run something like\nssh user@remote command\n\nThe command is not only run on the remote machine, it is also searched for on the remote machine. Therefore, when you run ./conn.sh cmd.sh, you are connecting to the remote and then you are trying to run a script called cmd.sh on the remote. Since there is no such script (it's stored on your local machine), the execution fails and you see that error. \nYou can do what you describe by changing your conn.sh to:\n#!/bin/bash\nsshpass -p PASSWORD ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no USERNAME@1.1.1.1 \\\n bash -s < \"$1\"\n\nAnd then run\n./conn.sh /local/path/to/cmd.sh\n\nThat will open a bash shell on the remote machine. The -s tells bash to read commands from standard input and the < \"$1\" provides the 1st argument given to conn.sh as the input to that bash shell. \nAre you sure you need to do this though? What you describe is almost certainly an XY problem. The simple solution is to create the cmd.sh on the remote server. Then you can do\n./conn.sh /remote/path/to/cmd.sh\n\n", "Q: Reboot command is not working as expected in Ubuntu 14.04.3 I have a fully working EFI dual-boot of Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04.3 in that I can select either Ubuntu or Windows from my grub menu and that OS boots correctly.\nHowever, on my Ubuntu install when I use sudo reboot or otherwise issue a restart command it does not return to the UEFI BIOS or GRUB menus.

My disk is running for a couple of months, so it should have finished indexing. I do not see any frequent additions in the log files. The disk seems to be in order according to the disk utility. The hard disk also passed a forced check of partition. fsck of the partition revealed that it is mounted, but e2fsck could not continue.\nDo you have any ideas how to solve this?\n\nA: kworker is no big deal, jbd2 might be a debug log running (some app is set to debug), jbd2 may be MB size writes. kworker stands for \"kernel worker\", but again it is generally very minimal activity.

If I create an SSH key pair, will I only be able to login through a client machine that has the public key? For example, if I wanted to use a computer at the library or a friend's machine would I be able to?\nPart 2:\nIs it possible to enable password authentication and a SSH key but only use one to login? Will this defeat the purpose of having a key?\n\nA: It depends on how you configure your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. If you still allow logins with just password authentication, you won't need the keys on every computer you want to log in with.\nThe following line in that file will stop any regular password logins:\nPasswordAuthentication  no\n\nThis line is set to yes by default.\nYou can create an ssh key-pair with no associated passphrase (leave blank in the generation process), then the username supplying the correct public key will be able to log in with no password, but your password logins will still work.\nYou're not defeating the purpose of having a key by allowing password login, but you are leaving more options for an attacker, such as brute-forcing your password. If you use a strong password, and a non-standard username (not root, admin or user), you will lessen this risk.\nI'm a big fan of not having port 22 open on the router which your PC sits behind, but port forwarding or NAT-ing a non-standard port to your PCs ssh port.

You will need to import the openssh keys to PuTTY keygen.\nhttp://www.putty.org/\nYou can access ssh without keys (password, kerberos, host based auth) as an alternate.\nSo if you are using keys, ssh will attempt to use a key first. If a key is not available it will fall back to password authentication unless you have disabled password authentication in sshd_config.\nIf you make a key, you can still log in with passwords or any other method.\nlog in is configured via sshd_config - See man sshd - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring\n", "Q: INSTALLATION _ PARTITIONING IN UBUNTU I have windows 7 ultimate in my laptop.

Since I have configured Empathy, I have a new icon shown in the indicator icon bar. This icon remains visible even if I close Empathy. \nHow can I have this icon disappear when not using Empathy?\n\n\nA: Inspired by cl-netbox' answer, you can automatically remove the icon after empathy closes. This can be done by running (starting) empathy through a wrapper script. As far as I can see, this has no downside. The only possible downside would be that the right- click option to open with does not work, but that does not apply to empathy.\nThe wrapper would only run during, and only as long as, empathy is running, waiting for it to close, so the solution is very specific.\nWhat it does\n\n\n*\n\n*When empathy is run (through the wrapper), a small script is started, doing two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*look (check) for the empathy indicator to be visible, by the command:\ngsettings get com.canonical.indicator.messages applications\n\nThis will return a list of current indicators. If the empathy indicator is not included, the script adds it to the list and sets the altered list by the command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.indicator.messages applications <newlist>\n\n\n*Then the script looks for the existence of an empathy window\nIf no empathy window exists any more, the script fetches the list of indicators again and removes the indicator in the same way.\n\n\n*Then the wrapper- script terminates itself, and your icon is removed from the panel.\n\n\nThe wrapper\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nkey = \"com.canonical.indicator.messages\"\n\ndef hide_icon(icon, mode):\n    # function to remove the targeted icon from the list\n    current = eval(subprocess.check_output([\n        \"gsettings\", \"get\", key, \"applications\"\n        ]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip())\n    if mode == \"h\":\n        try:\n            current.remove(icon)\n        except ValueError:\n            pass\n    elif mode == \"s\":\n        if not icon in current:\n            current.append(icon)\n    subprocess.call([\n        \"gsettings\", \"set\", key, \"applications\", str(current)\n        ])\n\n# run empathy\nsubprocess.Popen([\"empathy\"])\n# make sure the icon shows\nhide_icon('empathy.desktop', \"s\")\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(3)\n    try:\n        # get the pid of empathy\n        pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"empathy\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        break\n    else:\n        try:\n            # see if the pid of empathy is still in the window list...\n            wlist = subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n            # ...if not, remove the icon from the list and break\n            if not pid in wlist:\n                hide_icon('empathy.desktop', \"h\")\n                break\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n            pass\n\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as no_indicator.py\n\n*Test-run the script with the command:\npython3 /path/to/no_indicator.py\n\nThe icon should disappear if you close empathy. If all works fine:\n\n*Copy the global empathy.desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications:\ncp /usr/share/applications/empathy.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*Open the locally copied file with gedit:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/empathy.desktop\n\nreplace the line:\nExec=empathy\n\nby:\nExec=python3 /path/to/no_indicator.py\n\n\n*just before (above) the line, starting with Actions=, insert the line:\nStartupWMClass=empathy\n\nThis is to prevent an extra icon in the Launcher when you run empathy\n\n*Log out and back in\n\nA: Install the dconf-editor tool ... open a terminal and execute:  \nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor  \n\n\nOpen dconf Editor, navigate to com → canonical → indicator → messages.  \n\nRemove 'empathy.desktop' in the right pane, log out and back in.  \n\nNow the Empathy icon doesn't appear in the indicator bar any more.  \n\nNote:\nThe next time you open Empathy, the icon will reappear and you have to repeat the procedure.\nWhen you want to permanently remove the icon, you have to execute the following command:  \nsudo apt-get remove indicator-messages  \n\nThe downside is, that the Thunderbird icon will also be removed - so the decision is up to you ...\n", "Q: Any tutorials for installing windows 10 guest on VirtualBox on ubuntu 15.10 host I'm trying to install a Windows 10 guest on VirtualBox with a Ubuntu 15.10 host.

That's why cannot go to 15.10\n\nA: Installing from Ubuntu repositories is preferred.\nThis will install a supported Ubuntu kernel and it will get updates.\nIf you install a mainline kernel, you may have issues with some drivers, and you will have to update it manually.\nUbuntu kernel 4.2 will be default in the next \"point\" LTS release 14.04.4 that is scheduled to be out in Feb 2016.\nThere should be no problems in upgrading to 16.04.\nInstalling linux-generic-lts-wily now you install that kernel a bit earlier than it will be released for all LTS new installs.\nYou can read more about HWE Stack.\n", "Q: How do I find out what application deleted a file?

Then go to \"Output Devices\" tab and change to suitable port (usually where should be a choice between headphones and speakers). Another way is to choose suitable profile in \"Configuration\" tab.\n\nA: I have a HP Envy, with touch screen, Nvidia discret card and beats audio system. I have had this common issue of the sound comming out from both the speakers and headphones. I've tryed every attempt of solution I've found in any forum but nothing worked for me. But my situation is this one:\nI'm using the 16.04 LTS version which doesn't provide the latest stable kernel. As beats audio doesn't provide specific drivers for linux, there is a solution to make all the speakers (the 4 on the front and the subwofer) working with a graphical tool called HDAJackRetask. It is something you have to do (if you want to make the most of your hardware), as with the dedicated graphic card, for which you can install the proprietary drives after a fresh installation. Done so, everything works as it should. But...\nI also installed a tool called ukuu which installs the latest stable kernel directly from the github respository (I think). It's like going to the web yourself and download the three packages and installing yourself through gdebi or dpkg. After that, you discover than the current Nvidia drive doesn't work anymore. And the only solution is to uninstall everything related to Nvidia and start the ubuntu tool does searches for proprietary drives again. As if it was an fresh installation once again. And I think the same issue was happening with the sound system. So I run HDAJackRetask and dissabled the retask changes to the original. Rebooted and restarted and I could see the sound was able to be taken out from only one source: speakers or headphones when plugging them.\nAnd then I run HDAJackRetask again. \nSo, once more, after installing a new kernel manually (with the ukuu tool in this case), everything related to the graphic and the sound cards should be reconfigured or reinstalled again.\nEverything works fine again.\nJust in case this could be your problem ;)\n", "Q: How can I try to find why YouTube is crashing my Ubuntu 15.10 installation?

I would like when user types apt-get install my-mysql for my-mysql.preinst to run before mysql-server-5.5.preinst (so it can do debconf-set-selections to autogenerate root password and to stop mysql-server package from asking for it interactively).\nI could do it without putting any depends in my-mysql package, and manually running two commands:\napt-get install my-mysql\napt-get install mysql-server-5.5\n\nbut I need it to work with only one command (apt-get install my-mysql). I've tried playing with Pre-depends on third package which would do config, and Depends on mysql-server-5.5, but it seems mysql-server-5.5.preinst always run first. Is there a way to change that and force my package preinst to run before it?\nAs alternative way, I also cannot run apt-get install mysql-server-5.5 from postinst because of dpkg locking issues, and would like to do it in much cleaner way than locking kludges like this one.\nUPDATE: as mentioned in the comments, it seems that mysql-server package also has .config scripts (with associated .templates) which execute even before .preinst scripts, so I need to order them too.\n\nA: I've found a way to do it. \nSo, in order for single apt-get install my-mysql to work as described in question, I had to do several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*make my-mysql package so it pre-depends on my-mysql-config and depends on mysql-server\n\n*create additional package my-mysql-config, which pre-depends on debconf and contains my-mysql-config.templates and my-mysql-config.config script (which among other things sets password so mysql-server-5.5 won't ask for it) containing code like:\n. /usr/share/debconf/confmodule\ndb_set  mysql-server/root_password \"$PW\"\ndb_fset mysql-server/root_password seen true\n\ndb_set  mysql-server/root_password_again \"$PW\"\ndb_fset mysql-server/root_password_again seen true\n\n\n*also my-mysql-config.preinst contains code that does db_get and creates config files before mysql-server gets started\n\n*you can use my-mysql package .postinst script to run stuff you want after mysql-server is installed and running.\n\n\nThe Debconf Programmer's Tutorial was great help there, as was using export DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer and set -x in scripts for debugging.\nAnother two time-consuming issues for debug was making sure that config/preinst/postinst scripts do not output ANYTHING to STDOUT (as it breaks debconf in strange and interesting ways) and that you need db_stop if you do stuff like invoke-rc.d mysql restart or similar (or your apt-get will hang hard, without even responding to Ctrl + C)\n", "Q: How do I get a list of users not present in a CSV file from /etc/passwd?

The array is a hardware array via my MSI motherboard.\nI would like to add a new blank SSD drive with K/Ubuntu on it, and have that boot first so I can have grub dualboot either system.  I would prefer the Windows RAID array remain untouched in case I have to go back to my current setup.\nI have done this before with drives, but not with an existing RAID array.  My concern is that the RAID array might cause problems and I'm not sure what I'll have to do to get things running, and I don't want to lose the array.\nI'm looking for advice here, because I have many thousands of documents, home videos and pictures that I have backed up but it's a very very VERY long backup/restore procedure (Almost 1 TB, many small files).  Should I have any concerns or just go ahead and try it?  The distro I have is Kubuntu 15.10 64-bit.\nThanks!\n\nA: So I booted off of a USB iso and double-checked that the RAID array was being detected and could be mounted properly.  It was, and I was able to access the file structure.\nI added the 2nd SDD drive and did the same test again from the Live USB, and could access both the RAID and the SDD.\nI went ahead and started the install onto the SDD.  My RAID array was my primary boot drive, sda, and the SDD drive was sdb.  I configured the installation to put grub onto the RAID array (sda) since that's what boots first, and it rebooted and worked perfectly.  It even detected my Windows 10 OS on the RAID array when installing grub, so I'm still able to boot into Windows.  When I boot into Linux, I can also still access the RAID array files.\nSo, if you can boot off of a stick or DVD to run a Live session and still have access to your RAID array, then it's safe to go ahead and install since you already know that it can use your RAID, and grub will be able to find it and boot into it.\n", "Q: Set expire date for users I use ubuntu 12.04, i have a file \"user.cfg\" and i put in this file the users like this\nF: user pass { enddate=2017-01-24 }\n\nThis file existe in /var/etc/\nHere's image of the file\nI want a script for erasing automatically expired user from this file \"user.cfg\"\nThank you.\n\nA: You can do:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n## Reading \"/var/etc/user.cfg\", saving the line being read in variable \"line\"\nwhile read -r line; do\n\n    ## Getting the username from \"user.cfg\", saving in variable \"user\"\n    user=\"$(grep -Po '^F:\\s+\\K[^\\s]+' <<<\"$line\")\"\n\n    ## Getting the expiry date from \"user.cfg\", saving in variable \"exp_cfg\"  \n    exp_cfg=\"$(grep -Po 'enddate=\\K[^\\s]+' <<<\"$line\")\"\n\n        ## Getting expiry time, days since Epoch from \n        ## \"/etc/shadow\" into variable \"exp_shadow\"\n        exp_shadow=\"$(sudo grep -Po \"^$user:.*:\\K[^:]+(?=:[^:]*$)\" /etc/shadow)\"\n\n            ## Check if \"exp_shadow\" is not Null\n            [[ -n $exp_shadow ]] &&\n\n            ## If not null, then convert the date from \"exp_cfg\" into days \n            ## since epoch and then check if its less than \"exp_shadow\"\n            ## Replace \">\" with \"<\" if you want to see the expired accounts :)\n            (( $exp_shadow > $(($(date '+%s' <<<\"$exp_cfg\")/86400)) )) &&\n\n            ## If so, print the line\n            echo \"$line\"\n\ndone </var/etc/user.cfg\n\nSave it as e.g. user_exp_check.sh, now you can see the users with non-expired account by running the following (assuming you are on the script's directory):\nbash user_exp_check.sh\n\nTo save the output in a new file e.g. new_user.cfg:\nbash user_exp_check.sh >new_user.cfg\n\nThen you can remove the old /var/etc/user.cfg file.\n", "Q: Failure to install Ubuntu Linux My System: Intel 4930k processor, Sapphire(AMD) R9 270 4Gb video card, 32Gb GSkill memory, Samsung 250GB EVO SSD Single (Partition for Windows 7 Ultimate), Asus X79Gold MB, Seagate 1Tb disc drive with 2 logical partitions, Pioneer BDxl Bluray DVD and Asus DVD.\nProblem: I tried to install Ubuntu 15.10 from ISO disc provided with Linux Forum magazine.

This resulted in a \"cannot load \"metafi...\" error.  I tried twice same error.  I presume it meant \"cannot load metafile...\" I then tried to install on the Seagate hard drive, same message.\nWhat am I doing wrong?  How can I get Linux to install?\n\nA: Please make use of this to create a bootable USB for Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.3 LTS. Then follow the process to install Ubuntu. Rather than partitioning during the linux install one can very well partition it within Windows(if you are new to Linux) using Windows disk partition tool(under computer management). Make sure that you create some space for /boot on SSD and then install remaining Ubuntu Linux into the unused portion of your 1 TB hard drive. You can have both Ubuntu and Window on that 1 TB hard drive. You can very well use gparted to do partitioning in Linux if needed. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: Lubuntu on top of Ubuntu If I install lubuntu \"on top of ubuntu\", do I really get the low overhead effect of lubuntu as if I installed a lubuntu iso?\n\nA: Yes.\nWhat you mean is installing the lubuntu-desktop meta-package on top of your Ubuntu installation.\nIn fact, Lubuntu (and all Ubuntu flavors) is built on top of the exact same base used in Ubuntu. The only thing that changes is the desktop environment and the default applications. \nA meta-package is a group of packages which are installed together as part of something bigger. The meta-package lubuntu-desktop brings the LXDE desktop along with applications like Abiword, Gnumeric, Firefox, etc. If you install it on top of the Unity desktop you'll basically have the full functionalities of both Ubuntu and Lubuntu at the same time, and LXDE's performance should be just the same as in a pure Lubuntu install.\n\nA: Ok, I just made a usb of Lubuntu.  There is a huge difference and no clicking noise. \nMemory on Lubuntu (pure by usb) is 222 mb.\nAbout half of lubuntu on top of ubuntu..  ie. Ubuntu is installed and the Lubuntu desktop shell is installed after the fact and chosen on login.\nNo clicking noise which is my biggest worry.\nLooks like I will likely be removing ubuntu soon, mostly because the clicking noise is unanswered and worries me.\nI really like Ubuntu after installing Gnome and Lubuntu on my Ubuntu system.  I hope this gets fixed.  I hope the ideas of shells consuming the proper resources is also fixed.\n", "Q: How to completely delete MySQL for clean install I need to completely delete everything about MySQL.

From what I can tell, it also uses tar in places, and if tar doesn't support zopfli, get ready to add support for zopfli to GNU tar as well.\n", "Q: Open Android Studio \"studio.sh\" by double click on script file in ubuntu 14.04 I used Ubuntu 14.04, As I have to open Terminal and Drag-n-Drop studio.sh to open Android Studio every time.\nIs there any other simple way to open it.\nI thought to create script file and by clicking on that file open Android Studio Automatically.\nAny Help? \n\nA: To run Android Studio by double clicking on its icon, you will need to create a .desktop file for it:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Android Studio\nComment=Android Studio script\nExec=/home/user/android-studio/bin/studio.sh\nIcon=/home/user/android-studio/bin/studio.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nSave the above as a file on your Desktop with a .desktop extension.\nFor first time it will give warning to trust on android studio.\nI hope it helps.\n\nA: I found best solution as I think:\nAndroid Studio gives the functionality to create Command Line Launcher and Desktop Entry:\nTo Create Command Line Launcher:\n\n*\n\n*Go To Tools menu -> Select Create Command Line Launcher -> Enter your Password\n\n*It will create one launcher file on this location: /home/.AndroidStudio1.5/system/tmp\n\n*Simply it will also run like drag-n-drop on terminal.\n\nTo Create Desktop Launcher:\n\n*\n\n*Click on Create Desktop Entry.. from Tools menu.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It will be prompt for password, enter password of your current login.\n\n\n*Finally it will be display notification in Android Studio screen like:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can see in Applications => Programming => Android Studio, and you may see on desktop also after restarting system.\n\nThank you. :)\n", "Q: updating ClamAV 0.98.7 to 0.99.0 for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I would like to update my ClamAV antivirus 0.98.7 to 0.99.0 and tried updating it by typing:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install clamav\n\nAfter which I got a message:\n\nyour clamAV is the newest version?\n\nBut when I tried updating the signature database by typing sudo freshclam, I got the message your clamav 0.98.7 is outdated. \nI was able to download the ClamTK GUI and was able to update my definitions to the current one but my anti-virus engine is outdated.

Ubuntu is open source and you can go thru it. Essentially the kernel modules which are interacting with H/W and to some extend of the installer routines. Any time installers are running they probe the underlying hardware and based on that they behave. Your old computer may be having USB 2.0 interface only plus a lot of stuff(in terms of old hardware) which makes the installer make a decision how to behave.

Is there any way I can get graphics settings when booted via live usb stick and use it to solve the low graphics issue. The monitor in this case is a 48\" LED tv.\n\nA: I have the same NUC. You will need a reasonably recent kernel that supports Intel HD Graphics (Braswell) which is inbuilt in your NUC's CPU (Intel Celeron N3050) - I think support was added in 4.2, but it could be also 4.1. These kernels are not available in standard repositories for Ubuntu 12.04, so you will have to head over to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ and select one of the 4.x kernels, download the .deb packages relevant to your system (in your case, amd64 of the \"generic\" variety, low-latency is not normally recommended) and install them with dpkg -i.

What is a superuser? How do I get that privilege? or is there another way to configure dpkg?\n\nA: root (superuser) is the user on the system who has all permissions.\nYou gain superuser rights for the duration of a command by prepending sudo in front of the command you want to execute (if your user is in the sudo group).\nsudo dpkg --reconfigure -a\n\nEnter your password when prompted.\n\nA: The \"superuser\" is user \"root\" on Linux systems. It's the \"god in the system\", it has full privileges to do everything. All other users don't have those rights, and only admin users have the right to use sudo to run commands as root user.\nIf a command needs root rights, you must run it with sudo like this:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nThat will ask you for your user password. Note that no characters are echoed, not even asterisks, when you type in your password.\n\nA: Basically there are three different types of users in Linux (Ubuntu).\n\n\n*\n\n*Root user, which is the super user / administrator / or whatever you want to call it\n\n*Service users, which are hidden non-login users that are used by services such as Apache web server. These users can't login and can't be used by you to login.\n\n*Normal users, which are any other users. This kind of user can be either a sudoer or a non-sudoer.\n\n\nInitially logging in as the root user is disabled by default in Ubuntu. Instead you can use your normal user which has permission to run the sudo program which makes it possible to execute commands as another user, including as root.\nExample:\napt-get install SOME_APP\n\nThis will raise you an error of permission denied. So you have either to be a root or use sudo:\nsudo apt-get install SOME_APP\n\nwill work.\nSo back to your error, you should run it with sudo as below:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nRelated links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sudo on wikipedia\n\n*Root Sudo documentation on Ubuntu help wiki\n", "Q: SSL Error 61 in Citrix Receiver in Ubuntu 12.04 I am using Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS and I have Citrix Receiver installed.\nWhen I am trying to login, I got the error:\n\nYou have not chosen to trust \"DigiCert Hish Assurance Server CA\", the issuer of the server's security certificate (SSL error 61)\"\n\nSo, I tried installing certificate, and when I try to copy and rehash the certificate to /Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/ I got the error:\nunable to load certificate\n140085276386976:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:696:Expecting: TRUSTED CERTIFICATE\nDigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt => .0\nunable to load certificate\n140703055140512:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:696:Expecting: TRUSTED CERTIFICATE\nWARNING: Skipping duplicate certificate DigiCertSHA2HighAssuranceServerCA.crt\n\nWhat is the solution for this kind of problem? \n\n\nA: Just go ahead and copy certificates from Mozilla's folder into the Citrix certs folders\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/* /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts\n\nThis should do the work for you!\nSource\n", "Q: Show docky on second monitor I installed a new monitor and I connected it to my laptop, but I can't reach to DOCKY on secondary monitor, while on my laptop it is available.\nCan docky be shown on every monitor?\n\nA: I don't think you can have docky on both monitors.

The threshold varies, but is about 25% to 33% of the scale available. I would expect sound to gradually become quieter and quieter until reaching the muted state at zero volume instead.\nHow can I get that (IMHO more intuitive) behaviour?

Also the dad drive is trying to read a disk\n\nA: Do you have any disk inside the drive? If you do, the system may be configured to boot from the drive, and when you boot, it reads the DVD and, as there's nothing to boot from, the computer doesn't start. \nNext time you click on the power button, open the drive and check if there's anything inside it. \nIf not, it may be a BIOS or GRUB malfunction.

I have a camera driver supplied by its manufacturer but they only say it works on 10.04.\nMy question is that this driver can be used also on 12.04?\n\nA: My experience of v4l camera/media drivers is they ship a modified version of the Kernel's media source tree. This contains drivers for all sorts of video input. This might be augmented by an update script (like dkms) that updates it when your kernel is updated.\nBut if the driver is based on 10.04's kernel source tree, it's going to be ANCIENT!\n10.04 shipped with a 2.6 kernel. Precise started on 3.2. There were a lot of changes between 2.6 and 3.x. And getting even newer, modern systems are on 4.x which is a slightly less aggressive change from 3.x but still...\nPulling an ancient media stack on top of that will probably not work out well.\nThat said it costs you nothing but time to test. Ubuntu is free. You can install 12.04 on another system and test. It might Just Work™ without an added driver. Many drivers are pulled into the Kernel directly over time. Or your ancient v4l might somehow work.\nFailing that (and assuming the manufacturer wants nothing to do with this) you might want to look at compiling the latest 2.6 kernel on 12.04 and then installing your driver against that. It may still be incompatible but it's more likely to work. I don't know that 12.04 will definitely work on 2.6 but it's worth a punt.\nIf that doesn't work... It's time to look for new hardware. I'd look for something with drivers that are already in the Kernel. Staying on an unmaintained 10.04 is asking to be hacked.\n", "Q: How do I create a software raid on non system drives in Ubuntu 14.04?

Once it’s unpacked, the /configure command does not work. I happened to notice that the unpacked folder contains configure, read me, or install files, but the error says \n\nconfigure no such file\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with Firefox by default. If you’ve removed it and wish to reintall it, it’s available in the standard repositories. You can either use the point-and-click graphical interface of the Software Center or simply type\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\non the Terminal.\n\nIf you do wish to install Firefox (or any other program) from a tarball, you’ll need to be careful to enter exactly the commands you should. As Eduardo Cola said in a comment on your question, you probably want ./configure, with an initial dot. The command /configure will try to run a script in the root directory called configure: no such script exists, hence your error message. The same command with an initial dot will run the script called configure in your current directory, which you say does exist.\n\nA: Use the version of firefox in the repositories\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware\nIf for some reason you need a newer version, use a ppa\nSee How do I install the latest stable version of Firefox?\nIf you are trying to compile from source see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build and post the command(s) you ran and any error message.\n", "Q: Sharing SWAP and /home beteween Ubuntu 15.10 and Kali Linux 2.0 I am currently running Ubuntu-15.10 on my machine and I am planning to install KaliLinux alongside Ubuntu.

But will this effect Ubuntu? \nNote : I am not having an encrypted /home \n\nA: Sharing swap will mean you can't hibernate but that's the only real downside.\nSharing a common /home can be a bad idea. You have different versions of the same applications writing their settings all over the place. Something is bound to explode at some point.\nI'd avoid it and instead set up a shared data partition that you mount and/or symlink into each home to supplant things like ~/Documents, ~/Music, etc.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, you can use one swap partition for several Linux operating systems.\nThere is an exception, in case want to hibernate, you cannot share a swap partition.\n\n*Yes, it is possible but not recommended, better create separate partitions.\nThere you can store your personal data and you can access them from every system.  \nBelow an example of a convenient disk partition setup for being used by multiple systems :  \n\n\nAs you can see in the screenshots, the data partitions are separated from the system partitions.  \nThey can be accessed from every operating system, in this case from non-Linux systems as well.  \nsdb is used for operating systems : sdb3 contains the Ubuntu system, sdb4 contains virtual disks.  \nsda is used for everything external : sda1 contains personal data, sda2 music, photos and videos.  \nsda3 contains backups of data and operating systems, sda4 (bootable) ISO files and various tools.  \nThis is only a suggestion, of course, you should create partitions suitable for your personal needs.\n", "Q: No certificate files inside of /usr/lib/ssl I don't appear to have any SSL certs installed on my machine and it is causing issues with wget and Faraday called within Rails.\nWhen I run openssl version -a I am told my OPENSSLDIR is  \"/usr/lib/ssl\".\nWhen I look inside /usr/lib/ssl/certs it is empty.\nWhen I run sudo apt-get install ca-certificates I am told that ca-certificates is already at the newest version and when I run sudo update-ca-certificates I get the following output;\nUpdating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs... 0 added, 0 removed; done.\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d....\nThere was a problem saving the new Java keystore.

This would be true if a line beginning with KeyPress came two lines ago.\n\n*Then it prints the fifth and eighth fields, which are 133 and Super_L as can be seen in the first point.\n\n\nxev output actually looks like:\n$ xev\n...\nKeyPress event, serial 36, synthetic NO, window 0x2a00001,\n    root 0x29c, subw 0x0, time 217441518, (91,162), root:(91,697),\n    state 0x10, keycode 134 (keysym 0xffec, Super_R), same_screen YES,\n\nSo, for each keypress, the second line after that has the keycode and name.\n", "Q: What are some alternatives to Compton and Compiz in XFCE?

There seems to be a specific issue that I might only get resolved with a 4.1, but I don't want to remove the newer version, because other things work fine with that and I don't want to fix something that is working :)\n\nA: With regards to VirtualBox, I do not believe it is possible to keep two versions installed - each calls upon many things which are shared, and will have version conflicts with both installed.  (Including but not limited to virtual networking, which is utilized with the Virtual Machines to provide virtual network interfaces)\nSome packages are capable of being installed simultaneously (for instance, multiple gcc compiler versions), as they each share different library sets that don't use the same resources.  There are some server packages that can be installed side by side (multiple PostgreSQL server versions, for example) as well.

Ars Technica posted an article describing the getaddrinfo() bug and how it is widespread in the Linux world.\n\nThe vulnerability was introduced in 2008 in GNU C Library, a collection of open\n  source code that powers thousands of standalone applications and most \n  distributions of Linux, including those distributed with routers and other \n  types of hardware.\n\nSource: http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/extremely-severe-bug-leaves-dizzying-number-of-apps-and-devices-vulnerable/\nQuestion: In which general distribution versions of Ubuntu has this bug been fully addressed/corrected?\n\nA: Like any security patch, it has been patched in all supported versions of Ubuntu. It's pushed through both the security and updates repos for desktop installations. You just need to update in your normal way. If you have automatic updates turned on, this should install automatically.\nLike Kernel updates, libc updates usually require a reboot to fully take. However, weigh up how much risk you're actually at. To trigger this bug, an attacker essentially needs local network access —ie on your router or between you and your router— so while this has been talked up a lot, the risk of actual damage is still quite low for most people on their home networks. If you roam around on other networks, you're immediately in a higher risk bracket.\nI don't know how Ubuntu Touch factors into standard update procedures.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2900-1/\nThe problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:\n\nUbuntu 15.10:\n    libc6 2.21-0ubuntu4.1 \nUbuntu 14.04 LTS:\n    libc6 2.19-0ubuntu6.7 \nUbuntu 12.04 LTS:\n    libc6 2.15-0ubuntu10.13 \n\n16.04 (in development) will likely have a separate update come through the standard channel. Older, unsupported releases will remain vulnerable unless you patch them yourself.\n\nA: Patched versions are available for all supported Ubuntu releases namely 12.04, 14.04 and 15.10.\nThe relevant patched versions are:\nUbuntu 15.10:\n    libc6 2.21-0ubuntu4.1 \nUbuntu 14.04 LTS:\n    libc6 2.19-0ubuntu6.7 \nUbuntu 12.04 LTS:\n    libc6 2.15-0ubuntu10.13 \n\nYou just need to upgrade the libc6 package:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libc6\n\nCheck: http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2900-1/\n\nA: To check if your system is affected: \nldd --version\n\nAffected versions will have an output like this: \n\nldd (Ubuntu EGLIBC 2.19-0ubuntu6.6) 2.19\n\nTo upgrade glibc run either:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libc6 && sudo apt-get install libc-bin\n\nor \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAfter this you must restart the services that depends upon glibc or best option is to reboot the box.\nAfter this if you check again with: \nldd --version\n\nThe output should be like:\n\nldd (Ubuntu EGLIBC 2.19-0ubuntu6.7) 2.19\n\n", "Q: Dependency problem installing dell osam on Ubuntu 15.10 I have a simple problem with dependencies.\nI want to install a Server management package from Dell called OSAM\non Ubuntu 15.10.

The installer said that it was unable to install the bootloader onto any device, so I proceeded with the installation without installing bootloader anywhere. I then ran Boot-Repair and \"fixed\" the bootloader issue before rebooting. Now, when I press the Alt key, I can find the Macintosh HD and EFI boot (USB stick) options, but not the installed Lubuntu as an option. In addition, selecting the EFI boot option now crashes and immediately boots up Mac OS X.\nHere's the pastebin from Boot-Repair. Any idea where I went wrong?\n\nA: It looks like you've got a mixed BIOS-mode/EFI-mode installation. These can be tricky, although on average they're less tricky on Macs than on PCs. Nonetheless, using a BIOS-mode GRUB to boot OS X will be difficult to impossible. Your easiest course of action is likely to be to install my rEFInd boot manager in OS X. Once installed, it should detect your Lubuntu installation and enable you to boot it directly. (It will probably also offer an option to boot Lubuntu via the GRUB on /dev/sdb, which might or might not work.) If you can boot directly (via the boot\\vmlinuz-* options), you can remove the redundant or non-functional BIOS-mode GRUB by editing refind.conf: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is not among the options.\nOne caveat: If you're running OS X 10.11 (\"El Capitan\"), you'll have to jump through some extra installation hoops, as described here.\nOne final comment: Your /dev/sda has a hybrid MBR. This is ugly, unnecessary, and dangerous. I recommend you replace it with a conventional protective MBR. Doing any trivial operation on the disk with GParted will do this; or you can use gdisk: Type x to enter the experts' menu, followed by n to create a new protective MBR, and then w to save the changes. Your /dev/sdb uses an MBR (with no GPT). This is unusual in the context of a Mac, but it should be fine and cause no real problems if you follow my advice. I can't say how GRUB or the Mac's built-in boot loader would react to the mixture of GPT on the first disk and MBR on the second, though.\n\nEDIT:\nOh, wait. I hit the post button when I realized something: You have no EFI System Partition (ESP). This complicates matters. There are at least three possible ways to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFInd from OS X, but do so by running the refind-install --notesp command (adding the --notesp option). This will install rEFInd to the main OS X partition on /dev/sda2.\n\n*Convert /dev/sdb from MBR to GPT (by running gdisk on the disk) and make /dev/sdb1 your ESP by giving it a type code of EF00 (in gdisk; this is called a \"boot flag\" in parted and GParted). You should then be able to install rEFInd with its default options, which will put it on your ESP (/dev/sdb1). Note that this approach presupposes that /dev/sdb1 is not currently being used for anything else. (Based on its size and location, it does look like it might have been intended as an ESP at some point.)\n\n*Use gdisk or GParted to create an ESP on /dev/sda. There's enough room before /dev/sda1 for an ESP, so I suspect that one might have existed there at one point but been deleted. In any event, if you use GParted for this (make it FAT32 and give it a \"boot flag\"), it will also remove the hybrid MBR. You can then install rEFInd normally and it will be installed to the ESP on /dev/sda (probably /dev/sda1).\n\n", "Q: Instal Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS on windows 10 I tired to install Ubuntu on Windows 10:\n1.

But for easy booting i need uefi version of Ubuntu on HDD.\nSo, can you please tell me how to boot liveCD only via UEFI or how to convert bios Ubuntu into UEFI Ubuntu?\nI want to install newest Ubuntu 14, thank you for answers.\n(Sorry for bad english)\n\nA: First, disable your Compatibility Support Module (CSM), aka \"legacy mode support.\" Having it enabled complicates the boot path and sometimes directs the boot mode down that road even when you don't want it to do that. While you're in the firmware setup utility, you may want to re-enable Secure Boot. Although it does sometimes cause problems, it usually doesn't. (Many reports of Secure Boot problems actually have other causes.) You can always re-disable Secure Boot if you run out of other options. Secure Boot, as the name implies, is a security feature, so you probably shouldn't be disabling it unless you're certain you need to do so.\nIf that's not sufficient, use your firmware's boot manager. This tool is usually accessed by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key (usually F8 or above). Most modern EFIs show two options for booting external boot media, one of which includes the string \"UEFI\" and the other of which doesn't. Pick the option that includes the string \"UEFI\" to boot in that mode.\nIf that doesn't work, then chances are your boot medium was prepared incorrectly. You didn't say what tool you used to create your USB drive, but quite a few are available. Rufus seems to have the best reputation among Windows programs and Unetbootin usually works and is cross-platform. Neither is guaranteed to work, though. Note that Rufus has at least three options for different partition table and boot loader combinations, so be sure to use an option for creating an EFI-compatible medium.\n\nA: Good Day..

Any ideas? \nMy /etc/mpd.conf has the following audio output settings: \naudio_output {\n        type            \"alsa\"\n        name            \"Audio2DJ\"\n        device          \"hw:0,0\"\n}\n\n\nA: I am not entirely sure why this works, but after seeing several other people with USB sound cards mentioning a need to address the card with plughw:0,0 instead of hw:0,0 I changed my /etc/mpd.conf to: \naudio_output {\n        type            \"alsa\"\n        name            \"Audio2DJ\"\n        device          \"plughw:0,0\"\n}\n\nApparently this adds an extra resampling layer between the card hardware and ALSA which allows MPD to feed it formats that are not natively supported by the hardware. I haven't tested very thoroughly but sound quality seems to be ok with this setting - certainly a lot better than the white noise I had previously at least. \n", "Q: Cannot autolaunch D-bus without X11 $DISPLAY Today I moved my PC from one case to another and therefore had to change my graphics card from the PCI Express x4 to the PCI Express x16. This caused Ubuntu to go into low graphics mode. I managed to fix this by reinstalling default drivers (which I have used before and it has fixed issues perfectly). However, when I tried to reinstall the proprietary drivers (by unpacking the zip and building) it caused the system to enter low graphics mode again. Upon fixing and rebooting, the system is in a login loop. I try to login, it hangs on the desktop background for about 5 seconds, flicks to a black screen for a second and then opens up the login page again (and replays the sound that happens on boot). I have entered the tty console and logged in.

It is located at /opt/eclipse. I have a symbolic link form /usr/bin/eclipse to /opt/eclipse/eclipse. I also have a file named eclipse.desktop in /usr/share/applications, whose contents are as follows:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eclipse\nComment=Eclipse C++ IDE\nExec=/opt/eclipse/eclipse\nIcon=/opt/eclipse/icon.xpm\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Development;\nStartupWMClass=Eclipse\n\n/opt/eclipse/icon.xpm exists. However, the icon is not shown in the dock or in the list of applications. Any ideas? I'm on Ubuntu 14.04.\nEDIT: Tried updating StartupWMClass, doesn't help. Here's a screenshot that captures the situation:\n[]\n\nA: I am pretty sure you have another eclipse.desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications. The one you show in the image looks fine. Most likely, you ran Eclipse a single time before moving it to /opt. Then a .desktop file is automatically created in ~/.local/share/applications.\n.desktop files in ~/.local/share/applications overrule global ones in /usr/share/applications, which means that whatever you change to the global one, it has no effect whatsoever; the one in ~/.local/share/applications takes precedence ans is the one that shows in the Launcher.\nIf so, remove the one in ~/.local/share/applications, log out and back in.\n\nEDIT\n\nAfter your latest comment, it becomes clear what happened: It turns out you previously made a local launcher with alacarte. Alacarte does not handle icon paths correctly when using absolute paths; alacarte simply leaves out the icon's extension, but extensions are needed when using absolute paths. \nSee also here.\n\nA: I had the same issue which wasn't solved by any of the above but by not enclosing the path to the icon file in quotes (there were no spaces in the path or file name).  Icon was then displayed as expected.

How exactly can I go about solving this problem?\n\n\nA: From my experience, it is generally a bad idea to flash supersu on a CM13 install, because supersu is already supported by CM13 (in the developer options, the \"root access\" item), and there are some know issues with doing so. Here are some things that I would try:\nFirst, make sure USB debugging is on for adb. You can enable it in Settings > developer options > Android debugging. You can also try to enable root access for ADB. Boot into recovery and try adb devices. If this does not work, you can try the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*If you can detect your device in fastboot mode (fastboot devices), flash a new recovery (TWRP or clockworkmod).\n\n\n*Reboot into fastboot\n\n\n*Go into recovery\n\n\n*Try adb devices. If it works, format system, data, cache and reinstall everything (except supersu ;p).\nIf this does not work, I would suggest you flash the factory Motorola image from fastboot mode and then try steps 1-4 again.\nIf all fails, I would suggest consulting the associated page of your ROM on XDA.\n", "Q: Opening a program or installed software from Terminal? I need to know the command to open a program or software in terminal. The name of the program is youtube-dl\n\nA: youtube-dl is a script with no graphical interface, so you run it in a terminal.\n\nyoutube-dl is a small command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites. It requires the Python interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, and it is not platform specific. It should work on your Unix box, on Windows or on Mac OS X. It is released to the public domain, which means you can modify it, redistribute it or use it however you like.\n\nyoutube-dl [OPTIONS] URL [URL...]\n\nsee https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#readme for detailed instructions including examples of usage.\nIf you did not install it from the repos, \nchmod a+x /path/to/youtube-dl\n/path/to/youtube-dl [OPTIONS] URL [URL...]\n\n\nA: Youtube-dl is a youtube download software. It's a command line utility, so you can't \"open\" it and it doesn't have a GUI: you'll have to run it as command, like this:\nyoutube-dl video_URL\nIf you want a GUI alternative, I recommend 4k Video Downloader:\nhttp://www.4kdownload.com\n\nA: If it is installed, you should be able to just type youtube-dl and (at least) a URL. youtube-dl needs to know what to download. Easiest is to copy-paste it from a browser or something like that. When you paste into a Terminal window, use your mouse, or press Ctrl+Shift+V instead of the normal Ctrl+V.\nIf you get an error-message saying \"no such file or directory\", the program isn't installed. Reinstall it from Ubuntu Software Center or with apt-get in the Terminal (if you're familiar with that).\nNow, if you just type:\nyoutube-dl http://www.youtube.com/watch?somecode\n\nit will download the video to the directory you're in. It's a good idea to move to the directory you want it in. So before downloading, type cd ~/Videos (if you want it in the Videos directory.\nAlternatively, you can right-click a Files window, that you have displaying your desired directory, and click Open in Terminal. That'll open a Terminal window in the right place.\nyoutube-dl seems like a really powerful program, and it links into ffmpeg, that is another really powerful video converter. They can be a bit intimidating, but youtube-dl can be used just by giving it links as well - never mind the intimidating manual pages :)\n", "Q: Lenovo ThinkPad L460 Touchpad not working today I received my brand new Lenovo ThinkPad L460.

How do I bring these icons back?\nEdit: Here is a screenshot of what I mean. I am sorry it's in swedish. For example the folder \"Bilder\" which means \"Pictures\" in my home folder usually has a default icon which is now gone. \n\nA: One thing to try is checking your view settings, and checking your preference for display. The main options are List and Icons, maybe 1 or 2 others. Open Nautilus to the folder in question, and try those.\nBeyond that, to configure a custom icon, you could create a Desktop Entry file. These are the files Ubuntu uses internally to create visible shortcuts and app launchers. You can make one from scratch, or copy and modify from /usr/share/applications.\nDoes that help?\n", "Q: couchdb : Depends: couchdb-bin (>= 1.6.1-0ubuntu4) broken packages I encountered a problem trying to install couchdb on my Ubuntu 14.10 (GNU/Linux 3.10.23-xxxx-std-ipv6-64 x86_64) server.\nWhen I run  apt-get install couchdb,\nI've got the following mistakes : \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies.\n     couchdb : Depends: couchdb-bin (>= 1.6.1-0ubuntu4) \n     but it is not going     to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nI followed a lot of steps found on the net to try to fix it, but nothing worked...\nI hope someone will be able to find out what's going wrong...\nThanks\nEDIT: \nHere are the steps I have already done :\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to use Aptitude, but it installed Couchdb 1.0.1 instead of 1.6.1\n\n*I tried to remove completely the installation using \"apt-get remove couchdb couchdb-bin erlang-base erlang-base-hipe erlang-solutions\" But the result was the same.\n\n*The problem occurs when I add the PPA of couchdb to install the last version.

Also, I'm using Windows 8 and would like to dual boot with Ubuntu desktop.\nThanks in advance..!\n\nA: STEPS: \n\n\n*\n\n*First of all you have to set up you partitions, I recommend using minitool partition manager (link: http://filehippo.com/download_minitool_partition_wizard_home_edition/), \n\n*making the partitions. Make an ext-4 partition (say 100gb), this is where all your files will go, and make a linux-swap partition(say 4gb)(optional) the computer will use this as virtual memory in other words it acts as ram.\n\n*Next download rufus usb creator (link: https://rufus.akeo.ie/) and select \"bootable disk using: iso image\" and provide the route to it, select your image (the ubuntu iso file), select your drive (the usb stick) press ok and wait until the process is completed. \n4.One all is done (you have successfully created the partitions and the bootable usb stick is ready) shutoff the computer. Press the power button and immediately press the esc key repeatedly until a menu pops up (this may vary depending on your machine). Select boot options and then another menu showing all drives should pop up. Select your usb stick and then the grub menu should pop up. choose install (ensure that secure boot and fast boot are disabled). \n5.One the installation interface loads the first few steps should be simple enough for you. When you reach the section that asks you to choose the installation option (where it says \"install alongside windows\"... etc) choose \"something else\" at the bottom. Here double click on the ext-4 partition, select the format checkbox and set mount point as \"/\" which means root, then hit ok. \n6.From here on the rest of the installation process should be simple enough for the noobiest of users. Good Luck!!\n\nA: Please refer to this guide\nFew points:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have Windows 8 installed in EFI mode, install ubuntu in EFI\nmode.\n\n*Disable secure boot in BIOS\n\n*Disable fast boot and hiberantion in Windows\n\n*Use utility like this\n\n*Use boot-repair if needed.\n\n*If you are new to Linux , make sure you create some unused space\nfrom Windows disk partition utility.\n\n*Last but not the least - install Linux only in unused space.\n\n*Your wifi card may not work initially so be connected via LAN cable\n\n*Keep a second laptop/computer handy to do some R&D(or ask question\nhere in askubuntu) in case you are stuck\n\n", "Q: Please Help: Nvidia Drivers on Optimus Laptop Ubuntu 15.10 so I tried to install the vulkan driver a couple of days ago, but it did not work so I tried restoring my system by first uninstalling the vulkan driver, then purging everything nvidia, then installing nvidia-352 and nvidia-prime. But now GL doesn't work so I can only use xfce (which I am writing this on). In my Xorg.0.log (http://paste.ubuntu.com/15101909/) I have this line: (EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found). So now all GL programs won't run. Currently I am using the 355 driver because some guy on the forum said it might work but it didn't fix the problem. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. Notes: To be clear, I am no longer intending to install the beta vulkan driver. I have a muxless laptop so no, I can not disable the intel graphx card. And finally my graphics card is a GTX 960M.\nEDIT:\nHere is the output of lspci -k | grep -EA2 'VGA|3D'\nhttp://pastebin.com/1aLhr4Th\nEDIT 2:\nHere is the output of dkms status\n    bbswitch, 0.7, 4.2.0-23-generic, x86_64: installed\n    bbswitch, 0.7, 4.2.0-25-generic, x86_64: installed\n    bbswitch, 0.7, 4.2.0-27-generic, x86_64: installed\n\nEDIT 3:\nHere is what happens when I try to run a GL application:\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual\n\nEDIT 4:\n prime-select query\n\nreturns\n nvidia\n\nEDIT 5:\n glxinfo | grep OpenGL\n\nreturns\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual or fbconfig\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n    Xlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\n\nEDIT 6:\n    grep i915 /etc/modprobe.d/*\n\nreturns nothing\nEDIT 7:\n lspci -knn | grep -EA2 'VGA|3D'\n\nreturns\n     00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 4th           Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0416] (rev 06)\n        Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc.

I didn't experience any sudden suspend.\nThen, after installing the nvidia driver (nVidia NVS 3100m - Driver Version 340.96) and rebooting a couple of times, the laptop would suspend by it self.\nThis was happening either during X loading (after the splash screen) either after gdm login (or even during) or either during a shutdown/reboot.\nSome times it suspends immediately after a wake up.\nSometimes no screen is restored after a wake up (the laptop screen or the external one).\nIt's a frustrating situation.\nMy previous Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 LTS install, didn't have this problem.\n\nI did search as much as I could to find any solutions or suggestions, so this is what I've tried:\nCreated the file \n/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.disable-suspend.pkla\nwith the following content\n[Disable suspend (upower)]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.suspend\nResultActive=no\nResultInactive=no\nResultAny=no\n\n[Disable suspend (logind)]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.suspend\nResultActive=no\nResultInactive=no\nResultAny=no\n\n[Disable suspend when others are logged in (logind)]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.login1.suspend-multiple-sessions\nResultActive=no\nResultInactive=no\nResultAny=no\n\nSo that the systems ability to suspend was disabled\nIt wasn't effective...\nOf course, I have tried many settings of gnome shell as well\nhttp://imgur.com/hDBlWzB.png\nhttp://imgur.com/Bfx6d46.png\n...and also org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power in dconf-editor\nAlso, I know that even when my system seems to run normal after successfully login in gnome, if I try to reboot or shutdown, nothing happens!\nIt turns out that there is a suspend job running...\nnikos@elitebook:~$ sudo reboot\nFailed to start reboot.target: Transaction is destructive.\n\nAnd here is the job\nnikos@elitebook:~$ systemctl list-jobs \nJOB  UNIT                               TYPE     STATE  \n2160 suspend.target                     start    waiting\n2161 systemd-suspend.service            start    running\n2165 anacron-resume.service             start    waiting\n\nI can either reboot -f to reboot or cancel the job \nsystemctl cancel 2161\nand reboot normally.\nNote that this problem occurs only while the laptop is docked and the lid is closed.

I had also recently reinstalled xorg.\nAnyway, when I rebooted, I still had a black screen. I have tried everthing. I have tried chvt 7, Ctrl+Alt+F7, you name it. I know I'm in the right terminal, but all I have is a single black line with no text option. Help!\n\nA: It may take a few seconds before Ctrl+Alt+F1 puts something on the black screen, and even after that, it may take additional seconds before a  login prompt appears. When you see the login prompt enter your user name, and hit return. Then again, it may take awhile before another prompt on the black screen appears asking for your password. Sometimes it helps if you repeat the Ctrl+Alt+F1. Once your password is accepted eventually a terminal prompt will be seen on the black screen. At that point enter the command sudo reboot. This will shut down the machine in an orderly fashion and will reboot the system. Once rebooted you may want to try recovery mode or just boot normally.\n", "Q: How do I install gcc-4.6 on Ubuntu 15.10 (32bit edition) When I try to install gcc-4.6 on Ubuntu15.10 (32bit edition) using apt-get, but I can't.\nI tried it, but Ubuntu displayed these error messages:\n$ sudo apt-get install gcc-4.6\nReading package lists...

(It's back on after a reboot) I know that getting your touchpad disabled is as easy as toggling the on/off button in System Settings, but unfortunately it only works for the current session.

Add the command above, according to your Ubuntu version.\nNow shortly after login (within 15 seconds) your touchpad is disabled automatically.\nOf course you can play with the 15 seconds a bit to optimize for your system. \n\nEdit\nFrom your comment, it turns out the touchpad is (re-) enabled after a while, which means some process is enabling the touchpad.\nUsually, it is extremely difficult to find out which process is causing this kind of changes. Even if you could, it would not be sure you could eliminate the cause.\nThe good news however is that gsettings (which is used to check/control the touchpad) is extremely \"low on juice\". That means that it will be no burden to your system whatsoever to have a background script keep an eye on the current state, immediately disabling the touchpad again if it is enabled somehow by some process.\nIf you run 14.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the script below\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nkey = \"org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad\"\n\ndef check_set():\n    currstate = subprocess.check_output([\n        \"gsettings\", \"get\", key, \"touchpad-enabled\",\n        ]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    if currstate == \"true\":\n        subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\", \"set\", key, \"touchpad-enabled\", \"false\"])\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(2)\n    check_set()\n\nIf you use 15.04+\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nkey = \"org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad\"\n\ndef check_set():\n    currstate = subprocess.check_output([\n        \"gsettings\", \"get\", key, \"send-events\",\n        ]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    if currstate == \"enabled\":\n        subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\", \"set\", key, \"send-events\", \"disabled\"])\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(2)\n    check_set()\n\nTo use it\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as no_touchpad.py\n\n*Add the following command to Startup Applications:\n/bin/bash - c \"sleep 15 && python3 /path/to/no_touchpad.py\"\n\nI am afraid the only alternative is to disconnect the touchpad physically, as mentioned by Serg.\n\nA: Bellow are 3 possible approaches, advantages and disadvantages discussed. There could be others, but these are most bulletproof and simple.\nDconf approach\nFirst approach is by using dconf (and this is my prefered approach, since it survives reboots at least on my 14.04 LTS system ) , more specifically this command:\ndconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/touchpad/touchpad-enabled false\n\nTo finalize it , run dconf update.  \nVery nice approach, doesn't require root access, survives reboots, simple to script. \nBlacklisting the driver\nIf a driver ( in Linux terminology - module ) is blacklisted, the device won't be used - that's a simple idea. The specific module that we need is pmouse.\nOpen the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf with root privileges, for example with sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (command line editor) or with gksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (gui editor). Add the following line at the end:\n blacklist pmouse\n\nSave, exit, reboot, and now your touch pad will be prevented from use. For the record, wireless usb mouses still will be active - I am currently typing that on my laptop with touchpad module removed, while using a usb wireless mouse.\nSmall disadvantage of this method is need for root access, but overall it is a simple and effective approach.  \nxinput\nFinal one, is xinput --disable ID , where ID is the id= number from the xinput (notice no arguments)  of the device. Now how do we make that autostart every time we log in to GUI ?\nMake a script and add it to Startup Applications menu :\n#!/bin/bash\nDISPLAY=:0\nxinput --disable 13 # id 13 is just an example\n\nNow every time you log in , this will run. Slightly more verbose, more steps. However, this has advantage when you use any GUI that relies on X server. But only those that use dconf will work with the dconf method (obviously), for example Unity or Gnome. \nHardware solution:\nThis might be obvious, but if you want to 100 % disable a touchpad, open the laptop and disconnect a ribbon connector that goes from touchpad to the motherboard.\n\nA: There's a really cool utility called touchpad-indicator which shows an icon in the top bar about the status of the touchpad. The important thing is that it also allows you do to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable/disable touchpad by simply clicking on the icon.\n\n*Disable touchpad automatically on startup when touchpad-indicator starts.\n\n*Disable touchpad when mouse plugged in.\n\n*Disable touchpad when typing.\n\n*Enable/disable touchpad using a keyboard shortcut.\n\n\nI will show you how to install and set it up so that it disables the touchpad on startup.\n\n\n*\n\n*First we need to install it, open up a terminal and type in the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install touchpad-indicator\n\n\n*After you have installed it, start it by looking for Touchpad-Indicator in the Dash menu.\n\n*You will see a new icon (see picture below) show up at the top right of your screen. Click on it and select Preferences.\n\n\n*You will be presented with this window:\n\n\n*Go to the General Options tab.\n\n\n*Tick the box that says Autostart.\n\n\n*Now go to the Actions tab.\n\n*Tick on the box that says Disable touchpad when Touchpad-Indicator starts.\n\n\n*(Optionally) Set any other conditions you like in the Actions tab.\n\n*Done.\nYou can now close that window (by clicking on OK).\nEnjoy.\n\nA: The following command will disable your touchpad, provided that you replace \"XX\" with the id of your touchpad.\nxinput set-int-prop XX \"Device Enabled\" 8 0\n\nTo find your touchpad's id, run: \nxinput --list\n\nFor instance, my touchpad look like this:\n\n⎜   ↳ AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad            id=15   [slave  pointer \n  (2)]\n\nSo my touchpad's id is 15.\nSo, using this command, I am able to turn my touchpad off:\nxinput set-int-prop 15 \"Device Enabled\" 8 0\n\nAnd back on:\nxinput set-int-prop 15 \"Device Enabled\" 8 1\n\nThis is the same command issued by your enable/disable touchpad hotkey on your keyboard, so you'll still be able to turn the touchpad back on at any time if you need it.\nSo now, all that's left is to make this command run whenever you turn your computer on. Probably the easiest way to do this this is to add the command to your startup applications. In Unity, just search for Startup Applications in the dash.\nIf you're using Mate, the tool is under \"System -> Preferences -> Personal -> Startup Applications.\"\nUsing the startup applications method to run the command, the touchpad will still be active on the login screen and on the profiles of other user accounts. If you want to make the command run system-wide during startup, this question has some helpful answers to get you started.\nOther sources:\nhttp://wpkg.org/Disable_/_enable_keyboard_and_mouse_in_Linux\n", "Q: How can I make Ubuntu 100% installed and portable I want to make Ubuntu 14.0.4 full installed and portable to a USB, so I don't have to use windows at my school, I've tried heaps of methods and I don't know how, I am running windows 7 and the USB is 8gigs\n\nA: (please note this answer is a best guess, so take it with a grain of salt)\nYou would to boot from a different Ubuntu live USB, with the destination USB also plugged in, but empty.

It is used to examine the capabilities of a server, the predefined values for various parameters used in communicating between clients and the server, and the different types of screens and visuals that are available.\nThe command to get the monitor size is:\nxdpyinfo | grep dimensions\n\nResult\ndimensions:    1366x768 pixels (361x203 millimeters)\n\n\nA: Another option, using xrandr, is the command:\nxrandr | grep ' connected'\n\nOutput:\nDVI-I-1 connected primary 1680x1050+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 473mm x 296mm\nVGA-1 connected 1280x1024+1680+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 376mm x 301mm\n\n(mind the space before connected, else disconnected will be included)\nImportant differences between xdpyinfo and xrandr\n\n\n*\n\n*While xrandr lists screens separately (in case of multiple monitors), xdpyinfo outputs one single set of dimensions for all screens together (\"desktop size\" instead of screen size)\n\n*As noticed by @agold there is (quite) a difference between the two, which seems too big to be a simple rounding difference:\nxrandr: 473mm x 296mm\nxdpyinfo: 445x278\n\nIt seems related to a bug in xdpyinfo. See also here.\nIf you'd insist on inches\nUse the small script below; it outputs the size of your screen(s) in inches; width / height / diagonal (inches)\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n# change the round factor if you like\nr = 1\n\nscreens = [l.split()[-3:] for l in subprocess.check_output(\n    [\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip().splitlines() if \" connected\" in l]\n\nfor s in screens:\n    w = float(s[0].replace(\"mm\", \"\")); h = float(s[2].replace(\"mm\", \"\")); d = ((w**2)+(h**2))**(0.5)\n    print([round(n/25.4, r) for n in [w, h, d]])\n\nTo use it:\nCopy the script into an empty file, save it as get_dimensions.py, run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/get_dimensions.py\n\nOutput on my two screens:\nwidth - height - diagonal (inches)\n\n[18.6, 11.7, 22.0]\n[14.8, 11.9, 19.0]\n\n\n\nEdit\nFancy version of the same script (with a few improvements and a nicer output), looking like:\nScreen  width   height  diagonal\n--------------------------------\nDVI-I-1 18.6    11.7    22.0\nVGA-1   14.8    11.9    19.0\n\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n# change the round factor if you like\nr = 1\n\nscreens = [l.split() for l in subprocess.check_output(\n    [\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip().splitlines() if \" connected\" in l]\n\nscr_data = []\nfor s in screens:\n    try:\n        scr_data.append((\n            s[0],\n            float(s[-3].replace(\"mm\", \"\")),\n            float(s[-1].replace(\"mm\", \"\"))\n            ))\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n\nprint((\"\\t\").join([\"Screen\", \"width\", \"height\", \"diagonal\\n\"+32*\"-\"]))\nfor s in scr_data:\n    scr = s[0]; w = s[1]/25.4; h = s[2]/25.4; d = ((w**2)+(h**2))**(0.5)\n    print((\"\\t\").join([scr]+[str(round(n, 1)) for n in [w, h, d]]))\n\n\nEDIT 2 (May 2019)\n\"Kind of\" on request (in a comment), a modernized / more advanced / improved (no system calls, no parsing but using Gdk.Display) version, doing pretty much exactly the same:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport gi\ngi.require_version('Gdk', '3.0')\nfrom gi.repository import Gdk\n\ndsp = Gdk.Display.get_default()\nn_mons = dsp.get_n_monitors()\n\nprint((\"\\t\").join([\"Screen\", \"width\", \"height\", \"diagonal\\n\"+32*\"-\"]))\n\nfor i in range(n_mons):\n    mon = dsp.get_monitor(i)\n    mon_name = mon.get_model()\n    w = mon.get_width_mm()/25.4\n    h = mon.get_height_mm()/25.4\n    d = ((w**2)+(h**2))**(0.5)\n    print((\"\\t\").join([mon_name]+[str(round(n, 1)) for n in [w, h, d]]))\n\nOutput:\nScreen  width   height  diagonal\n--------------------------------\neDP-1   20.0    11.3    23.0\nHDMI-1  18.6    11.7    22.0\n\nI will leave the original answer, since it seems inappropriate to remove the answer after such a long time, that generated the existing votes.\n\nA: How'bout this :\nxrandr | awk '/ connected/{print sqrt( ($(NF-2)/10)^2 + ($NF/10)^2 )/2.54\" inches\"}'\nand through SSH :\nssh server DISPLAY=:0 xrandr | awk '/ connected/{print sqrt( ($(NF-2)/10)^2 + ($NF/10)^2 )/2.54\" inches\"}'\n\nA: Just in case you want a more general answer, you can cut the the gordian knot, and use a non-geeky physical ruler for that. As per this wiki, the \"size of a screen is usually described by the length of its diagonal\":\n\nIf you have a ruler that only displays centimeters, you can use the simple conversion:\n1 cm = 0.393701 in\n(or 2.54 cm = 1 in)\n\nSo if your ruler measures 30 centimeters, your screen is 11.811 inches. You can also use google with a query of the form 30 cm to in.\n\nImage credits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Display_size_measurements.png\n\nA: This was something that I too was struggling with(when I wanted to upgrade to a new monitor for myself and wanted to know what size my old monitor was), so I wrote a shell script that finds the monitor size for you. \nI used the xdpyinfo from the first answer to get the screen dimensions and built ahead on it. The script essentially computes the diagonal from the screen dimensions, converting from millimeters to inches and displays the result.\nRepository URL: https://github.com/abhishekvp/WhatsMyScreenSize\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Terminal broken characters It doesn't matter if gnome-terminal or xfce4-terminal is used, I got always some broken characters in my terminal window.\n\n\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 15.10\n\n*Ubuntu Mono, UTF-8 encoding\n\n*ZSH \n\n\nAny tips would be appreciated.\n\nA: This is a known bug: \nhttps://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=403130\nThe solution \"is practically impossible.

How can I do it?\nI have tried a very simple example I have found on the internet but it erases the file instead:\ncat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default| sed -e 's/^[ \\t]*//' > /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n\nA: This:\ncat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default| sed -e 's/^[ \\t]*//' > /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\ntruncates the file because the > redirection is resolved first; i.e. the file is truncated before cat and sed are run (and cat reads an empty file).\nAlso the command strips leading spaces and tabulations.\nIf that's what you want, just use the in place option of sed (and to drop the useless cat):\nsed -ie 's/^[ \\t]*//' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\nIf you want to remove only leading spaces, use this command instead:\nsed -ie 's/^ *//' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n\nAlso it looks like you want to process only the first line.\nIf that's the case, prepend a 1 to the s command; i.e.:\nsed -ie '1s/^[ \\t]*//' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\nto strip leading spaces and tabulations from the first line and\nsed -ie '1s/^ *//' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\nto remove only leading spaces from the first line.\n\nA: Use this instead:\ncat 1.txt | sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//' | sed '/^$/d' > 2.txt\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*cat 1.txt - loads the file content as input  \n\n*sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//' - removes empty spaces from both sides of the file. Beginning or trailing.  \n\n*sed '/^$/d' - removes empty lines (in case left by the above command)  \n\n*> 2.txt - saves the result into a new file.\n\n\nIn case you don't want to remove the empty lines, skip step three. In which case your command becomes:\ncat 1.txt | sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//' > 2.txt\n\nExample\nInput text (as image, dots show spaces): \n\nOutput text (as image, No dots and empty lines removed): \n\nEDIT\nThe above explanation empties a file if redirected onto itself as shown below:\ncat 1.txt | sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//' | sed '/^$/d' > 1.txt\n\nTo handle this and make sure the content is re-written into the file, we just have to echo the output out as in the command below:\necho | cat 1.txt | sed 's/^ *//;s/ *$//' | sed '/^$/d' > 1.txt\n\n\nA: You could also use Python (both Python 2 or Python 3) for the job:\npython -c 'import sys; print(\"\".join((str(line).lstrip(\" \") for line in sys.stdin)))' <INPUTFILE >OUTPUTFILE\n\nWhat this command does:\n\n\n*\n\n*python -c '...' or python3 -c '...':\nStart the Python (2 or 3) interpreter and let it run the commands in the quotes.\n\n*import sys; print(\"\".join((str(line).lstrip(\" \") for line in sys.stdin))):\nThis is a little Python script compressed to one single line that reads everything from STDIN (standard input stream) and prints it back to STDOUT (standard output stream) after having removed all whitespace characters (including spaces, tabs, etc.) from the beginning of each line. It will continue reading until the stream ends, that means either until you manually type Ctrl+D if STDIN is connected to the keyboard, or until all the data has passed through if STDIN is connected to a file or pipe.\n\n*<INPUTFILE:\nThis connects the file INPUTFILE (replace with appropriate file name) with the command's STDIN.

How my sidebar normally looks and How it looks after opening a folder\nWhy? Normally it was all stacked as one single symbol.\n\nA: Something in how Ubuntu launches Files might have changed in an update. That means that the launched Files doesn't have the exact same command line as the linked Files.\nYou could probably fix it by right-clicking the opened folder, select Lock to launcher, and the removing the original, normal Files icon by right-clicking it, and selecting Unlock from launcher. Then you move the \"new\" icon up to the position of the old icon, and it should work as before.\n", "Q: Terminal closes when executing apt-get Each time I execute apt-get update, my terminal closes unexpectedly in the middle of the execution.\nI think that happened because my /var/cache/apt/archives file was removed.\nIs it possible to \"reinstall\" apt-get or reset it?\nThanks\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get install -f (fix broken).\nIf that does not work, reinstall it with sudo dpkg -i package_name. \nYou can download apt here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/apt.\n", "Q: Rename on move with placeholder / wildcard Lets say I have the following files\n/home/user/test1.java\n/home/user/test2.java\n/home/user/test3.java\n/home/user/test1.java.orig\n/home/user/test2.java.orig\n/home/user/test3.java.orig\n\nI want the overwrite the files without the .orig extension with those files having it, eg /home/user/test1.java.orig -> /home/user/test1.java and so on.\nIs there some command like the following?\nmv /home/user/*.orig /home/user/*\n\nwhere I can use the placeholder from the source in the destination definition and where I can specify that I want to overwrite?\n\nA: for file in /home/usr/* ; do mv \"$file\" \"${file//.orig/}\" ; done\n\nShould do the trick for you, it loops through all of the files (and directories) in /home/user by using glob expansion, and replaces any instance of the string .orig with nothing, so deletes it.\nIt should be fine so long as you don't have any subdirectories with .orig in their name. This will give you some error messages which aren't critical, but may be annoying. To only work on the files which have a .orig extension you can insert a conditional check whether the file has the unwanted extension:\nfor file in /home/user/* ; do [[ $file = *.orig ]] && mv \"$file\" \"${file//.orig/}\" ; done\n\n\nA: for file in $(find /home/user/* -name \"*.orig\") ; do mv $file ${file//.orig/} ; done\n\nThis will only move the files with the given extension, and also runs recursively through subdirectories.\nIf recursion should be turned off, on can add -maxdepth 1 to the find command.\n", "Q: website goes to a different ip address I am maintaining a website, pcc.edu.ph , I can't seem to access it since yesterday and I tried to ping the website, it pings back but gives me a different IP not the IP provided by my DNS.

But you can also pick \"something else\" and do it yourself. \nFor starters pick the 1st option. In the future when you get better with this you might want to decided on a partition setup you like.\n-all- partition methods are fine as long as / is something like 20Gb or more. You can use 1 big part, use 1 for root and 1 for /home, or no /home, use a part for a /data/ disk. It will all work and it is more of a preference.\nMy preference: I like my personal data on a separate partition (/discworld/). My /home/$USER/ directories are on that partition so I just copy \"users-dirs.dirs\" over and all is set as I need it to be. A format of my system I can do at any time where I do not need to worry about contents of / and /home/.

The first few days Wifi/Bluetooth worked just fine.\nWell, actually the Wifi was constantly disconnecting so I bought D-Link DWA-121 external USB Wifi Adapter (no bluetooth). This adapter was recognized by the system, but I couldn't get it to work either. The network manager was activating the PCI Wifi always.\nAfter a few reboots of the system my Bluetooth (from the PCI Wifi) disappeared. I'm getting the No Bluetooth adapters found message in the default Gnome Bluetooth manager.\n\nA: Wifi\nAt the time of writing the Intel's 8260 Wifi card is pretty new. It is officially supported by the kernel shipped with Ubuntu 15.10 onward. In case of a Slow Or Erratic Wi-Fi In Ubuntu 12.04 LTS? Try Wicd:\n# install Wicd\nsudo apt-get install wicd\n# remove the default Network Manager that ships with Ubuntu\nsudo apt-get remove --purge network-manager\n\nWhile I can't say that my Wifi issues have disappeared altogether at least I'm aware exactly what's going on at any given time, because Wicd shows you much more useful information than the default network manager that ships with Ubuntu. It also stores your Wifi password, so you are no longer constantly asked about your password when the manager is trying to automatically reconnect you.\nIn case you have external USB Wifi adapter you can easily switch between the two:\n# list network devices\nsudo lshw -C network\n\nCopy the logical name of the network adapter you want to use in Wicd - Preferences - General Settings - Wireless interface\nBluetooth\nWhat I noticed with this particular Intel's 8260 Wifi adapter is that the Bluetooth can become a bit laggy from time to time, especially if your divce's batteries are about to die.\nAnother thing is that after a couple of sleep-wakeup cycles the Intel's Bluetooth adapter entry tends to disappear. No matter what command you use in the shell it's simply gone. Probably until system restart or something which is not an option for me.\nSo, I bought a cheap external USB Bluetooth nano adapter and I'm using it for that. I'm using the Intel's Wifi strictly for, well, Wifi. The external Bluetooth adapter works always and it delivers a bit smoother performance than the Intel's one.\nI'm using Blueman to manage my devices:\nsudo apt-get install blueman\n\nIt also allows you to switch between different Bluetooth adapters (when the Intel's one is actually present :)\n", "Q: How to install cmake,ccmake from source?

If the compilation of the ncurses program fails, the BUILD_CursesDialog variable is unset. If libncurses5-dev is installed, the ncurses program builds and thus, the Makefile generated for cmake upon bootstrap also has instructions to build ccmake.\nWith this understanding of the current build process, the sequence of steps listed by augre are to be followed. Additionally, remember to also clean any temporary build files first (coming from a similar experience, I believe this is what s.k. did not do, and found an admirable :) hack to work around).\nThus, for me, running off git, the process is:\n\n\n*\n\n*git clean -f -d\n\n\nReplicate augre's solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*install libncurses5-dev\n\n*Reconfigure/compile/install cmake\n\n*Potentially restart terminal\n\n", "Q: Find/generate standard PPD file when installing a printer from command line I need to install a network printer using the command line.

Echo doesn't require spaces between arguments, it just takes them.\nSo echo $'$foo' expands to run the command $ (which isn't a command so it ignores it) and then echo '$foo'. Anything in '' is taken at face value - it doesn't expand it or anything. You can put what you want in '' and nothing happens.\nIf you replace the $ with $$ it echos the process ID.\n\nSecond:\n\necho $\"$foo\"\n\nThis echos pwd (which means the bash expands $foo, my variable, to its value)\n\nThat's because \"\" doesn't prevent it expanding. \"\" is normally used to ensure there is a value to compare to.\nIf you have a variable that could be empty (e.g. it is from a grep result) then you want to compare to another value / variable, you have to put the first variable in \"\". This ensures that there is always a comparison to check, rather than just an empty section of code (as bash sees) which gives an error.\n\nFinally, number 3. This is interesting.\n\necho $`$foo`\n\nThis echos $~/scripts (I expected it to print ~/scripts and not $~/scripts)\n\nThat's because (in this case) echo is printing the $ character first. Putting something in backticks causes the value of the variable to be run as a command (the better way to do it in more recent versions of bash is $(command))\nSo first it echos $ then it expands ​`$foo`​ to ​`pwd`​ which is run and returns ~/Scripts. But we had the $ print earlier - so the whole output is $~/Scripts.\n\nA: *\n\n*echo $'$foo': the $'[...]' token around $foo interprets $foo literally (as $foo) and tries to expand ANSI C-like escape sequences in it, which are not present, so echo yields $foo;\n\n*echo $\"$foo\": the $\"[...]\" token around $foo expands $foo to its value (pwd) and tries to translate it if the current locale is not POSIX / C; this is not happening, because either the current locale is POSIX / C or a translation for pwd is not available, so echo yields pwd;\n\n*echo $`$foo`: the `[...]` token around $foo allows the expansion of $foo, so $foo is expanded to its value (pwd); the expanded value is run in a subshell, whose output (~/scripts) replaces the whole `[...]` token, so echo yields the $ token followed by the ~/scripts token ($~/scripts).\n\n\nUltimately, the last one prints $~/scripts because $`foo` is a combination of a literal $ followed by a command substitution; so the leading $ is interpreted as a literal $ and the trailing `$foo` as a command substitution.\n", "Q: How to connect two or more mp4 files?

If you do not install ALSA then you might get a message when testing that says you have no audio devices.\nYou can find out more about ALSA here: http://www.alsa-project.org/\nConfiguring and Compiling PortAudio\nYou can build PortAudio in Linux Environments using the standard configure/make tools:\n./configure && make\n\nThat will build PortAudio using Jack, ALSA and OSS in whatever combination they are found on your system. For example, if you have Jack and OSS but not ALSA, it will build using Jack and OSS but not ALSA. This step also builds a number of tests, which can be found in the bin directory of PortAudio. It's a good idea to run some of these tests to make sure PortAudio is working correctly.\nUsing PortAudio in your Projects\nTo use PortAudio in your apps, you can simply install the .so files:\nsudo make install\n\nProjects built this way will expect PortAudio to be installed on target systems in order to run. If you want to build a more self-contained binary, you may use the libportaudio.a file:\ncp lib/.libs/libportaudio.a /YOUR/PROJECT/DIR\n\nOn some systems you may need to use:\ncp /usr/local/lib/libportaudio.a /YOUR/PROJECT/DIR\n\nYou may also need to copy portaudio.h, located in the include/ directory of PortAudio into your project. Note that you will usually need to link with the approriate libraries that you used, such as ALSA and JACK, as well as with librt and libpthread. For example:\ngcc main.c libportaudio.a -lrt -lm -lasound -ljack -pthread -o YOUR_BINARY\n\nReference\n\nA: The following worked for me on Ubuntu 16.04:\nsudo apt-get install libasound-dev portaudio19-dev libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg libav-tools\n\n", "Q: Upgrade from ubuntu 14.04 to 15.10 How can be performed upgrade from 14.04 to 15.10? Is it enough to replace \"trusty\" as \"wily\" in sources.list and then run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?\n\nA: You can not skip normal Ubuntu releases. You can upgrade one version at a time, which means you have to through 14.04 to 14.10 then 15.04 and finally 15.10. Alternatively you can upgrade LTS to LTS. which means you can wait for 16.04 and upgrade directly from 14.04 to 16.04. Modifying sources.list wont help at all.\n", "Q: Which system folders can I mount to RAM drive safely? I recently made a full installation of Ubuntu 15.10 to a USB drive. \nIn order to make it faster, using RAM, I made /tmp folder to mount on RAM on boot, by adding this line to fstab:\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,mode=1777 0 0\nWhich other system folders is safe to move to RAM in the same manner?\nBy \"safe\" I mean folders that their contents either never change or the changes in them won't be needed after reboot.\nI accept the risks from power failure, bad hardware or RAM getting overloaded.\n\nA: Knowing that this is over a year old, I still feel the need to jump in here. For cases where I had loads of free (really never used) RAM I suffered from the same non-answers to a similar request, yet I always noticed that the systems were NOT using up all possible/available RAM. What I ended up doing was: I put as many of /etc /var /usr and /home into ramdisk as I could fit (I had about 12 GB RAM for that), and rsynced back to disk with a cron-job each of the mounted parts, so I would have a backup in case of power-failure. I also created an unload to disk before shutdown/reboot, and a return copy to RAM at boot using /etc/rc.local, so the machine would always be able to reboot and lose nothing. Rest assured that I've never even once needed the backup! And it's been running that way for 3 years on a debian server. Blazing fast IO response time by the way.\nUsing tmpfs for it wasn't any good, certain software seemed to not want to run from tmpfs, but would run fine from a separate ramdisk I mounted. And I did have to use special mount options for some software that doesn't like to run from ram, but they are all use-case specific.\n\nA: You're essentially asking \"What system folders can I load into RAM rather than save on the disk\".\nThe short and vague answer is that \"You can load any folders into RAM by making them 'tmpfs' mount points in /etc/fstab, if and only if the folders contain temporary files or items that do not need to survive reboots\", and, \"We cannot answer this question with any specificity because there is no bounds on the scope of the question.\"\nThe longer, but equally as vague, answer is \"What can or cannot be loaded into RAM cannot be described in the scope of a short answer here\".  Different systems and software handle caching of information, or storage of temporary files, slightly differently, and none of them are usually designed to utilize a tmpfs/ramdisk to store those files, as some of them need their caches to survive reboots.\nFor all intents and purposes, the only 'safe' directory for being loaded into RAM this way is /tmp, as the contents of that directory are extrememly regularly erased, by reboots.  It should be kept in mind, though, that if you want to do this with /tmp you will likely need to give it a larger amount of ramdisk space (such as 1024MB or 1GB) which will detract from your available memory on the system.\n\nTL;DR: Within the scope of this site, /tmp is one of the few items that can be sanely put into a RAM disk / tmpfs space.  We cannot comment on whether any other system directories can be loaded into tmpfs, as we do not know the needs of your system, the needs of the software you need, nor what your ultimate goal is with such an endeavor.\n\nA: After putting the /tmp into ram and Firefox's cache (which it sounds like you did), the easiest way to improve performance for browsing, casual use, it to use the guest session, which is run out of ram.  The desktop environment writes a large number of (hidden) files, so that gives you a big boost.  Forgo any failure analysis, and put /var/log into ram too.  Really, sounds like you want a persistent live media with the \"toram\" key on the boot line -- which copies the filesystem into ram and gives you really snappy (better than a hard disk) performance on first invocation).  The USB filesystem will use caching anyway, so invocations after the first should be faster. Check out other locations with heavy writes with iotop, and consider putting them into ram.\n", "Q: How do I link the OpenAL library to eclipse in Ubuntu? I just downloaded the OpenAL library using the command sudo apt-get install libopenal1 libopenal-dev, now I can't find where the library is on my system and how should it be linked with Eclipse. I am new to Ubuntu hence I am not familiar with how Ubuntu's file system works. \nThanks in Advance.  \n\nA: As far as I can tell, the libopenal-dev package installs its headers to /usr/include/AL/ so (since /usr/include is a standard search path) provided you include them as <AL/whatever.h> you should not need to do anything else. \nSimilarly, the library goes in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ (or its 32-bit equivalent) so it should just be a matter of adding openal to the list of libraries in your project settings.\nFYI since the package appears to provide a .pc file, you can always run pkg-config --cflags --libs on the command line and copy the relevant flags and settings from there.\n", "Q: How to change index.html file in apache from normal user when apache is installed in root? I work in Ubuntu 14.04. Well, I always had the misconception that installing a software from the root user makes the software available to all users. So, I wanted to install apache and add my html pages over there. I installed apache using root user. It installed successfully.\nThen to test apache, I typed localhost, and the default page came up successfully. So then I thought about changing the index.html page and adding my code. I was making all my .html files in gedit, and thus tried to change index.html in gedit. When I tried to open it, it told me I could open it in only read-only mode, and I could not change it. Then I figured out that I could not change the permissions, nor change the file in the normal user. \nI thought about it for a while, and thought removing the index.html file and adding my on file would work.

My guess is the application is already running; it may be configured such that it loads at boot or loaded right after installation.  It may also be the case that this is a temporary thing and when you reboot or log off you'll have to run the command to execute aiStarter again.\nThe second problem you have is that you're missing a lot of libraries - including the 32-bit version of libstdc++.  My guess is you'll need a lot of libraries, so lets go ahead and install build-essential.  This pulls in a lot more than just libstdc++, but it may help resolve a majority of the 'missing library' issues you're going to be seeing.\n", "Q: .vmx .vmdk files not opening on VMPlayer I am completing a University Assignment and I copied the .vmx, .vmdk, .vmxf, .vmsd files onto my USB stick from the labs and am working from home. \nI installed Ubuntu 14 on my windows 8.01 laptop.

For example there is the PID 1 zombie reaping problem, which I think should be fixed by docker developers and not by the community with some init process workaround. Another argument against docker, that the server has very limited resources, so it would be better not to use virtual machines.)\n\nA: Generally best practice is to run services as a non-root user.\nOn my Ubuntu system, installing neo4j defaulted to running neo4j as a user name neo4j.  If you are install from the official repos, using apt-get, this should be an non issue.  Those users should not be in any groups that can gain root privileges like wheel, suers or admin.

I know that if there is a package some-package, that I can run the command sudo apt-get install some-package=version-i-want to get the version that I want. However, if my understanding is correct, this only works if that version exists in the Wily repo, and the versions that were current for Precise probably don't (as well the shouldn't).\nMy question is, is there a good way to downgrade to a very old version of a package through apt-get? If not is there some other good, repeatable way to do it? I know that there are other solutions that involve using an older version of Ubuntu on my dev machine or in a virtual machine, or using a newer version in production machines, but I am not asking about this kind of solution in the present question. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!\n\nA: I have found that if I go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and add to that url <old-release-name>/<old-package-name> I can download and install versions of old-package from the repo for old-release. \nFor example, if I am running Wily, but want to get the version of the python-tz package that is available in the Precise repository, I can go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/python-tz and find it there.\nThis is the kind of solution I was looking for.

Is it as simple as partitioning /usr, /lib, and /bin to another disk? or is that not possible? Any help would be appreciated.\nOne thing to point out: I am asking this, because I know you are able to do this on Windows 10 by changing the default installation drive via settings, But I do not want to use windows 10, as the licence terms are too strict in my opinion. \n\nA: \nIs it as simple as partitioning /usr/, /lib/, and /bin/ to another disk?\n\nYes. And maybe /var/, /etc/ and /opt/ too (depending on usage).\nI would not bother. The only 3 things I would leave of the SSD are tmp filesystems, swap and the directories inside your users /home/. The 1st 2 you do during mounting. The 3rd you can do by editing /home/$USER/.config/user-dirs.dirs.\n\nA: Yes you can do that.\nYou have several choices - like mount /dev/sdb(b is for the second drive generally) so let's say your ubuntu partition on second hard drive is at /dev/sdb2 - then mount that into /etc/fstab\nBut better approach is LVM as you can change the partition sizes later and it's flexible. But it's not as straight forward as the previous method i mentioned above.\nAt the time of installation make use of LVM for your second drive(2TB hard drive). You can make some logical volumes like /opt, /usr, /home, /var into that and work accordingly.\nI tried to do it after the install(as i added the additional hard drive into my working Ubuntu). I got success to have my /var into the second drive and others - i have some problem. But i will say do it at the time of installation itself. \nYou can refer to my detailed thread and it has got a lot of pointers to help others.\nAfter going thru the LVM route /opt is on second drive where i install all the applications.\nThis is how my second drive looks like - it has Windows partion as well as Linux.

Use your browser (on apaches computer) to look at http://127.0.0.1 and see if anything loads. http://127.0.0.1:8080 will be apaches default page if you configured it for 8080.\nAnother useful command ... apachectl configtest\n\nYou may need to check what other programs you have installed recently. Usually config files are located in /etc// and man <program name> e.g: man apache2 to see command options etc.\n\nA: If I'm interpreting your quesiton right, you have 'nginx' on the system already.  This will always consume your Port 80 process in its default setup.\nThree options to fix:\n\n(1) You want to keep NGINX, but have nginx run on a different port.\nIf you want to keep NGINX, then edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/default and change listen 80 to listen 8080, then run sudo service nginx restart.\n\n(2) You want to keep NGINX on Port 80, and have Apache run on a different port.\nRefer to Teoma's answer.\n\n(3) You don't want to keep NGINX at all.\nYou can easily get rid of it, I think.\nRun these commands in this order:\nsudo apt-get remove nginx nginx-full nginx-common nginx-light nginx-extras nginx-core\nsudo service apache2 stop\nsudo service apache2 start\n\nThis should have Apache then load as expected.\n", "Q: Amazon Prime videos play, but not in HD, citing HDCP error (HD Videos Unavailable, HDCP) On Windows it works fine with this setup, so it's an Ubuntu issue. I am running HDCP capable HDMI cables to an HDCP capable TV as a dual monitor from an HDCP capable graphics card.\n\n\nA: The protected content would not be streamed over unprotected media. High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection usually authenticated all devices in chain. So that include application->Display Driver->Graphics Card-> Serializer(on host side) -> deserializer(on display device side) -> Display Device. HDCP usually encrypt data when transferred over cables(HDMI etc). But software that renders data can request underlying device content protection status. So things can go wrong at lots of places. \nProblem is most likely with driver of your display adapter/associate serializer. You can try to get latest graphics driver for display adapter and display monitor. Also how are playing video via desktop app or web browser?\nHope this helps\n\nA: HDCP is a work in progress. I'm not sure about the status, but comparing the first patch of the RFC to the code of linux-4.13-rc6 I see it didn't land yet.\nStay tuned, I'm pretty sure the day HDCP get the whole stack from kernel through DRM (as in Direct Rendering Manager) to userspace up and running you'll see a big article on Phoronix. It's a slow work because of other things in priority, and because any kind of DRM (as in Digital Rights Management) have always been a subject of hot controversy.\n\nA: The only way to get Amazon HD video streamed was through the flash stream through Firefox using the HAL PPA\nthis is the link to that:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2015/09/how-to-watch-hulu-on-ubuntu-1404-up\nI'm not sure if it still works because I don't use flash anymore\nThe html5 stream works but HD is not supported at this time.\nAlthough tv shows do come through in HD. Just not movies.\nSince I run linux exclusively the best solution for me:\nBuy a roku. A roku 2 is about 35 bucks on amazon and it will stream anything\namazon, netflix, hbo, etc.\nIf you need a QHD or UHD get roku premiere.\n", "Q: How do I change nameserver in Ubuntu?

The chip when present on the motherboard is used for securely producing cryptographic keys and securing the hardware components. Several laptop motherboards (and many desktop boards) have such TPM chips.\nThe message you receive means: Either the chip is available but not recognized or it is absent. The message itself is harmless.\nFor your system, from the specs I see that there is a TPM chip (ver 1.2) onboard.\nYou can check in your BIOS under security or trusted computing section for TPM and deactivate it. Most probably this will stop the errors. \n\nASPM\nASPM stands for Active State Power Management whose purpose is to save power in order to extend battery life on portable devices like laptops.

If not I can write more dedicated instruction.\n", "Q: Editing ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs does not permanently change user directory locations So it appears the same is happening to me on Ubuntu 14.04 as has previously been reported as a bug here\nA difference though is I am trying to move the Home directory folders to a separate drive and am simply trying to follow the instructions here (scroll down to Configure Your Subfolders (Linux))\nTL;DR: Attempt 1 and 2 are the important ones that really show my problem. Rest just there to show what else I've tried.\nAttempt 1\nI found a question with no accepted answer that has what appears to be precisely my problem.\nFollowing the first suggested solution I tried using symbolic links:\ncornelis@Bob:~$ ln -s /media/cornelis/Storage/Home/Documents /home/cornelis/Documents\n\nThis created the folder that linked to my other drive. I then tried modifying the user-dirs.dirs file as before such that XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents/Documents\" where the symbolic link folder was created. I logged out and logged back in and presto! It worked! I see that the Documents shortcut links to $HOME/Documents/Documents, the user-dirs.dirs file is still appropriately modified. Looks like the change is permanent. Though less than ideal since I have to use a Documents inside a Documents folder. I cannot do something as follows that I had hoped would redirect the Documents folder directly:\ncornelis@Bob:~$ ln -s /media/cornelis/Storage/Home/Documents /home/cornelis\nln: failed to create symbolic link ‘/home/cornelis/Documents’: File exists\n\nI reboot. Disaster. Click image below.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The Documents folder is missing from the Places shortcut\n\n*The original Documents folder is now vanilla\n\n*The symbolic link inside the Documents folder is broken\n\n\nAlso, this reverted again: XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/\"\nI used xdg-user-dirs-update --force to reset Documents back to its default.\nAttempt 2\nFinally, I looked at the second suggested solution and I guess I can now safely assume that my problem is that my second drive isn't being mounted automatically upon boot. Since I have no issue creating symbolic links from logging off and logging in deduce I need an automatic systemwide mount. And this I'm afraid is where I'm pretty lost, seems quite the dense read though I did try to make heads and tails of it. I think I'm supposed to Edit Ubuntu's filesystem table, but I don't know what entry to add and the example they provide doesn't make it clear to me how I can automatically mount a drive on startup. \nHere is my fstab file. Perhaps you can tell me what I need to modify here or how to arrive at knowing what to add here? My 1TB HDD drive that I want my Documents folder to be in is on sda3\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).\n#\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n# / was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=<hidden> /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sda6 during installation\nUUID=<hidden> none            swap    sw              0       0\n/Storage/16GiB.swap  none  swap  sw  0 0\n\nAttempt 3\nIf I change XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\" to XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"/media/cornelis/Storage/Home/Documents\" it becomes XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/\" upon reboot. \nChanging user-dirs.conf such that enabled=False I had hoped that \n\n\"When set to False, xdg-user-dirs-update will not change the XDG\"\n\nso something else is causing changes in user-dirs.dirs to be impermanent? \nAttempt 4\nI ran xdg-user-dirs-update after saving my changes in user-dirs.dirs. Nothing is displayed and a reboot results in the same problem as before. I also tried \ncornelis@Bob:/etc/xdg$ xdg-user-dirs-update --force\nMoving DOCUMENTS directory from /media/cornelis/Storage/Home/Documents to Documents\n\nAnd sure enough, this results in what I changed in user-dirs.dirs. to revert back, which doesn't seem to make sense since the documentation states:\n\n   --force\n       Update existing user-dirs.dir, but force a full reset. This means:\n       Don't reset nonexisting directories to HOME, rather recreate the\n       directory. Never use backwards compatible non-translated names.\n       Always recreate user-dirs.locale.\n\n\nAttempt 5\nThis also didn't work:\ncornelis@Bob:~$ xdg-user-dirs-update --set DOCUMENTS /media/cornelis/Storage/Home/Documents\ncornelis@Bob:~$ \n\nAttempt 6\nI Crawl into the fetal position and beg for help from Ask Ubuntu. Help me Ask Ubuntu, you are my only hope.\n\nA: I figure it is bad form to leave my question without an answer. I eventually resolved all issues by following bessman's solution by the letter. He made it much clearer than the official docs how I was supposed to modify fstab - and now I also know how to create backups before I do so and got rid of the \"documents inside a documents folder\" issue - so triple props to his step-by-step solution. I wish I could upvote him twice since nothing else seemed to work.\n\nA: I use KDE4 and I've found that the paths are reverted upon reboot, even though I set the drive to automount at boot via KDE's \"Removable devices\" (something like that name, I use a localized KDE).\nI've solved the issue by putting the following into \"/etc/rc.local\":\nsu username -c 'xdg-user-dirs-update --set DOCUMENTS \"/media/username/Data/Documents\"'\nsu username -c 'xdg-user-dirs-update --set MUSIC \"/media/username/Data/Music\"'\nsu username -c 'xdg-user-dirs-update --set PICTURES \"/media/username/Data/Pictures\"'\nsu username -c 'xdg-user-dirs-update --set VIDEOS \"/media/username/Data/Videos\"'\n\nwhere \"username\" is of course to be changed with your name.\n\nA: Can you try this :\necho \"enabled=true\"  > ~/.config/user-dirs.conf\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set DOCUMENTS ~/Storage/Home/Documents\"\necho \"enabled=false\" > ~/.config/user-dirs.conf\nxdg-user-dir DOCUMENTS\n\nand type this after reboot :\nxdg-user-dir DOCUMENTS\n", "Q: Make Roboto the default font How can I change the default font in both Gnome and Terminal to Roboto without installing any additional software?

It seems that whatever user is running the script on boot is NOT root.\nUPDATE2:\nThe updated below answer solved the problem - that addresses the issue in Ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: There are only three things I can think of that might be preventing you from connecting:\n\n*\n\n*Do you have a firewall in place? Have you unblock access to port 5903? You can do that using UFW which is a GUI for your firewall in Ubuntu.\n\n*Are you trying to access the server from outside your network? In that case you also have to forward the 5903 port on your router to access the VNC server (in addition to point 1). If you are getting this error when connecting from the same network, ignore this option but keep it in mind when connecting from outside the network.\n\n*Last one, which is silly but I wanted to cover my bases. Are you trying to connect from the same computer? I don't think x11vnc allows for loopback connections, so always try use a different computer when testing (or your phone). EDIT: after testing, it works with at least Remmina using the 192.168... local address.\n\nI also use x11vnc server on my computer, but the difference is that only the localhost can access it. I also run an SSH server, that way I have a way more secure connection, and once a user ssh to your computer, they can connect to the VNC server as a localhost.\nI hope this helps\nEDIT\nAfter trableshooting, the problem is that Ubuntu 15.10 doesn't have upstart so x11vnc will never run on boot.\nInstead, you have to create a service and make it available at boot. Here's what to do:\nsudo nano /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service\n\nInsert this into the file:\n[Unit]\nDescription=\"x11vnc\"\nRequires=display-manager.service\nAfter=display-manager.service\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -display :0 -auth guess -loop -forever -safer -shared -ultrafilexfer -bg -o /var/log/x11vnc.log -rfbauth /home/moore/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5903 -http -users moore -nowireframe\nExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nThen you can start the service with:\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl start x11vnc\n\nAnd to make the service start on boot:\nsudo systemctl enable x11vnc\n\nThis solution was previously posted by babelmonk here\n", "Q: How to solve the problem \"package is broken or not fully installed\"?

All goes well until I finish installing ubuntu and try to get back into windows. Computer starts fine, goes into the purple background boot loader, and when I try to go into windows, it goes straight into this blue background screen that says \n\"Recovery\nthere are no more BitLocker recovery options on your PC.\nYou'll need to use recovery tools. . .\nPress the Windows key for UEFI Firmware Settings\"\nI press the windows key, nothing happens.\nNow I've done a little research and I've narrowed the problem down to what I think is the boot loader. I want to try to delete the Ubuntu boot loader and use the Windows one (then remove ubuntu for now), but all resources i've found required me to have windows working :/ \nIs this even the right answer? Has anyone else encountered this? How do I start using the original windows boot loader if I don't have access to windows? \nThanks! \n\nA: I have a number of suggestions, none of them guaranteed to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the computer's built-in boot manager to select which OS to boot. You can normally get to this tool by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key (usually F8 or above) soon after powering on the computer; however, there's no standardization on this, so you may have to experiment to find it. If this is successful, you should be able to boot Windows, but you'll need to use this trick every time you do so.\n\n*Type sudo efibootmgr in Linux to see your boot options. You can then adjust the boot order with the -o option, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 2,5,0 to give priority to Boot0002, then Boot0005 if that fails, and so on. This won't solve the problem per se, but it may be useful in conjunction with the preceding suggestion if you want to make Windows the default boot option -- you'd set Windows as the default, followed by Ubuntu, rather than the other way around.\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager from Ubuntu. rEFInd often does a better job of launching Windows than does GRUB, so it may work around the problem with less awkwardness than the computer's built-in boot manager. Note that if Secure Boot is enabled, when you reboot you'll need to locate and enroll a Secure Boot key (either EFI\\refind\\keys\\refind.cer or EFI\\refind\\keys\\refind_local.cer) using a rather limited user interface.\n\n*Use the Boot Repair tool. This will re-install GRUB and adjust its configuration. It might fix things, but I doubt if the odds of it helping are that great. There's also a small risk that it will make matters worse.\n\n\nTry these suggestions in whatever order you like, or ignore them altogether of course.\n", "Q: Where can I find the Unicode Emoticon set? I am trying to find a suitable font that contains the Unicode Emoticon set.\nWhen an iPhone user sends me some emoticons over Google Hangouts they render either incorrectly or not at all.\nThe problem can be seen from the following screenshot from this Wikipedia page:\n\n\nAs you can see the Diversity emoticons are particularly problematic.\niPhone users can simply pick a \"colour\" (skin colour) and that's them done. Apparently the font used on the iPhone is Helvetica.\nThose of us with Linux (in my case Ubuntu and Android) are stuck with an emoticon and an undefined symbol: . The second glyph is supposed to modify the colour of the first glyph.\nObviously, this is because the font does not have the required glyph.\nNow, I have been Googling around for a few hours and read a few pages, some of which pointing here, and there has been no solution at all. This includes all of the answers across the StackExchange network. Perhaps I'm asking the wrong question.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Symbola\n\n*Symbola706\n\n*CODE2001\n\n*CODE2002\n\n*xfonts-wqy\n\n*ttf-unifont\n\n*fonts-linuxlibertine\n\n*Open Sans Emoji\n\n*EmojiSymbols\n\n*Helvetica (though I can't remember where I downloaded it from)\n\n*Google Noto\nNone of them work. Either they are still missing the required symbols, they're missing all emoticon symbols despite claiming otherwise, they simply don't work, they don't show up as an option to select in Chrome (no idea why) or I simply can't make sense of them.\nThis page lists the symbols for \"Google\" as missing. I assume it means Android as I am receiving the message from an iPhone running the Google Hangouts app.\nSo, has anyone found a font that contains all the required symbols?\n\nA: Noto Color Emoji from google.com/get/noto/#emoji-qaae-color is only usable in Android. On Windows, that font will not install (it is considered broken.invalid), because the Windows text renderers do not support colors in fonts.\nTo display those colorful emojis, you'll need a plugin in your browser that will substitute SVG images (if the browser supports SVG), otherwise a scaled down bitmap (scaled bitmaps can be rescaled in HTML with simple CSS, on browsers that support zoom in CSS, or geometric transforms in the Canvas, so that the image will render at the expected font-size).\nHowever I have no problem at all displaying all emojis listed in the Unicode charts on Wikipedia with my browser (Chrome on Windows 10).\nBut it's true that I have installed the FULL Noto font collection (except the Color Emojis font that Windows does not want), and even made it the default in my browser (because it has coherent metrics across all scripts) and supports almost all of them, many with various styles, and most of them are well hinted.\n\"Noto\" is a fabulous collection of free fonts (with a free licence). Its development continues as Google wants it for Android in all languages of the world. Things are regularly updated to fix minor quirks. It is intended to cover all characters standardized in the Unicode/ISO 10646 repertoire.\n\"Robo\" was an initial \"fast\" fallback collection created with less care but that provided missing characters for the huge ideographic scripts. But its design was not so careful. Progressively, characters are integrated to Noto and removed from the Robo collection. Also Robo exists in only one style (for other styles such as bold and italic, the text renderer of the browser will synthesize them, notably in Chrome, but italics may be too much slanted, and strokes may collide ungracefully in complex scripts with many strokes such as sinograms: there's no such problem with Noto that even provides 6 font-weights for CJK sinograms). So, use it only as a fallback for those that have old versions of Noto in CSS like as following: font-family:Noto,Robo,sans-serif; \nThat's all what is needed (you don't need more fonts, the last fallback to sans-serif allows getting access to some OS-specific fonts that would be present for implementing characters not found in Noto and not even in early versions of Robo when using early versions of Noto).\nI really love Noto. Thanks to Google for making it fully open-sourced (and to all those that have contributed to extend it and fix quirks in complex scripts). It's definitely a huge improvement compared to what Microsoft did in the past (but only for Windows, and still with many mis-matching across world scripts).\n\nA: sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ttf-ancient-fonts\n\nThat fixed it for me on Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: It turns out that my version of Ubuntu (14.04) predates the relevant Unicode standards. Ubuntu 16.04, for example, includes updated Unicode packages.\nAfter installing fonts-symbola the emoticons are shown.\n\n\nThere are still issues with the colour modifiers but I'm hoping that this will be resolved in a later release. fonts-symbola is not available in the repositories until Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial).\n", "Q: Running Ubuntu on an HP t5710 I acquired several t5710 thin clients a while back, which all run on XPe.

I want to use them to access a server as an admin terminal, one server running Ubuntu (not set up yet) and one a legacy Magnia SG20.\n\nA: You probably want Lubuntu.

It seems that OEM install just plain does not work on server 14.04.\nI perform the same OEM install using 15.10 and everything works as expected.

It won't boot that way. You need to use some software to write its content to your USB drive. You can use Win32 Disk Imager (https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) for that. If you do this step correctly with the official Ubuntu image, your USB flash drive will become bootable.\nSECOND, If you are NOT using UEFI, in other words, if your Windows HDD is MBR, when you are asked to choose the location to install \"grub\", make sure you don't install it on your internal HDD (which is usually sda). If you do so, when you boot from your internal drive without your external HDD, the grub loader will not be able to load the grub menu - and you will not boot into any OS. If possible, install \"grub\" to your external drive. (Not sure what it is like for UEFI booting though...)\n", "Q: How do I run xrandr?

Instead you will need to use snappy install commands.\nI do not believe that xen hypervisor is available on snappy at this stage though. So you would need to talk with the team behind it to find out if they can make a port available.\n\nA: The amd64 packages are for regular 64-bit processors, and the Pi has an Arm processor. The packages for 64-bit processors will simply not be understandable for an arm processor.\nBut furthermore, a hypervisoris probably not a good way to go for a Pi. Virtual machines take up a lot of RAM memory, and the Pi has precious little. You might want tolook into some sort of multi-boot solution instead, where it might be possible to boot different OS'es on the Pi, but just one at a time.\n\nA: Although the RPi2 has Cortex-A7cores, which have virtualisation extensions in it, including a virtualised Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC). AFAIK the overall SoC does not use the GIC to route/control interrupts but instead such things are under the control of another interrupt controller which s part of the GPU (which is actually in control of the system like with RPi1 and RPi2) and is not a GIC and is not virtualisable. \nXen requires a virtualis(ed|able) GIC, and AFAIK the GPU interrupt \ncontroller does not meet the requirements.\n", "Q: How can I fix lightdm login black border?

The\n       standardized  interface  makes it possible to write just one driver for\n       each scanner  device  instead  of  one  driver  for  each  scanner  and\n       application.\n\n       While  SANE  is  primarily targeted at a UNIX environment, the standard\n       has been carefully designed to make it possible to implement the API on\n       virtually any hardware or operating system.\n\n       This  manual page provides a summary of the information available about\n       SANE.\n\n       If you have trouble getting your scanner detected,  read  the  PROBLEMS\n       section.\n\nTERMINOLOGY\n       An  application that uses the SANE interface is called a SANE frontend.\n       A driver that implements the SANE interface is called a  SANE  backend.\n       A  meta  backend  provides  some  means  to  manage  one  or more other\n       backends.\n\nSOFTWARE PACKAGES\n       The package `sane-backends' contains a lot of  backends,  documentation\n       (including the SANE standard), networking support, and the command line\n       frontend  `scanimage'.   The  frontends   `xscanimage',   `xcam',   and\n       `scanadf'  are included in the package `sane-frontends'.  Both packages\n       can      be      downloaded      from      the      SANE       homepage\n       (http://www.sane-project.org/).   Information about other frontends and\n       backends can also be found on the SANE homepage.\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n       The following sections provide short descriptions  and  links  to  more\n       information  about  several  aspects  of SANE.  A name with a number in\n       parenthesis (e.g.  `sane-dll(5)') points to a manual page. In this case\n       `man    5    sane-dll'    will   display   the   page.   Entries   like\n       `/usr/share/doc/libsane/sane.tex' are references  to  text  files  that\n       were     copied     to     the     SANE     documentation     directory\n       (/usr/share/doc/libsane/) during installation. Everything else is a URL\n       to a resource on the web.\n\n       SANE homepage\n         Information on all aspects of SANE including a tutorial and a link to\n         the   SANE   FAQ   can   be   found    on    the    SANE    homepage:\n         http://www.sane-project.org/.\n\n       SANE device lists\n         The  SANE  device  lists contain information about the status of SANE\n         support for a specific device. If your scanner is  not  listed  there\n         (either supported or unsupported), please contact us. See section HOW\n         CAN YOU HELP SANE for details. There are lists for specific  releases\n         of  SANE,  for  the  current development version and a search engine:\n         http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html.   The  lists\n         are also installed on your system at /usr/share/doc/libsane/.\n\n", "Q: KVM / QEMU / VMM : local host not connected I am using Ubuntu 14.04. I have installed kvm.

System\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 15.10 Wily\n\n*Desktop Environment: GNOME Shell 3.16.4\n\n*VPN: Astrill v2.9.3\n\n\nProblem\nI live in China. Without a VPN, I can't access many sites, including Google, Facebook, etc. Thus, I have bought the Astrill VPN and installed it on my computer.\nThe VPN works perfectly, at least on my browsers. I can access Facebook, Google, and other sites available in the U.S. on Firefox and Chromium. However, the terminal command line doesn't seem to know that I am on VPN and can access blocked sites in China.\nFor example, I can access the Google's robots.txt file by going to google.com/robots.txt on a web browser. However, when I try to download the file via the command line by typing:\nwget https://www.google.com/robots.txt\nIt just gets stuck there. I also tried writing a simple Python script with urllib2.urlopen() on a url and every blocked url I tried it on gave me a:\nurlopen error [Errno 110] Connection timed out>\nThis made me believe that the terminal command line simply doesn't recognize I have my VPN on and that I am making the wget request from my actual ip address from China.\nI always thought that VPN is a proxy that is applied system-wide, and so I thought that the terminal command line would believe that I am not in China anymore. Turns out I might be wrong and misinformed.\nWhat can be done?\nEdit:\nI installed some applications that will look up the geolocation of an IP address:\nsudo apt-get install geoip-bin geoip-database.\nI got my IP address recognized by the command line by running hostname -I.\nSo I tried to look up my geolocation by running: geoiplookup $(hostname -I)\nThe output? GeoIP Country Edition: IP Address not found\nI tried inputting the same IP address with some web apps on my browser and as expected, no luck.\n\nA: Well, I found out the problem.\nTurns out I was using my Astrill VPN configured as OpenWeb. This means that the VPN is only tunnelled via web browsers and whatnot.\nI then changed my configuration to OpenVPN, which means \"it has advanced split routing/split tunnelling features and can tunnel all applications on your computer.\" All applications meaning web browsers, and everything else including the terminal command-line. Now all my requests from the command-line are made through the VPN tunnel, and I am a happy man.\nI guess the OpenVPN configuration is the \"system-wide proxy\" that I always thought would be the configuration of all VPNs. Using OpenWeb previously explains why I can only access China's blocked sites from the web.\nIf you'd like to know more about the difference between VPN protocols - here's what Astrill has to say, but I don't know if this is applicable to all VPNs. However, I'd imagine their explanations to vary only slightly.\n", "Q: KDE Umlauts without compose key I recently switched from Windows to Kubuntu.\nI have an US international keyboard (€ sign on key 5).\nIn order to be able to type Umlauts I have to press the compose key+shift+'+vowel.

It adds a VLAN tag to the Ethernet protocol. The VLAN Tag includes for example priority handling of Ethernet messages.\neth0:1 is called virtual interface and has has not to be enabled in the kernel.\nThis is what I think:\nThe virtual Interface does not add a VLAN Tag to the Ethernet protocol.

The Fcitx configuration just changes the files in ~/.config/fcitx, so you can manually edit them. Look at these lines in ~/.config/fcitx/config, the TriggerKey has been set to SPACE not SUPER_SPACE:\n\n # Trigger Input Method\nTriggerKey=SPACE\n\nThe Fix\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually change Line 3 of ~/.config/fcitx/config to TriggerKey=SUPER_SPACE and save.\n\n*Reopen the Fcitx Configuration tool and apply without changing anything (updates your settings).\n\n\nThat should do it\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20.04, you can unset the system hotkey in\n\nSettings -> Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n\nA: In my case, after I changed the Trigger input method to Super+Space, I needed to disable the Keyboard shortcuts:\n\nSettings > Keyboard shortcuts > Switch to next input source >\n[backspace] (to disable the shortcut)\n\nTo my understanding, since they're both changing the input, there is either a conflict or double-changing of the input source.\n", "Q: Juju deploying charm produces \"local error: record overflow\" I am trying to install a charm and I get the following error\n\nERROR cannot resolve charm URL \"cs:juju-gui\": cannot get\n  \"/juju-gui/meta/any?include=id\": Get\n  https://api.jujucharms.com/charmstore/v4/juju-gui/meta/any?include=id:\n  local error: record overflow\n\nThis problem occured several times but i tried dpkg-reconfigure juju without changing anything else and temporarily the problem was solved.

I'm trying to configure it so that one of the interfaces (eth1) is configured for use with OpenVPN and is not a default route for anything. (Connections to the VPN interface would be controlled by manually selecting it on the application level.)\nIts also important that the setup not interfere with incoming traffic on the non-VPN interface (i.e. remote ssh connections, etc).\nAnyone know how to set up such an environment?\n(My system is running Ubuntu 15.10.)\n\nA: First upgrade from 15.04. It's dead and vulnerable to attack.\nSecondly, I'd strongly recommend doing this with in an LXC container (or with Docker, which uses LXC). A container limits anything within it to whatever you like, including network stuff.\nThat way you can force OpenVPN onto a certain network interface. And then force a load of applications to use the VPN. All without disrupting the main network connection and everything outside the container. For granular access, you can run a proxy within the container and expose that to your host computer's applications.\nIt isn't trivial though. Currently it involves using privileged containers (okay but not ideal) and there are several hacks you have to do to make it all work. The most complete guide on the matter is here but an amount of Googling around \"lxc vpn\" will help.\n", "Q: How to tell if my system is \"multiarch\"?

It was introduced in Ubuntu 11.04, so any later release should have it.\nYou can use dpkg --print-foreign-architectures command to find the added foreign architectures on multiarch e.g.:\n% dpkg --print-foreign-architectures\ni386\n\nTo find the native architecture, use dpkg --print-architecture e.g.:\n% dpkg --print-architecture          \namd64\n\nAlternately, you can also read the file /var/lib/dpkg/arch to get a list of added architectures (first one is native, although you can remove it):\n% cat /var/lib/dpkg/arch             \namd64\ni386\n\n", "Q: bash: ./configure: No such file or directory I'm trying to install a GUI for Dansguardian (https://bitbucket.org/ssoulaimane/webcontentcontrol-gambas3) but when I type:\n ./configure && make && sudo make install\nI get an error message:\nbash: ./configure: No such file or directory\nI have completed all the previous steps mentioned in the manual (on the site I provided), unless I have misunderstood something.\n\nA: You should first clone the repository (use git clone https://bitbucket.org/ssoulaimane/webcontentcontrol-gambas3).\nAfter that you should change directory the repository folder using cd webcontentcontrol-gambas3 and only after that you should do ./configure && make && sudo make install.\nconfigure is a file located in that repository and it's written in bash. You don't have any file named configure in your home folder so that's why you have to cd on your repository folder.\nBy the way, if the command ./configure && make && sudo make install listed above doesn't work use bash configure && make && sudo make install.

Read more about it here.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: This applies to almost any text editor:\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Home go to beginning of the file.\n\n\n*Ctrl + End go to end of the file.\n\n\n*Home go to beginning of the line.\n\n\n*End go to end of the line.\nAlso, Ctrl + Left / Right arrows jump between words.\nFor Macbook keyboards use Fn + arrows.\n", "Q: Fix OpenSSL CCS vulnerability on Ubuntu 14.04 I just installed an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt on one of my domains.

I've come close to the answer where other users are having similar issues, but I still cannot come to a conclusion other than: \"It's a bug.\"\nI'm currently running Ubuntu 15.10 on my old 5560G Acer Aspire laptop and considering the laptop is quite old now, it runs like a dream. However, I have a problem with powering off the device when shutting down and restarting. \nBehaviour:\nWhen I power down the device, however which way I choose to power it down- be it from terminal using the \"force\" shutdown commands- the system freezes and becomes unresponsive to key commands or anything. I have to force-power down the machine by holding the power off button. CTRL + ALT + Del also doesn't do anything. Auto power-off when the battery is low sees the same issue. Restarting works in that it successfully leaves the OS and posts to the BIOS but when grub should be loaded, it freezes and doesn't load Ubuntu. I'm not sure if this issue is related in some way with the shutdown fault behaviour. Suspend mode and closing the lid works flawlessly.\nSomething to note - The shutdown behaviour appears to power-down the drives as the hard drive and disk drive make a clicking sound when they're shut off, and the CPU fan resumes it's default speed (like it would in the BIOS) but this is where the system freezes. This leads me to believe it may be a low-level issues to do with communication between the OS and BIOS, though Windows didn't seem to have this issue.\nTried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using apci=force and other commands by modifying the grub config\n\n*Shutting down using force commands from terminal\n\n*Updating/downgrading BIOS firmware\n\n*Freshly re-installing Ubuntu\n\n*Turning off quiet splash and searching logs to observe any foul\nbehaviour that may prevent the machine from powering off completely.\nFrom what I can tell, nothing out of the ordinary. The last message\nbefore the machine freezes is [ OK ] Reached Target Shutdown\n\n*Unmounting Samba drives and other possibly conflicting drives\n\n\nBasically, I've come to a dead-end in my search. I do think it is software related. Some sort of incompatibility, somewhere. I'm not sure where else to look in terms of logs.

This version:\n\n\n*\n\n*keeps an eye on newly mounted devices (using the command lsblk)\n\n*if a new item shows up, it checks if the newly mounted device is a usb device by the command: find /dev/disk -ls | grep <disk>.

The main appeals are that it integrates with my download manager (DownThemAll), offers a lot of download options, is easy to use, is featured, and unlike another extension I tried, it doesn't advertise for websites nor have user tracking \"features\".\nBut just like any type of extension, a brief search in Mozilla's extensions website reveals many more options. It's not that I don't like them, it's that I didn't bother trying each one of them, since the aforementioned extension settled the deal for me. YMMV.\nSince you are new to extensions, you are advised to follow some security guidelines before installing any new extension that you discover. For starters, those marked as \"Featured\" are most probably safe. If they're not featured, at least check their popularity / number of users (if it's in the order of hundreds of thousands or millions, then it's probably in the green; absolutely avoid the ones which still have like a few hundred users, as they haven't been tested enough to verify their legitimacy), and check the ratings and reviews for anyone mentioning malware, \"a scandal\", or something like that.\nIf not sure about some extension, it wouldn't hurt to paste its name in Google along with keywords like \"virus\", \"trojan\", \"scandal\", etc., which reveals any discussions about this matter, or ask an experienced person about it. If all fails, it might be better to do without it. Likely a dozen other popular alternatives exist.\nNow, for a more Ubuntu-related answer: You can also install the package youtube-dl (using apt-get install youtube-dl). It's not really a browser extension, but a separate command-line program for downloading videos from YouTube (and a ton more websites). Usage is quite simple: Just copy the URL, open a terminal, type youtube-dl and paste the URL after it. Options may be used to specify the desired format and quality, among many other things. Try youtube-dl --help and man youtube-dl for detailed help.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: The Firefox plugin 'Video DownloadHelper' works well with Youtube and is usually updated to match Youtube changes.:\nVideo Download Helper\nI see there is also a Chrome version but I have not tested this...\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 14.04.4 server setup Need some help on my configuration on my low power server.

Running \"ps -ef\" should give you a process listing with full commands for each process.\nAnyways, I strongly suspect that the server is using all its potential CPU power when it can. Your problems are likely (a) it's underpowered for what you're trying to do, and/or (b) there's another bottleneck (if you're performing operations that are heavy on filesystem I/O, for example, your Western Digital Green drive may simply not be fast enough and may be the bottleneck).\n", "Q: Kernel panic at boot/Screen shuts off if I try to boot any recent release.

Among other functionality, it has on-board hardware implementation of TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).\nSince TEE is rather industry-wide catch-all term, not a standard at least, most of this implementations are OEM-specific. Main use cases are DRM, mobile finance, authentication, enterprise/government.\nThe presence of TEE on system had been not caused by Linux, rather by other concerns of industry. Linux only adopted to its presence and made it accessible and usable.\nAs any security feature with hardening options, it has benefits and risks. Industrial lobby is concentrated on benefits, from higher security here and there, and down to pragmatical \"small gifts\" e.g. your fingerprint image in finger scanner can not be easily changed or read. Security research community more often points to risks, from unpleasant potential of getting rootkit which would be extremely difficult to get rid off, to ransomware and limit is only imagination. \nIn case of this device/hardware/software combination, you may enjoy reading piece of kernel documentation along driver mei_txe. It clearly states functionality provided by Intel and has contact from intel at bottom. They state three main applications with detailed description and reference in that article :\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Local Management Service (Intel LMS)\n\n*Intel AMT Remote configuration using a Local Agent\n\n*Intel AMT OS Health Watchdog\n\n\nIn theory, you can blacklist this device as it most probably does not carry on much of value while constitutes certain risks. However, they clearly state in driver documentation:\n\nThe feature set depends on the Intel chipset SKU.\n\nSo your particular case is hardware-specific\n", "Q: Broken JRE installation, any advice how to fix?

Python has a wonderful tool called a virtual environment, which lets you effectively hermetically seal various python libraries (which may conflict with each other!) from each other. Is there an equivalent tool for the whole of Ubuntu? Or, rather, for things I make?\nFor instance, I have a repo that requires a modified version of OpenCV 3.0.

I'm not skilled enough to port the changes from the modified OpenCV 3.0 to OpenCV 3.1.0...is there a way to install both without them fighting? Perhaps with  the Ubuntu equivalent of a virtual env?\n\nA: I would suggest you to use vagrant. \nUsing vagrant you can easily create/destroy/re-create development and testing environments. \nYou use with docker,lxd,virtualbox as providers to build,test packages without making any change in your host system. It is very helpful to create identical development environments.   \nVagrant provides functionality to take/restore snapshots of your virtual environment. Using  docker as vagrant provisioner, you can build/test your virtual environment in no time. For example you need to test some new package, you just need to build docker image once with preinstalled libraries. Vagrant will provision docker image and test/run your built package. This way it saves lots of time to build virtual environment. You can use same image multiple times. \nTo install Vagrant, Download latest vagrant linux zip file,unzip it and copy vagrant binary to /usr/bin.\nunzip vagrant*_linux_amd64.zip\nsudo cp vagrant /usr/bin/ \n\nor You can install vagrant via apt.\nsudo apt install vagrant\n\nVerify vaagrant installation. \nvagrant --version\n\n"]
