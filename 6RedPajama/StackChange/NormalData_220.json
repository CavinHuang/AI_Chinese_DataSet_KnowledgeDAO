The other one is a Kubuntu 15.10 which used the proprietary nvidia-352 driver before.\nAfter the removal of the NVidia driver, my Kubuntu 15.04 booted without any trouble and X works fine with two monitors attached and with all 3D effects. I really do not need an NVidia card.\nHowever, the Kubuntu 15.10 does not work properly. First, X didn't start at all. So I logged in to the text console (which was fortunately working fine) and I uninstalled all nvidia driver stuff:\n$ apt-get purge nvidia-*\n\nAfter this, I rebooted and the system still didn't work :-( I found out that the problem was a wrong 'xorg.conf'.

I rebooted and the file was wrong again.\nAfter some digging, I found that I have to pass 'nogpumanager' to the kernel, hence I edited '/etc/default/grub', ran 'update-grub' and rebooted => the system booted fine.\nHowever, I saw that some of the desktop effects - e.g. the cube - don't work (they work fine in my Kubuntu 15.04).\nThe problem seems to be that X uses the 'modesetting' driver instead of the 'intel' driver. I tried to explicitly set 'Driver \"intel\"' in my 'xorg.conf', but then X does not start :-(\nWhen I run 'Xorg -configure', however, it lists 'intel' as the first line under 'List of video drivers:'!\nI assume that my previous installation of the nvidia proprietary driver somehow somewhere forced the intel driver out of the way.

Is it that possible?\nHow can I do it?\nAny help?\nPlease\n Really appreciate.\n\nA: Try looking here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nAfter you download it, insert a blank DVD into your computer. Choose to do nothing when the AutoPlay (or similar) dialog pops up. Right click the .iso file and choose \"Burn to disk\". (That should be close to the actual wording.) Once that is done, put/keep the disk in and restart your computer. After that, go here and follow the instructions: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop\n\nA: Yes it is possible. \nYou need to first download the iso file, then the easiest way for beginner in my opinion is to burn that Ubuntu iso file to a DVD. (make sure your system architecture is the same as the iso. eg. If your machine is 64bit, then download the 64bit Ubuntu and so on). Once you have done that, you have to insert the disk, restart your computer, and go onto your BIOS setting (spamming F2 on my dell laptop while it's booting up, yours might be F12, F10, or F8 depending on your machine). Go to a boot device sequence settings and you should change the boot priority to your DVD/USB that you have burn your iso file into. From there, it will start booting from that device, and will ask if you want to install Ubuntu to replace the OS, or install it side by side (dual booting). I have mine dual booted, so I can switch around between Ubuntu and Windows. From there, the rest of the installation process is pretty much self-explanatory. Partitioning, settings, etc. Good luck, and if you have any questions or my instruction is unclear, just reply. (I'm rushing this answer)\n\nA: First download ubuntu os 64 bit or 32 bit depending on your computer.Then you need to make a bootable usb/cd drive,you can easily do that with http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/.\nThen reboot your system with your usb/cd in and press F12.In BIOS menu select BOOT--->Hard Disk Drives.Next follow the installation of ubuntu ;)\n", "Q: updating from 11.1 to 13.1 or higher I am updating computer stored a couple of years.

I'm using the MacBuntu pack, it's great but whenever I try to drag some icon/file to another place the launcher shows up.

If you don't want the Unity Launcher you will have to remove Unity as the two are not separable.\n\nThe best you can do to remove the Unity Launcher (though this is probably what you have already done) is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the System Settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Go to the Appearance settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Then click on the Behaviour tab:\n\n\n\n\n\n*And finally turn on the Auto-hide the Launcher setting, set the Reveal location to Top left corner, and drag the Reveal sensitivity slider to Low:\n\n\n\nBut this is really it, there's not much more that you can do, and if you really want to remove the Unity Launcher then you'll have to remove Unity, and the safest way to do that is just to install another Ubuntu Flavour.\n\nA: Go to System Settings followed by Appearance, then Turn On the Auto-hide and set the reveal sensitivity to absolute low.\n\n", "Q: Why is my GRUB displaying so many options?

I have just installed i965-va-driver, vdpau-va-driver, libvdpau-va-gl1 on my Ubuntu 14.04. vainfo now returns: http://pastebin.com/r0DcMMUg\nMplayer nows takes 100% CPU (all cores).\nVLC is still choppy though it now finds va_openDriver and doesn't report an error like in my edit #1. Also, note that VLC never returns and I have to kill -9 it. It has always been the case when decoding a 4k file.\nEdit #3\nHere is a more verbose debug of vlc: http://pastebin.com/8ykvG9rc. As you can read:\navcodec decoder warning: threaded frame decoding is not compatible with avcodec-hw, disabled\n\nAlso: \navcodec decoder debug: using slice thread mode with 4 threads\n\nI only see 25% CPU usage while mplayer does 100%. In any case, hardware doesn't seem to be used (even with mplayer).\n\nA: Chances are you can offload the video playback onto the video card, instead of using the CPU(s).\nMake sure you have the vaapi packages installed (for Intel/AMD video card):\n\nsudo apt-get install libva1 libva-x11-1 vainfo vdpau-va-driver\n\nIf you have an Nvidia card add this:\n\nsudo apt-get install vdpauinfo libvdpau\n\nSince mplayer is working fine, it may already be using hardware acceleration. So these packages may already be installed.\nNext, see if VLC will start with hardware acceleration:\n\nvlc -v /path/to/name-of-file\n\nThere also is an option in the GUI to turn on hardware acceleration. Check to see what it is set on (Tools>Preferences>Input/Codec):\n\n\nA: \nIs there a fix?\n\nAnswer to the question: it depends.\nI think there are some other questions you have to ask in order to solve your problem of not being able to play 4K video without it being \"choppy\" using vlc:\n\n\n*\n\n*What videocard (GPU) do you have?\n\n*Do you have the correct driver installed?\n\n*are these drivers being used?\n\n*Is mplayer using hardware acceleration?\n\n*Is VLC using hardware acceleration?\n\n\n*\n\n*if yes: why is it not playing smoothly?\n\n*what codec do you need?\n\n*etc.\n\n\n\nHint\nFrom your findings I guess mplayer is using hardware acceleration, since I don't know a CPU that can playback 4K video, so I guess that you probably have a GPU that is good enough to playback 4K.\n\nA: I've came across 3 issues to get hardware acceleration working on VLC on Ubuntu 16.04.\nLong and detailed answer here: \nHow to enable Hardware acceleration\n\n\n*\n\n*For NVIDIA video cards, you need to switch to the NVIDIA proprietary drivers version R367+\n\n*There are bugs in VLC 2.2: upgrade to at least VLC 2.2.4, or ideally nightly VLC 3.0 from VLC official PPA ppa:videolan/master-daily.\n\n*If you are using VLC with FFmpeg (that's by default I think), you must disable FFmpeg multithreading in VLC > Tools > Preferences (All) > Input / Codecs > Video codecs > FFmpeg: change the value of Threads from 0 (auto) to 1.\n\n\nOf course, you must enable hardware acceleration in VLC > Tools > Preferences (Simple) > Input / Codecs > Hardware-acceleration decoding = Auto. For NVIDIA, you can choose VDPAU video decoder explicitely.\nNote that for NVIDIA, HEVC (H265) Profile Main 10 is currently not supported by the Linux driver. Check the NVIDIA final software+hardware support using vdpauinfo.\n\nA: VLC worked for my DJI phantom3 pro,  4k video.    \nLaunch VLC Player > Tools > Preferences > Input/Codecs > Hardware-accelerated decoding -> select from dropdown \"DirectX Video Acceleration\" (DXVA) 2.0.\nIt worked for me right away! :)\n\nA: I have solved this issue by disabling video quality post-processing level.\nSo to disable this option -\nOpen vlc  Tools  Preferences  Input/Codecs.\nand now set video quality post-processing level to 0 (the default is 6; 0 means disabled).\n", "Q: Move semi- maximized windows across multiple (2 or more) monitors I frequently use Ctrl+Super+Arrow -Keys to move windows around. However, with a multiple monitor set up, the shortcuts only move the windows on the current screen.\n**Example of my situation:\nI have 3 monitors and I have an instance of Chrome open in my center monitor. \n\n\n*\n\n*When I hit Ctrl+Super+Arrow (left)the window splits to the left half of my center monitor.\n\n*When I repeat, the window does not move.\n\n\nWhat I'd like to see instead is that in [2.], the window moves to the right half of the left most monitor, and so on\nHow do I achieve this behaviour?\n\nA: Move your semi- maximized windows across multiple screens (\"aero- snap\" alike)\nThe script below does exactly as you describe. It can be used on any number of screens. The script is optimized for Unity, but can easily be edited to fit  other window managers.\nIt turned out to be a bit more complicated than I thought, since the script should take into account that the user possibly set the launcher to only appear on the leftmost screen (or not). The targeted positions (and targeted window sizes) should be calculated accordingly.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*The script moves the windows through all connected screens, subsequently switching through the \"halves\" of the screens, from left to right and vice versa.\n\n*The script reads the sizes of the screens and sets the window size, to half the screen size accordingly.\n\n*The script reads the settings on the launcher (if the launcher appears on only the first screen or on all), and calculates the targeted window sizes accordingly.\n\n*The script does not take into account the possibly set autohide option for the launcher. The reason is that updating the windowsize once the launcher hides or shows up would take a background script, and quite an other story to code. \n\n*The windows are moved and resized by a combination of xdotool and wmctrl - commands. Since these commands can have some \"characteristic behaviour\" in combination with Unity, there is a possiblility minor changes can be useful on your system. I tested it on two (quite different) systems however, working fine on both.\n\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\n# --- set possibly wanted marge (on the right side of the window) below\nmarge = 0\n# --- set set launcher width below (default = 65)\ndefault_launcherwidth = 65\n# ---\n\nmove = sys.argv[1]\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(\n    [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\nscreendata = [l for l in get(\"xrandr\").splitlines() if \" connected\" in l]\n# get the primary screen's position\npr = [l.split() for l in screendata if \"primary\" in l][0]\ni = pr.index(\"primary\"); s = pr[i+1]\nprimary= [int(s.split(\"x\")[0]), int(s.split(\"+\")[-2])]\n# general screen list\nscreendata = [\n    [s for s in l.split() if s.count(\"+\") == 2][0] for l in screendata\n    ]\nscreendata = [\n    [int(s.split(\"x\")[0]),int(s.split(\"+\")[-2])] for s in screendata\n    ]\nscreendata.sort(key=lambda x: x[1]); primary = screendata.index(primary)\n\ndef launcher_size():\n    launcherset = get(\n        \"dconf read /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/num-launchers\"\n        ).strip()\n    l_size_0 = 65; l_size_1 = l_size_0 if launcherset == \"0\" else 0\n    return [l_size_0, l_size_1]\n\ndef magnets(index):\n    l_size = l_sizes[0] if index == primary else l_sizes[1]\n    screen = screendata[index]\n    screenwidth = screen[0]; shift = screen[1]\n    parts = (screenwidth - l_size)/2; virtual_mid = screenwidth - parts + shift\n    left_trigger = shift + l_size\n    return [left_trigger, int(virtual_mid), int(parts)]\n\ndef find_screen(x_loc):\n    scr_index = len([scr for scr in screendata if x_loc >= scr[1]])-1\n    scr_index = scr_index if scr_index >= 0 else 0\n    screen = screendata[scr_index]\n    return [scr_index, screen]\n\ndef get_active():\n    active = hex(int(get(\"xdotool getactivewindow\").strip()))\n    active = active[:2]+(10-len(active))*\"0\"+active[2:] \n    x_pos = int([l.split()[2] for l in get(\"wmctrl -lG\").splitlines() \\\n                 if l.startswith(active)][0])\n    return [active, x_pos]\n\ndef decide(x_loc, active):\n    current_scr = find_screen(x_loc)\n    triggers = magnets(current_scr[0])\n    width = triggers[2]\n    index = current_scr[0]\n    if move == \"left\":\n        if x_loc <= triggers[1]:\n            if x_loc == triggers[0]:\n                if index != 0:\n                    alter = magnets(index-1) \n                    width = alter[-1]\n                    target = alter[1]\n                else:\n                    target = triggers[0]\n            else:\n                target = triggers[0]\n        elif x_loc > triggers[1]:\n            target = triggers[1]        \n    elif move == \"right\":\n        if x_loc >= triggers[1]:\n            if index != len(screendata)-1:\n                alter = magnets(index+1)\n                width = alter[-1]\n                target = alter[0]\n            else:\n                target = triggers[1]\n        elif x_loc < triggers[1]:\n            target = triggers[1]\n    subprocess.call([\n        \"wmctrl\", \"-r\", \":ACTIVE:\",\"-b\", \"remove,maximized_vert,maximized_horz\"\n        ])\n    subprocess.call([\"wmctrl\", \"-ir\", active, \"-e\", \"0,\"+str(target)+\",400,\"+\\\n                      str(int(width)-marge)+\",200\"])\n    subprocess.call([\n        \"wmctrl\", \"-ir\", active, \"-b\", \"toggle,maximized_vert\"\n        ])\n\nl_sizes = launcher_size()\nw_data = get_active()\nactive = w_data[0]\nx_loc = w_data[1]\n\ndecide(x_loc, active)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The scrpt needs both wmctrl and xdotool:\nsudo apt-get instal xdotool wmctrl\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as move_window.py\n\n*Test- run the script from a terminal window by (repeatedly) the command:\npython3 /path/to/move_window.py right\n\nwhich should move the window through your screens to the rignt, and:\npython3 /path/to/move_window.py left\n\nwhich should move the window through your screens to the left.\n\n*If all works fine, add both commands to shortcut keys: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".

I have a monitor connected to my onboard Intel graphics card and a monitor connected to my Radeon HD 7570 graphics card. At the moment I have it set-up so that I am using the fglrx proprietary graphics driver. This causes only the monitor connected to my Radeon graphics card to display while the other monitor does not display anything (even though I can see both VGA devices in the terminal). \nFor some reason when I try to change the device driver to the AMD/ATI xserver-xorg-video-ati driver and reboot I get the message \"The system is running in low-graphics mode\". From there I cannot access Unity at all until I revert the video settings back to when I previously was working. \nI can get the onboard monitor to work when I have a \"manually installed driver\" but then the other monitor no longer works. Anybody have any advice? \n\nA: Many motherboards will automatically turn off on-board video whenever there is a card present. \nSometimes there is a way to override in the BIOS but usually not. \nDoes the 7570 not support two displays already?\n", "Q: how to reset skype? How can I reset my skype configuration? \nI think this could be done by removing or modifying its configuration folder. Will this work and where is it?\n\nA: The entire user-specific configuration of Skype is located in the directory ~/.Skype (~ represents your current user's home directory).\nYou can safely delete it to reset the configuration.\nTo do recursively delete this folder, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and enter the command:\nrm -r ~/.Skype\n\nIf you are not 100% sure and prefer to just rename (here: to .Skype-backup) it in case you want it back later, run this instead:\nmv .Skype .Skype-backup\n\nYou can also perform that using your GUI file manager (usually nautilus). Just make sure you have enabled it to show hidden files (names starting with a .). Press Ctrl+H or click on the menu View > Show hidden files.\n", "Q: Removing R libraries in protected /usr/ paths I am familiar with Unix as an operating system, but not in the general logic of how developers decide to organize application library locations.\nTake R, for example. Installing R on ubuntu can be done with apt-get. You'll get an installation into the directory:\n/usr/local/R/lib/site-library         --> All R packages go here.\n/usr/lib/R/library                    --> R packages go here.\n\nBoth of these directories are by default not writable. So why does an R installation default to install there? \nI've had numerous issues installing R packages into the \"default\" directory (which I guess is /usr/lib/R/library?), so I've had to install them into a local directory at ~/R/x86_64_pc-linux_gnu-library/3.2.\nMy question is: how do I get rid of ALL \"default\" libraries and ONLY use my local library directory? Not only removing old default libraries, but to let R know that my new default library is at ~/R/x86_64_pc-linux_gnu-library/3.2? \n\nA: If you want to not use the packaged version of R, then you need to install your own version to a private directory where you will use it from.\nIt's also possible to create Ubuntu packages of additional R libraries, so that they are installed to the system, if that's what you want.\n\nA: \nBoth of these directories [/usr/local/R/lib/site-library and /usr/lib/R/library] are by default not writable. So why does an R installation default to install there?\nI've had numerous issues installing R packages into the \"default\" directory (which I guess is /usr/lib/R/library?), so I've had to install them into a local directory at ~/R/x86_64_pc-linux_gnu-library/3.2.\n\nThe default R packages (e.g., base) are installed in these system libraries as these are available to all users on that machine.\nAlthough they are not writable by a non-root user, this is by design. A user would install their additional packages to a personal library instead.\nYou can see the default location for this personal library by running Sys.getenv('R_LIBS_USER') in your R console.\nThe .libPaths() command lets you view the current set of library search paths, as well as add additional paths.\n\nMy question is: how do I get rid of ALL \"default\" libraries and ONLY use my local library directory? Not only removing old default libraries, but to let R know that my new default library is at ~/R/x86_64_pc-linux_gnu-library/3.2?\n\nYou don't want to \"get rid of\" those default libraries as they contain the default set of R packages. These are required for R to work correctly.\nR already knows about the default personal library location (see .libPaths()).\nHowever, you can specify where you want to install package to and load them from by specifying a library location:\ninstall.packages('packageName', lib = Sys.getenv('R_LIBS_USER'))\nlibrary('packageName', lib.loc = Sys.getenv('R_LIBS_USER'))\n\nTo more easily control R package versions (which is especially important for reproducible research), I recommend the packrat package. It can be used to configure a personal library for each of your projects, allowing each project to use its own set of packages (i.e., different versions). When using packrat  it works automatically so you don't need to specify the lib nor lib.loc arguments when installing or loading packages.\n", "Q: How to reset Ubuntu installation How do I reset my Ubuntu installation just like it's freshly installed (like factory reset), with my files being intact and without a reinstallation.\n\nA: Sorry, but there is no \"factory reset\" option in Ubuntu. You will need to reinstall it. To keep your files intact:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a separate /home partition, unmark the \"format\" partition and set its mountpoint to \"/home\" during the installation.\n\n*If you do not have a separate /home partition, copy the entire /home directory to an external storage drive, such as a flash drive. You will need root privileges to do it, so run 'gksudo nautilus /' in a terminal, without quotes, to open the file manager with such privileges. Then just copy-paste the \"/home\" directory to the external drive. After you reinstall Ubuntu, your files should be there.\n\nA: If you try this software, I believe it will do as you want: https://github.com/gaining/Resetter, just download and install the deb file, it reads the manifest of ubuntu and compares it with actual installed package list then creates a removable list from there along with options to remove users.\n\nA: This is just an idea, but technically you could mount an image of a freshly installed system and swap it from your original one\n", "Q: i can only login as a guest on ubuntu 14.04 I bought a laptop that has Ubuntu 14.04 on it but I only can login as a guest.any idea how to add an administrator or standard account? Thanks\n\nA: You can always boot into single user mode. See here: How do I reset a lost administrative password?\nI would just install a fresh copy of the OS if I were in your shoes.\n\nA: In order to add a new user you must be singed in as root\nIf you can sign in then type: adduser newuser  \"newuser\" being the person you wish to add.\nIf you can not sign in on root or as an administrator I would try to change the ad-min password See Here.

I would say probably you didn't miss doing anything but the too just wasn't there. Fortunately there is a user manual of Foxit Reader for linux proving my point. I could not find this tool being mentioned in this manual.\nhttp://cdn01.foxitsoftware.com/pub/foxit/manual/reader/en_us/FoxitReader1.0_QuickGuideforLinux.pdf\n\nA: You don't need a snapshot tool in Foxit Reader. If you're using Gnome taste in Linux, you can use the snapshot tool in your distro, or just download it from your friendly repository.\nIt works great and you can either save as a .png file or copy in your clipboard to paste in your application that you're using.\nIt's perfect, simplest and faster as Linux.\n", "Q: How to make sure my computer clock is right and fix it if it is not? I have recently noticed that the time on my computer isn't the same as on the others in my household, and I'm not sure if it's just them, or whether my machine has actually got the wrong time...\nSo I was wondering if there is some way through Terminal of synchronizing my computer clock with the Ubuntu servers or something? Or at least being able to check that I have the right time for my time zone?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: There should be an option to enable network time synchronization in the Date & Time section in your system settings. If however this is too inaccurate, you can enforce NTP time synchronization with the ntpdate command (you will need to install this with sudo apt-get install ntpdate as it is not installed by default on 15.10):\nsudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nAfter fetching the current time from the server, it will tell you the offset to the machine's own clock and automatically adapt it:\n 7 Dec 22:27:57 ntpdate[14411]: adjust time server 91.189.94.4 offset -0.049344 sec\n\nIf you're experiencing reoccurring time deviations, despite automatic synchronization (I don't know how often this is executed), you could have this command executed by the cron daemon, e.g. by adding it to the file /etc/crontab. The following line will cause the command to be executed at the 0. minute every hour:\n0 *    * * *   root    /usr/sbin/ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com\n\nIf you want to use another time interval, consult the manpage crontab(5).\n\nPS: If the time is wrong each time you boot your computer, it is most likely caused by a failing CMOS battery; you may want to look for a replacement.\n", "Q: What do the fstab mount options 'errors=remount -ro' mean? I've checked /etc/fstab and saw the following lines\n<file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=some-hex-appears-here                /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n /home was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=another-hex-here                      /home           ext4    defaults        0       2\n\nerrors=remount-ro 0       1 concerns me because I would expect defaults instead of errors=remount-ro. Ubuntu runs as normal, but I have reasons to believe that Ubuntu might have being tempered with during the install process.\nSo what does this mean?\n\nA: It means that if any errors occur when trying to mount the device, it will be remount as read-only.\n\nA: The 0 and 1 on the last columns referring to  and  from fstab man pages:\n\nThe fifth field (fs_freq).\nThis field is used by dump(8) to determine which filesystems need to be dumped.  Defaults to zero  (don't  dump)  if\n                not present.\nThe sixth field (fs_passno).\nThis  field  is  used  by fsck(8) to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at boot time.  The root\n                filesystem should be specified with a fs_passno of 1.  Other filesystems should have a fs_passno of 2.   Filesystems\n                within a drive will be checked sequentially, but filesystems on different drives will be checked at the same time to\n                utilize parallelism available in the hardware.  Defaults to zero (don't fsck) if not present.\n\n\nA: From the man page:\nerrors={continue|remount-ro|panic}\n    Define the behavior  when  an  error  is  encountered.   (Either\n    ignore  errors  and  just  mark  the  filesystem  erroneous  and\n    continue, or remount the filesystem read-only, or panic and halt\n    the  system.)   The default is set in the filesystem superblock,\n    and can be changed using tune2fs(8).\n\nEssentially, when there is an error mounting the disk with read/write privileges, it will instead mount it as 'read only'.\nWhether or not 'defaults' are used in your setup are not necessarily relevant.  Yes, you can expect 'defaults' here, but the lack therein doesn't hurt you a ton.\nAs well, the '0 1' part isn't part of the mount options - everything in an fstab line is space-delimited / tab-delimited - any space between things indicates the 'next argument' to use.\n\nAs a security person, though, my advice is that if you believe your system was tampered with during installation outside that of the typical installer, then you should not be using that system, and should install with a known, good ISO and no networking during that installation to rule out network boot installer images causing issues.\n", "Q: Hide hidden files and directories in file upload pop-up explorer How can I hide hidden files and directories in pop-up file explorer when uploading a file via web browsers, e.g. when inserting an email attachment? I checked Firefox 42.0 and Chrome 46.0 on x64 Ubuntu GNOME 15.10; both show hidden items. In this screen-shot I wanted to do a Google image search. And yes, nautilus does not show hidden files when I do day-to-day directory navigation.\n \n\nA: A shortcut key to show/hide hidden 'dot' folders is: Ctrl+H.\nThis key is part of Nautilus and such (also GNOME I think) to toggle the displaying of hidden files and folders.

After downloading Crypt of the Necrodancer on my desktop, I thought I could just copy the folder of that game which is located in ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common to a USB stick and then copy it from there to that directory on my laptop. The purpose for this was to avoid downloading 1.5 GB of data a second time. However, Steam just gives me the option to install the game, upon choosing which it says something like discovering existing game files. Then the files are just removed and Steam starts downloading them anew. Is there a way to keep these files?\n\nA: I used to do it that way but for some reason it's no longer a reliable method. The good news is Steam has a built in backup/restore feature that works a lot better. You can choose to backup directly to your USB stick.\nClick the Steam menu and choose Backup and Restore Games.\n\n", "Q: How to disable fingerprint login timeout I have fingerprint scanners on a couple of laptops and a desktop via a usb scanner.\nIs it possible to disable the timeout at login time, so that it will wait indefinitely for a fingerprint scan?\n\nA: Question was posted long time ago, so to whom it may concern (too):\nTo disable the timeout for fingerprint-logins (using fprintd), you've to edit the corresponding configuration file: /etc/pam.d/common-auth\nopen a terminal and enter:\nsudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth\n\nyou'll find the following config line:\nauth    [success=2 default=ignore]  pam_fprintd.so max_tries=1 timeout=10 # debug \n\nchange the timeout to -1 like this (I adjusted max_tries too):\nauth    [success=2 default=ignore]  pam_fprintd.so max_tries=2 timeout=-1 # debug\n\nperhaps it won't work all the time / in all cases because of other pam.d settings - but to figure out that cause, you have to inspect all your pam.d configuration.\nhth\n", "Q: Is it possible to make the scrollbars wider in 15.10?

The story is: I'm trying Linux for the first time in my life.

If that's incorrect, please clarify your question and/or comment on my answer.\nThe desktop environment in Linux allows user to manipulate their computer graphically, as is done on Mac OS X and Windows. Different desktop environments have look and feel different, provide different functionality, and sometimes come with their own applications (i.e. the Gnome Calculator).\nThe bug that you are referencing is most likely not a bug, but rather the system is confused somewhere, and I would advise you to just reboot your computer, as that should probably fix it.

(two grubs) I was once foolish enough to think I would take care of my Ubuntu install (\"this time I will, I promise...\") so I didn't separate /home or anything when I installed it for the first time. Now I kind of want to leave some bloat behind.\nI've installed Kubuntu 15.10 (guided install). The problem is I don't think GRUB was installed correctly. The GRUB I get when I turn the laptop on is the one from my previous Ubuntu install (I had to update-grub so I could log into my new Kubuntu install). The partition table is weird because I have this fat32 space flagged as \"boot\" and \"esp\", and this \"unknown\" partition flagged as \"bios_grub\". I suspect the fat32 one is the grub that's actually being used and this unknown one was supposed to be the new grub. Funny thing is I've already 'grub-install'ed from the new Kubuntu system and nothing changed.\nWith time I'll move the data over to a new partition, using it as some sort of /home partition... But for now all I want is to solve this Grub mess. How do I use the grub from my new install, so that I can delete the original system without worrying?\nThis is the layout so to make it clearer:\n\nThanks in advance; any help is appreciated - I've read a lot about EFI and MBR and GPT and other three-or-four-letter things and I am now more confused than ever.\n\nA: Ok, after a lot of research and help from the G+ community (special thanks to Sanja Bonic!) I figured out what to do.\nBasically, the sda1 partition was the EFI partition, and every drive from newer PCs, like those that come with Windows 8, has to have one (I'm leaning towards saying only one). So I kept using that as my EFI partition.\nI'll use a lot of stuff from this website, one you should refer to if you find yourself in a similar situation.\nAnyway: I live-booted Xubuntu into my system (like he says in the website, you have to boot it as a UEFI system). Then you chroot into your own system (in my case, the new one; the sda5 in the gparted image). To do that, execute these commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt \n\n(replace sda2 with your system partition)\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi\n\n(replace sda1 with your EFI partition)\n(notice your system might not have a \"efi\" folder inside boot; I created one with 'sudo mkdir /mnt/boot/efi' and things worked out fine!)\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\n\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/\n\n(This one makes the network available after chrooting)\nmodprobe efivars\n\nsudo chroot /mnt\n\nNow since I was in Xubuntu (Ubuntu-based system) I had to do an 'apt-get' command:\napt-get install --reinstall grub-efi-amd64\n\nNow we're going to undo the chrooting and all the mounting.\nType Ctrl+D\nAnd then these commands:\nfor i in /sys /proc /dev/pts /dev; do sudo umount /mnt$i; done\nsudo umount /mnt/boot/efi\nsudo umount /mnt\nsudo reboot\n\n... And that's it!\n\nA: You can use sudo fdisk /dev/sda to set the boot flag for the correct partition. \nIf you press 'a' it will ask you to select the partition you want to toggle the boot flag on. In your case, you want to toggle 1 (to unset) and 5 to set.\nI hope it helps and be extra careful with fdisk !\n", "Q: How can I fix choppy audio?

I resolved my issue simply by stopping the adb server with the following command: adb kill-server.\nWanted to share in case anyone else was having the same issue while using adb\nThis likely does not apply to a lot of people.\n\nA: Edit the file /etc/pulse/default.pa.\nFind the following line:\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nChange the line to the following:\nload-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nRestart PulseAudio:\npulseaudio -k\n\nShould do the trick.\n\nA: I just ran into a similar issue with Skype 8 (skypeforlinux).\nHere are the instructions that solved my pulseaudio configuration problem.\n\n\n\n*Resolve Choppy sound in (Pulseaudio) -> Skype\n\nIn /etc/pulse/daemon.conf two lines has to be also substituted:\n\n; default-sample-rate = 44100\n\n\nShould become;\n\n; default-sample-rate = 48000\n\nHT: PCFreak.Net\nYour mileage may vary. Best of luck!\n\nA: None of the above fixes worked for me (pulseaudio 11.1); what solved it for me was going into /etc/pulse/daemon.conf and turning off realtime-scheduling by adding in the line realtime-scheduling = no beneath the line reading ;realtime-scheduling = yes like so:\n;realtime-scheduling = yes\nrealtime-scheduling = no\n\nThis completely fixed the issue for me.\n\nA: I also had same issue. I first watch this => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Eyu4a1XD4  it didn't solve problem. but i kept all changes which are done according to video. then I enter following command,\n$ sudo nano /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\nit will open daemon.conf, then locate \" ;realtime-scheduling = yes \" using arrow down/up and remove \" ; \" and change it to \" realtime-scheduling = no \". then save it (press Ctrl+o then enter)(quit => Ctrl+x).\nfinally, run following command or restart computer.\n$ systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service\nit was done job for me.

What am I missing? \n(I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)\n\n\n\nA: Ubuntu base is a group for the tools and services and core parts of Ubuntu and the following applies equally to any software installed.\nIt's normal to have Ubuntu base updates more often. In Linux, security flaws are found much easier when they exist due to the code being open. Then the patch is immediately put upstream and onto your computer through the package update.\nWhereas in a closed source system, often such flaws aren't found until exploitation. Its just a matter of when the security flaw is found, not the existence itself.\n\nA: You can compare your configuration against the list of updates here. The list seems quite in sync with the official reports. Needles to say, to get the right picture, don't forget to apply the proper filtering corresponding to your PPAs, in case it's wrong.\n\nA: Like the other answers say, this seems normal. If the frequent update reminders bothers you, you can set up automatic security updates. \n\nA: If it gets annoying you could change Security Updates in your update setting to how long you want. After that time it would show you if a new update has come. \n", "Q: Complete Removal of Webstorm from Ubuntu I installed Webstorm and something went wrong so I removed the installation folder and every thing using the advice from here. \nA run of whereis turns up nothing, but when I try to install a fresh Webstorm it simply launches the formerly installed one and I don't know where that installation is coming from. \nHow can I completely remove all traces of Webstorm and install it fresh?\n\nA: I had been running the fresh install using sudo rights but this time I ran it without the sudo rights and was able to install it fresh.

If I reboot and hold alt, my thumb drive shows up fine.  But if I choose it, Ubuntu starts.

When I check the cpu usage using top command, sometime it shows more than 100 %, like 340%, 650% etc. I did some investigation and found that its actually a sum of usages across different cores. For example if 1st cpu usages is 20% , 2nd is 30%, 3rd is 40% and remaining are 0% then ‘top’ shows 20+30+40=90%. \nIts bit confusing and misleading. I believe the top command should display the CPU usages between 0 to 100 by calculating the usages across all the cores. In my example above, I would expect -(90*100)/3200 =2.8125% . Is this a bug with top command ? should it be considered as an enhancement for future releases? please advise\n\nA: By default, top displays CPU usage as a percentage of a single CPU. On multi-core systems, you can see percentages of CPU usage are greater than 100%. You can toggle this behavior by hitting Shift + i while top is running to show the overall percentage of available CPUs in use.\nhtop is a better alternative of top. In htop, you can see how your programs consuming all of the 32 cores.\n\nA: looks like I found a way :-) if I switch to solaris mode while running the top command it shows the correct cpu usage.

How i restore my laptop?\n\nA: If you are stuck at a grub prompt, that means that you aren't even booting into Linux. You will either need to reinstall from media, or do some serious technical gymnastics to recover the system.\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean that your data is lost. During an install, you can attempt to not make the file systems, which is dangerous. Also, you could boot with a live distribution (like the Ubuntu installer) and use that interface to mount your disk and backup to other media. There is no one prescribed way to do this.\n\nA: I occassionally get the same error but have a simple remedu reboot. Why it works, I have no idea but when I do reboot, I get the GRUB menu. \nThe first time it happened I went through troubleshooting but found no errors, the next time it occurred I simply chose the top option, forget what it was and was able to get in. \nIt occurred for a 3rd time, but this time I simply rebooted, chose the first option on the GRUB screen and was able to get in.\n", "Q: Backup ubuntu packages I have Ubuntu 14.04 installed on my system, and I want to upgrade to Ubuntu 15.10.

Secondly this is not a full answer, just parts, but I can't post a comment only answers.\nI have done part of this, opening a gnome-terminal that resumes command history of a previous terminal session (I used this to capture commands during lengthy software testing). You don't need to capture the history separately, just specify what file the terminal should use. Call this script \"myterm\":\n#/bin/bash\n\nTERMDIR=~/.myterms\nif [ ! -d $TERMDIR ] ; then\n    mkdir $TERMDIR\nfi\n\nTERMUID=$1\nif [ -z \"$TERMUID\" ] ; then\n    # generate unique id for new terminal\n    TERMUID=\"`basename \\`tty\\``-`date +'%s'`\"\nfi\n\nHISTFILE=$TERMDIR/$TERMUID gnome-terminal\n\nSo executing myterm without an argument will place a new history file in TERMDIR. If later you execute myterm with one of the filenames in TERMDIR as an argument, it resumes that terminal's history. If you have a fixed set of terminals, you could also dispense with random uid generation and just use fixed names.\nI realise you want to do a lot more than this, but one requirement is not clear to me - if you close a terminal manually, do you need to forget it? i.e. remove its history and not re-open on login? That may be a little tricky as I'm not sure how to detect manual closure as opposed to forced close during logout or shutdown.\nRe-opening the terminals on login is simple enough by scanning TERMDIR; i.e. the existence of the history file flags that the terminal is needed.\nMore difficult is changing to the last working directory. Each child terminal knows its directory at the time it closes, via $PWD, but ofc  myterm can't read the child environment to write this to a store. No problem if it is known, however; just use\nHISTFILE=$TERMDIR/$TERMUID gnome-terminal --working-directory somedir\n\nYou may need to write a monitor that runs during your user session to\n\n\n*\n\n*detect when a terminal is closed and remove its history\n\n*periodically detect working directory and store this\n\n\ndepending on your requirements.\n", "Q: Missing fonts for photoshop cs6 on Ubuntu 14.04LTS I have installed photoshop cs6 on ubuntu 14.04 with Wine1.7 but missed fonts.

Screenshots of my drives as they stand:\n\n\nI completely lost what I was doing when I installed Ubuntu, intending to dual-boot it with Windows 10. First, while in Windows, I partitioned off 25GB of my 1TB hard drive and named it Linux_OS (L:). I went to install Ubuntu from a USB, and when it got to the screen where it was supposed to ask me to install alongside Windows, it told me it didn't recognize an existing operating system. I hit \"Something else\" to manually install it to the Linux partition I had created. The screen confused me but I thought I had it figured out: all of my partitions were there, but they were listed as some ridiculous name. At the end of each one was \"p1\", \"p2\", \"p3\", up until \"p6\". p6 had 17GB free on it so I assumed it was the lastest partition I had created: Linux_OS. I selected it, put \"Ext3\" for filesystem and hit \"/\" as the mount (honestly still don't know what that meant). I put the same drive as the bootloader (this also confused me) and installed Ubuntu. Now I have Ubuntu installed, but I checked the Linux_OS drive and it's completely empty, marked as NTFS; Ubuntu was installed somewhere else. I have no idea where though - I think I may have overwritten some part of my Windows drive.\nOn startup, Windows still boots up as default. I figured out I can get to Ubuntu by searching \"BIOS\" and hitting the button that boots the computer from another source.\nIf anyone can explain what exactly I did to my computer, I would greatly appreciate it. In addition:\n\n\n*\n\n*What exactly is a mount point?\n\n*What is a bootloader?\n\n*How can I get the computer to ask me which system I want on startup?\n\n*What is this GRUB thing I keep hearing about?\nSorry if these questions may sound simple, but I'm pretty lost.\nThanks.\n\nA: Your last 3 question are all related. GRUB ≈GRand Unified Bootloader, which is the Linux way of loading operating systems on boot. GRUB can be configured to load Windows in a dual boot configuration. When GRUB is set up correctly, you'll get the famously ugly GRUB menu at startup, which gives you a choice of OS's to boot into.\nIf you don't see a GRUB menu, something's wrong. I would suggest using your Ubuntu CD to do a GRUB repair. How to do this exactly depends on if your computer is set up with legacy BIOS or UEFI. I'll give you some links later.\nA mount point is where you, or programs, looks for a file system, which could be a folder, or an entire hard disk. For example, Linux could be installed on hard drive partition sda2, but for it to be used, it must be mounted to \"/\". You look for things in \"/\", not sda2. It something like \"c:\\\" in Windows.\nFirst of all, let's try to find that lost Ubuntu installation. Boot into your Ubuntu live CD (Try Ubuntu without installing)\nWhen you get to the desktop, open a terminal( Ubuntu menu/type \"terminal\", click on the icon that looks like a black computer monitor).\nIn the terminal, type :\nsudo fdisk -l\n(last character is \"l\" as in \"lemon\")\nAnd hit enter.\nYou'll get some information about which hard drive partitions you have( /dev/sda1  etc.) ,size of each, and partition type: ntfs, ext, whatever.\nMake note of this information.\nOpen the Nautilus file manager program. Look on the left side of the window for anything that looks like a hard disk, and click on them to mount them.\nNow go back into the terminal window and type:\ndf -h\nAnd hit enter.\nThis will display information about active mounts, where they're mounted, and how much space is used and free on each. \nWith this information, provided that Liniux really is installed on on of those partitions, you can do a GRUB repair. Here are some links on how do do that:\nhttp://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd\nFor UEFI, you'll need to add a couple more steps:\nCan I install in UEFI mode with the alternate installer?\nHope these links help.\n", "Q: Steam will not run (missing libGL.so.1) I'm trying to install Steam on the laptop my son is getting for christmas (running Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS), however when I try to run Steam for the first time (via the \"Steam\" desktop icon it creates), a Terminal window appears and I am told:\nSteam needs to install these additional packages: \n    libgl1-mesa-dri:i386, libgl1-mesa-glx:i386, libc6:i386\n\nEntering the password does its thing, then I am told:\nReading package lists...

This allows me to keep secure boot enabled and also use VMWare. \nThe issue is that the vmware kernel module is not signed so fails to be loaded when secure boot is enabled. However you can \"self sign\" the module which is what I did for both VMWare workstation and VirtualBox.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to this forum post : https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=77363&start=15\n\n*Go to the post by Fayce66 on 6 May 2016, 08:37 \n\n*In each command replace the kernel module \"vboxdrv\" (virtualbox module name) with \"vmmon\" (vmware module name)\n\n*You might have to do all the commands again for kernel module \"vmnet\" (vmware network module)\n\n\nThese steps worked for me. I am able to keep secure boot enabled and use VMWare Workstation.\n\nA: It's possible that your problem with VMware Workstation 12 is that...\n\nOn Linux host with secure mode enabled, it is not allowed to load any unsigned drivers. Due to this, VMware drivers, such as vmmon and vmnet, are not able to be loaded which prevents virtual machine to power on.\n\nTo fix this without turning off secure boot, you can do the following in a terminal to self-sign the drivers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate a key pair using the openssl to sign vmmon and vmnet modules:\nopenssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.priv -outform DER -out MOK.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj \"/CN=VMware/\"\n\n(Replace MOK with the name of the file you want for the key.)\n\n*Sign the modules using the generated key by running these commands:\nsudo /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der $(modinfo -n vmmon)\nsudo /usr/src/linux-headers-`uname -r`/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./MOK.priv ./MOK.der $(modinfo -n vmnet)\n\n\n*Import the public key to the system's MOK list by running this command:\nsudo mokutil --import MOK.der\n\n\n*Confirm a password for this MOK enrollment request. \n\n*Reboot your machine. Follow the instructions to complete the enrollment from the UEFI console.\n\n\nCited from this VMWare article: https://kb.vmware.com/kb/2146460\n\nA: sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all \n\nThis command fixed it for me\n\nA: Just disable Secure Boot from UEFI options.\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2103112\n\nA: I build an automated shell  script to help download, extract and build the VMWARE vmnet and vmmon files.

Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an msdos partition table.  Is this a GPT partition table?[\\QUOTE]\nI was getting an image of an empty USB drive in gparted, so I tried creating a format. I had to create a partition table first, and it wiped out the drive.\nI deleted everything and ran startup disk again.

I tried the USB 3 port, and two of the USB 2 ports with both devices and I get the same results, the 2.0 device works, but the 3.0 device doesn't boot.\nEither one boots on the laptop, but the 3.0 is just a little faster than the 2.0.\n\nA: The 32bit image doesn't work with UEFI (Unless you have Legacy support enabled).

Before the nvidia-355 drivers were installed, glxinfo showed Intel Haswell graphics were in use. The graphics situation seemed a bit choppy, but with no horizontal screen tearing at all. I did not try loading nouveau.\nNone of the configuration changes in nvidia-settings seem to stick. Some settings are supposedly saved to nvidia-settings-rc in my home folder, but these do not survive a reboot. It does not look like anything of consequence is being saved there. I've already explained the xorg.conf situation.\nNvidia-settings can't ID the monitor. I'm not sure if this is the normal situation for a laptop. X Server Display Configuration shows X Screen 0 (No Scanout). The horizontal screen tearing persists when I connect an external monitor which nvidia-settings correctly IDs as a Samsung, so I doubt that's related. There's no sync-to-vblank option in nvidia-settings. There's one in Compiz settings, in the open-GL subsection, but it's checked by default and does not appear to affect anything when unchecked.\nAnyway. I simply must get this screen-tearing problem fixed.  I'd sincerely appreciate any help.\n\nA: I have the same Nvidia card and I'm afraid we'll have to wait. The issue is related to this:\nhttps://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/775691/linux/vsync-issue-nvidia-prime-ux32vd-with-gt620-m-/1\nPay close attention to fratti's comment at the end of page 3.

Why is ubuntu trying to remove the desktop and unity  as well when I just want to remove upstart?\n\nA: \nI read that since Ubuntu 15.04 upstart has been replaced with systemd\n\nYou read wrong.  As explained in the last bullet point of https://askubuntu.com/a/613814/43344 , upstart is still used for so-called \"user\" init.  If you uninstall it, all of the things in your desktop that try to talk to a per-session/per-user service manager (as opposed to the system-wide one) will stop working.  Hence the package dependencies.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/194208/5132\n", "Q: Cannot add PPA repository Whenever I try run the following command it gives me an error:\ndmacs@dmacs-HP40:~$ sudo apt-get-repository ppa:nae-team/ppa\nsudo: apt-get-repository: command not found\n\nI don't know how to fix this.\n\nA: There is no such command as apt-get-repository.\nThe correct command is apt-add-repository:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:nae-team/ppa\n\n", "Q: Will encryption of /home partition create problems if I do a new install in the future while saving /home? I have a dual boot Windows/Linux machine that I am doing a full revamp of. After saving my personal files, I wiped the 1 TB drive and did a clean install of Windows 10. I have reduced the Windows partition to 120 GB and now I want to add a 80 GB /root partition for Linux and a /home partition with all the remaining space (plus a 4 GB swap partition). If I encrypt the /home partition during install, will I still be able to access the files in it if in the future I do a new install of Ubuntu (or if I try another distro like Mint, Peppermint, Elementary, etc.) and re-adopt the /home partition? Or is it safer in this scenario to not encrypt /home? Are there any special steps I need to take to re-access the encrypted /home if I install a new distro in the future?\n\nA: Yes you will be able to access to your data of course. \nThere are many way of doing that and I am going to suggest you 2 here.\n1) You decrypt your home partition before re-installation and you can do this by using the following command:\n #ecryptfs-setup-private --undo\n\nHere is the step by step about how to remove the decryption from your home.\n  http://rayslinux.blogspot.ie/2011/01/caught-out-by-being-overzealous-remove.html\n\nI tried myself and it worked for me.\n2) You can install your system and choose /home partition the existing one by de-selecting to format the partition and that will basically take it as your /home, but you will still need to access to it as it is encrypted. \n   #ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase\n   #ecryptfs-recover-private\n\nare the 2 main tools that you will work with. You can find different how-to's about this but here is the step by step one:\n   http://www.howtogeek.com/116297/how-to-recover-an-encrypted-home-directory-on-ubuntu/\n\nThere are many other ways to do that but the easier way would be of course to remove the encyrption before re-installation.\n", "Q: Is my SSD broken? I recently started experiencing lags and freezes on Windows 10. Because of that, I've removed it and have tried installing various Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint). With all of them I experienced familiar freezes, and sometimes after I rebooted the PC it became stuck, so I had to force reboot (cut power and turn it on). Then this message popped up: boot error\nThe SSD is 840 EVO by Samsung.\nAlso, when freezing began (still windows 10, samsung software magician) I've tried to disable RAPID mode, and while doing that PC froze again.\nIs there any way to fix the ssd ?\nEdit: pluged ssd out and in again, booted into live cd, fixed it with fix disk commands and then everything started working perfectly. That was until few hours ago, when very weird thing started happening: everything is stable up until I go to a website called aliexpress and click on my order pc screen turns black and sound freezes (is repeating 1 s over and over again). \n\nA: The boot error screen shot you've shown indicates filesystem damage exists on one of your partitions. That's not surprising after a system crash; whenever the system shuts down uncleanly, the filesystem will be left in an inconsistent state and a disk check will be performed, even if the cause was not disk-related. If I had to bet, I'd put money on bad RAM, based on your description; but it could be a failing CPU, a bad hard disk, a failing motherboard, or something else. Failures like the one you describe can also be caused by bad drivers, although the fact that you ran into similar crashes in two OSes suggests a hardware failure.\nYou can test some of these components with specialty tools such as GNOME Disk Utility or smartctl to check the SMART status of the hard disk, or memory check tools to test your RAM.\nIf your hardware is failing, it's very unlikely that you'll be able to fix it, just replace the failing component. (There are some exceptions for trivial problems like loose cables.) \n\n\n*\n\n*If it's the disk that's going bad, you have the added complication of transferring data off the failing disk, which can sometimes be difficult because of the very failure you're trying to overcome. \n\n*If your RAM is going bad, and if you have more than one memory module, you might be able to remove the bad one and leave the good one in place. Of course, that means you'll be halving the amount of RAM in your system (assuming you've got two equal-sized memory modules). Some systems have just one memory module, though, so if it's going bad, you must replace the whole thing.\n\n", "Q: Got a new SSD, don't want to wear it out but I still want to use some of it to store data files together with the old HDD I bought a new 250GB Samsung 850 EVO SSD for my laptop that I want to use as primary storage device, together with the old but still functioning 250GB 7500 RPM HDD that I put in the former DVD bay with an adapter caddy.\nRight now the HDD has only one big ext4 partition containing the OS, the applications and data files. I want to use the HDD for storing data, but I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to get the speed improvement of the SSD by doing so.\nI want to combine say a 50GB or even smaller partition on the SSD and merge it with the partition on the HDD so that the least modified of the most accessed files are automatically moved to the SSD.\nI've looked at caches like EnancheIO and Bcache, but they don't seem what I want, because (correct me if I'm wrong):\n\n\n*\n\n*The space occupied by the cache partition is subtracted from the amount of space available.  \n\n*The cache speeds up access to the most accessed files regardless of whether they're also the least often modified, which goes against the objective of not wanting to wear out the SSD. \n\n\nIs the above correct, or could a cache (which one of those two?) help me reach my goal? If the above is correct, do you know of any other viable solution?\nWould a union filesystem, like OverlayFS, be helpful here? If you monitored the HDD for the most accessed files (keeping track of their atime on a daily basis) and identified the least modified ones  among them (keeping track of their mtime), in theory you could move those files to the SSD, freeing space on the HDD, while the union filesystem could make all that transparent to the user. \nWould this work?\n\nA: You have a few options depending on what you're trying to accomplish:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use bcache: You will be able to eat your cake, but not keep it.\nYes, the amount of space you reserve for caching will be just like the opposite of a swap file: the amount you specify will be \"taken away\" from the total amount of disk space and given to the memory subsystem to be used as buffers for the other hard drive.\nTo control which files do get cached, use something like vmtouch to fine-tune the bcache caching.\n\n*Use LVM: You will get to keep your cake, but not eat it.\nYou can use the Logical Volume Manager to create a volume that contains both SSD and HDD creating a large /home volume that contains the space from both, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will have no control over which file goes on the SSD and which one on the HDD\n\n*If you lose one of the two drives, you lose all data and will need to restore from back-up!!!\n\n\n*Use a manual system: You will be able to keep your cake, and eat it.\nPartition the drive into separate file systems: put / on the SSD and /home on the HDD.  On top of this, you should put the all the files you want to go fast into /media/FastData and symlink the originals to the ones in /media/FastData if and only if these files reside in your /home (otherwise they already reside on the SSD anyway)\nNote 1: I have a small SSD and a large HDD, so I use yet another system: / on the SSD and /home on the HDD and don't bother to optimise further...\nNote 2: A union file system will not help you any more then the manual system...\nNote 3: Here are some more tips not to wear out your SSD from bullet point 4 and onwards\n", "Q: Updating windows 10 to 1511, dual booting with Xubuntu I have been dual-booting Xubuntu and Windows 10 since windows 10 came out as the final version a few months ago.

Can I convert them to H.264 in a command line batch file to rapidly convert the files for re-compression using Devede/OGMrip? Upon searching this site I have not found it discussed so I will post what I feel is a useful question and answer to the question.\n\nA: Yes, using ffmpeg.\nOpen a terminal and direct it to the directory containing the H.265 encoded files, assuming you have ffmpeg and the appropriate libraries installed and assuming they are in MKV format copy and paste the following into the terminal window.\nINPUT=\"$1\"\nfor i in *.mkv ; do\n    ffmpeg -i \"$i\" -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -sn -map 0:0 -map 0:1 -vcodec libx264 \"$i.ts\"\n    mv \"$i.ts\" \"$i.mpg\"\n    sleep 3\ndone\n\nThere you have it. This will convert to h.264 in an MPG container in the same directory.\nExplanation of the command switches:\n\n\n*\n\n*for i in *.mkv ; do ... done\nThis sets up all .mkv files in a directory to be included in the batch process. This may be changed to accommodate the container extension of the files you wish to process.\n\n*ffmpeg -i \"$i\"\nExecutes the program ffmpeg and calls for files to be processed.\n\n\n*\n\n*-bsf:v activates the video bit stream filter to be used.\n\n*h264_mp4toannexb - Is the bit stream filter that is activated.\nConvert an H.264 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.264 specification).\nThis is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2 transport stream format (mpegts) processing MKV h.264 (currently)requires this, if is not included you will get an error in the terminal window instructing you to use it.\n\n*-sn stops the streaming of subtitle streams (for those that do not want subtitles in their video) This is optional and can be removed.\n\n*-map 0:0 -map 0:1 Tells ffmpeg to only process the first two streams of the file (0:0 is the video stream, 0:1 is the first audio stream of the file). This does two things, strips the excess audio streams, usually the first audio stream is English but not always. Other streams such as embedded subtitles are removed reducing the file size. This is also an optional string. You can use ffprobe to view the streams available in the file. -map is optional and can be discarded from the command. \n\n*-vcodec libx264\nThis tells ffmpeg to encode the output to H.264\n\n*\"$i.ts\"\nSaves the output to .ts format, this is useful so as not to overwrite your source files.\n\n\n*mv \"$i.ts\" \"$i.mpg\" Converts the file extension to MPG in the same directory. This can be set up to send it to any directory you like.\n\n*sleep 3 - allows the process to rest giving ffmpeg time to queue the next file\n\nA: Batch conversion of H.265 to H.264\nThese examples were written for recent ffmpeg. Save yourself some trouble and download a recent version. Then put the ffmpeg binary in ~/bin or /usr/local/bin (you may have to log out then log in for it to be noticed).\nMatroska output\nmkdir h264vids\nfor f in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -map 0 -c copy -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium h264vids/\"${f%.*}.mkv\"; done\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This example will output to a directory named h264vids.\n\n*This example assumes your inputs are .mp4. If not, change the .mp4 instance in the example to your input file type, or just use the greedy * by itself.\n\n*Adjust -crf for quality and -preset for encoding speed/efficiency. Or just remove these options and use the defaults which are fairly good and should suffice for most (the example is using the default values for these options). See FFmpeg Wiki: H.264 for more info on these options.\nMP4 output\nThis one is a little more complicated. This will perform conditional encoding depending if the input audio is AAC or not. If the input audio is AAC then the audio will be stream copied (re-muxed) as is and needless re-encoding is avoided. If the input audio is not AAC then it will be re-encoded to AAC.\nHere's a simple script demonstrating how to do this using ffprobe and ffmpeg. Copy and save it to the directory containing your videos to be converted, give it execute permission with chmod +x yourscriptname, then run it with ./yourscriptname.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmkdir h264vids\n\nfor f in *.mkv\ndo\n  audioformat=$(ffprobe -loglevel error -select_streams a:0 -show_entries stream=codec_name -of default=nw=1:nk=1 \"$f\")\n  if [ \"$audioformat\" = \"aac\" ]; then\n    ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy -movflags +faststart h264vids/\"${f%.*}.mp4\"\n  else\n    ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -movflags +faststart h264vids/\"${f%.*}.mp4\"\n  fi\ndone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This example will output to a directory named h264vids.\n\n*This example assumes your inputs are .mkv. If not, change the .mkv instance in the example to your input file type, or just use the greedy * by itself.\n\n*See note above regarding -crf and -preset.\n\n*You can pause the encoding with ctrl+z and resume with fg.\n\nA: Considering the previous answers, I came up with the following:\nfor file in *265.mkv; do nice -n19 ffmpeg -i $file -c copy -c:v libx264 ${file/%265.mkv/264.mkv}; done\n\nThis assumes, that the files have always a name ending in 265.mkv. This ending will be replaced with 264.mkv.\nIf your file naming is different, you need to adapt the command accordingly.\n", "Q: Can Ransomware effect the Linux OS?

I recently upgraded to 15.10 and jumped through a bunch of hoops to get Clementine running and somewhere along the way I stopped seeing text on quite a few web pages in Firefox. \nI thought that a plugin check would help, but ... \nIf I use the element inspector, the text is definitely there. But it isn't showing up on the screen. I can't seem to find a pattern to it, except that it is consistent. I never see headlines on SFist.com or LAist.com but I can read the articles fine. But there doesn't seem to be an obvious pattern to which fonts don't show up. \nThis started when I got Clementine installed, but I don't have a record of exactly what I installed that day (maybe there is a record I can access somewhere?) and I can't figure out why that would cause fonts to stop appearing in my web browser. \nAny tips on troubleshooting this? \nUpdate: I see the same behavior in a clean profile, with no add-ons. I see the same behavior in a fresh user account. \nOn one page, using the element inspector to disable \"sans-serif\" at the end of a list like font-family: \"Open Sans\",X-LocaleSpecific,sans-serif; renders the page readable. Same with Ubuntu,\"Bitstream Vera Sans\",\"DejaVu Sans\",Tahoma,sans-serif; If I pull sans-serif off the end, I see the page fine (in a serif font). \nSo it seems like Firefox is unable to find anything to fill that set of requirements -- it has no sans-serif font at all? \n\nA: If you know the name of any of the font packages you typically have installed, you can use the locate command:locate fontName | less or locate fontName | grep -iv java | less to filter out unwanted results.\nIf you do not know the font name, you will have to get your system back to a working state and then see if you can identify them. Either way, 'locate' will probably be able to show you where they are and if they move after your Clementine, etc. setups. For example, do you have much inside of /etc/fonts? Or /etc/X11/fonts?\nUPDATE: Since the problem seems to be with the default sans-serif, do fc-match sans-serif to find out what your system wants to use and make sure that it is available. \n", "Q: How to force Ubuntu to detect external display?

As expected, it activated Secure Boot but did not change any of the other values on the setup screens. This should fix the  ACPI issues.

I am confused about archiving and compression and I am going to write what I think is correct.\nHere are the commands that I wish to get a better understanding of:\ntar –c file > file.tar\ntar –cf file.tar file // this command and the previous one are about the same\n\nI think that the previous commands merely create a sort of common folder (archive) in which we have the exact files we had before executing the archiving command (the size is not reduced at all), The only difference is that the third one will produce an archive with .gz instead of .tar.\nTo reduce the archive’s size (compress it) we have to use:\ntar -cjf file.tar.bz2 file\ntar –cJf file.tar.xz file\n\ngzip file.tar // it’ll create a compressed file called file.tar.gz\ntar -cz file  > file.tar.gz \n\nThe way I see it is that, if the extension is .gz, .bz2, or .xz it is compressed and if it is .tar it is archived, Is that correct?\n\nA: I think this one answers your question: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/127169/does-tar-actually-compress-files-or-just-group-them-together\nTo confirm what you think: tar indeed just puts the file together in an archive without any compression. It is the compression flags you can use that will make tar use a type of compression when creating the archive.\nAlso, the file extensions are typed manually, so you could be fooled like this:\ntar -cz file > file.tar.bz2 (when you should have used .tar.gz instead)\nIf you want to extract this file later you will fool yourself thinking you used gzip compression, so know what you are doing or document somewhere what you did.\n\nA: 'tar' literally means tape archive and stores and extracts files from a tape (or disk) archive. tar supports a large number of compression programs such as gzip, bzip2, lzip, lzma, lzop, xz and traditional compress\ntar commands should begin with a function such as \n[-] A --catenate --concatenate | c --create | d --diff --compare |\n         --delete | r --append | t --list | --test-label | u --update | x\n         --extract --get [options] [pathname ...]\n\nthe -a option can be used to autodetect the compression desired from the suffix (extension) of the file being created. tar should autodetect the compression type and act accordingly on extraction without a need for specific information. It will only fall back on the suffix for type determination if the signature check fails. For much much more on tar issue the command man tar and to learn more about tar compression specifically, see: https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_69.html\nThere are a number of options that can modify the results. tar allows for the addition to, and removal  The extension in no way indicates file type. For instance I've seen image files from a Windows system with an extension of .jpg that were actually .gif. To find out the file type open a terminal with Ctrl Alt T navigate to the directory with the file in question and issue the command file filename Here's an example of output from a gzip compressed file:\n$ file wireless-info.tar.gz \nwireless-info.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Thu Apr 23 07:45:20 2015\n\nChanging the extension in no way changes the output of file making it a trustworthy way of determining filetype even on files you don't own and have no notes on. Here's an example after renaming the previous file and removing the .gz...\n$ file wireless-info.tar\nwireless-info.tar: gzip compressed data, from Unix, last modified: Thu Apr 23 07:45:20 2015\n\nFor more on file and how it works issue the command man file\nSources: Experience & https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_69.html\n", "Q: usb-modeswitch update I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I have a modem on stick that is not recoqnized by OS.

Would creating a script using init.d or adding an Upstart job would be better way for running the deamon on startup for ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: And now, the Ubuntu answer.\nYou are using Ubuntu Linux. You already have either upstart or systemd (the former in this particular case). Do not begin by writing System 5 rc scripts.\n/etc/rc.local is a double backwards compatibility mechanism, because it is a backwards compatibility mechanism for a mechanism that was itself a compatibility mechanism in System 5 rc. And as shown by the mess that https://askubuntu.com/a/618138/43344 addresses, using /etc/rc.local can go horribly wrong.  Do not begin by using rc.local.\nupstart and version 14\nSo write an upstart job file.  \nIt would look something like this:\n\n# /etc/init/dtnd.conf\n\ndescription \"DTN2 daemon\"\n\nstart on filesystem and static-network-up\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nenv DAEMON='/usr/sbin/dtnd'\n\nrespawn\n\nexec /usr/sbin/dtnd -c /etc/dtn/dtn.conf -o /var/log/dtn/log\n\nAdjust for your log and configuration set up; and use as an upstart job, in the usual manner, with initctl start, initctl stop, and so forth.\nDo not use the -d option.  The program is already \"daemonized\" by dint of being run under a service manager.\nsystemd and version 15\nSo write a systemd service unit.\nThe first rule for migrating to systemd applies … yet again.  Someone has already done this.  For an example, see dtnd.service written by a pseudonymous person in 2012.\nAgain: Do not use the -d option.  The program is already \"daemonized\" by dint of being run under a service manager.\nAlso note that you don't need the -o option.  Log to standard output/standard error in the ordinary way, and systemd will write it to the journal.\nUse as a systemd service, in the usual manner, with systemctl start, systemctl stop, systemctl status, and so forth.

Get a Lubuntu ISO now at:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu\nYou can either burn it to a CD/DVD or put the Live system in a USB drive with a program such as UNetBootin, available here:\nhttps://unetbootin.github.io/\nDownload your ISO, install UNetBootin and run it, select to install with an existing ISO and select your USB thumb drive as the output drive. We're good to go, boot from your fresh CD/DVD/USB!\nYou will see a menu with several options. The first of them is \"Try Lubuntu without installing\". Select it and do everything you would do in an everyday OS, like creating documents and browsing the web. If everything is fine, you can proceed with the installation. You can choose to install Lubuntu alongside Windows or, why not, erase Windows and install Lubuntu over it. The second option usually leaves you with a faster OS, because it will be installed in the beginning of your disk.\nAfter installing (the whole process should take about 20 minutes), reboot your PC and you should go directly into Lubuntu. Let me recommend you some packages considered essential by me (you can get them at Lubuntu's Software Center):\nLibreOffice: this amazing office suite comes with Ubuntu but is not included in Lubuntu so it's more compact. In Lubuntu it's replaced by gnumeric and abiword, but LibreOffice is always better.\nWine: wine is a program that creates a compatibility layer to run Windows software in Linux (there is also a Mac version). With wine you will be able to run everything you need from Windows, including games. Note: Wine is NOT an emulator, it is a compatibility layer. This means that you will NOT have much performance loss. But you can always find free, open-source alternatives to Windows programs for Linux.\nGIMP: this incredible program is used to edit images in a professional level, a great replacement for Adobe's Photoshop.\nOpenShot: a very simple yet powerful video editor for Linux. It's very user-friendly and easy to use and has tons of features.\nThere is a program called \"additional drivers\", it comes with Lubuntu and you can find it in the applications menu. Use it to enable proprietary hardware drivers and increase even more the performance!\nThese are my hints for now! Don't be afraid to test, configure and use Linux. It's wonderful!\n\nA: My desktop computer is also 10 years and came with Windows XP installed. I dual booted Lubuntu 14.04 LTS on my hard drive. Before installing Lubuntu I used GParted to partition the hard drive between XP, an XP Recovery, and an extended partition for Lubuntu and a swap partition.\nI can access my Windows XP partition and copy Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and photographs I've saved to my Lubuntu partition. I can use LibreOffice products to do every thing I had used MS Office to do. Other than copying a occasional file, I don't use Windows XP any more. I use Chome as my browser. You can use Firefox if you prefer. \nIn April, 2016, a new Long Term Support (LTS) version of Ubuntu (and Lubuntu) will be issued. At that time I'll switch completely to Lubuntu and use the disk space occupied by Windows XP and the Recovery partitions.\nFollow the instruction given to generate a DVD or USB stick. Try Lubuntu. I think you will find that you can do all of your usual computer tasks just as well as you did with Windows XP. You can enjoy the updates and upgrades provided by Lubuntu, and if you have issues or problems, Askubuntu is there to find solutions.\n\nA: Make sure that you backup any pictures, files, documents or music that you want to keep on external media before installing even if you are going to install along side windows. I have found out the hard way that installations may not go the way you expect.\n", "Q: use jpg as background image I am trying to install a custom background image on my xfce desktop. When I browse for the image the file is grayed out regardless of what I do. I trier to chmod it to my username, place it in /usr/share/background/ - nothing helped.\nHow can I use my image? \nthanks,\n\nA: In the XFCE settings, when you select to change the folder, you cannot select any images. Select the folder where your image is, press Open and THEN select it from the menu.\n", "Q: Primary SSD on Dell Precision 7510 Cannot Be Detected by Ubuntu Installer I've been trying to install Ubuntu along with the pre-installed Win 10 on my new Dell Precision 7510 with a PCIe SSD as the primary hard drive (this is where Win 10 was pre-installed) and a SATA HDD as the second hard drive. The problem is that Ubuntu installer cannot detect the SSD. It can only recognize my HDD and the USB thumb drive that I used for installation. The fdisk command doesn't list the SSD either. I've tried both 14.04 and 15.10 and neither worked. However there is no issue with the SSD when running Windows. Anyone's got the same issue or knows how to fix it? I'm pretty new to Linux so any advice would be a big help. Many thanks!\n\nA: I was able to install both Ubuntu 14.04 and 15.10 on the Dell Precision 7510 (settled for Ubuntu 15.10 due to out-of-the-box Wireless driver support).\nIn order for the installer to recognise the disk I went into the BIOS:\nSystem Configuration -> SATA Operation -> Choose AHCI\nApply and Exit\nThat did the trick for me.\n\nA: I had to disable SATA-0 as well. Ubuntu did not install right away. SSD card was not recignized in 14.04. Installed openSuse first, than Ubuntu install worked fine\n\nA: on my Dell Precision T5600 SSD was not getting detected by windows 10 setup . After spending hours, it turns out that there are SATA ports separate then HD ports although they have same connector . once I plug-in SSD in one of the ports marked as SATA (partially covered by a cover) it start working as expected.\n", "Q: Cannot access shared folder on another Ubuntu machine I have ubuntu 15.10 installed on two PCs.\nOn PC A I have shared the /home folder (as a result samba + other were installed automatically).\nFrom PC B I can see the folder but when I try to open it I just get this greyed out screen:\n\nBefore getting that screen I did select Registered User and typed the user and password for the user I use to login to PC A.\nHow do I access the shared folder from PC B?\nIs there some mandatory checklist that I need to go through to make this work, since it apparently is not something that works out of the box?\nI made it work using this guide:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Network%20Share%20Via%20Samba%20Via%20CLI%20(Command-line%20interface/Linux%20Terminal)%20-%20Uncomplicated,%20Simple%20and%20Brief%20Way!\nAnd connecting using this guide:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaClientGuide\n\nA: Do you configure correctly :\n\n\n*\n\n*adduser john\n\n*addgroup users\n\n*sudo chown -R john:users folder\n\n*sudo chmod -R 0770 folder/\n\n*sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\nAnd add following lines:\n[folder]\npath = /home/samba/folder\nvalid users = john\nguest ok = no\nwritable = yes\nbrowseable = yes\nsecurity = user\n\n\n\n*/etc/init.d/samba restart\n\n*sudo usermod -a -G users john\n\n*sudo smbpasswd -a john\n\n*enter passwd:\n\n", "Q: Can I detect on Ubuntu if Windows XP computer is on? I would like to measure how much a laptop with Windows XP can run on batteries. I have another computer with Xubuntu that I can use to measure if Windows XP computer is on. But how can I connect these two computers and how can I measure if Xubuntu can read data from Windows XP computer? Or should XP send some data to Xubuntu?\n\nA: I think the easiest solution is using ICMP echo requests (ping). For this, you have to set up the XP box to respond to ICMP messages, as described here.\nNow, make sure the Linux and the XP machine are in the same network, and both have an IP address. You can check this on Linux with\nifconfig\n\nand on Windows with\nipconfig /all\n\nYou'll need the XP IP address for the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\ntime (\n    while [ true ]; do\n        ping -c 1 \"$1\" > /dev/null || break\n        sleep 60\n    done\n)\n\nSave this script in some file, e.g. pingtimer.sh and make it executable with chmod +x pingtimer.sh\nYou can now start it with\n./pingtimer.sh <target IP address>\n\nfrom within the same directory.\n\nLet's break this thing down:\n\n\n*\n\n*time () measures the time the command inside the () took to execute.\n\n*while [true]; do ...; done repeats the inner command (...) infinitely or until interrupted or broken.\n\n*ping -c 1 \"$1\" > /dev/null sends one ping request to the IP address stored in $1, which is the first program argument, i.e. the target IP. As ping produces a lot of output, we'll just discard that to /dev/null\n\n*... || break will break the 'infinite' while loop if the command before the || operator returns a non-zero value. In case of ping, this happens if at least one ICMP packet was not responded to. If this happens, e.g. because the target machine is down, the program will quit, printing the output from time.\n\n*sleep 60 will cause the process to sleep for 60 seconds, after which another ICMP Echo request is sent. Adjust this value to taste. Note that some firewalls will stop responding if you start flooding it with pings.\n\n", "Q: How to make a double-newline? I want to print in the Terminal something like this:\nlollipop\nlollipo\nlollip\nlolli\nloll\nlol\nlo\nl\n\nHowever if i do -n twice i get a newline and then it just prints \"-n\" if i use echo.

Here I am using AWK to print the ever decreasing substring that was provided with here-string . Note that I could have used printf \"%s\" lollipop | awk . . . as well for better portability\n$ awk '{for(i=length($1);i>=1;i--) print substr($1,1,i)}' <<< \"lollipop\"       \nlollipop\nlollipo\nlollip\nlolli\nloll\nlol\nlo\nl\n\nAWK's print function always prints a single line, similar to java's System.out.println.

I paired up my Galaxy S3 (running Android Kit-Kat) to my laptop running Ubuntu, and my phone seems to think that Ubuntu is a Bluetooth speaker. It works as a bluetooth speaker mind you, but I need to send my files to the computer, wirelessly, since my phone has a wobbly physical connection.\nI know I could use an alternative like google drive or dropbox, but it'd be nice if the bluetooth worked.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: Install the blueman package. Blueman is a graphical configuration tool for Bluetooth. Install it from the Software Center or run the following in a terminal (without quotes):\n'sudo apt-get install blueman'\nAfter installing, run it with the command 'blueman' or by searching \"blue\" in the dash.\n", "Q: Setting system-wide environment variable using /etc/environment I want to add to my PATH so that my computer (Ubuntu) knows where to interpret the \"R\" command (for launching R). I need this so a Terminal or RStudio can find where I installed R.\nI did all of the following, none of which permanently associates the command R with the directory of my R installation in ~/R/bin.\n\n\n*\n\n*export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/R/bin      <- This works within the Terminal session it was enacted in, but if I open up a second terminal, PATH goes back to what it was before I added $HOME/R/bin to it\n\n\nThe same \"local Terminal only\" behavior occurred when I added this line to two different files, based on recommendations on various websites:\n\n\n*sudo vim ~/.profile \nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/R/bin\n\n\n*sudo vim /etc/environment\nexport PATH=$PATH:$HOME/R/bin\n\nWhy won't R be recognized in new Terminal sessions? \n\nA: The /etc/environment file is not a script file: AFAIK you can't use export there and it doesn't support variable expansion of the type $HOME, just simplevariable=value pairs. So to use that file, you'd need to simply append your path to the existing definition, like\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/home/username/R/bin\"\n\nHowever, setting the system-wide PATH to include a user's home directory in this way is a questionable practice IMHO: the normal way would be to use one of the user's own shell startup files: ~/.profile is usually the recommended one for environment variables, however it has the disadvantage of only being invoked by login shells, so in order to get it to take effect you will need to log out and back in - or at least, start a new login shell e.g. using\n    su - username\n\nor\n    su -l username\n\nNote that sudo should not be used to edit these personal files, as it will likely leave them owned by root, which can cause further problems down the road. If you have already used sudo vim you may need to use sudo chown to restore their correct ownership e.g.\nsudo chown username:username ~/.profile\n\nThen you can add the desired path component using your preferred editor e.g.\nvim ~/.profile\n\nYou could even consider copying the existing paradigm for ~/bin in that file i.e. add it as\n# set PATH so it includes user's private R bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/R/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/R/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\n", "Q: How do I get out of the endless cycle of GNU GRUB terminal?

I have a gut feeling it means \"make data storage accessible\", but what does it really mean? Please specify the cases when \"disk is accessible\" and \"disk is mounted\" are different\".\n\nA: Well, let's get back to the basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you plug in a memory device, such as a flash drive, the Linux kernel creates a special file for it inside the /dev directory. All your devices are represented by one of those files.\n\n*When this device is not mounted you cannot access/read/write from it.  It's just like a \"stand-by\" mode, it's ready to be used, but not being used yet.\n\n*When you mount the device you have to specify a mountpoint. This is a very confusing concept for users coming from Windows. In Windows, every memory device has its own root. In Linux, they are always mounted inside of one single root.\n\n*Mounting a memory device is basically \"turning it on\" from the \"stand-by\" mode. It is accessible through the specified mountpoint.\n\n*The /mnt directory exists so you can mount things in it. In some distributions (like Ubuntu) there is also a /media directory, for the same purpose.\n\nA: For simplicity, I'll limit this answer to usual storage devices like disks and flash drives.\nWhen you plug in your device, its driver makes it accessible as a device node, which to user programs looks like a file: e.g. /dev/sda. Now the disk is already accessible. You can read and write it. Here's an example of how you could look at its MBR (first 512 bytes) in hexadecimal+ASCII form:\nsudo head -c 512 /dev/sda | xxd -g1\n\nBut if you have some files on that device and you want to access them, this low-level look isn't quite satisfactory. You want to involve a file system driver. For this you mount the device, using mount utility. To make it more obvious, I'll specify the file system explicitly in the following command (assuming I've made the correct choice of ext4; if not, mount will tell you):\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ -t ext4\n\nAfter this, your device will be exposed in /mnt/ in the format user programs expect it: files and directories — instead of just plain sectors.\nYou may wonder why I used sda1 instead of sda in the command above. It's because between filesystem level and plain sectors level there's a small layer of partitioning, and here sda1 denotes the first partition on device sda.\n\nA: How familiar are you with Windows (or — ugh! — DOS)? \nIf you have gotten beyond absolute newbie status on either of them,\nyou know that your main system secondary storage device (hard disk or SSD)\nis called C:.  (For simplicity,\nI will assume that the computer has only one secondary storage device,\nand that it has only one partition.) \nThe root directory is C:\\, and it contains other directories\nlike C:\\Intel, C:\\Program Files, C:\\Users, and C:\\Windows. \nThese can contain yet another layer of directories; e.g.,\nC:\\Program Files\\Oracle, C:\\Users\\your_name, and so on.\n\n\n*\n\n*But if you insert an optical disc (CD or DVD) into the appropriate drive,\nit becomes D:.  And it also has a root directory,\nD:\\, and typically subordinate directories like D:\\Install.\n\n*And if you remember diskettes (“floppy disks”),\nyou’ll recall that they were disk A: (and, in the really old days,\nyou could have a second one, which, naturally, was called B:). \nAnd the same pattern applies:\nthe root directory A:\\ could contain folders like A:\\GAMES and A:\\WORK.\n\n*Other removable drives (e.g., USB drives)\nhave drive letters beyond D (perhaps F),\nand the root directory F:\\ could contain folders like F:\\Project1.\n\n*And if you have network drives,\nthey might have drive letters near the end of the alphabet (perhaps Z),\nand the root directory Z:\\ could contain folders like Z:\\Project2.\n\n\nSo your whole computer’s directory layout looked something like this:\n     A:\\                          C:\\                             D:\\        F:\\        Z:\\\n    ⋰ ⋱                     ⋰  ⋰  ⋱  ⋱                       ⋰         ⋰          ⋰\n   ⋰   ⋱               ⋰     ⋰      ⋱     ⋱                 ⋰         ⋰          ⋰\n  ⋰     ⋱         ⋰        ⋰          ⋱        ⋱           ⋰         ⋰          ⋰\nGAMES   WORK    Intel   Program Files   Users    Windows    Install    Project1    Project2\n                             ⋰          ⋰\n                           ⋰          ⋰\n                         ⋰          ⋰\n                     Oracle     user480468\n\nSo you could have, in principle,\nup to 26 independent filesystem directory trees,\neach with its own root directory.  And I suppose that works well enough,\nespecially now that Windows ties them all together in the Computer\n(previously known as My Computer) superfolder. \n(But then again, look at how hard it is to install programs\non a disk other than C:, or to move your user directory off C:.) \nAnd note that Computer is a pseudo-folder —\nyou can’t create files or directories in Computer.\nUnix has a philosophy that includes the concept\nDo One Thing and Do It Well. \n(Even the name “Unix” is derived from the prefix “un-” or “uni-”,\nmeaning “one”.) \nSo it’s not surprising that the designers of Unix\nchose to have a single filesystem directory tree;\nyou’re probably familiar with it:\n                                        /\n                               ⋰ ⋰ ⋰  ⋮  ⋱ ⋱ ⋱\n                         ⋰   ⋰   ⋰    ⋮    ⋱   ⋱   ⋱\n                   ⋰     ⋰     ⋰      ⋮      ⋱     ⋱     ⋱\n             ⋰       ⋰       ⋰        ⋮        ⋱       ⋱       ⋱\n       ⋰         ⋰         ⋰          ⋮          ⋱         ⋱         ⋱\n ⋰           ⋰           ⋰            ⋮            ⋱            ⋱            ⋱\nbin         dev          etc           home           mnt          tmp          usr    …\n                                       ⋰                                       ⋰⋱\n                                     ⋰                                       ⋰    ⋱\n                                   ⋰                                       ⋰        ⋱\n                              user48046                                   bin         lib\n\nThe beauty of this is that you (in your role of system administrator)\ncan put everything in one partition,\nor put /home in one partition and /usr in another,\nand you (in your role of user) can forget about it. \nYou don’t need to know what disk (partition) /usr is on;\nit appears under the one-and-only filesystem root (/) regardless. \nThe mild drawback is that you (in your role of power user)\nmust maintain this unified filesystem directory tree when you add\n(and remove) storage components. \nWhen you insert a CD or a flash drive, it’s just an entry under /dev,\nwhich you probably shouldn’t mess with too much. \nYou can do some things with the device node, like run fsck or fdisk;\nor possibly configure it as a dedicated database storage device\n(e.g., for Oracle) — because the disk is accessible. \nBut you can’t access the files (and directories) on it,\nbecause they aren’t in the filesystem yet —\nbecause the disk is not mounted.\nTL;DR\nAnd this is where mount comes in. \nmount is the command that attaches a filesystem\n(e.g., on a removable device) to the filesystem\n(the one starting at /).1 \nYou’ll notice that there is a /mnt directory under the / directory. \nConventionally,\ntransient (removable) filesystem storage devices are mounted onto directories\nunder /mnt; i.e., they are attached to the filesystem there. \nAnd on some systems,\nsome devices are automatically mounted when they are detected. \nBut, in theory,\nyou can mount a filesystem anywhere in the filesystem.\n___________\n1 Splitting hairs,\nmount is a program that calls the mount() system call,\nwhich attaches a filesystem to the filesystem.\n\nA: When you 'mount' something you are placing access to the file system contained within onto your root file system structure. Effectively giving the files a location. This is similar to the C:/D: drive labels in windows.\nMounting /dev/sdb1 to /mnt/disk1 places all the files and folders contained within the device standard disk B partition 1 into the directory /mnt/disk1 where you can access them.\nModern systems have ways to auto-mount drives just as windows auto-mounts drives to drive letters, but the location mounting system in Unix is much more flexible. And unmounting is obviously the removal of the access to those files/folders from that location. You can find out what file systems are mounted by running the command:\nmount\n\nInvolved parts : mount, umount, fstab (for fixed mounts), udev, gvfs (for automatic mounting)\n", "Q: How and when to use groups? I have only one user on my computer, and I never set any group permissions. When are they useful? Can you give me a few examples?\n\nA: A good example is that, by default the Apache web server runs as user and group www-data.\nYour user ID is not www-data, nor is your default group ID.  You can't arbitrarily change your user ID and retain the integrity of your access, but you can add your username to a group and have access to files that are not normally available to a normal user.\nYou could add your user id to the www-data group with the command:\n$ sudo adduser [username] [groupname]\n\nAfter that command the user with the username will have access to files with the groupname.  By the way, you won't use the brackets.  The brackets in the example is to show you a variable that can be replaced.\nNow you could create files on your web server that you could edit.  The server itself would be able to make updates to the files also\nBy the way you can remove a user from a group with:\n$ sudo deluser [username] [groupname]\n\nThere are many other group access examples that you could find just by looking at the various groups that are available by default.  You can check the group list with:\n$ less /etc/group\n\nYou'll probably notice that your username has access to a number of system features such as plugdev (the feature that give access to usb devices that you might attach to your computer).  You'll may also notice that you have access to the cdrom device (the cdrom group).\nAn important one is the sudo group, which allows you to use the elevated/super user commands.\nAn for using the www-data group access\nI used www-data as an example.  By default the web files are owned by root.  They are not available to be edited by other users.  You can specify the files to a different group according to who you want to have access to be able to edit the files.  Then you can give access to those people (including the web server) access.\nSince the web server  is running under the user and group ID, www-data, you could give the web server access to making changes to files by changing them to that user or group.  By default your web server can't make changes to any of the web files.\nIf you had a reason for your server to make changes to certain web files (or folders) that would be an occasion to change the files (or folders) to that specific user or group.\nCreating a group\nThank in consideration that you might also have an occasion where you want to give specific access to particular files or folders to yourself and to other userID's.  You can create a group specific for that and add access to that group with the commands above.\nA commandline for creating a group is:\n$ sudo addgroup <groupname>\n\nThere might be an occasion where you might write a program to perform specific task.  You could create a user and group ID for that program.  Place the files and folders that the program will be accessing (reading and writing to) in that group with the command above.\nThe FTP daemon and protocol is an example.  If you wanted to allow people to upload files to your computer, you would create a specific directory and give write access via user or group to that directory so that the FTP daemon can write to it.\nYou wouldn't want the FTP daemon to be able to write anywhere on your system.  So you would specify by user or group access where the FTP daemon can read or write.\nNote\nNotice the $ in front of the terminal commands.  This is an indicator of the command prompt from a normal user's login session.  If the command was coming from the root login the default prompt is the # symbol.\nWhen logged in as a normal user, yuo have to prefix your command with the sudo command to elevate the access to the super doer.  This isn't necessary it you're logged in as root.  Also it's easy to look at the text and see with commands needs to be elevated, such as adduser.  Notice teh /etc/group is (by default) world readable, so you don't need the elevated command (root access) to read the content.  You would need it to write to it.\n", "Q: Grub2 not updating I have an Nvida Quadro FX2700M and I was trying to fix suspend so I switched to the proprietary driver.

If so, you can do:\nperl -pe 's/(?<!;)\\s*\\n/ /' file > newfile\n\nOr, to edit the file in place, use -i:\nperl -i.bak -pe 's/(?<!;)\\s*\\n/ /' file\n\nThe above will make the changes to file and create a backup of the original called file.bak. To skip creating the backup just use -i alone, without an extension.\nExplanation\nThe -p means \"print every input line after applying the script given by -e. The s/// is the substitution operator. Its general format is s/pattern/replacement/ and will replace pattern with replacement.\nIn this case, pattern is 0 or more whitespace characters (\\s*) followed by a newline (\\n) which are not preceded by a ;. The (?<!foo)bar construct is a negative lookbehind, it will match bar if the previous characters are not foo. Therefore, the script above will remove all newlines that aren't just after a ;.\n\nA: The script below should do the job.

This could affect services on your server that send traffic from eth0 and expect to not have its ports changed.\nFor example, if you're running an IPSec VPN service bound to the eth0 interface on your server, it will have the source port in its outbound packets changed and thus will cause the connection to fail.\nI recommend you change that NAT rule to the following:\n iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --source $lan_network --out-interface eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nThis will ensure that ONLY your LAN network's Internet connections will be masqueraded out of the WAN interface.\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: difference between ubuntu server , minimal and desktop? i found similar two question on Askubuntu that are 3-4 year old. \nWhat is the difference between minimal, desktop & server Editions?\nand\nIs using Ubuntu Minimal any different from Server?\nBut this ubuntu page says \n\nBefore 12.04, Ubuntu server installs a server-optimized kernel by\n  default.

Further information here.\nThe Server version has a lot less packages, when fully installed, as it doesn't have all of the extra desktop stuff such as GUIs for file managers etc.\nThe page that you've quoted, is saying there's no difference in the kernel between server and desktop versions.\nThe Server installation is the recommended one for server deployment.\n", "Q: Define a globally available bash function to be used by any script I'm running a simple webserver using Ubuntu server.

Softwares is better stored in there... like that.\n\n/home/shifar is your home dir and dedicated for your personal uses. You can store your personal dirs, files in any dirs in it. ~/Documents may be a good place for Projects. ~/Public is normally shared to anyone in the network. So if you do not want to share, put your files in another dirs instead.\n\nA: The previous answers are all good. I would just add a few points.\nLater, (not now!) when you're more comfortable with Linux, you may want to create a separate partition for data - especially if you have big files like lots of music or video. If you add too many of these to your home partition, you can fill it up and then other things stop working because they can't get the disk space they need.\nIf you fill up a data partition, it doesn't affect anything else.\nAlso, when you want to backup your data, you can just do it any time. /home has things which change all the time, so you can't normally \"freeze\" it to get a copy where everything is in sync. With a separate data partition, you can make a perfect backup any time.\nAs far as paths go, if you are working from the command line, you can define a bash alias (in ~/.bashrc or in ~/.bash_aliases) to shorten any path or even to change into the directory.\nalias proj='cd /home/shifar/Public/Projects'\nand then just type proj to switch to that directory.\nWhen you get more comfortable with bash, you can do even more with functions. But, we'll leave that till later.\nAnother approach would be to add a line to ~/.bashrc like\nexport PROJ='/home/shifar/Public/Projects'\n\nThat would make an environment variable PROJ available for use and you could do things like:\nls \"${PROJ}\"\ncd \"${PROJ}\"\ncp mynewfile \"${PROJ}\"\n\nIt will also work without the export in front of it, but then it would only be defined at the top level of your shell, not in any subshell you might run from there.\nYou don't strictly need the quotes or braces in the example above either, but they protect you from things like embedded blanks and also allow you to use PROJ as part of a word - like ${PROJ}ect.\n\nA: Ubuntu is just like your own conventional Windows. Only it is a different operating system. I am not sure what version of Ubuntu you are using. Regardless of that, Linux Environments including Ubuntu all offer a very user friendly GUI just like that of windows which shouldn't be difficult to understand for someone who is used to windows.\nIf you're not comfortable with the terminal, you can always just use the GUI and access your files and folders from there.\nAs far as where you should keep them, again, it's your own desktop. It's just a different system. It is exactly the same as windows. Just store them where you would store them in windows.\nThe file path can be shortened. You are currently in Projects. You can move up the tree and store your files in, let's say \"home\" folder. It's all up to you. But it is generally a good idea to keep personal files inside your username, that is \"shifar\" in this case.\nThe \"/\" indicates the root directory. It contains \"home\", which contains \"Shifar\" and so on. They are solely for keeping data classified and organized. A directory is what you would call a folder on your windows.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The files are personal as in you don't want other people looking at them, your home directory is a good choice, but you should also understand file permissions -- not directly on point to your question, but relevant. You should set your permssions as restrictive as possible, as permissive as necessary. Also, if you're concerned about privacy and security, Ubuntu provides a way to encrypt only your home directory, so you can keep your sensitive data quite secure. It's somewhat technical (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome).\nMy usual practice is to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data files one-by-one using gpg -- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto. This is also kind of technical but really important and worth your effort.\nI've never felt much compulsion to use the subdirectories in my homedir that Ubuntu installs. You're free to organize your data as you see fit.\n", "Q: Merging/joining a lot of csv files with numeric digits in the file name As we process our csv data, we generate a lot of output files with 30 000 lines in each one of them.

If you know the number of segments, 599 for example, you can use brace expansion  (the \\ is only there to let me print the command on two lines for readability):\ncat AB_20151127_120000_{0..599}_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv > \\\n    AB_20151127_120000_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\n\nIf you don't, you can still use brace expansion. Just choose a large enough number to be sure that all files will be included and ignore error messages about non-existant files:\ncat AB_20151127_120000_{0..599}_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv > \\\n    AB_20151127_120000_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv 2>/dev/null\n\nAlternatively, you can generate a list of sorted file names and use that:\ncat $(printf '%s\\n' AB_20151127_120000_*_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv | sort -nt_ -k4) > \\\n    AB_20151127_120000_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\n\nThe printf will print each file name followed by a newline which is the passed to sort which will sort it numerically (-n) on the 4th field (-t4) where fields are defined by _ (-t_). \n\nA: If you have access to a Zsh shell, the task can be reduced to a single command:\ncat AB_20151127_120000_*(n)_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv >AB_20151127_120000_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\n\nThis is because the (n) globbing qualifier forces the * globbing pattern to expand to a list of filenames sorted in their natural order, as opposed to their lexicographical order.\nFor comparison, filename expansion in Bash:\n$ for f in *; do echo \"$f\"; done\nAB_20151127_120000_0_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\nAB_20151127_120000_10_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\nAB_20151127_120000_1_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\nAB_20151127_120000_2_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\nAB_20151127_120000_3_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\n\nFilename expansion in Zsh using the (n) globbing qualifier:\n% for f in *(n); do echo \"$f\"; done\nAB_20151127_120000_0_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\nAB_20151127_120000_1_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\nAB_20151127_120000_2_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\nAB_20151127_120000_3_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\nAB_20151127_120000_10_SEGMENT_FINAL.csv\n\n", "Q: Sublime installation error I am trying to install Sublime through the following command.

On the page I linked, select either Ubuntu 64-bit or 32-bit, depending on your system, and save the .deb file to your ~/Downloads directory. Next, run the following commands, where XXXX is the build number:\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i sublime-text_build-XXXX_amd64.deb \n# for 64-bit\n# or\nsudo dpkg -i sublime-text_build-XXXX_i386.deb \n# for 32-bit\n\nThis will install ST3 in /opt/sublime_text, put the subl command in /usr/bin/subl, and set up icons properly.

I was just curious to know if there any difference in keeping the record of the terminal commands using script filename and manually copying it from terminal. Please tell me if there exists a bit of diffrence. What i know is using script command brings unnecessary keystrokes to file.\n\nA: The script command creates a script containing all your interactions with the terminal for your current session. It is basically creating a live screen dump and pasting the contents into a file.\nIt includes all inputs and outputs visible in the terminal.\nThe history command gives you all the commands entered into the terminal from the first time you used it.\nIt shows only inputs, either for your current session or for all sessions.\n\nA: There is a difference, but not how you might think.\nThe terminal can support ASCII characters - 0 to 127. This includes the Western, Latin Alphabet, including some accents like the grave accent ` and the punctuation like { and ~.\nSo when you copy paste from a terminal emulator you are copying ASCII characters into a UTF-8 file (most likely). Of course, UTF-8 and ASCII are compatible. The characters 0 to 127 in UTF-8 are the same as ASCII.\nWhen you output into a file, it will be ASCII by default, however that can be changed.\nSo why would anyone use redirection to a file if it's a less good encoding? Automation or Incompatibility.\nThe terminal you are using (likely Gnome Terminal or X-Term) is a terminal emulator - a terminal inside a graphical window.\nBut some terminal aren't like this - they are completely non graphical, CLI only - like the TTY terminals, accessed with Ctrl + Alt + FX where X is a number from 1 to 6. E.g. to access TTY2, use Ctrl + Alt + F2.\nThese terminals have no mouse - so you can't copy the output, or even scroll it.\nIf you are running a command with a lot of output you can either output it to a file and use nano or vi to view it, or you could use the less command, so allow arrow key scrolling.\nAnd if I have a code to monitor my dreadful internet speeds so I can get a discount on the cost of the internet I might want to automatically save the speed to a file - for example redirect the output of wget to a file.\nThis is the main use case - a computer can do it without any human input, and without a GUI. In these cases, the lack of characters like  and ☺ is not a big deal - you're just saving numbers essentially.\nIf you want to share the output, pastebinit is an excellent command. Simply run yourcommand | pastebinit and it will upload it to paste.ubuntu.com and give you the link.\n\nA: In short, script command captures more than just text, and on a different level.\nFor instance ls command. To produce coloured  output, ls adds special characters to each entry(read more about it here). If you were to call ls while script is capturing output, those special chars will be captured. It will also capture escape characters you may have pressed with the keyboard. \nscript also captures everything on that invisible, lower, system level.\nWith manual selecting text and copying, you are doing what ? Selecting text inside the X graphical server, right ? So where does the text come from and go ? It comes already rendered, already post processed,colorized, so it doesn't necessarily contain the special characters. It also goes into the clipboard ( which by the way is one of 3 in X server system ), then when you paste gets released from the clipboard. \nscript is good for when you want to record lengthy session, and pass it on to someone. The special characters are no problem when you just run default commands, not the colorized ones (by default ls is aliased to ls --color=auto ). So you either can use backslash to escape aliases\\ls or use this solution from stackoverflow site. \nAs for copy-paste method, it's good for short output that you just want to pass on and forget about\nAdditions\nI've also noticed you are more interested in history vs script for recoding list of commands that you enter in terminal. Difference between them is that history only keeps records of what you tell the terminal to run. script is like recording of your terminal, where everything is captured.\nThey are storing data differently too. While for bash the .bash_history it's text, other shell may choose a data file. For instance here's comparison of my mksh history file, vs .bash_history, vs typescript\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ file MKSHHISTFILE \nMKSHHISTFILE: data\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ file .bash_history\n.bash_history: UTF-8 Unicode text\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ file typescript\ntypescript: ASCII text, with CRLF, LF line terminators\n\nWith history, it's different from shell to shell. bash by default keeps everything in .bash_history, while with shells like ksh or mksh and dash, history file has to be set by the user.  script,by default stores everything in typescript file, but user can specify another file,too.  \nFinally, history is one of builtins to a shell, which will always be present, but may or may not need to be configured. script is a utility, which may or may not be present, but needs no config.\n", "Q: Why can not I log in Ubuntu?

I want it to only send when the service actually has restarted from stopped.\nCan anyone explain which part i've got wrong\n\nA: There are a couple of issue in your if statement.\nThe! at the beginning of condition test means that you're looking for whether the expression \"$(/usr/sbin/service mysql status)\" is false, which is not what you want to achieve. You want to check that the outcome of service status command is not a string that contains 'start/waiting'. != is the best way to say not equal to.\nAlso, the =~ is expecting a regular expression, where you're just supplying a part of the string that you expect to see. As the double bracket syntax of if statements supports shell globbing, you can search for the 'start/waiting' with *start/waiting*. \nIf you change the line:\nif [[ ! \"$(/usr/sbin/service mysql status)\" =~ \"start/running\" ]]\n\nTo:\nif [[ \"$(/usr/sbin/service mysql status)\" != *start/running* ]]\n\nYour script should work properly, otherwise, I think you're restarting the service, and emailing, every time the script runs.\nEDIT:\nThe following is not an ideal solution, I'm just posting it to try to help with the current situation you're facing.\nTo try to cope with output from systemd-sysv-generator you could try replacing the first line of the if statement with:\nif [[ \"$(/usr/sbin/service mysql status)\" = *inactive* ]]\n\n", "Q: IF inside UNTIL.

Usually with ubuntu live usb (I don't know with persistent mode) you can access the information in /cdrom directory which also have a link in /media/$USERNAME.

I also have a hunch that it's the later kernel that's borking the software I'm using although the vendors docs aren't specific and i haven't got an answer from them about this.\nFor clarity, I'd like to add that i do not currently know where the source of incompatibility is between the software I am running and Ubuntu releases >14.04.1 Just that this is what I have been told by the vendor and this does appear to be the case. Whilst i get to the bottom of where these incompatibilities lie, I'm after a way that will allow me to remain on 14.04.1 whilst updating packages that don't constitute a move to anything >14.04.1. If the anwer to this is you can't that's fine, I'd just like to know.\nTL:DR\n1) How can I hold Ubuntu at version 14.04.1 and prevent upgrade to 14.04.2 or 14.04.3 whilst retaining the ability to apply updates to my packages.\n2) Am I misunderstanding Ubuntu LTS strategy and point releases by expecting point releases not to change things dramatically enough to break compatibility\n3) Can I achieve my aim by holding the kernel on the 14.04.1 (3.13.0-32) version, and is this sane?\nThanks.\n\nA: You do not need deliberately \"stick on a point release\".\nThe main difference between point releases is HWE Stack that includes new kernel major version and new xorg with related user space drivers.\nWhen you do normal package upgrades, you will never be moved to a new kernel major version or new graphical stack.\nKernel 3.13 will get security and bug fixing updates till 14.04 EOL. You do not need to freeze on 3.13.0-32.\nThe current 3.13 version is 3.13.0.71.77.\nIf you are worried by the version number, you can freeze base-files package by running:\nsudo apt-mark hold base-files\n\nIn this case you will get all updates, but you will never see \"point\" release number.\nIf you have installed 14.04.3, you can switch to kernel 3.13 by running\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic\n\nThen you will need to remove linux-image and linux-headers of version 3.19.\n\nA: You (and probably the vendor of your binary as well) misunderstand what Ubuntu point releases are about. All that happens is that at some point after 14.04 was released, the Ubuntu developers say: \"Okay, 14.04 has been out for a while and there are a lot of updates. For someone installing 14.04 now it's a bit of a bummer to have to install all those updates, so let's create ISOs of 14.04 plus all the updates released until now, and call that 14.04.1.\" And then the same happens after that, yielding 14.04.2, etc.\nSo, \"keeping 14.04.1 but still installing updates\" is a contradiction. If you install from a 14.04.1 ISO and then install updates, you move towards 14.04.2, and ultimately you will reach it. You or the vendor of your binary need to find out what exactly causes it to work on a bare 14.04.1 install but not on a 14.04.2 one. This was caused by some updates that were installed after 14.04.1 was installed, and you need to find out which ones so you can block them. Otherwise, they will be installed as part of the normal updates, as well.\nOh and for your other questions :\n2) Not really; it is reasonable to assume that Ubuntu point releases will not break things. Sadly, even the most reasonable assumptions fail sometimes.\n3) Holding a kernel version is possible and should not break your system. You don't even really need to do anything: even if new kernels are installed, the old one will still be available. Of course, you will not benefit from bug fixes of new kernels if you use an old one, however.\n", "Q: Command to compare two strings I need to compare two strings and ignoring the case of the contents.\nIF [ $first != $second ].

(End of file)\n\nI don't know how to copy file name instead of this %20 %20 thing .\nThanks in advance\n\nA: There are two issues here.\n\n\n*\n\n*%20 represents a space (). In general, spaces should be avoided in file names, because they can cause problems for some programs. Therefore you should rename your file and replace  with _.\n\n*It is better to give the filename to a command with the direct path. Judging from the command you posted, I believe this is /home/jai/Total Siyapaa Title Song by ali jafar-GKr6rCN1SuM.mp4\nIn summary, after renaming your file, typing \nmplayer ~/Total_Siyapaa_Title_Song_by_ali_jafar-GKr6rCN1SuM.mp4\n\nin your terminal should work.\n\nA: You need to remove all whitespace and the file:// part of the command.\nThe terminal can interpret whitespace as %20; same thing with some search engines.\nYou can escape whitespace by placing the location of the file in quotes, like this:\nmplayer \"/home/jai/Total Siyapaa  Title Song   by ali jafar-GKr6rCNlSuM.mp4\"\n\nYou can also replace the /home/jai/ part with ~/ - it's basically shorthand for your home directory.\n\nA: as far as I know stands %20 for the space. So you can write an escaped space instead.\nThis should do it for you:\nfile:///home/jai/Total\\ Siyapaa\\ \\ Title\\ Song\\ \\ \\ by\\ ali\\ jafar-GKr6rCNlSuM.mp4\n\nHere you can get more info:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding\nBut I recommend you to use _ instead for filenames like Wayne_Yux said.\n\nA: all you are trying to do is to open a video file from cli using mplayer and I am wondering what so difficult in doing that if you have just checked the man page or searched on internet:\n  http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html\n\nEven without the help of documentation one would straight follow the logic and perform:\n  mplayer /path/to/file-to-play.mp4\n\nIn addition the output speak by itself \"File not found:\"\nIt would be easier for you is to perform:\n  cd /path/to/where/mp4/located\n  mplayer file-to-play.mp4\n\nOr use TAB key to let bash help you in auto complete what and where you are trying to go.\nAnd if you have fancy names with special chars etc, all you have to do is to rename the file by giving a short name if you don't know how to use bash/shell.\nIn the other end all you are trying to do is to open and mp4 file in your local home directory from what i see. Wouldn't be that easier just to click on the file and the system will spark it up for you in auto?\nWhat is you purpose of starting a video file in shell?\nSorry but all this questions are coming naturally when you see such post here.

I am using bash shell but some of the scripts that I need to source are in csh format. Can somebody tell how I can source csh scripts from bash shell?\nBy sourcing I mean the sourced csh script should be able to set the environment variables. So, I want to do something like this in my ~/.bashrc:\nsource path/to/csh_script/script.cshrc\n\n\nA: bash won't run all csh scripts perfectly. There may be some basic overlap, like very basic bash scripts will run in sh/dash, but if it fails to run in bash (test with bash [file] ) then it's a no-go. Either\n\n\n*\n\n*modify them to run in bash, or\n\n*run them with csh, called from the bash script, as if you're running them in a terminal, having them return a result value or do whatever they're supposed to. This would not leave any variables or functions available to the main bash script, as you've commented, so you'll either \n\n\n*\n\n*have them do whatever they're supposed to do to external files, or \n\n*return a single value/string, or maybe\n\n*treat them like another program and read multiple lines of output into your bash script.\n\n\n\nIf you're just looking to source variables, it's theoretically possible to go through the csh script line-by-line and adding just the variables into the current bash shell/script. Something similar to this:\nwhile read line\ndo\n[stuff with $line]\ndone < /path/to/[the csh script to add]\n\nI don't know how all the variables are laid out in the scripts you're sourcing, so it's up to you to decide what the [stuff with $line] should be.\n\n\n*\n\n*If they're like bash, then maybe just grep any lines that begin with spaces or characters, have a = with optionally more characters with no spaces, so:\necho \"$line\" | grep '^\\s*\\S*=\\S*'\n\n*or as above with anything after the = with:\necho \"$line\" | grep '^\\s*\\S*=.*'\nBut I think csh variables all start with set / setenv, so could find set/setenv lines, then throw out the set/setenv. Try as a starter:\necho \"$line\" | grep '^\\s*\\S*set.*=.*'\n\nThose're just quick sample grep / regex patterns, see this & that & others for more info.\nOr, if it's only a few of them, go through them manually & paste all the variables into bash/sh compatible files you can then source in bash with no problems.\n\nA: The shebang line already takes care of that for you. When you run a script that has #! /bin/csh -f as first line, the system will recognize #! part as script, and load whatever interpreter is specified after it (in this case /bin/csh). \nAlternatively, you could call the interpreter explicitly , with csh /path/to/script.csh.\nHere's a small demo. My interactive shell is mksh and I am calling a simple csh script:\nxieerqi:\n$ cat bin/whiledemo.csh                                                                       \n#! /bin/csh -f \n# demoloop.csh - Sample loop script \nset j = 1\n while ( $j <= 5 )\n   echo \"Welcome $j times\"\n   @ j++\n end\n\nxieerqi:\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/mksh\n\nxieerqi:\n$ bin/whiledemo.csh                                                                           \nWelcome 1 times\nWelcome 2 times\nWelcome 3 times\nWelcome 4 times\nWelcome 5 times\n\nxieerqi:\n$ csh bin/whiledemo.csh                                                                       \nWelcome 1 times\nWelcome 2 times\nWelcome 3 times\nWelcome 4 times\nWelcome 5 times\n\nNote that if you have even one space in front of #! , the #! won't be interpreted, hence the script will run with your interactive shell from which you call the script. Naturally, you can expect script to fail due to different syntax between script and what interactive shell expects. In the process of writing this answer, I encountered this exact error.\n\nA: I don't know csh but I have a similar requirement for ksh. My hack solution was to\neval source <(ksh -c \". /path/to/my_script.ksh\nenv|sort)\n\nI ran into issues with quoting and ended up putting in some grep patterns after the env to remove environment variables that I didn't want carried over but it kinda worked.\nI found another useful bit here:\nhttps://www.theunixschool.com/2010/07/how-to-access-child-shell-env-variable.html\nThis little bit of sed creates properly quoted export commands:\nsed 's/^/export /;s/=/=\\\"/;s/$/\\\"/'\n\n", "Q: How to delete this files with wildcards in ubuntu terminal Just asking how to delete these files (below is a sample).

Just use rm -rf *.upload. And if they are just files you don't need the -r option.\nEDIT:\nActually, because you have a \"-\" at the beginning of your file's name, the command line tries to interpret it as an option for the command, messing things ups.

Thus, it is safer to use rmdir.\nIt can save one when hidden files get involved since a cp * or mv * won't copy or move the hidden files along with the rest. rmdir will refuse to delete the folder if there is anything in, even hidden files so it serves as a additional protection in cases like these.

And finally here >2/dev/null is redirecting stderr to the bit bucket (/dev/null) so that we ignore any \"Permission denied\" output we may have otherwise received.\nNote: I have not tested this in scenarios where wine is launched with parameters other than just the program to be launched.\n\nA: The wine run logs are hidden typically, they're not stored anywhere.\nTo get the Wine logs for a specific executable, you need to run it via the terminal with the wine command.\nwine /path/to/program.exe\n\nNote you need the full path here, or you need to first cd into the directory where the .exe is stored.\n", "Q: Cant boot Ubuntu 15.10 ( not even the live version) Hi everyone ( sorry for my bad english), i own an Hp Stream 13 (2x1.6GHZ, 2GB RAM, 32GB SSD) with windows 10, and yesterday i have successfully installed Ubuntu 15.10 ( using a 4gb usb stick with Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.6.2). Everything was perfectly fine, i have used my netbook with ubuntu the whole day, but now it won't start anymore!\nLong story short, i wanted to try the live version on lubuntu 15 so i used the same software (USB-Installer-1.9.6.2) from my other deskto pc with windows, to load the iso on the usb stick.

I have tried 2 different usb stick and tried to mount ubuntu ( v.15 and v.14) and lubuntu more than once but everytime i got the same message.\nI'm desperate i don't know what to do, i hope i don't have crashed my notebook \n\nA: I don't know what your BIOS looks like, but try to change a similar setting in yours as is detailed below. To enter your BIOS, I think you have to press ESC repeatedly.\n(Copied from Boot Error - ACPI PCC Probe Failed)\n\"I [Solved] the problem by changing the motherboard settings. For my motherboard (access this at boot, not through Ubuntu) I went to Advanced > System Agent > Graphics > iPGU Multi-Monitor and set it to \"enable.\" I left all of the other system agent graphics settings on auto. After that the boot and ACPI problems (including a shutdown hang, crashes, freezes, monitor shutdown) stopped.\nEvery motherboard vendor has its own settings. The problem seems to be a northbridge snafu between the onboard Intel graphics and the Nvidia card. So, it may takes several visits to your motherboard setup to find the right combination of settings that works for you. This problem was new to me under 15.04, and may be due to a change in how Ubuntu handles such graphics disputes.\n(My motherboard is ASUS P8Z77-V LX LGA 1155 Intel Z77)\"\n", "Q: Added `export` command in `.bashrc` to update PATH with binary location -- GUI apps don't know about update even though terminal does? I had to add an:\nexport PATH=\"/path/to/my/bin:$PATH\"\nto my bash.rc, for progA's binary library location. Now, whenever I start a GNOME Terminal instance, I can type progA and hit return and the right binary is executed.\nHowever, if I run progA through a GUI launched app, my system fumbles and doesn't know where progA's bin is.\nWhat should I do? \n\nA: The ~/.bashrc file is only processed for interactive, non-login shells: probably a better place to set the path would be your ~/.profile\nFor maximum portability, you could follow the existing paradigm of the user's ~/bin directory in ~/.profile (i.e. avoiding export, and testing for the directory's existence): something like\nif [ -d \"/path/to/my/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"/path/to/my/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nSince ~/.profile is only read for login shells, you will need to log out and back in for it to take effect (or at least, start a new login shell e.g. using su - username). From there, the new PATH should propagate to all child shells - including the interactive, non-login shells of your gnome terminals.\n\nA: First, whatever is inside .bashrc applies only to bash shell. Unless that mysterious GUI-launched app that you refer to also uses .bashrc ( for which I don't see any reason whatsoever  ), then it won't know where is your progA.  Even the run dialog (which is Alt+F2 if you didn't know ) uses dash not bash , so .bashrc means nothing to it.     That's for one. \nSecond, If what you want is to have a desktop or launcher shortcut, you need to have a myAppName.desktop file with the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=myAppName\nType=Application\nExec=/path/to/the/progA\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/path/to/some/icon.png\n\nNow when you have that and the file is executable, you can double click that .desktop file and launch the app (provided that progA has ownership properly set, permissions set and executable bit set ). Icon= part is optional, so you could leave it out. \n", "Q: I want to install both WiFi drivers Just installed Ubuntu on my laptop (Lenovo y700 14ISK). \nI am unable to get my WIFI working.

I don't feel like manually taking out the PCI-E adapter, so how can I set the USB one as the default, and disable the internal one?\n\nA: You can use rfkill\nFirst, do rfkill list\nThis will show you the names of your interfaces. Then you can do rfkill block <adapterindex> and that interface will be blocked. You can unblock again with rfkill unblock <adapterindex>\nFor example, my rfkill list gives:\nmy-lat wilhelm # rfkill list\n0: dell-wifi: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: dell-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\nSo I could run rfkill block 0 or rfkill block 1\nYou can add these commands to /etc/rc.local so they will be run on every boot.\nFor more information see man rfkill\n", "Q: Bash script not working properly from crontab I've some scripts that run perfect if you run them from a terminal, but once you add them to crontab it's like the bash doesn't execute properly and doesn't continue with the first IF statement and the script looks to stop.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n## File: opt_files_backup.sh\n## Author: Raul Sanchez\n## Last update: 09/12/2015\n## Description:\n\n## Includes the configuration file for the FTP connection\n## Available variables (FTP): $ftp_user, $ftp_pass, $ftp_server, $ftp_source_directory, $ftp_target_directory\n## Available variables (mail): $mail_recipients\n## Available variables (Logging): $log_files\nsource config.sh\n\n## Creates a tar.gz backup with the format opt_files_YYYYmmdd.tar.gz\nif tar czfP /opt/backup-scripts/src/files/opt_files-`date +%Y%m%d%H%M`.tar.gz /opt --exclude='/opt/backup-scripts';\nthen\necho -e \"`date` - Files Backup OK\" >> $log_files\n## Remove files older than 7 days\nif find /opt/backup-scripts/src/files/*.tar.gz -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \\;\nthen\n    ##------ Connect to remote server and synchronize ------##\n            ## ftp::ssl-allow is false by default on /root/.lftprc\n    if lftp -e \"mirror --reverse --delete --verbose $ftp_source_directory $ftp_target_directory; exit\" -u $ftp_user,$ftp_pass $ftp_server;\n            then\n        echo -e \"`date` - Files Backup Mirror Transfer OK\" >> $log_files\n                ##------ Send email notification to Sys Admin ------##\n            echo \"The task completed successfully at `date`\" | mail -e -s \"CRONTAB task #2 OPT Files Mirror\" $mail_recipients\n    else\n        echo -e \"`date` - Files Backup Mirror Transfer KO\" >> $log_files\n        exit 1\n    fi\nfi\nelse\necho -e \"`date` - Files Backup Mirror Backup KO\" >> $log_files\n##------ Send email notification failure to Sys Admin ------##\necho \"The task didn't completed at `date`, something went wrong.

Either manually change to a pre-defined location (cd) with one of your first operations, or always use absolute pathnames for everything.  That includes your \"source config.sh\" line - where is that config.sh file...?\n\n*It may not have the same PATH environment variable as when you run it manually. If you reference anything that is not in the standard system binary locations (/bin /usr/bin) then you will either have to manually specify a different PATH variable or again use full absolute path names for your commands.  That even includes /sbin and /usr/sbin - some systems don't have that in the default PATH for non-root users.\n\n\nFor debugging make sure that the MAILTO variable is set in the crontab so that it knows where to send any error reports to. You can also add \"-x\" to your hashbang line to show all the commands on stdout as they are executed - which cron should then mail you.\n", "Q: Must boot through recovery mode - new Nvidia drivers installed After installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers (GEForce 730), normal boot hangs during splash loading. Alternate boot selecting Recovery Mode / Resume normal boot takes me to the login screen. The behavior is identical to that described in these other issues:\nNVidia driver, normal boot results in blank screen, recovery boot works fine\n14.04 LTS only boots through recovery\nNew install of Ubuntu 15.10. I have literally done nothing but configure my drives and install keepassx2 before Nvidia installation.\nI originally tried to install the drivers from Nvidia, but the install never started because I couldn't overcome the problem of nouveau being loaded. So I used the repository instead:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\n\nto install the 355 driver version.\nThat is when the current problem started. I also tried using the Additional Drivers app to change the 358 driver version.\nI tried following the suggestion in the first referenced issue to slow down boot with a sleep command. But I think our systems aren't identical. I have a lightdm file, not a lightdm.conf file. And instead of exec lightdm it is a paramaterized lightdm start command. I may have done it wrong, since when it didn't work I changed from sleep 2 to sleep 90 with no effect. And by \"no effect\" I mean it doesn't fix the problem, and when I boot with Recover Mode / Resume it doesn't seem to add 90 seconds to the boot time.\n/etc/init.d/lightdm [snip]\n\nelse\n  log_daemon_msg \"Starting X display manager\" \"lightdm\"\n#To fix boot hang / starts lightdm too soon\nsleep 90\n  start-stop-daemon --start --quiet $SSD_START_ARGS \\\n    || log_progress_msg \"already running\"\n  log_end_msg 0\nfi\n\nI also (inadvertently) tried setting the 'nomodeset' parm in grub, in that I had already added that parm earlier while trying to disable nouveau drivers. After I gave that up and went with the PPA installation, the parm was still set. In troubleshooting the current issue, I removed the 'nomodeset' parm from grub, but that hasn't made a difference.\nAnyway, the drivers seem to work great...I just can't boot through the normal process. What is failing during boot, and what fix and or workaround can I apply?\n\nA: I found a way to fix this.\nOriginally I was running a shell script at boot to re-assign update alternatives. For example..\nsudo update-alternatives --set x86_64-linux-gnu_gl_conf /usr/lib/nvidia-352-prime/ld.so.conf\nsudo update-alternatives --set i386-linux-gnu_gl_conf /usr/lib/nvidia-352-prime/alt_ld.so.conf\n\nFor a separate reason I needed to have a newer kernel so I downloaded the wily 4.2 kernel to my 14.04 system and I noticed I didn't have to run that script any more.\nI think this may be that installing this kernel forced rebuilding.  I also noticed a DKMS error as well.  Obviously this isn't the exact reasoning to the error as I haven't had a chance to investigate it completely.  \nPerhaps re-installing the kernel and headers might help, or even trying to install the wily kernel.  It does have some new upgrades.\nYou can see the all the options for kernels by searching the repos like so.\napt-cache search linux-image\napt-cache search linux-headers\n\n", "Q: What are this zeros denote?

As far as I can see the key needs to invoke a command in the appropriate environment.  I can't see why this has been giving problems for so many years.\n\nA: Sorry ...  PrintScreen button is working fine.  I made a silly mistake.\nI was immersed in what I was doing on a headless machine through teamviewer.  Teamviewer does not send the PrintScreen key to the remote machine.  It is processed locally.  I just found all the screen shots I tried to get (of the headless client screen !) on the host machine.  To it's credit teamviewer is so good that I forgot that I was using a remote system !\n", "Q: My text is being automatically highlighted Wherever I am typing on Gedit, my text is being automatically highlighted. \nFor example when I type in anything the previous word is highlighted.\nIs there a way to change this?\nAt line 22 it just starts highlighting randomly:\n\n\nA: It's simply a syntax highlighting feature; it's triggered e.g. by the use of Perl's match, quoting, substitution and transliteration operators; in fact you'll notice that it happens only when typing m, q, s or y; it's probably there to highlight the fact that the operator has a syntax error.\nSo the only way to disable it would be to disable syntax highlighting altoghether.\n\n\n", "Q: \"Startup Applications\" not working I have a simple one line command which works perfectly in terminal, but does not work in the \"Startup Applications\" app thing.\nThe line of code is : xmodmap /home/seph/Code/Ubuntu\\ Scripts/Xmodmap\nIt's not that much of a hassle to copy it from \"Startup Applications\" and paste it into terminal, but I don't really get why it isn't working.  I followed someone else's instructions to do it in the first place, so maybe I did something wrong?  In any case, wouldn't it be the obvious and logical assumption that it just types whatever you put in it into Terminal?   \n\nA: Commands, especially those related to keyboard, mouse, and touchpad settings, or xrandr commands, often need the desktop to be fully loaded. If you run them simply at login (using Startup Applications), they often run too soon and break.\nTherefore, you need to introduce a little time break before your actual command runs. Use the following command instead to add to Startup Applications:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && xmodmap /home/seph/Code/Ubuntu\\ Scripts/Xmodmap\"\n\nOpen the dash → Startup Applications → Add, and add the command.\nThat should do the trick.\n\nA: Add this code snippet into a .conf file in ~/.config/upstart/:\nstart on startup\ntask\nexec xmodmap /home/seph/Code/Ubuntu\\ Scripts/Xmodmap\n\n", "Q: What is the purpose of /usr/share/themes/Raleigh?

The bigger problem in your code is that you do not use any locking. One of your thread modifies global variables and the other is using them (if only in printf() calls).

I figured out how to install and get Minecraft running. However, when I hit Ctrl+Space, the mouse appears in the middle of the screen and the game loses focus, flickers, and sometimes pauses.\nThis is important because Ctrl+Space is sprinting and jumping in many games. I'm not sure what I should be looking up (though I tried) to learn how to fix this, and how to fix similar problems in the future. Could someone please help? Thank you!\n\nA: You should figure out what action is bound to Ctrl+Space.\nYou need to list all key bindings. This line should show you all bindings:\ngsettings list-recursively  org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings | sort | more\n\nThere are some exceptions e.g. Alt+F1 this is hard-coded in Unity so you can't change it and it's not shown by this command.\n", "Q: How do I change an application installed using PPA? I installed an application using Personal Package Archives (PPA).  I installed the application by adding the \"unstable\" PPA, and now I want to switch to the \"stable\" PPA.  So I removed the \"unstable\" PPA, and added the \"stable\" PPA.  After doing the apt-get update/upgrade, it didn't detect a change, and the application is not getting reinstalled to the \"stable\" PPA.\nHow do I trigger apt-get to re-do the install?\n\nA: Depending on the PPA we may have only installed a single package from there. After having disabled a PPA we can just purge this package to makes sure a previous version will be installed from another source.\nsudo apt-get purge <package>\n\nHowever quite so often a package may need another dependency with a newer version as well, and this version may also be included in the PPA. We therefore may have to also purge any newer or instable dependent package that may have been installed.\nTo ease this process there is a package ppa-purge which will revert any packages to those

Also the file/directory names are case sensitive.\nFiles with alphabet names, being case sensitive, means, the following file names are different.  You can have a directory of file by the following abc combination:\nabc aBc aBC\nAbc ABc ABC\nabC\n\nYou can also place a space or a number of spaces anywhere around from the front of all the letters to the end of all the letters as well as in between any of the letters.  That would make the directory name different, even though it would have all the same letters and resemble the same.\nYou can see the details of the names and which ones are folders and which are files with this command:\n$ ls -la\n\nIn that command the l is specifying give the long output which will show you more details about the item.  Looking at it this way you will have a d at the far left of the details to specify the item is a folder (a directory).  You'll also see the actual item names in a list that will make it easier for you to see the differences.  There will be differences unless your system is corrupted if which you might need to run a command such as fsck to fix.\nYou might consider adding the content of the ls command to your question so that the problem are experiencing would be clearer.\nYou can get to the terminal to execute the ls command by hitting AltCntrlT\nYou can move the file to a directory by that name with the same way you would move any file.  Type in the full pathname of the filename and the full pathname of the directory name.\nThis is an example:\n(The third line shows the move command of the file with the same name.)\n$ mkdir /tmp/test\n$ mkdir /tmp/test/123\n$ echo hello > /tmp/123\n$ mv /tmp/123 /tmp/test/123\n$ nautilus /tmp/test\n\nIf you typed the commands above in a terminal window the last command will bring up a window of the test directory in your /tmp/ folder.  It'll have one directory by the name of 123 with a file in it by the same name.\n\nA: This can be achieved by moving the file from another directory into the folder that is named the same.\ni have wrote a simple example of how you can do this below.\ncd ~\nmkdir test\nnano 123\ncd test\nmkdir 123\ncd ~ \nmv 123 test/123\n\n", "Q: mcedit runs differently when it's linked I've installed mcedit and in terminal I tried to set it up so that i can type edit instead of mcedit (because I found it easier to type).\nA symlink works, a copy works also.

Debian Linux for about a decade had an mcedit-debian shell script (which edit/editor could link to) that did nothing but spawn mcedit $@.  This was so that the \"alternatives\" system could invoke the Midnight Commander editor under the command name editor.\nIronically, edit and editor have been explicitly rejected as ways to bring Midnight Commander up in editor mode, by its developers.  In 2010 mcedit-debian was replaced by a Debian-specific patch to Midnight Commander's argument processing to recognize editor for editor mode, just as it recognizes the less generic vi already, but this patch was rejected from Midnight Commander proper.\nFurther reading\n\n\n*\n\n*mcedit-debian.

But checking the other software I couldn't find a pattern.\nSo, does someone know why the webservers are called Apache and Tomcat?\nI mean wow, a jet is fast and hmmm an apache is not that fast. So I am stuck.\n\nA: Apache\nAccording to the FAQ in the Apache project website, the name Apache was chosen out of respect to the Native American tribe Apache and their superior skills in warfare and strategy.\nTomcat\nTomcat started off as a servlet reference implementation by James Duncan Davidson, a software architect at Sun Microsystems. He later helped make the project open source and played a key role in its donation by Sun Microsystems to the Apache Software Foundation. The Apache Ant software build automation tool was developed as a side-effect of the creation of Tomcat as an open source project.\nDavidson had initially hoped that the project would become open sourced and, since many open source projects had O'Reilly books associated with them featuring an animal on the cover, he wanted to name the project after an animal. He came up with Tomcat since he reasoned the animal represented something that could fend for itself. Although the tomcat was already in use for another O'Reilly title, his wish to see an animal cover eventually came true when O'Reilly published their Tomcat book with a snow leopard on the cover in 2003.\nNote: you could find them all on Wikipedia.\n", "Q: Gnome-shell and gnome desktop installation failed on 14.04 So I did a fresh installation of 14.04 lts today and i wanted to install gnome shell or ubuntu-gnome-desktop on my linux but it is a problem there : \nAspire-E5-571G:~$ sudo apt-get install gnome-shell\nReading package lists...

Something along the lines of this solution, just for a GUI based editor: http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/1446/rapidly-invoke-an-editor-to-wri‌​te-a-long-complex-or-tricky-command\nPlease note that I'm specifically looking for a way to edit in an external editor.\n\nA: With this command you can achieve that:\necho \"This is a complex command\" > tempfile | gedit tempfile.\nEdit:\nAs I understand it, you want something like this:\necho echo \"This is a complex command\" > tempfile | gedit tempfile.\nFor example, echo ls -d  > tempfile | gedit tempfile will open a gedit file with the following text: \"ls -d\". \nThat said I would advice against editing commands on Gedit. The Linux terminal is extremely powerful(we have a powerful tab completion). \n\nA: bash, zsh, and ksh (including it's derivatives) have this very neat built in command fc, which opens an editor for altering your previous command. If the variable FCEDIT is not set, by default it will call the editor set in EDITOR; if the variable EDITOR is not set, by default it will call nano. \nWhat you can do, is to set FCEDIT=/usr/bin/gedit. Now there's the trick: you run a long command, you decide you want to change it, so immediately after you run it call fc. That will spawn gedit window with your command right there ready for altering. Once you're done altering, save and exit as if you normally would.\nThe disadvantage ? It will leave a trail of unnecessary gtk messages in terminal. Personally, I use vim or nano command line editors rather than gedit - those don't leave any trace , besides they can be used in TTY not just in GUI environment. I strongly suggest you switch to nano as it is one of the easiest command line text editors.\nExtra note in bash, you can do the same with the command line your are currently editing with ctrl+X+E or ctrl+X - ctrl+E; you can have the same behavior in zsh adding to your .zshrc \nautoload -z edit-command-line\nzle -N edit-command-line\nbindkey '^XE' edit-command-line # binds CTRL+X+E\nbindkey \"^X^E\" edit-command-line # binds CTRL+X - CTRL+E\n\n\nA: Use gedit -. This way it will read from stdin, so you can use\necho 'echo \"complex command\"'|gedit -\n\nor simply\ngedit - <<< 'echo \"complex command\"'\n\nThis way you won't need to create a separate tmpfile.\n", "Q: sedutil suspend I'm using sedutil and LinuxPBA for full disk encryption on my Samsung Evo 850 SSD.\nEverything works fine, except that I am unable to suspend while encryption is \"enabled\" since the disk loses power in suspend and locks.

It's better than LUKS for me in the regard that it's hardware based and none of the partitions can be edited without unlocking.\n\nA: Well, I am facing the same problem. Actually, not yet, but I bought an SED without knowing that limitation.\nThere are some SED-enabling software solutions out there that DO enable S3-suspend, but they are a) subscription-based solutions aimed at a corporate level, and b) quite expensive. And maybe they don't work with linux.\nYou have identified the underlying problem already: on S3, power to the drive gets cut, disabling it effectively. On resume, the drive is locked, what the data in your RAM doesn't know, so your system will crash. To circumvent this there would need to be a mechanism which somehow stores the password for unlocking in RAM and also runs first after resume to make sure the drive is accessible again. I know that this poses a severe security issue, as the key would need to be in ram all/most of the time, making it possible to be read by a malicious software. But this is not OPAL compliant. Maybe those commercial programs use the help of BIOS implementations (possibly the ATA security features?). I do think however that having the key disclosed in memory is an acceptable risk for most users and still protects against theft/spying from random encounters. It should be worth noting that also any software-based FDE also has to store the unencrypted key in RAM all the time!\nI really hope that the developer of sedutil could find a way to achieve a similar solution to enable S3. It is really what hold me back from enabling the SED functionality.

These terms get thrown around a lot and they seem to be the same, but is there a subtle difference? \nTrying to prepare for a degree in programming so I want to make sure I don't screw up with any of the terms in an interview!\n\nA: The command prompt usually refers to the one Windows is using (cmd.exe) while a shell usually refers to the one Linux is using (usually bash or sh). The command prompt (cmd.exe) is also a shell, but the term \"shell\" gets used a lot more in Linux. And both of these are text-based (CLI) shells. explorer.exe is also a shell, although it's a graphical shell. Confusing, isn't it?\nBasically, the Linux shell is more advanced than the command prompt. It gives users way more flexibility in commands and scripts than the command prompt.\nExamples include but not limited to: way more complex commands (completely achieveable with cmd), way more complex string manipulation, more diverse built-in tools\nRemember: we also have Powershell in Windows which IMO is Microsoft's attempt to be as good as bash. Yes, we have a lot of shells.\n\nA: yes but no.\nCommand Prompt refers to the Windows' CMR as a whole, thus the program that you start by either typing CMR.exe into the start > search box or clicking on the icon.\nIn Linux when we refer to this window that has a text interface in it we call it \"a terminal\" or with any of the generic names \"an xterm, konsole, gnome-terminal\".\nTHE shell is a program, which is also the program that you can use from one of these terminals, it is also a generic term for a type of programs and these can be several: bash, zsh, csh, dash, the busybox shell...\nAnd the SHELL PROMPT refers quite specifically to tow things: The point were you insert text in the terminal window and the text that is displayed there, such as the \"$\", the \"#\" and similar.\nActually when we write \"insert something at the shell prompt\" we literally mean write something into the shell as soon as you see the (empty) prompt appearing\n", "Q: Run Unreal tournament on ubuntu 15 this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games/Native/UnrealTournament\nseems to be out of date : it says in the Troubleshooting category, under \"Error loading shared libraries\" which is the error I get that I should download and dpkg three libraries. the second of which is incompatible with my ubuntu and fails to install with this error code under terminal :\nSetting up libglib1.2ldbl:i386 (1.2.10-19build1) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of libgtk1.2:i386:\nlibgtk1.2:i386 depends on libgtk1.2-common (>= 1.2.10-18.1build2).\n\ndpkg: error processing package libgtk1.2:i386 (--install):\ndependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for libc-bin (2.21-0ubuntu4) ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\nlibgtk1.2:i386\n\nand in the Software Center :\n(Reading database ... 229960 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack .../libgtk1.2_1.2.10-18.1build2_i386.deb ...\nUnpacking libgtk1.2:i386 (1.2.10-18.1build2) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of libgtk1.2:i386:\nlibgtk1.2:i386 depends on libgtk1.2-common (>= 1.2.10-18.1build2).\n\ndpkg: error processing package libgtk1.2:i386 (--install):\ndependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\nlibgtk1.2:i386\n\nfrom where I stand it looks like libgtk1.2:i386 cannot install no matter what.\nIs there any hopes to be able to run ut?\n\nA: I think you might want to try following this user's response: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2089790&p=12430257#post12430257\nYou'll have to edit the part where he points the package source to a maverick repo, to you'r current Ubuntu release (also, the gpg key part will differ).\nI haven't tried this out yet, but it certainly looks promising.\n", "Q: Can't detect internet connection in terminal and Ubuntu software center I just installed Ubuntu 15.10. I can connect to the internet in mozilla. However, the terminal and Ubuntu software center don't detect the internet connection. What can I do?\n\nA: Since you are connecting to a  proxy, you need to do the following:\nCreate the following file : /etc/apt/apt.conf, open the terminal and type:\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nEdit this file according to your proxy details:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://username:password@yourproxyaddress:proxyport\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://username:password@yourproxyaddress:proxyport\";\n\nIf your proxy doesn’t require a username, then those statements take the following form: Acquire::http::proxy yourproxyaddress:proxyport\";\nTo be able to add what is a PPA, you will need to export your proxy settings open the terminal and type:\nexport https_proxy=\"https://username:password@yourproxyaddress:proxyport\";\n\nexport http_proxy=\"http://username:password@yourproxyaddress:proxyport\";\n\nOnce you have done this, to export you will need to add a -E after sudo, e.g. sudo -E apt-get install python-software-properties \n", "Q: how to count the number of directory and files recursively?

I have an Intel NUC like box with me (exactly this thing: http://b2b.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=5445#ov) and trying to get Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed on it, but for some magical reason it just won't work. It has a 32GB built-in eMMC flash storage and every time I boot the live usb with UEFI and get to the installer it goes fine till a point and I get an input/output error message for some unknown reason or a read-only error for the /target which makes not much sense to me.\nOnce booting the live usb without UEFI can install it, but can't install the UEFI partition not even with boot-repair so can't boot it... argh\nHas anybody had any experience installing Ubuntu on eMMC flash? Is there any trick? \n\n(Click image to enlarge)\n\nA: In my experience, eMMC storage devices are poorly supported in Linux. I've got an ASUS P100T that's virtually useless with Ubuntu (I've tried through Vivid) because of similar I/O errors and other problems on its eMMC storage. Sometimes such problems get cleared up with newer kernels, so you might try with Wily, which has the most up-to-date kernel of any Ubuntu release at the moment. Along those lines, it's not clear if you used 14.04 GA (which has a 3.13-series kernel) or one of the more recent point releases, which have more recent kernels. 14.04.3 uses the same kernel as 15.04.\nThe specs for your device say that it has a bay for a 2.5-inch SSD or HDD. I'm guessing that's a conventional SATA device, although I've not dug too deeply into the specs. My guess is that you'd have much better luck if you plug in such a disk and install to it rather than to the eMMC device.\n\nA: Just to follow this up a little. The key to solve the issue was not to use a newer release like Wily to have a newer version kernel, but to go back a little bit and use an older release.\nWhat I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable compatibility support module in the bios (CSM),\n\n*Boot Ubuntu 14.04.1 from USB drive in UEFI mode,\n\n*Installation is smooth and no issues at all, no i/o errors, no need for any grub fix or boot-repair although in my case it took a while to finish the installation, probably some bandwidth issues,\n\n*Once the system is up did an upgrade and it works fine, 14.04.3.\n\n\nThanks for the help and ideas, hope this can help others as well!\n", "Q: Ubuntu webserver permissions for writing While setting up my webserver I gave all my public folders 777 permissions with filezilla, I found out that this is very bad because everyone can put stuff in that folder at the moment.\nI have a website that has a fileupload form (laravel).

Without the /boot partition, you won't be able to boot RHEL, since your system won't have a kernel, which is absolutely essential for booting. My suspicion is that you accidentally deleted your RHEL /boot partition when you installed Ubuntu, which I suspect exists on your /dev/sda1. I can't be 100% positive of this diagnosis, though.\nThere is one small glimmer of hope: Your /dev/sda1 starts at sector 314,574,848, which means there's about 150 GiB of unallocated space at the start of the disk. If /boot was originally in that space, then it may be possible to recover it with TestDisk. You may want to look into that possibility:\nA caveat: If I'm right, changing your disk's partition layout runs the risk of creating new problems or making your current problem worse. Doing a low-level backup of the entire disk is a wise precaution. You'd do that with something like:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/lots/of/space/sda-backup/img\n\nThis command is likely to take several hours to complete. You'll need another disk that's at least a little bit larger than your current /dev/sda, mounted somewhere so that /path/to/lots/of/space will reside on that larger disk.\n", "Q: CUPS and OS X - client-error-not-authorized for Create-Job Cups running on Ubuntu 15.10 server and so far so good.\nWhen an OS X device tries to print through the ubuntu cups server, I get this error:\nIPP client-error-not-authorized for Create-Job\n\nOn the OS X device in the print job I get the message:\nHold for Authorization\n\nMade the standard tweaks to cupsd.conf and printers.conf (see below), but no joy.\nAny cups experts have any advice?\nThanks\nLuis\ncupsd.conf:\n#\n# Configuration file for the CUPS scheduler.

However, Pro can turn off auto updates (I think there's a patch for Home) and the data tracking can be turned off with another program. Of course, Linux is great, especially Ubuntu ;), but if it doesn't work out, Windows 10 should be fine for just gaming (although I recommend Windows 7).\nNow, for Ubuntu. Your computer is a very good build. Your processor will work fine, but make sure you get the 64-bit version of Ubuntu to use it to its full potential. Since your LAN and WiFi are both Intel, everything will be OK there. Anything Intel is usually fine. Unless your hard drive is SCSI or in soe weird proprietary RAID system, you're fine, and I doubt you'll be doing that. You almost never have to worry about RAM from a software point of view.\nThe only thing I worry about is your graphics adapter. NVIDIA tends to have annoying problems when you install its proprietary drivers. You can go without installing them, but games won't run as well. I have the 950M, and it works fine on Ubuntu 14.04-15.10, so the 960M should also work fine.\nEverything you've provided should work fine with Ubuntu.

Post your success experience later here.\n\nA: I was working on my laptop when my new one arrived. I shut my old one down, took out the drive and installed the drive in the new computer, turned it on and continued working :)\nMileage may vary, but I think as @Laket said, if you haven't messed with the kernel, you should be fine.\n\nA: I moved an SSD with Ubuntu 16.04 from an Intel NUC DN2820FYKH to a Gigabyte Brix BXBT-1900 (both barebones mini-PCs) and it wouldn't boot.

In the new window that opens up look for the entry after where it says BIOS Mode.\n\n          BIOS vs. UEFI\nIf you have installed Ubuntu in legacy mode on the same drive with GPT partitioning, you can use Boot Repair's Advanced options to uninstall grub-pc and install grub-efi-amd64. That converts the Ubuntu installation from BIOS boot to UEFI boot, the same firmware as most recently manufactured laptops with Windows pre-installed have.\nConverting Ubuntu into UEFI mode\n\n*\n\n*Start Boot-Repair, and select Advanced options -> GRUB location tab.\n\n*If you do not see a Separate /boot/efi partition option, this means that your PC does not have any UEFI partition.\n\n*If you see a Separate /boot/efi partition option, put a checkmark in the checkbox to the left of it, then click the Apply button in the lower right corner.\n\n\n\n\n*Set up your BIOS so that it boots the hard drive in UEFI mode. The way to adjust this setting depends on the specific model of the computer, but generally this setting is located in the boot priority settings under the Boot tab of the BIOS/UEFI setup utility.\n\n\nConverting Ubuntu into BIOS mode\nNote: Use this procedure only to convert an UEFI mode Ubuntu installation to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Such a conversion may be necessary if some hardware doesn't work correctly under UEFI mode. (Graphics cards are a common source of problems.) Converting to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode while Windows boots in UEFI mode can make the boot process more awkward -- you'll need to use the computer's built-in boot manager to switch between OSs, and some computer's have such poor boot managers that this may be impossible.\n\n*\n\n*If Ubuntu is installed on a GPT disk (you can check it via the sudo parted -l command), use GParted partition editor to create a BIOS-Boot partition (1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag) at the start of its disk.\n\n*Start Boot-Repair, and select Advanced options -> GRUB location tab.\n\n*Uncheck the Separate /boot/efi partition option\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apply button in the lower right corner.\n\n*Set up your BIOS so that it boots the HDD in Legacy mode. Generally this setting is located in the Boot tab → Boot order section of the BIOS.\n\n\nConverting Windows into GPT mode\nMBR2GPT.exe is a command line tool which is located in the System32 folder in Windows 10. With it you can effectively and non-destructively convert a Windows 10 OS disk from MBR (for Legacy BIOS) to GPT partition style (for UEFI) without modifying/deleting any data on the disk or making a clean installation of Windows 10.\n\nLinks:\n\n*\n\n*UEFI - Community Help Wiki, Converting Ubuntu into UEFI or Legacy mode\n\n*Convert from EFI to BIOS boot mode\n\nA: Shutdown. Then press F12 on boot and use arrows to choose ubuntu (note lowercase).\nAlso, you should try shutting down, press F2 to open BIOS/UEFI settings and disable Secure Boot and make ubuntu top priority.

What fixed it for me was this:\nI have 2 different hard drives installed. It took me forever to figure this out but was solved it was changing the boot priority from the first to the second drive. Probably the boot manager for ubuntu was installed on the other drive so it couldn't find it and booted straight into windows.\n\nA: I had a similar issue, and it turned out that the problem was that there wasn't a working driver for my GPU preinstalled on the OS. My solution was to enter Recovery mode. At the GRUB menu press the down arrow key until you select the 2nd entry from the top (the entry with the recovery mode in its description) and then press Enter twice.\nNow you should see this Recovery Menu:\n \nSelect the network option from the Recovery menu and press Enter.\nSelect the root option from the Recovery menu, and then use the command line to run ubuntu-drivers autoinstall && reboot to automatically install the proprietary graphics driver. \n\nA: What worked for me is selecting OS boot manager in the BIOS boot Options menu and pressing Enter.\nBoot Options menu in BIOS:\n\nA popup should appear asking whether you want Windows or Ubuntu boot manager.

So, I'm looking for a way to show me usage of running apps. \nIs there any command for this purpose? Thanks\n\nA: free, top, htop all do what you ask for: they can show the memory used by the applications. \nfree is aggregated, while you can order top to show it by usage (with < and > you can choose the sorting column)\n\nA: smemstat is another option, it will report memory usage with shared memory divided proportionally between processes\n\nA: ps command will do what you ask for. It prints by default a whole lot of information, but with -o flag you can specify the formatting you may want.

It's not working but it does work when you visit using Firefox.\nI've updated the certificates: sudo apt-get install --reinstall ca-certificates and update-ca-certificates -f. Still nothing.\nHow often does Ubuntu's native CA certificates get updated? How often do new certificates pop up?\nWhat's a work around if you really need to access such a URL? But you don't control the domain? But SSL verification is mandatory.\n\nA: Curling this works for me, but here's 2 things you could do (taken from man curl):\n\n\n*\n\n*In Firefox, select Options, then Advanced, then the Encryption tab, View Certificates. This opens the Certificate Manager, where you can Export. Be sure to select PEM for the \"Save as type\".\nLet's say you put your certificate in ~/cert.pem, you would then use:\ncurl -E ~/cert.pem https://api.the-newshub.com/api/1/topics/trending/top\n\n\n*Many older SSL-servers have problems with SSLv3 or TLS, which newer versions of OpenSSL etc use, therefore it is sometimes useful to specify what SSL-version curl should use. Use -3, -2 or -1 to specify that exact SSL version to use (for SSLv3, SSLv2 or TLSv1 respectively):\ncurl -2 https://api.the-newshub.com/api/1/topics/trending/top\n\nOtherwise, curl will first attempt to use v3 and then v2.\nNOTE: your site seems to use SSLv3 according to its certificate, so this second idea is probably useless.\n\n*(source, about 10.04) I've been having the same trouble and after poking around a bit found that you can download a package of CA-certs ready for curl on ubuntu directly from the curl dev site.\ncd /etc/ssl/certs\nsudo wget http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem\n\nNow curl uses the most up-to-date bundle and you're good to go.\n", "Q: What do silenthunter@ubuntu:~$ mean?

Your problem seems very strange, because you should have a GUI if you downloaded the desktop edition of Ubuntu. \nThis line is an output automatically created by bash (Bourne Again SHell). This is Ubuntu's default command interpreter, and is very common in the Linux world. This output gives you some handy information when executing commands. It's like this:\nusername@computer-name:/path/to/directory/you're/in$\nIf you are a normal user, you will see a $ in the end. If you're root (has total power over the computer) you will see a #. Be VERY careful if you see a #.\nIf you run the command echo $PATH (be careful because bash is case sensitive), you will see a series of paths just like this:\n/path1:/path2:/path3\nPATH is the name of the environment variable that bash searches the commands from. \nCommands are nothing but binaries (similar to Windows' .exe's) located in some specific directories, included in the PATH variable. Every time you run a command, bash searches for a binary with its name in these directories. If the binary is found, it is executed. Some commands also accept arguments/parameters, to modify their actions.\nUbuntu uses a system called APT (a heritage from its 'father', Debian GNU/Linux) to manage packages (software). There are front-ends for the APT system, such as the Software Center and Synaptic. What APT does is download a specified package from the Ubuntu official repositories. These packages have a .deb extension and contain eveything needed to install a program. A binary called dpkg is used to install .debs.\nSorry for the long explanations, but the above content is the basic you'll need to know. Let's get back to your specific case.\nFor some strange reason, Unity (Ubuntu's default Desktop Environment) is not installed or simply does not show up. Run the following commands, one by one to try to solve your problem (you will need wired internet connection):\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nYou will need your user's password in this command, since it requires root privileges. It won't appear in the screen while you type.\nIf you get an output like \"ubuntu-desktop is already installed\", run:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nif you don't get this output, ignore the above command and wait for the installation to finish.\nDo the same with the \"lightdm\" package:\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\nand \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm\nif you get that error.\nAfter everything has finished, reboot your computer and there should be a Desktop, now.\n", "Q: Need to suspend twice under 15.10 Since upgrading to 15.10, I am having suspend issue on my Thinkpad X1 Carbon (1st gen) which has been running five or six Ubuntu releases fine so far.\nUpon lid close, no successful suspend happens right now: the machine stays on / immediately reverts to 'on'. When I first noticed that (about a month ago after upgrading) I simply reverted to booting into the older 3.* kernel.  Following a reboot this week it turned out that under 3.50.* I had no wifi :-/ so the 3.* kernel is no viable option.\nSo back to 4.2.0-19, and after some research (and looking at existing bug reports) I found out that sudo pm-suspend; sudo pm-suspend works.  \nI tried to file a bug report but ubuntu-bug complains about third-party repositories so no luck.  Happy to provide further details if it helps.\n\nA: There's an option in systemd that allows you to prevent your laptop to get into sleep mode when you close the lid. \nHere are the steps to use that option:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file /etc/systemd/logind.conf with admin rights\n\n*Add in a new line at the end of the file:\n\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\n\nOr, in one command in your terminal:\n    echo \"HandleLidSwitch=ignore\" | sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/logind.conf\n\n\nHere's what logind.conf manual says (source): \n\nHandlePowerKey=, HandleSuspendKey=, HandleHibernateKey=,\n         HandleLidSwitch=\n       Controls whether logind shall handle the system power and sleep\n       keys and the lid switch to trigger actions such as system power-off\n       or suspend. Can be one of ignore, poweroff, reboot, halt, kexec,\n       suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep and lock. If ignore logind will\n       never handle these keys. If lock all running sessions will be\n       screen locked. Otherwise the specified action will be taken in the\n       respective event. Only input devices with the power-switch udev tag\n       will be watched for key/lid switch events.  HandlePowerKey=\n       defaults to poweroff.

I'm dual booting Windows 7 (home 64-bit) and Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.  Windows is on a SSD, Ubuntu runs off of a HDD.  After I installed Ubuntu (I was originally using Windows by itself) the WiFi was not working on Ubuntu.\nI followed the steps described here by Chili555 How can I install Broadcom Wireless Adapter BCM4352 802.11ac PCID [14e4:43b1] (rev 03) on fresh install of Ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn)? to install the Ubuntu driver.  That fixed the problem, but now the Windows 7 WiFi does not work.  It turns on, but does not detect any networks.  Ethernet connections work fine.  Ubuntu WiFi and Ethernet connections work fine.\nI have run the Windows network diagnostic tool, tried uninstalling, reinstalling, updating, rolling back, and every combination of things for the Windows Broadcom driver, but nothing fixes the problem.  Throughout all of this, the Ubuntu WiFi continues to function normally.\nWhat did I do wrong and how can I fix it?  I'm new to Linux, so I apologize if this is a dumb question, but hours of my best google searching have failed to produce results.  \nUpdate:  I think I have it figured out.  When I hit restart from Ubuntu, and then boot Windows, the WiFi does not work.  If I shut down, and then start the computer fresh, it works.  Why does this happen though?  What is the difference between hitting \"restart\" and doing a \"complete\" shut down?  And why did this only start happening after I installed the Ubuntu wifi driver?\n\nA: First of all: while reading your question, I was going to advise you to completely shut down your machine, remove the battery if it has one and finally the power chord.\nThen wait for 1 second and then turn on and do a complete cold boot, but apparently, you've found that a normal cold boot solves your problem. ;-)\nWhy is this happening?\nWhat you're experiencing is called an unintentional side-effect and you need to know more about the intricacies of the Broadcom chip-set to understand what's going on:\n\n*\n\n*Broadcom chip-sets are not really WiFi chip-sets but DSPs who not only have drivers, but firmware as well: this means that the driver loads a piece of software in the computer's memory and another piece of software on the DSP chip itself.\n\n*Broadcom does not support Linux, but there is a bunch of hackers who do a tremendous (and extremely difficult) job of reverse-engineering the Broadcom firmware to make their drivers compatible with Linux, but couldn't care less about Windows compatibility.\n\n*Broadcom doesn't properly test their Windows drivers/firmware and just uses Microsoft update to push out stuff if anything fails.\n\nWhat is actually happening?\nThe DSP chip's registers get set by the Linux drivers to work as robustly as possible under Linux, but your BIOS subsystem doesn't properly reset the DSP, nor does the Windows firmware written by Broadcom! As Broadcom doesn't care about Linux, they don't test whether their Windows firmware gets properly re-initialised after a warm boot whereas the Linux firmware does!\nSymptoms:\nWarm booting from Windows to Linux works, whereas to reboot from Linux to Windows, you need a cold boot!\n", "Q: Presence of files in Recent Files that I did not open Often when I open Places -> Recent Files, some random files I haven't opened in days (or even years) all of sudden appear there.

If anyone has a better answer than this, aside from copying all personal files off this machine and doing a full system reinstall in a blind attempt to (calling in the exorcist) deal with possible issue #1 --- you could do that, but I don't see it as being an effective fix, personally --- please post an answer below.\n", "Q: juju redundancy I use juju to deploy OpenStack (using MAAS as the provider). In my current setup, the juju 'master' is deployed to my machine 0.

I've now done this, only time will tell if it has any effect.\nAnother Edit:\nAfter a long period of stability, it's happened again - I can't be 100% sure but it seems to happen every time Ubuntu runs an update of the Ubuntu Core (I assume that's another word for the kernel). Totally dead, have to hard reset it, but if I then select the normal boot option from Grub (it only pops up if the system failed to boot last time) it will just work normally as if nothing's happened.\nI can't help but wonder about the kernel update perhaps setting some parameter in the Grub config that's lingering from an older install (for example, when I had a different gfx card) and it's only when it fails to boot that grub sets some slightly different parameter because of the failure and it sails through fine.\nDoing the suggested egrep -B75 '\\[ 0.000000\\] Linux version' /var/log/kern.log* returns precisely nothing!\nI'm going to see if there's a way to do a clean Ubuntu install on a system without losing installed programs / settings, see if that cures it - in the meantime any suggestions welcomed!\n\nA: Well I'm not sure it counts as a great answer, and it's certainly not a definitive solution / root cause but I got fed up & switched to Linux Mint and it seems much more reliable now. Perhaps the installer updated grub to something more reliable or something like that.\nAt least it's what's worked for me.\n", "Q: Intellij Idea keep deleting project files I have a project, it is a Gradle project, and everytime I close Intellij it deletes the src files, they still exist in the directory just not in the idea project. \n\nA: I thing that is deal with IntelliJ cache.

If \"$BD\" is actually the name of your directory, you should rename the directory.  If for some reason you can't, you can address it by making the entire pathname literal with single-quotes ('), thus:  \ncd '$BD/android-python27' && '$SCRIPTS/python.sh'\n\nIf $BD is in fact supposed to be a variable, it is undefined, and you need to set it, thus:\nexport BD=/path/to/container/directory/\n\n", "Q: bind before connect i'm new to ubuntu and networking \nIs there a method in Linux to check how many ephemeral ports are left available? I've problem with \"Address already in use\" errors as a result of running out of ephemeral ports\nand how can i do this \n1- Set tcp_tw_reuse sysctl to enable reusing of TIME_WAIT sockets.\n\nA: See e.g. (https://serverfault.com/questions/261663/on-linux-how-can-i-tell-how-many-ephemeral-ports-are-left-available).\nThe ephermal port range is specified in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range. You can probably extend it to run from 16k to 64k.\nYou can see the number of open connections using netstat -an. Sockets may be stuck in TIME_WAIT state if you are opening and closing a lot of connections. In some places this is unavoidable, but you may need to consider if you need a pool of connection if this is the case.\nIf TIME_WAIT is the problem, you can set net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse / net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle to speed up connection turnover.\nThe latter refers to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse and /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle which thus can be set to 1 or 0. E.g.,\necho 1 | /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse\n\nDoing that will set the flag until next reboot. If you want the setting also after reboot, you need to add corresponding lines to /etc/sysctl.conf. E.g.,\nnet.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1\n\nAnywhere in the file will do, and presumably you'll add some comment(s) about it as well.\nAlso, if your netstat output is excessive, consider piping it through a pager, e.g.\nnetstat -an | less\n\n", "Q: Lubuntu script to reverse order of a list state-capital capital-state I am new to Linux and have a project due in an hour and I know I can use tac to reverse a list, but how do you reverse order like:\nBirmingham-Alabama\nAtlanta-Georgia\nTopeka-Kansas\n\nTo this:\nAlabama-Birmingham\nGeorgia-Atlanta\nKansas-Topeka\n\n\nA: If you have always only 2 fields:\nawk  -F- '{print $2\"-\"$1}' file\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This prints just the 2nd field, followed by a dash, followed by the 1st field.\n\n\nOr with bash:\nwhile IFS=\"-\" read -r a b; do echo \"$b-$a\"; done <file\n\n\n\n*\n\n*IFS sets the value of bashs internal field separator.\n\n*read reads the input line by line and saves the first field to the vairable $a and the second field to $b.\n\n*echo then prints both with a dash.\n\n*<file gives the contents of file as input.\n\n\n\nIf the number of fields is not always the same:\nawk  -F- 'OFS=\"-\"{c=1;for(i=NF;i>=1;i--){a[c]=$i;c++}for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){$i=a[i]}}1' file\n\n", "Q: Upgrading btrfs-progs I am running Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS and have setup a btrfs RAID 10 volume with 6 member drives for storing data.

So how do I go about upgrading btrfs-progs? \nI tried the naive approach of sudo apt-get upgrade btrfs-progs which didn't work. I upgraded the Kernel to 4.2.0_19, which I thought might be worthwhile doing anyways, but that didn't seem to upgrade the tools. I started looking at PPAs, but I couldn't figure out which one to setup and admittedly got scared off by the \"experimental\" flags on a bunch of the PPAs for btrfs. So I thought I'd ask in the AskUbuntu community, how can I upgrade btrfs-progs so that I can get the bug fix to my problem reliably?\nFor reference, I read the following two questions and they seem to be a little outdated these days:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to upgrade BTRFS?\n\n*How can I upgrade to a newer version of btrfs-tools?\n\nA: You can check here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/btrfs-tools\nafter the oficial versions for every release you can see \"Other versions of 'btrfs-tools' in untrusted archives.\" section.\nyes, are \"untrusted archives\" but you can see that Stephane Grabber (LXD Developer from Canonical) have many ones for trusty, on this, my recomendation is: \nhttps://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/ubuntu/buildd-backports\nfor backport for several developer packages, and you can see btrfs-tools here.\nNow this is the first part, the other part is that you upgrade your kernel too, for kernel package for btrfs (btrfs from kernel <> btrfs-tools, different things):\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack\nand install linux-generic-lts-xenial for newer kernel now.\n", "Q: Can Windows 10 and Ubuntu bootloaders reside on one partition? I was having Windows 10 on my system and I installed Ubuntu 15.04 specifying boot partition same as where Windows 10 bootloader was residing. \nNow in the grub it is showing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu but it is able to boot only from Ubuntu. In Ubuntu it is showing all my Windows 10 files intact as well as files in boot volume.\nWhen I repaired my windows Windows 10 bootloader using bootrec then system neither boot from Ubuntu nor from windows 10.\nI again reinstalled Ubuntu and it is now booting from Ubuntu but not from Windows 10.\n\nA: If the computer is booting in EFI mode, then both the Ubuntu boot loader (GRUB 2, by default) and the Windows boot loader can reside on the same EFI System Partition (ESP). The ESP is a FAT partition that's intended for this purpose -- to hold boot loaders. Microsoft requires that manufacturers use EFI mode for pre-installed Windows 8 and later computers, so if the computer came with Windows 10, chances are it uses EFI mode and what you describe should work. The most likely explanation of the symptoms you're describing is a defective firmware, perhaps in conjunction with some misapplied fixes intended to overcome such defects.\nOTOH, in BIOS mode, boot loader code goes in the Master Boot Record (MBR; aka the first sector of the hard disk) and in various follow-on locations. Typically, Windows boots from the MBR to the Partition Boot Record (PBR; aka the first sector of the partition) to files in the NTFS volume, whereas GRUB boots from the MBR to some post-MBR code to files in the Linux directory tree. If you install GRUB to a partition rather than to an MBR, though, it will take over the PBR. If you install GRUB to the PBR of a Windows partition, then that partition will no longer boot Windows. The symptoms are consistent with what you've reported, at least as far as I understand them. You're most likely to encounter a BIOS-booting Windows 10 on a system you've upgraded from Windows 7 or earlier, installed yourself from scratch, or re-installed yourself over an earlier installation. The solution to your problem in this case is likely to involve using Windows tools to restore the PBR (and probably the MBR), then re-installing GRUB to either the MBR or the PBR of an Ubuntu filesystem partition.\nBecause EFI-mode and BIOS-mode booting are so different, fixing your problem requires that you know which boot mode you're using. In Windows, boot mode is tied pretty tightly to partition table type, which you can determine in Ubuntu with:\nsudo parted -l | grep Table\n\nThe output should specify your disk's partition table type, as in:\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nThis indicates GPT, and therefore an EFI-mode boot of Windows. If it reads msdos rather than gpt, then that indicates MBR, and therefore a BIOS-mode boot of Windows.\nIf you can't get it fixed once you know the boot mode, please run the Boot Info Script on your system. This will produce a file called RESULTS.txt. Post it to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here. This will give us additional diagnostic information. Also, please specify the make and model of your computer.\n", "Q: Why eth0 became enp6s0, first install Ubuntu? help please\n_enp6s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 18:67:b0:db:c8:a8  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.9  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)_\n\n\nA: From v197 systemd/udev will assign names in new format according to location of the connector of the hardware due security reasons.

From man find (Time calculation is identical in -atime, -mtime and -ctime):\n\n-atime n\nFile  was  last  accessed  n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago the file was last accessed,\n  any\n                fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to have been accessed at least two days ago.\n\nNow if you can use couple of solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can do:\nfind . -type f -mtime +0\n\nThis would get you the files modified one day or more ago.\nIn your case:\nfind $HOME -type f -name \"myFile_*.sql.zip\" -mtime +0\n\n\n*To get precision like this case, you should use -mmin option which strictly matches minutes.\nSo lets say you want to get the files that were modified more that 7 hours and 10 minutes i.e. 430 minutes ago, you can do:\nfind . -type f -mmin +430\n\nIn you case, do the calculation and replace 430 with that value:\nfind $HOME -type f -name \"myFile_*.sql.zip\" -mtime +430\n\n\n*Another option is to do it the reverse way.\nYou can create a reference file e.g. ref.txt:\n touch -d 'today + 2 days ago' ref.txt\n\nNow you can find files that were modified more recently than ref.txt: \nfind . -type f -newer ref.txt\n\nIn your case:\nfind $HOME -type f -name \"myFile_*.sql.zip\" -newer ref.txt\n\n\nOnce you are satisfied with the results, you can remove the file(s) e.g.:\nfind . -type f -mmin +430 -delete\n\n", "Q: pv permission denied, but dd works without error pv is program running above dd.

You may want something like the following:\nsudo bash -c 'pv < /dev/sda > /dev/sdb'\n\nThis will cause bash to be run by sudo.

However, since similar scanners are unsupported, the chances of this one being supported are slim. You can still try to contact the SANE project, through their mailing list or by filing a bug report, to be sure.\n\nA: There are some devices SANE does not support and some that it says it supports but under \"certain\" conditions do not actually work. For example, I have a Canon Scan Lide 110 and it is in the list of supported scanners, but after trying all possible solutions in the web, none worked.\nAfter much pain & hassle (2 afternoons and nights) I gave up in trying to make SANE work, and instead I used a 15-year-old mature & proven commercial application called VueScan and it worked instantly, like magic.\nIt works better and faster than the Canon-made Windows application my scanner came with.\nThis is the website for VueScan: https://www.hamrick.com/\n", "Q: Is it resource consuming if I use multiple work-spaces?

Anything running inside a workspace is still active and using processing power, even if it's not the \"active\" desktop.\nSome programs may treat themselves as minimized or hidden when their workspace is not available, but there should be little to no performance gain or loss.\nMeaning, there should be little to no difference between running one Firefox process on each of four workspaces versus running four Firefox processes on one workspace. If anything, there will be a (very) slight performance loss because the system needs to keep track of four workspaces.\n\nAs to why, programs in a non-active workspace are still active themselves. A download in Firefox on one workspace will still continue if you're in another. A YouTube video playing in one workspace should[citation-needed] be audible from another workspace.\n", "Q: How to escape \".\" with sed or grep?

Since your underscored filenames start with denm followed by zero occurrences of the character ., they are matched. grep \"denm\\.\" file will work.\n\nA: If all you need are the lines that have a . in them, used grep with fixed strings instead of regular expressions:\ngrep -F . file\n\nFrom man grep:\n-F, --fixed-strings\n      Interpret PATTERN as a  list  of  fixed  strings,  separated  by\n      newlines,  any  of  which is to be matched.  (-F is specified by\n      POSIX.)\n\nWith fixed strings, all regular expression special characters lose their meaning.\nsed does not have a corresponding option.\n\nA: You were close, you just need to remove * which means zero or more match of the preceding token, . in this case. As a result the demn_ is also being showed in the result as it matched the condition of zero ..\nSo you can do:\ngrep 'denm\\.' file.txt \n\nSimilarly in sed:\nsed -n '/denm\\./p' file.txt\n\nNote that you have missed the -n option of sed, without it sed will print all the lines too.\nThere are also so many level of precision can be added to get exactly what you want in complex cases but take it as a start.\nExample:\n% grep 'denm\\.' file.txt\ndenm.xyz\ndenm.abc\ndenm.def\n\n% sed -n '/denm\\./p' file.txt\ndenm.xyz\ndenm.abc\ndenm.def\n\n\nA: I tend to use brackets instead of backslashes for escaping:\negrep \"denm[.].*\" file\nsed -r 's/denm[.]/.../'\n\nThis saves me the effort of thinking if and how I should escape the backslashes.

I have installed the latest Kubuntu in dualboot with a Windows 7 installation on my workstation at work. For a week or so, the network has been running very well, only using Kubuntu. But after a very brief boot into Windows 7 and back to Kubuntu, Kubuntu has stop being able to connect to the wired connection.\nUsing ifconfig I will not get an IPV4 address. So I tried\nsudo dhclient -r \n\nfollowed by a\nsudo dhclient \n\nbut when the last command is performed it seems to hang on the command and does not go further. \nBooting into Windows and the internet will work.\nAny suggestions to solve this problem?\n\nA: The problem is described here:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/internet#TOC-No-wired-or-wireless-internet-on-a-dual-boot-computer\n\nThis may be due to a flaw in Windows, which can be repaired easily.\nIf you have a dual bootable PC with Windows, and you've just used Windows, you may not get an IP address after a reboot in Linux. And so no internet connection.\nThis has the following reason: every network card has a unique MAC address. This address is ingrained in your NIC. The DHCP server in your router remembers this MAC address.\nWhen you access the internet in Windows and then reboot in Linux, in many cases you'll get no IP address from the DHCP server in your router. Because this server will recall that it previously issued an IP address for that very same MAC address, and won't issue a new one.\nYou can solve this by forcing Windows to release the IP address, before you reboot the PC. By the way: Linux by default does release the IP address on shutdown. So a reboot from Linux into Windows causes no problems.\nTip: Did you forget to force Windows to release the IP address, and you don't want to boot Windows to do it as yet? Then simply boot Ubuntu or Linux Mint twice in a row. After the second boot of Ubuntu or Mint you can probably connect.\nA. Manual method\n  1. Open a DOS window in Windows\nWindows XP:\n  Start - Programs - Accessories - Command Prompt\nWindows 7:\n  Start - All Programs - Accessories - Command Prompt\n\n  \n*Type:\n  ipconfig /release\n  \n  \n  (note the space between ipconfig and /release)\nAnd press Enter.\nB. Semi-automatic method\n  By means of a shortcut on your desktop, you can apply a semi-automatic solution for this.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Notepad\n  Windows XP: Start - Programs - Accessories - Notepad\n  \n*type the following text:\n  ipconfig /release\n  \n*Save this text file as release.bat and place it on your desktop. Now you can always simply double click this file, before you exit Windows.\nAs I said, Linux releases the IP address by default on shutdown. So a reboot from Linux into Windows causes no problems.\n\n", "Q: Compiz CPU usage around \"100%\" when system idle/screen off When I'm in the room and leave my laptop sitting for a period of time, the screen goes black (powersave mode) and then almost immediately I hear the fan go into overdrive and the laptop and air blowing out the vent gets hot.\nI was concerned what was causing this.  If I move my mouse, the screen returns (lock screen) and the behavior continues.

It will tell you that the file is opened somewhere else and ask you if you want to edit the file anyway.

An orderly shutdown will unmount all storage devices harmlessly, and once the system is powered down, you can disconnect the external drive.\nHowever, I'd look for what keeps reconnecting the external drive, and try to get that to stop.  It might be that some software on your system expects to find that storage, and it'll fail once you restart if you do a shutdown-disconnect-restart cycle.\n", "Q: Best RAID solution with a hardware RAID card? I have a repurposed server. Before the repurpose it was an ESXi host so it had 6 2TB hard drives and an Adaptec 6805 SAS RAID card (and 2 6-core processors and 128GB ECC RAM which is another problem) but now decommissioned as a VM host it is receiving a desktop version of Ubuntu.\nDuring the VM Host days I found out that the RAID card have a bit of personality though, requires a fan on it to perform reliably, and if the fan get clogged by dirt it can lock up from time to time.\nNow how should I manage the drives in its most efficient way? I'd like to use RAID-10 or RAID-5. The motherboard do have enough ports to hold the disks.\nOptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get rid of the RAID card and build an array using the onboard soft RAID Option ROM and dmraid\n\n*Keep the RAID card and build the array there.\n\n*Keep the RAID card but use it only as a JBOD, and build the array in dmraid\n\n*(Joke option) sell the drives and the RAID card (and half the RAM) - one 2TB spinning platter drive is more than enough.\n\n\nA: While I don't want to point you away from askubuntu, you may find more input on serverfault, or other linux forums. What you will get here is most likely opinions based on personal experience (and possibly limited to Ubuntu), which would be all I could offer you. \nThat being said, the RAID card you have is known to be one to run VERY hot. So the fan requirement is well known. \nI personally would not sell any of the hardware, since you will never recover anywhere close to the amount you originally spent. Hang on to it, and use it.\nNow, as far as your question regarding using dmraid, I would steer away from it. The only reason I would use it is if I didn't have a Hardware RAID card (you do) and if I had to dual-boot with Windows and Linux.\nIf all you are going to run on it is Ubuntu, and you don't want to use the RAID card, you could simply use mdraid (not to be confused with dmraid), which is very mature by now. I have a couple mdraid RAIDs in use for many years now, without any issues. The nice thing about mdraid is that you can move controllers without major problems. But you will most likely want to have a separate boot drive, for ease of setup.\nAgain, it really does depend on how \"mission critical\" your setup will be. The more it needs to be 100% reliable (which nothing is), the more you will have to invest into Hardware RAID and redundancy. \nJust my 2 cents.

Due to large quantities of Chocolate Cake falling on my computer's touchpad it has become unresponsive at times (though the left- and right-click works fine) and I would like to make it so that when I press CTRL and at the same time hold down one or two of the arrow keys for the mouse to move accordingly. So if the up-arrow key is pressed it will move up, if the left-arrow key, then left, and so, and if the right-arrow key and the top-arrow keys are being help down together for it to move diagonally (and so on for the rest of the keys).\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, can this be done? And if so how? I would accept a script which does this.\n\nA: Scripted alternative to Universal access (to move the mouse)\nNot 100% exactly like you describe, nevertheless an alternative for using the mouse or touchpad. The answer below in fact is an almost exact copy of an answer I posted a long time ago on this question. I deleted it however, since I never had the chance to find out if it was what OP was looking for (no response at all).\nIn your case, since you only want to use it to move the mouse, you can leave out a number of shortcut keys (the last three) which will also prevent the most \"risky\" options. The scripted options should work fine any way, without risks on conflicting situations.\nMouse Keys alternative\nAs mentioned, the script offers basic mouse functionality, as an alternative to the default Mouse Keys- option in System Settings > Universal Access. Unlike Mouse Keys, the mouse pointer is moved (either x- or y wise) by repeated clicks, in two modes: \n\n\n*\n\n*bigger steps (as it is set now: 50px)\n\n*smaller steps to \"finish\" (as it is set now: 3 px)\n\n\nTo my own surprise, I found it reasonably comfortable to use. It is definitely not the same level as a \"real\" mouse, but (much) more comfortable than the use of Mouse Keys, at least in my experience. After five minutes to get used to it, I was able to perform practically all \"normal\" actions; opening applications, drag windows, edit text etc. \nDisadvantage\nThere is however a downside to mention:\nUnlike Mouse Keys, the setup does not \"claim\" the NumPad exclusively. The disadvantage of that is that there is a bigger chance of key clashes, especially with the left/right click and hold the left click -functionality. Although I did not run into insurmountable situations, you might run into some conflicts, and being familiar with general shortcut keys is an advantage.\nYou will have to try and see if it works for you.\nThe setup\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Disable mouse keys (most likely it already is)\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as mouse(no extension) in ~/bin (create the directory if needed).\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n#--- Don't change these lines:\ndirection = sys.argv[1]\nspeed = sys.argv[2]\n#--- Change the steps below if you'd like to\nbig_step = 50\nsmall_step = 3\n#---\n\nstep = big_step if speed == \"fast\" else small_step\nstep = -step if direction == \"left\" or direction == \"up\" else step\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef move():\n    coords = [int(it.split(\":\")[1]) for it in get([\"xdotool\", \"getmouselocation\"]).split()[:2]]\n    if direction in [\"left\", \"right\"]:\n        cmd = \"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", str(coords[0]+step), str(coords[1])\n    elif direction in [\"up\", \"down\"]:\n        cmd = \"xdotool\", \"mousemove\", str(coords[0]), str(coords[1]+step)\n    subprocess.call(cmd)\nmove()\n\n\n*Make the script executable.\n\n*If you just created ~/bin, either log out/in, or run source ~/.profile, to make the directory \"visible\" in $PATH.\n\n*Now add a number of shortcut keys. All shortcut keys as I set it up are aiming on the use of the NumPad, in combination with Shift+Ctrl (fast move), Ctrl (slow move, mouse left click), Ctrl+Super, (right click, mouse down).\nAdd the following shortcut keys: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the commands (11 in total, including mouse keys):\nmouse left fast \n\nkey combination: Shift+Ctrl+Num Left\nmouse right fast    \n\nkey combination: Shift+Ctrl+Num Right\nmouse up fast       \n\nkey combination: Shift+Ctrl+Num Up\nmouse down fast     \n\nkey combination: Shift+Ctrl+Num Down\nAnd:\nmouse left slow \n\nkey combination: Ctrl+Num Left\nmouse right slow \n\nkey combination: Ctrl+Num Right\nmouse up slow       \n\nkey combination: Ctrl+Num Up\nmouse down slow     \n\nkey combination: Ctrl+Num Down\nAdditionally, I set shortcut keys for:\n\n\n*\n\n*left-click:\nxdotool click 1 \n\nkey combination: Ctrl+*\n\n\n*\n\n*right-click:\nxdotool click 3 \n\nkey combination: Ctrl+Super+*)\n\n\n*\n\n*hold left click (e.g. to grab, use click to release):\nxdotool mousedown 1 \n\nkey combination: Ctrl+Super+/)\n", "Q: Permission denied with ./configure I am trying to install Open MPI.

If I run this code how do I make sure there are no other users that still have the unsafe permissions?\nI have replaced the username with the user I use for logging in to filezilla etc (with ssh).\n\nA: If your web server run as www-data and your user belong to www-data group is sufficient: \nsudo chown -R username:www-data /var/www/\n\n(-R is for recursion) and \nfind /var/www/ -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \\; && find /var/www/ -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \\;\n\nYou do not need to assign rights to other users, so 750 is the best choice in my opinion.\n\n\n*\n\n*the find changes files to 640 and the directories to 750 (type f and type d are the main parts in there). If you need more permissons 660 and 770 are the next step (execute permissions for group).\n\n\nA: \nIf I run this code how do I make sure there are no other users that still have the unsafe permissions?\n\nThink of it in terms of the file system, and less in terms of users having specified permissions. The permissions set on the folders / files are what matters, followed by the users who are part of whichever groups you have assigned to the folders/files. So what you want to check is which users belong to the group youve given the read-write-execute permission to.\nAn easy way to check what members are in a group are with the members program:\nsudo apt-get install members\nmembers www-data\n\nThat last command would list which users are in the group that has rwe permissions on the directories you've listed.\nWithout installing any new software packages, you could just grep the /etc/group file, and read the last part of the output for a particular group:\ngrep 'www-data' /etc/group\n\nUsers assigned to this group will be printed at the end of the output.

For example, press hotkey Ctrl+1 - select english, press Ctrl+2 - select other language etc. Any ideas?\n\nA: The way unity/gnome change their language settings is through gsettings schema org.gnome.desktop.input-sources, and the key current. I've used it in several other scripts before to answer questions on Askubuntu. \nBasic idea is that you run command\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current $1\n\nWhere $1 is the number of the language source. Language sources are ordered starting from 0, just like shown in your drown down menu with all the languages. So suppose my language order is english, chinese, russian.

By clicking plus mark, create 3 shortcuts, for 3 numbers. I suggest you use Ctrl+Shift+number, because Ctrl+number may be taken by an application, like firefox for it's own internal usage.\nThis I bind Ctrl+Shift+1 to gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current 0 for english. Repeat same process for chinese:  Ctrl+Shift+2 to gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources current 1.

I have a script I've written and (finally) have it working like I want it to, as long as I run it against a static file. Is there a way to tail a live file and have the script perform its actions against the tail file as each line comes into the live file?\nI tried\ntail -f logfile.txt | ./myscript.sh\n\nand\n./myscript.sh <logfile.txt\n\nBut neither of them seem to produce the desired results. My guess is that (in the first example) that myscript.sh won't run until tail -f finishes, which defeats the purpose :)  \nI don't know why the second example doesn't work...seems like it should, but it reads in all the contents of the file, but not the new lines as they come into logfile.txt\n\nA: Here's a simple proof-of-concept:\nIn myscript.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwhile read -r line; do\n  echo \"syslog says: $line\"\ndone\n\nThen in a terminal:\n$ tail -n 0 -F /var/log/syslog | ./myscript.sh\n\n(note that I'm using -n 0 because I don't want to process any previous log content; if you want to process it all then change that to -n +1 to start the tail from the first line). I'm also using -F instead of -f so that tail will retry if the original file becomes inaccessible - for example as a result of being rotated out.\nIn a different terminal\n$ logger \"logger says hello\"\n\nYou should immediately see in the first terminal something like\nsyslog says: Dec 11 13:48:54 T61p steeldriver: logger says hello\n\nIf it doesn't work, perhaps it's because whatever is writing to the logfile is doing so in a buffered manner, or you're processing it in a buffered manner within your script (grep is sometimes the culprit: it has a --line-buffered option that may be useful in that case).\n", "Q: Unable to play media on website I seem to be able to play the media on every website except datpiff.com flash player.

Use firefox to download chrome at http://google.com/chrome and then install with Ubuntu package manager the downloaded bundle or you take the package manager in the left side of unity and install there chrome directly.

Ok, I am running Ubuntu 15.04 with Kodi 15.2 as an HTPC.  I have always had problems with suspend and hibernate due to the fact that it appears that the two systems' power management cause some conflicts.  I have had Ubuntu put my system to sleep while watching movies on Kodi, so I disabled the power management.  I have had Kodi put my system to sleep while watching Netflix (either with Advanced Launcher or Chrome Launcher), so I disabled that (currently my HTPC runs 24/7).  I am trying to come up with some sort of script that not only measures inactivity, but audio output as well.  I am a total noob when it comes to scripting, but this is what I came up with so far:\n    LOG=/var/log/sleepcounter.log\n    sound=0 > /var/log/sleepcounter.log\n\n    while true: do\n        sleep 1\n\n        # check if sound is sent to speakers, add 1 if not\n        if pactl list | grep -v RUNNING > /dev/null; then\n            echo sound=$((sound += 1)) > /var/log/sleepcounter.log;\n        fi\n    done\n\nThis essentially counts seconds that audio is not playing.  The problem then is it does not reset the counter to \"0\" when audio does play.  I attempted to switch it around, and came up with a slightly different script that does NOT work:\n    LOG=/var/log/sleepcounter.log\n    sound=0 > /var/log/sleepcounter.log\n    read -d $'\\x04' sound < \"$LOG\"\n\n\n    while true; do\n            sleep 1\n\n            # check if sound is sent to speakers, add 1 if not\n            if pactl list | grep  RUNNING > /dev/null; then\n                    echo sound=0 > /var/log/sleepcounter.log\n            else echo sound=$((sound += 1)) > /var/log/sleepcounter.log;\n\n            fi\n    done\n\nThis exact script does not write anything to the sleepcounter.log file, when I check it it's blank.  I can't figure out how to make it default to sound=0 and maintain 0 while sound is playing, start counting when sound stops, followed by starting over from 0 when sound starts again...\nI have this paired up with another script:\n    LOG=/var/log/sleepcounter.log\n    read -d $'\\x04' sound < $LOG\n\n    while true; do\n            sleep 30\n            # check if there is any system activity\n            if [[ `xprintidle` > 600000 && \"$sound\" -ge 600 ]]; then\n                    (sudo pm-suspend-hybrid);\n            fi\n    done\n\nThis one does work.  If I manually set sleepcounter.log to sound=600 (or more) it puts the system to sleep when it has been inactive for 10 minutes.  While this works, I am thinking there also might be a way to combine the two scripts into one, just to make it a bit simpler.\nI know I am having a problem with referencing the variables, and this is my first time trying to write a script.  If anyone could help me out, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: With a little bit of testing here I saw Kodi close its client to Pulseaudio after a couple of minutes of idling. That makes this problem quite simple. In your shutdown script all you need to test for (other than time) is that there's no Kodi or Chrome clients. That's as simple as:\nDISPLAY=:0 pactl list clients | grep -E 'kodi|chrome'\n\nEdit: I honestly hadn't read past the title before writing this answer. Setting the DISPLAY seems to be the critical element, at least here, to get pactl looking at the right Pulseaudio session.\nIf you're scripting this into something remember that grep returns 0 on a match. And you can use the -q argument instead of redirecting to /dev/null.\nHowever if you have navigation sounds turned off too, the user might just be in a menu. You might want to do another sort of check, perhaps hooking into input or checking the average screen colour (set the screensaver to black screen, if screen is black, and there's no sound, suspend).\n\nA: I will post this here for anyone else looking for a simple solution.  My biggest concern is many times we fall asleep watching movies, and wake up to the TV still being 'on'.  I am new to Linux, and our previous system was Windows XP (without Kodi), so having the screen disabled after 10 minutes was no problem (although it would occasionally glitch, and shut off in the middle of a Netflix movie).  I have had two different Dell systems with Windows die in the past by going to sleep and never waking up, so I never used the sleep/suspend functions built in to Windows.  I think Kodi is an awesome interface, much better than trying to control the Windows desktop with a wireless mini keyboard/trackpad.\nI finally figured this out, and of course I was making it WAY more complicated than it really is.  What I ended up doing was rewriting the two different scripts into a single one:\n    while true; do\n            sleep 1     # wait for 1 second to continue loop\n\n            # check for sound output, if yes clear variable, if no then count +1\n            if pactl list | grep RUNNING > /dev/null; then\n                unset sound; echo $sound; else\n                echo sound=$((sound++))\n            fi\n\n            # check idle time and no-sound time, if yes then suspend and exit loop\n            if [[ `xprintidle` > 600000000 && \"$sound\" -ge 600 ]]; then\n                (sudo pm-suspend); exit 0\n            fi\n    done\n\nAfter saving the script, I then had to perform some other commands to make it work properly:\n    chmod x+ /path/to/filename.sh #to make it executable\n    chmod 555 /path/to/filename.sh #had a problem with permissions and ownership\n\nfollowed by modifying the /etc/sudoers file to be able to call pm-suspend without being root or asking for a password by adding this to the end of the file:\n    username  ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-hibernate\n    username  ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend\n\nreplacing username with the actual username I use to log into my system.\nSo far, regardless of what is producing sound (I tested with Netflix via Chrome Launcher through Kodi, YouTube in Chrome straight off the desktop, and playing a movie directly from Kodi) it suspends approximately 10 minutes after the sound stops, as long as I am not doing anything else.  I say \"approximately\" because I believe xprintidle throws off some random numbers here and there, but so far it ALWAYS sleeps.  I had to add the exit command, otherwise it generated a sleep/wake loop that was hard to get out of.  I then added the script to be run at startup by adding a cron job with @reboot /path/to/filename.sh.  This works great, but I am not sure yet if cron restarts on resume (I don't believe it does, haven't been able to test that yet), or if I have to call the script from somewhere else when the system wakes up.\nI assume I need to ask in another thread, but my next part of this project is to make sure this script starts again upon resume, and to make the system recognize my Rii Mini i28 wireless keyboard (with USB dongle) as a wake-up device.\n", "Q: How to resize ubuntu partition I have got 3 partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*partition on /dev/sda1 is for files.\n\n*partition on /dev/sda2 is for microsoft windows (in this partition i have got unallocated space).\n\n*partition on /dev/sda3 is extended partition (/dev/sda4 and 5 is for ubuntu).\n\n\nI want to resize Ubuntu partition with only 20 gb.\nI tried make it bigger but I can only make it smaller.\n\nA: You have to have unallocated space following the partition to make it larger.

I don't want a whole encrypted home.\nHow can it be done?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I have ecrypts-utils installed\n\n*I ran sudo chmod 700 ~/.docs\n\n*I mounted a folder sudo mount -t ecrypts ~/.docs ~/.docs\n\n*Moved files in there\n\n*Unmount folder sudo umount ~/.docs\n\n*Content is encrypted\n\n\nThan I have to run step 3 again (with all settings) to decrypt files again. How can I make it work on logout/login?\n\nA: ecryptfs-setup-private can do all those things for you, in a private folder called ~/.Private that gets mounted as ~/Private just use it, and we can modify it's folder names below. \nOr even encrypt your entire home folder with ecryptfs-migrate-home would be a good idea.\nThey'll both do exactly what you want, auto mounting on login & unmounting on logout. Why re-invent the wheel with your own potentially unsafe (password handling can be tricky) custom scripts? And unless you're using symbolic links, if you're copying files back & forth between plain folders and encrypted folders, you'll likely be leaving behind the unencrypted deleted files, just waiting to be read with an undelete or free space search command.\n\nA solution is to use a ~/.Private underlying directory containing encrypted data (OR a link from ~/.Private to a different folder elsewhere), but change the mountpoint folder to a different one (thanks to Sebastian):\n\n\n*\n\n*Run ecryptfs-setup-private then\n\n*Move/create a new mountpoint folder\nmv ~/Private /path/to/new/folder\n\n\n*Change the contents of ~/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt (file containing path of the private directory mountpoint) to the new mountpoint folder\necho /path/to/new/folder > ~/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt\n\nIf the ~/.ecryptfs/auto-mount and ~/.ecryptfs/auto-umount files exist the folder will be automatically mounted/unmounted on login/logout.\nFor manual mounting/decrypting (password will be required), run ecryptfs-mount-private\nFor manual unmounting, run ecryptfs-umount-private\n", "Q: I want to use Ruby built from source, and also use Gvim vim-gtk and vim-gnome both have libruby1.9.1 as a package dependency (in trusty), which in turn depends on ruby1.9.1 and I fear doing sudo apt-get install vim-gtk will cause commands such as irb and rails to invoke 1.9.1 stuff.

I might not be picking up the subtle differences, but here goes. I am a PC Tech. I have made a Bootable flash drive with Grub4dos that allows me to boot several versions of acronis, hirens boot cd, parted magic and several other useful tools from iso files. I have been beating my head against the keyboard trying to find a way to do a similar thing in UEFI. I have even seen people say first use grub2 and the chainload grub4dos. How can I make my flash drive work. I would prefer a single drive that would work in Bios and UEFI, but if I have to have 2 drives that's fine too.\n\nA: You certainly can not use GRUB 2 to chainload GRUB4DOS in EFI mode, since GRUB4DOS is a BIOS-mode boot loader, and the EFI version of GRUB 2 can't launch a BIOS-mode boot loader.\nGRUB 2, though, does include the ability to access files in an ISO-9660 disk image, so in theory, you should be able to configure it to boot from a collection of .iso files. I've never tried it myself, though. A quick Google search turned up this forum thread that claims to describe how to do this in BIOS mode. Some details might differ in EFI mode, though.\nAnother way that might work is to use my rEFInd boot manager and its ISO-9660 driver. You can't read .iso files with rEFInd, though, so you'd need to create partitions on your disk and copy the .iso files' contents to those partitions, as in sudo dd if=sourcefile.iso of=/dev/sdd7, assuming the USB flash drive is /dev/sdd and you want to copy sourcefile.iso to its seventh partition. I can't promise that this will work, but there's a good chance it will. Even if it works, of course, it's more awkward than reading from .iso files, since the partitions will be rather inflexible. The advantage of this approach over the GRUB approach is that it will require less mucking about with configuration files, since rEFInd should auto-detect and run the EFI boot loaders on the partitions.\n", "Q: Lost access to my windows 10 partition after Ubuntu update I have a new laptop where Windows 10 was initially installed on the first of two partitions.

When I tried to reboot later and select the Windows options, it would boot to Ubuntu. I can't access Windows 10 anymore. \nHow can I recover access to it? I know I have not deleted my windows partition.\n\nA: I solved my problem by following instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n\nA: My hunch is that your problem was caused by Boot Repair. Under some circumstances, Boot Repair will back up the Windows boot loader to a non-standard name and put a copy of GRUB in the Windows boot loader's place. Boot Repair does this to overcome bugs in some EFIs. It's an ugly workaround to, but not really a fix for, those bugs.\nWhat I think may have happened is that you applied that fix in the past, but when the regular Ubuntu update came around, it replaced the changes made by Boot Repair with a more standard configuration. The regular Ubuntu update didn't recognize the Boot Repair changes and so created an entry for \"Windows\" that pointed to the regular Windows filename -- which was really just the old copy of GRUB installed by Boot Repair. This would result in exactly the symptoms you describe. Re-running Boot Repair reset things to the way Boot Repair liked.\nIf I'm right about this, then you're likely to run into this problem repeatedly in the future. You may want to check your boot loader files. From Ubuntu, the Windows boot loader is /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. If there's another file in the same location with a similar name (I believe Boot Repair uses bkpbootmgfw.efi), then that's evidence that my hypothesis is correct. If so, you might try undoing Boot Repair's workaround. There's an option for this on the Advanced menu of Boot Repair. It's called something like \"restore backed-up boot loader files\" (I don't recall the exact term). OTOH, if you do this and your firmware is defective, then you'll end up with a system that won't boot Ubuntu. If so, your best solution is to return the computer to the store for a refund, since the machine is defective. If you're outside of the return period, write to the manufacturer and demand a repaired firmware. You won't get it, but there's a slim chance that the complaint will help set some wheels into motion that will result in fixes at some point in the future.\n", "Q: My mouse changes themes when over menus My mouse pointer changes from white, with a black outline, but when I have my mouse over the top bar or the side it changes to a black mouse, with a white outline.

I would be interested if anybody has any idea, what could have happened.\nAs a small plus info, the fstab says swap was on /dev/sda3 during install, now it's sda5.\nEDIT:\nSorry, I was not exactly clear, I was able to solve the problem, I checked the UUID of the swap with blkid and changed it in fstab, and turned it on with swapon I was interested in if you have any ideas why it happened. I found out the problem when I saw that there's no swap and swapon reported that it can't find the given UUID.\nI'll put the outputs here none the less, but they already show I fixed the problem itself.

Furthermore....\n\nWhen I Tried Ubuntu Live USB boot iso to perform an automatic boot repair it says : \"You have installed on sda10 a Linux version which is not EFI-Compatible. You may want to install a 64-bit Linux instead\"\n\nThis error message suggests that you've installed a 32-bit version of Ubuntu. If so, and if you have a 64-bit EFI and 64-bit version of Windows, your best bet is to do as the message suggests: Install a 64-bit version of Ubuntu. Furthermore, you should do so in EFI mode. (Disable the CSM, aka legacy-mode support, in your firmware.)\nTo better understand why a mixed-mode setup is likely to be troublesome, see my Web page on the subject. In brief, most EFIs make switching between modes awkward. Enabling the CSM can also effectively randomize your mode of booting from external media, which makes the creation of incompatible installations far too likely.\n", "Q: Problems with running \"vagrant up\" When I execute \"vagrant up\" I see the following error message:\n% vagrant up\nBringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\n[default] Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...\n[default] Clearing any previously set network interfaces...\n[default] Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...\n[default] Forwarding ports...\n[default] -- 22 => 2222 (adapter 1)\n[default] -- 3000 => 3333 (adapter 1)\n[default] -- 5678 => 5678 (adapter 1)\n[default] -- 27017 => 27017 (adapter 1)\n[default] -- 28017 => 28017 (adapter 1)\n[default] Booting VM...\n[default] Waiting for machine to boot.

My current PC is a dual boot between Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7.  I really hardly ever boot to windows.  The only thing I really use windows for is gaming, which I have not done much of lately, but now that fallout 4 is out that might change :). \nI am getting a new Motherboard, processor, etc, and I am thinking of moving my Ubuntu install to a VM running under windows. The main things I do on Ubuntu are Ruby on Rails and Android development, so I think running under a VM should be OK.\nSo my question is what are some good options for converting a physical Ubuntu 14.04 install to a VM?  Here is what I have done so far:\nI spent a number of hours (see below) getting to a point where I have a windows machine able to connect to my running Ubuntu install via vmware's standalone converter, but now I realize I need to also have an ESXi server running.  So before I go any farther, I would like to ask:\nWhat are my best options for converting a physical 14.04 install to a VM?\nFYI:  Issues I ran into even getting started with the vmware converter.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is the linux version?  I did this some number of years ago and it was easy.\n\n*VMware converter would not connect to running linux box.  I added a root password, but probably needed to add a root userid.  Finally got past that by enabling sudo to work with out requiring a password and hacking some vmware converter files by following this\n\nA: While a direct P2V seems like it would be ideal,  the issues I was running into made it really not worth the trouble.  If you could go directly from a physical machine to a vmplayer file that would have been great (and I think in the past were able to do this).  Anyway here is how I managed to do this, and it is pretty painless in the end.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink your existing volume, with gparted,  to a size that makes sense,  for example if you are only using 100G on a 1T real disk you might want to reduce the volume to something close to the minimum needed.\n\n*Image the partition with clonezilla\n\n*Install vmplayer or virtual box client on the host\n\n*Create your VM,  using the option to defer the OS install\n\n*Use gparted on the VM to create your partion. Create a partition larger than the partition you imaged (maybe 2X?)\n\n*Create a swap partion in the VM as well\n\n*use clonzilla to restore the image to the VM partition\n\n*Install grub on the VM partition.  \n\n*Use blkid to find the uuid of your swap partion and update the /ect/fstab file accordingly. \n\n", "Q: Live-Build lb build \"chroot: failed to run command ‘/usr/bin/env’: No such file or directory\" I have a problem with live build\n$ sudo lb build --interactive shell\n\nreturns with\nchroot: failed to run command ‘/usr/bin/env’: No such file or directory\n\ndoes anyone know what is happening?\n\nA: I had the same thing happen to me and I think it's because my working directory is mounted from my host OS (mac osx) via vagrant.\nP: If the following stage fails, the most likely cause of the problem is with your mirror configuration or a caching proxy.\nP: Running debootstrap...\nmknod: ‘/vagrant/tutorial1/chroot/test-dev-null’: Operation not permitted\nE: Cannot install into target '/vagrant/tutorial1/chroot' mounted with noexec or nodev\nP: Begin unmounting filesystems...\nP: Saving caches...\nchroot: failed to run command ‘/usr/bin/env’: No such file or directory\n\nThe '/usr/bin/env': No such file or directory error is because debootstrap failed, and I'd bet the command being run is something along the lines of: chroot /vagrant/tutorial1/chroot /usr/bin/env FOO=bar baz, and chroot is failing to find /usr/bin/env\nI moved outside of the /vagrant path on my machine and it seems to be working.\nTry looking at earlier messages in the output for clues.

For that matter, we have an Ubuntu Server 14.04 as a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Network File System (NFS) server, giving them accounts with remote access to their files to work in any computer within those labs.\nTo easily handle the administration and organization of these accounts, we use the LDAP Account Manager (LAM), the web front-end. And here comes the issue: the LAM is not capable of doing his whole purpose. Through it, we create user accounts, for example. So far so good. But we have to manually log into de LDAP server and create the user's home directory for it to properly work. That is, until now, the lamdaemon was not configured, so we have to manually make the necessary changes in the server. You could say that it was not the priority when the server was implemented and now we are giving it attention.\nThat being said, we started trying to make the lamdaemon work. It is installed on the server, and the LAM admin account was modified (giving it the attributes \"PosixAccount\" and \"id\") to be able to run the lamdaemon.pl. It is able to run, but not as expected. Now I will try to actually show what are the errors and the configurations of the server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Users accounts have their home directories created at /export/home.\n\n*For the automount, we have set the configuration files auto.master and auto.home as follows:\n\n\nauto.master:\n\n/home   /etc/auto.home\n+auto.master\n\nauto.home:\n\n *    192.168.1.254,192.168.2.254:/export/home/&\n\n\n\n*\n\n*A user foo has it's entry as follows:\n\n\n\ndn: cn=foo,ou=bar,ou=group,dc=server,dc=at,dc=this,dc=location\ncn: foo\ngidnumber: 2000\nhomedirectory: /home/foo\nloginshell: /bin/bash\nobjectclass: account\nobjectclass: posixAccount\nobjectclass: top\nuid: foo\nuidnumber: 22273\nuserpassword: {MD5}aY3BnUicTk23PiinE+qwew==\n\nThese are some of the configurations of our working LDAP and NFS server, but without the lamdaemon feature. As you may have noticed, the user entry says it's home directory is located at /home/foo but I told you that it actually is at /export/home/foo.\nSo we figured this was a problem for the lamdaemon after we had it configured and tested it by creating a user (using the LAM) with the correct home location according to the server. The user is created and the home folder too (without the need of manually creating the folder. It's what we want!). All the permissions and ownership are correct. When trying to login with the user, it logs in, but the following error is showed:\n\nCould not chdir to home directory /export/home/foo: Permission denied\n-bash: /export/home/foo/.bash_profile: Permission denied\n\nAnd his directory in not mounted, therefore the user is not able to initiate a graphic session. That's the main issue. The lamdaemon seems to be working but something is off with the server configurations that is making this error happen. And we don't really know what is causing it, or where it could be at this point, so I'm sorry for this long text and possibly short with useful information that could help. If there's anything relevant missing, please leave a comment so I can get it.\nAny tips or suggestions are highly welcome.\n\nA: What role does LAM play in the user logging in? Isn't it just a frontend to creating/deleting users and so on?\nAre you using NFSv3 or NFSv4? If the latter, are you using Kerberos?\nLook at UID/GID mappings (idmapd). Both nfsd and slapd need to agree what UID/GID to map to users.\n", "Q: How do I install sqlite3 ODBC drivers with unixODBC? According to the unixODBC drivers page (straight out of the 90s), I should download the SQLite3 drivers from: http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc\nThe instructions for building sqliteodbc from the source code provided on that page is available here: http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/html/index.html\nAccording to that page, we should untar the source into a directory, and then run the following commands:\n1) ./configure\n2) make\n3) make install\nHowever, when I run ./configure in the directory, I get the following error:\nconfigure: error: No usable SQLite header/library on this system\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: In order to deal with configure: error: No usable SQLite header/library on this system, one has to:\nsudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev\nYou might still get the following error after you do so:\nconfigure: error: ODBC header files and/or libraries not found\nIn that case, do: \nsudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev unixodbc-bin unixodbc\nYou might already have some of the packages listed there, but if you are getting the error, you are missing unixodbc-dev.\nAlright, now you should:\n1) ./configure && make without issues\n2) instead of make install check out the instructions here to learn all about checkinstall: I installed a program by getting its source code, and then running `sudo make install`; how to make `apt-get` know about it?\nNow, reading further into the [instructions] provided for the sqliteodbc driver, we have to:\n1) set up odbcinst.ini correctly\nOpen up the odbcinst.ini in an editor (you will probably need superuser abilities, and you will need to know where the file is -- usually it is in /etc, so we can do: sudo gedit /etc/odbcinst.ini), and add the following:\n[SQLite3]\nDescription=SQLite ODBC Driver\nDriver=/usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.so\nSetup=/usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.so\nThreading=4\n\nSet up Description with any string you'd like, but make sure Driver and Setup have the right paths to the *.so provided by install the sqliteodbc driver. In order to figure out/confirm which *.so were provided: either grep or just open up /usr/local/lib/ and check out which *.so files you have. For instance, according to the example in the instruction, you should point to /usr/local/lib/libsqliteodbc.so, but I only had /usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.so. If you have both, you could make two entries like so:\n[SQLite3]\nDescription=SQLite ODBC Driver\nDriver=/usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.so\nSetup=/usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.so\nThreading=2\n\n[SQLite]\nDescription=SQLite ODBC Driver\nDriver=/usr/local/lib/libsqliteodbc.so\nSetup=/usr/local/lib/libsqliteodbc.so\nThreading=2\n\nAlso, make sure you choose some decent value for threading. For instance, if you have 8 cores, maybe Threading=4 will make sense. \nFor the sake of step 2, I am going to set up things as:\n[MYGOOFYSQLITE3DRIVERTAG]\nDescription=SQLite ODBC Driver\nDriver=/usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.so\nSetup=/usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.so\nThreading=2\n\n2) optional: setup a DNS in ~/.odbc.ini --- just follow the instructions, but note that you can also use SQLite/3 DNS-less. For instance, using pyodbc and Python:\nimport pyodbc\n\nconnection_string = \"Driver=MYGOOFYSQLITE3DRIVERTAG;Database=/path/to/database.db\"\nconnection = pyodbc.connect(connection_string)\n\nNote that for Driver key, I referred to the tag I gave the driver in odbcinst.ini. Maybe you want to be goofy, maybe you don't -- the point is that the key depends on what you set up, or what some other program automatically set up, so if you need to know what the Driver is called, look it up in odbcinst.ini. \nFurther details regarding what can go into the connection string can be found in the instructions for the sqliteodbc driver which we have referred to before.  \n", "Q: How can I prune a (kmz) track from my GPS?

I am research student and I lost all my research in a second. I could not recover my data and repair Ubuntu. Please help me.\n\nA: It would help if we had a list of the commands you were using, or some link to some of the processes you were using (from Google) to try to recover your data.  None of the grub command options would interfere with actual data on your drives.  The grub commands are boot options.  It would use sectors on the drives that are reserved for booting.\nEven an option to reinstall Ubuntu using the live disk would leave the areas that contains your person data untouched, unless you used and option to reformat a drive or partition.\nSo, unless you specifically chose a format option you should be able to locate your data by browsing your drives and partitions.  By the way, this would be from a real install, not from a Wubi install, whereas Ubuntu would actually be running as a program under Windows using a virtually created disk.  If that is the case, you would do something different from the steps provided below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Browsing drives and partitions using GUI\nFrom the Live CD (ideally one of the later Ubuntu LTS versions, I'm using 14.04) bring up gnome-disk-utility.

Once you have selected a drive you will see the various partitions on the right column under the Volumes section.  They will be listed as Partition 1, Partition 2, Partition 3, etc.\nMount the partitions one by one by selecting the Partition #.  Click on the play icon to mount it if it's not mounted.  Then below the Volumes section click on the Contents link specified by Mounted at to bring up the volume.\nLook for the folder you specified by your home folder on that drive.  By default it would be call /home/[userid].  The userid would be the name you selected for login when you performed the install.\nDo this for each of your drives and partitions.\nYou can also right click on the Mounted at link and click Copy Link.  Then with Alt + Ctrl + T open a terminal window then use the find command to search for your userID or any specific file that you remember having created on your data drive.\nYou can go to a volume by right typing cd and pasting the link to the terminal.  You would have to remove the file:// prefix and have a command like the example below:\n$ cd /media/ubuntu/4fed9bc1-07b0-45a2-a384-b24213e2d09e\n$ sudo find -name userid\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Browsing drives and partitions using cli\nFrom a terminal window type this command to see your connected drives and partitions:\n$ cat /proc/partitions\nThis command will give you a list of partitions labeled similar to sda1, sda2, sdb1, sdb2, etc.\nThe one by one use this command sequence to search each partitions:\n$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n$ cd /mnt\n$ sudo find -name userid\n$ sudo umount /mnt\n\n\nA: If your home directory, by chance, is not encrypted, you will be able to access it and copy the data.\nFirst, start Ubuntu live CD, and the open the terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T, enter the command: .df -h\nLook at the output to see if there is /media/device_name\nGo to the directory, you should find your real home directory, e.g, /media/device_name/home/username\nIf you have any question, feel free to leave a comment.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 : Samba Server Error.

However I only gave the ubuntu partition ~7GB of memory, thinking I wouldn't use it as much. Long story short, turns out I needed a lot more memory for it, so I completely wiped my hard drive, merged all the various partitions I had and started from scratch. I first installed windows. While doing that, from the windows installer I created 3 partitions. 1 - Windows (~300GB), 2 - Various stuff (~50GB), 3 - Ubuntu (~350GB). I installed windows on the first partition with no problem whatsoever. But when I tried to install ubuntu on partition 3, it popped an error saying: \n\"/dev/sda contains GPT signatures indicating that it has a GT table.      However it does not have a valid fake msdos partitiontable as it should. Perhaps it was corupted possibly by a program that doesn't    understand     GPT partition tables or perhaps you deleted the GPT table and are now using an msdos partition table.Is this a GPT partition table?\"\n\nI am pretty new to the world of \"partitioning\" so I have absolutely no idea what any of that means. So, any kind of help would be immensely appreciated. But please, PLEASE, remember that I'm a newbie to all that stuff, so I probably won't understand very technical solutions. If you kept it simple, you'd have my never ending gratitude. \nThank you in advance.\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention something I think is rather important. When I try to create a partition using the ubuntu installer, it says that I have ~685GB of unallocated space. (I have a 700GB hard drive, so it thinks it's completely empty). I think it doesn't recognize any of my current partitions.\n\nA: First, you're not dealing with memory, but with disk space. The term \"memory\" refers to random access memory (RAM), which is temporary storage space that's erased whenever you power off the computer. Modern desktop and laptop computers typically have about 4-16 GiB of RAM. Disk space is more permanent, and ranges in size from about 128 GB to 2 TB on modern computers. (Both RAM and disk space can be significantly less than this on older computers or on tablets or other specialty devices; and bigger than these values on high-end computers and servers.)\nYour problem was ultimately created because you enabled your Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy boot support\" or something similar) in your firmware setup utility. You probably did this because you followed somebody's well-meaning but poor advice when you installed Ubuntu the first time, but it didn't bite you until recently -- or if it bit you earlier, you found a workaround. See this page of mine for details. You needn't read that to fix the current problem, but I suggest you do so at some point, or if you run into additional problems trying to solve this one.\nIn brief, the immediate problem is that Windows has overwritten some of the original installation's GUID Partition Table (GPT) with a simpler and smaller Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. The result is that you've got leftover GPT data, which is confusing the Ubuntu installer. The easiest solution to this problem is to run my FixParts program on your disk. This tool is part of the gdisk package and should be accessible from a boot of the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode. FixParts will detect the extraneous GPT data and give you the chance to delete it. After you do so, the Ubuntu installation should proceed normally, with one caveat: If the Ubuntu installer boots in EFI/UEFI mode, it will either complain or try to install an EFI-mode boot loader, which won't work well with your BIOS-mode Windows installation. (This type of mis-match is another possible consequence of enabling the CSM.)\nA better solution, though, is to wipe the partition table entirely (use sudo sgdisk -Z /dev/sda from an Ubuntu live CD), disable the CSM in your firmware, and re-install both Windows and Ubuntu. This solution has the advantage that you won't be as likely to run into the conditions that can lead to the problem you've encountered, or other related problems, in the future. Fundamentally, the issue is support for multiple incompatible ways of booting the computer -- BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI. Each boot mode has its own unique needs in terms of disk partitioning, and it was a switch from EFI mode to BIOS mode that created the leftover-GPT-data problem you're seeing now. Locking BIOS mode out of the equation by disabling the CSM in your firmware will simplify things and make a whole range of problems go away. You can't do that without either re-installing Windows or jumping through hoops to get Windows to boot in EFI mode, though, which is why this solution will take more effort than the one of removing the stray GPT data and installing Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n", "Q: Dell XPS 15-9550 doesn't boot 14.04 (Live USB) I cannot boot up the default 14.04.3 image flashed into my usb drive, booting up output as here:\n\nCan anyone explained to me how to boot up using the 4.3 kernel?\n(seemingly possible as implied here:\n15.10 Dell XPS 15 (9550) External Monitor not waking\nand something called \"Hardware enablement\" feature of Ubuntu:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseNotes\nAdded Notes (3 March 2016):   Just install Ubuntu 16.04 from thumbdrive to an external SSD and it worked!

Since I need to change it to the 4.7 often, I'm using update-alternatives; I've noticed, however, that the default compiler is not restored on closing the terminal; this may be an issue since there is the possibility to mix codes compiled with different compilers. Is there a way to force the shell to restore the default settings on exiting? Thank you in advice.\nEdit:\nI wish to thank the_Seppi for his precious help\n\nA: The alternatives system only works globally. So you could use something like\ntrap 'sudo update-alternatives ....' EXIT\n\nHowever, this would ask for your password and also would reset it for all other active shells. So I doubt this is what you want.\n\nMy suggestion: First set the alternative back to the 'default' version of g++. Create something like the following in your ~/.bashrc file (or whatever your shell uses, when not using bash):\nfunction oldg++() {\n    alias g++=/path/to/older/g++\n}\nfunction newg++() {\n    unalias g++\n}\n\nSo now you'll be using the more recent g++ by default, until you run the command oldg++ This will switch to the older version for the current session or until you execute newg++, which deletes the alias and therefore switches back to the default version.\n", "Q: Color adjustment for 100 jpg files: Fast workflow for save+next I want to do manual color adjustment for 100 jpg files.\nThe workflow I use at the moment works like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*open first jpg in gimp.\n\n*do manual color adjustment.

Since it sounds so good, why doesn't Ubuntu adopt the snappy approach?\n\nA: Well, that was kind of an over-arching sentence, that Snappy has those advantages-- they don't all come from transactional updates. Transactional updates applies to the \"faster\" and \"more reliable\" parts.\nWith the normal Ubuntu (Debian) packages, you only install one version at a time. If you install version 1 of package foo, and version 2 is released into the repos, then you update to version 2, which effectively uninstalls version 1. If you don't like version 2 (or it was broken), you have to essentially uninstall it and install version 1 again.\nIn Snappy this changes a bit. If you install version 1 of package foo, and version 2 is released into the store, then you update to version 2. However, version 1 remains installed, it's simply deactivated. If you don't like version 2 (or it was broken) you can roll back to version 1 immediately, without downloading anything. You can see how this would be faster and makes for a more reliable system.\nAs for why Ubuntu doesn't adopt the Snappy approach, well, that's what Ubuntu Core is! Ubuntu Next is now also based on Snappy. It's just that Snappy is still being developed when it comes to GUI-based things (note that Ubuntu Core is CLI-only).\n", "Q: get an error trying to install google chrome I'm getting an error after installing Google Chrome.\nWhen I try to do sudo apt-get update I get this error:\nW: Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/dists/stable/Release.gpg  Bad header line [IP: 37.29.1.44 80]\n\n\nA: *\n\n*add this line in /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo echo \"deb http://dl.google.com/linux/deb/ stable main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\n*download and install key\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys A040830F7FAC5991\n\n\n*update the repo\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: How to configure Citrix Receiver started through Cisco Secure Desktop on Ubuntu 15.10 Many Corporations enables to work from home using Secure RDP approach to the Windows systems.

The default one is Nautilus.  You'll see a file folder at the top of the launch bar.\nClick on Browse Network.\nThere you should see the various computer servers that have shared resources.

I am concerned about the security when I run Ubuntu without an anti-virus and visit a hacked website. I feel that this question then should be asked here and not anywhere else. I can't seem to comprehend why it has attracted a lot of close flags and negative up-votes.\n\nI don't have an antivirus running on my laptop. I run an regularly updated Ubuntu 14.04 on it. I unintentionally visited a hacked website:\n\nI got a bit concerned and I tried visiting the same website on a Mac laptop with an antivirus running. The anti-virus stopped me from visiting the page and warned me that it is a malicious/hacked website.\nI would like to ask two questions. \n1) Should I be concerned about my laptop's (which runs on Ubuntu without an Anti-virus) security at the moment? Is there a chance of mine getting infected?\n2) Whether I got infected or not this time, what can be done to reducing the probability that next time, if I end up accidentally visiting a hacked website, I don't get infected?\n\nA: No one here can say if you are infected, we don't have access to your computer. \nAll I can say is most viruses are for Windows, the chance is low, but it is a chance non the less. \nThe course of action I would recommend for you is, use an anti virus program on Ubuntu to scan it. This one is free and open source clamav\nsudo apt-get install clamav\n\nUpdate its database\nsudo freshclam\n\nScan your whole system with\nclamscan -r / \n\nOr a single folder\nclamscan -r /home\n\nFor some real-time protection, you can install the daemon, it will run automatic at boot\nsudo apt-get install clamav-daemon\n\nSample output\n----------- SCAN SUMMARY -----------\nKnown viruses: 33840\nScanned directories: 145\nScanned files: 226\nInfected files: 1\nData scanned: 54.22 MB\nI/O buffer size: 131072 bytes\nTime: 20.831 sec (0 m 20 s)  \n\nHere is some documentation, it is dated but it works. Tested on 14.04.\n\nA: The best way to remove malware , as it's often mentioned on security.stackexchange.com , is to nuke it from the orbit - in other words reinstall the whole OS. However, that might be a bit of an overkill.\nHere are couple of suggestions I personally would use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your computer, and on fresh login , don't open the browser.\nRun sudo netstat -tulpan to check for any fishy connections and IP\naddresses that belong to sites other than Canonical's.  You can\ncheck ip-addresses with nslookup  <ip-address-here> command.\n\n*Most malware is for Windows, so unless you ran your browser with root\npermissions (sudo or gksu), there shouldn't be that much\npossibility for your system being infected. But just in case you can\ncheck processes that are running with ps -ef | less command. Cannot\ntell  you what exactly to look for, just anything fishy.\n\n*You could remove your browser profile,also, as a security measure.\nFor instance, ~/.mozilla/firefox if you are a firefox user.\nWhatever malicious cache and cookies could have been there, will be\ngone.  Note that bookmarks will be gone. You might want to export\nthem to an html file, before you nuke your profile.\n\n*Change password with passwd command.\n\n*Get into your home router (if that's where you've browsed from) and change/set admin password as well as change your wifi password\n\n", "Q: Removing Katoolin from Ubuntu 14.04 I made the mistake of installing Katoolin package https://github.com/LionSec/katoolin.

About 20% of the way through downloading the update, it just stopped.  I left that window alone for about 20 minutes or so but it wasn't progressing and although it said it was downloading there wasn't network activity.  \nI xkilled the window and rebooted.  During shutdown and then again at boot there was a bunch of these ata1.00: status: { DRDY ERR } entries.  When it finally booted into KDE, my graphics resolution had reverted to 768p instead of 1440p and only one monitor came on.\nI tried to purge my nvidia and reinstall but I got an error which I forgot but it suggested I run dpkg ... (I forget the ...) which I did.  After another reboot, my graphics were still in the same boat and I was still getting the above errors so I googled them and saw that they indicated a problem with my hard drive and weren't directly related to my video driver problems.\nI ran mdadm -D /dev/md0 and sure enough it came back saying one of my drives is in removed state, not failure though.  The overall state is clean, degraded.  At this point I decided to stop screwing around with the video drivers.  My question though is, why would the video settings/driver go out at the same time as the SSD (apparently) did if the mdadm is clean?  Am I misinterpreting what clean means?  Besides making fresh backup of critical data, should I do anything before replacing faulty SSD?\nAs to replacing the drive here's what I think I need to do.\nFirst manually fail the drive mdadm /dev/md0 -f /dev/sda2\nNext remove the drive with mdadm /dev/md0 -r /dev/sda2\nAt this point I would power down and replace the faulty drive with a new one.\nAfter rebooting I would run gparted on the new drive and then run mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/sda2\nAt this point mdadm would automatically rebuild the array?\nAm I missing anything?\nFor reference here is my latest dmesg\nhttp://pastebin.com/Vbut0fNJ\n\nA: I did the above and there were no big surprises.  The only thing is that since the drive was already in removed status, it couldn't be manually failed or removed.  It would seem that manually failing a drive is just for testing drives that are synced.\nMy graphics resolution (and 2nd screen) went back to normal so I wonder if that is a feature to alert people that they need to do something.  Were it not for that, I would have droned on with a bad drive.\n", "Q: USB Flash drive size usage discrepancy I've got a 68gb thumb drive with 52gb of stuff on it and I've got 9gb remaining to add, but I can't do so because Thunar says there's insufficient space. Hitting properties shows this: \nI've unhidden folders, deleted what I can, and emptied the trash. Graphical disk maps shows the files I have and doesn't reveal anything that would explain the mystery extra.\nDoes anyone have any ideas what the hell's going on here?\nThanks\nedit: new pic\n\nA: \nI've got a 68gb thumb drive with 52gb of stuff on it\n\nNo, you likely purchased a 64GB thumb drive.  USB thumb drives are typically issued in powers of 2... (so 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.).  How you get to 67GB volume is likely a larger drive that's damaged.\nSecondly, you probably have hidden files and folders and such in the dot-hidden folders - those take up space too.\nThirdly, gparted gives you the more accurate file usage statistics, so you've got extra files in there, likely stuff you deleted previously.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas what is going on here?\n\nThere's several confusions you're making.  First, the size of a thumb drive is theoretical.  That is, a 64GB thumb drive may actually have only usable space of 62ish GB.  They can't guarantee you the full space.  Secondly, as stated in comments, you may have damage that reduces the actual usable space.  Thirdly, the filesystem takes up space too - a 60GB NTFS partition may really  be 59-ish GB usable.\nUltimately I think this is a case of an odd-size USB stick having only 62GB usable space, not 68GB that's being advertised.  Which means you really don't have the amount of space you think you do available.\n", "Q: Intel integrated graphics screen tearing I seem to be having problems with screen tearing on my Intel nuc5ppyh(n3700 quadcore) with intel integrated graphics. I'm using ubuntu 15.10 with gnome3 but the problem consists in unity or xfce as well. It's noticable when scrolling through webpages, watching fullscreen HD videos through pipelight, html5 or a local file.\nI have tried the following to try and fix my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed latest intel graphics stack from 01.org\n\n*My config file (/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf) looks like this:\nSection \"Device\"\nIdentifier \"Intel Graphics\"\nDriver \"Intel\"\nOption \"AccelMethod\" \"sna\"\nOption \"TearFree\" \"true\"\nOption \"TripleBuffer\" \"true\"\nOption \"MigrationHeuristic\" \"greedy\"\nOption \"Tiling\" \"true\"\nOption \"Pageflip\" \"true\"\nOption \"ExaNoComposite\" \"false\"\nOption \"Tiling\" \"true\"\nOption \"Pageflip\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nI've decided to disable the tearfree and triplebuffer options, they do not have any result on my screen tearing but increase buffer times specifically on pipelight streams.\nFurthermore I have tried the fix described in this link: http://www.rottenrei.be/posts/2014-12-23-fixing-ubuntu-s-screen-tearing-on-intel-hd-graphics/\nand supposedly this package should have cleared my tearing as well but to no avail: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/wily/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel\nI'm not really an expert at drivers and such as it comes to ubuntu, so don't expect me to fully understand the answers that may be given to me. English is also not my native language so expect some level of discrepancy.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I was able to eliminate screen tearing by enabling DRI3 with SNA acceleration. According to the link below, option \"TearFree\" \"true\" is not necessary with option \"DRI\" \"3\".\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/intel_graphics#Tear-free_video\nHere is a method to turn on DRI3 by editing your xorg.conf file to something like this:\nSection \"Module\"\n    Load \"dri3\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"Intel Graphics\"\n    Driver      \"intel\"\n    Option      \"DRI\"   \"3\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: Try to install and use Compiz windows manager.

I'm new to Ubuntu and don't know much about dual boot. could u please tell me how to run windows 8 on an Ubuntu desktop?\n\nA: Just install Windows 10 from a bootable drive as usual and make sure to install it in a different partition than the one in which Ubuntu is on. \n", "Q: I need to reinstall Ubuntu 14.04 after erasing a lot of files and ubuntu won't start anymore I played around without looking in terminal and I somehow started to erase all the ubuntu system files.

I just deployed a small PC with Ubuntu Desktop 15 and the Vim behavior is drastically different in Insert mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*The arrow keys insert special characters\n\n*I can only backspace over characters I inserted in the current insert \"session?\"\n\n\n*\n\n*i.e enter insert mode -> type a few chars -> I can backspace over them, but I cannot backspace over any other chars that exist there.\n\n\n*files are not auto colorized\n\n\n*\n\n*ie: html files, system files like /etc/passwd\nThese are only of the few inconsistencies. Is there any way I can get the desktop unit to behave like the server units in Vim?\n\nA: The default vim version that comes with desktop is somewhat restricted, different; it is called vim-tiny. I had to run sudo apt-get install vim to get the simple arrow key behavior and other features. That's probably the simplest approach.\nHowever, the second simplest thing that you can do is to copy over vimrc file from server to your desktop. You c an use either rsync or scp, whichever you're familiar with more to pull the file from server to local system. \nAlternatively, you could search for customized vimrc files on github. There are plently of those with tons of customizations and features, which include your desired behavior and more\nYou can also have your own github account and back up the same vimrc file there. On each desktop install just git clone https://github.com/YourRepo and you will have that vimrc in the YourRepo folder.\n", "Q: Adding a partition (device) back to the launcher I am new to Ubuntu and I unknowingly removed the shortcut to the drives and partitions from the launcher as it was totally cluttered initially. But now I'm having trouble accessing files and folders by going to each and every drive.\nIs it possible to add the partitions to the \"Launcher\" as prior to removal of the icons? \n\nA: By removing the devices (accidentally) from the launcher, you \"blacklisted\" them, meaning the ones you removed are no longer visible in the Unity Launcher. To undo, and make them show up again, run the command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"[]\"\n\n(open a terminal window by typing Ctrl+Alt+Tand paste the command above in the terminal window, press RETURN)\nThis will make any device you might have removed from the launcher visible again.\n", "Q: ubuntu 15.10 - shrinking volumes and removing others \nI have the above volumes.

Nothing I've found in the documentation on how to disable key checking works.\n\nA: Disabling signature verification because you installed a local repository is like removing the door locks because you fenced your garden. Don't do this, especially not in environments requiring enhanced security!\nYou don't need access to a key server to install the public key used for signing packets in reprepro. Simply copy the key file to the respective machine, and import it using a command like\nsudo apt-key add [publickey]\n\nwhile [publickey] is the file containing the key with ID 082BCA0181FE8E68. You can generate such a file on the computer you generated the key on with\ngpg --armor --export 082BCA0181FE8E68 >082BCA0181FE8E68.asc\n\nThe public key can be shared arbitrarily, as it can only be used to verify signatures issued using the private key.

How can I remove command-line history over a specific time period?\nIs it possible do so with only one command?\n\nA: While it is possible to store the time at which a command was run, the history manipulation commands do not use time as a reference. Look up HISTTIMEFORMAT in man bash:\nHISTTIMEFORMAT\n      If  this  variable  is  set and not null, its value is used as a\n      format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated\n      with  each  history  entry displayed by the history builtin.  If\n      this variable is set, time stamps are  written  to  the  history\n      file  so they may be preserved across shell sessions.  This uses\n      the history comment character  to  distinguish  timestamps  from\n      other history lines.\n\nIf you had set HISTTIMEFORMAT before you ran the commands you wanted to delete, your .bash_history would have lines like so:\n$ tail -4 ~/.bash_history \n#1449955320\nhistory\n#1449955329\nhistory -w\n\nThen you could take advantage of the Unix timestamps to delete them, using awk, for example:\nawk -F# -v end=$(date -d yesterday +%s) \\\n  -v start=$(date -d 'now - 3 days' +%s) \\\n  '$2 < start || $2 > end {print; getline; print}'\n\nI'm not sure how this command will work with multi-line commands, but you could maybe count the timestamps to get the number assigned to a command, and then use history to delete it.\n\nIf you hadn't set HISTTIMEFORMAT beforehand, then you'll have to do this manually.\n", "Q: Extremely slow USB transfer speed I'm getting extremely slow USB transfer speeds with Ubuntu 14.04.

The bzr dh_make command (bzr dh-make PACKAGE_NAME VERSION TARBALL) extracts the tarball to a directory name PACKAGE_NAME, and sets it up as a bazaar branch. From the docs:\n\nIf there upstream is available in bzr then run the command from the\n  root of a branch of that corresponding to the 0.1 release.\nIf there is no upstream available in bzr then run the command from\n  outside a branch and it will create a branch for you in a directory\n  named the same as the package name you specify as the second argument.\n\nIn the second mode, which is what you're using, bzr will refuse to extract to an existing directory to create a branch. That's the error you got. Bazaar branches are essentially directories.\nThe simple workaround (though I have a feeling this is not the intended way) would be:\ncd /path/to/resolutionx \n# create tarball in parent directory\ntar zcf ../resolutionx-1.0.tar.gz -C .. resolutionx\nbzr dh_make resolutionx 1.0 ../resolutionx-1.0.tar.gz\n\nIf you're already using git for version control, then look into git-buildpackage instead.\n", "Q: Host git repo on my VPS I am trying to host a git repo on my VPS.

I used chsh to set my default shell to /usr/bin/zsh.\nMy ~/.zprofile defines several environment variables, e.g. export EDITOR=vim. Yet after logging in and starting GNOME Terminal, these variables are not set. After running zsh -l, they are:\n% echo $EDITOR\n\n% zsh -l\n% echo $EDITOR\nvim\n%\n\nSo apparently when zsh is run on login it does not know it's a login shell and therefore does not read .zprofile?

Compare by switching to a TTY (CtrlAltF1), and logging in.\n\nit does not know it's a login shell\n\nThe term \"login shell\" is overloaded:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's the shell mentioned in your passwd entry. Console-based login methods usually start this shell (try the TTYs, or sudo -l, or su -). \"Login shell\" with this context is used in discussion of user accounts.\n\n*A shell can be run as a login shell, irrespective of whether it is a login shell(1) of the user. With most Bourne-like shells, that's obtained by either using -l when run manually, or by using - as the first character of argument 0 when launched indirectly (by login, sudo, su, etc.). This meaning is used while discussing invocation of shells.\n\n\nSo, it isn't a login shell(2), because we are discussing how it is started (invocation).\n\n.zprofile is read by login shells (2). GNOME Terminal does not run a login shell (2) by default.

I like to program, so I thought a linux-based os would be a good idea, but I needed to keep microsoft for some more everyday things. So I tried to dual boot and I'm pretty sure I went wrong somewhere around the partitioning part of this whole install.\nI started with booting from a usb that I loaded with the iso that's online. It loaded fine, I got to the installer, selected manual partition, and here's what I did from there (note, my computer says efi in the setuppact file, and it seems that it's gpt as well. That said, I don't know what that means, but from what I've looked up I guess it's supposed to affect how I partition). I set up a 8gb partition for swap, a 20gb ext4 for root tagged with /, a 1mb for biosgrub (it recommended that I add that one), and an 8 gb ext4 tagged with /home. for the boot loader install I kept it at the default, which was the one at the top of the partition list (forget what it's called, I think just sda/hd without any numbers).\nI hit install, and it says it worked out well, except grub won't open up when I boot regardless of what buttons I do or don't press during startup. I can only conclude that I screwed something up at that point. I downloaded the correct version so I don't think it's that. Maybe somebody has another idea? thanks\n\nA: \nmy computer says \"efi\" in the setuppact file, and it seems that it's gpt as well\n\nThis description suggests that Windows is probably installed in EFI mode. This is a critical detail, so I recommend you verify it, as described on this page of mine, among other places.\n\na 1mb for biosgrub (it recommended that I add that one)\n\nIf the installer is suggesting a \"biosgrub\" partition, then that indicates that the installer booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Such a boot is at odds with an EFI-mode boot of Windows and would explain your failure to boot.\nIf this analysis is correct, you have a number of recovery options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy boot support\" or some similar term) in your firmware and re-install Ubuntu. A full re-install is overkill, but since you presumably haven't yet customized your installation or done much with it, you might consider it.\n\n*Disable the CSM in your firmware and run the Boot Repair program from a boot of the Ubuntu installer in \"try before installing\" mode. This should get Ubuntu booting in EFI mode, but there are a number of ways it can go wrong. In most cases you'll still be able to boot Windows, but there's a small chance Boot Repair will end up creating serious new problems. I don't want to blow this risk out of proportion, though; this procedure will probably work fine.\n\n*If it's not already disabled, disable Secure Boot in your firmware. Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, prepare a medium from that, and boot it. This should enable you to boot into either Windows or Ubuntu. If both work, install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package. This approach eliminates the small risk of the preceding one because the USB/CD-R boot of rEFInd serves as a test of what it will do once it's installed on your hard disk, enabling you to abort before you touch the disk, should you not like what you see.\n\n\nThere are variants and additional options. For instance, you could use rEFInd to boot once and use that to install GRUB 2 (Ubuntu's default boot loader).\nNote that, if my analysis is correct, your initial problem was caused by enabling the CSM. Many pages recommend doing this as a routine part of installing Ubuntu, but the advice is misguided, as I describe on this page. That's why two of my procedures specify disabling the CSM -- unless you disable it or use an EFI-only boot procedure (which rEFInd is), you can't be sure you'll boot the Ubuntu installer in EFI mode, so you could end up back in the same boat.\n", "Q: deleted .zshrc file and messed up few things Oh-My-Zsh was working fine.

The configuration file will have other settings like compression, log file location etc.\nThe cron will look like \nlogrotate --force /etc/logrotate.conf\n\n", "Q: Configuration of static IP address I used the link to set-up configuration of IP address \nbut I got this \n Failed to bring up eth0\n\ncommand I used:\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nconfiguration  is \n# The primary network interface\n auto eth0\n iface eth0 inet static\n address 192.168.1.6\n netmask 255.255.255.0\n gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nI have this \nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 192.168.1.1 \n\nbut network I don't know , and tried them but still same error\n\nA: Static Ip config for eth0\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo eth0\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.10.33\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    broadcast 192.168.10.255\n    network 192.168.10.0\n    gateway 192.168.10.254 \n    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 #

So I used rails server -b 0.0.0.0 as explained in the answer here. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34246254/cant-access-docker-container\n\nA: The most likely explanation is that Rails isn't actually running in the container. In particular, the output of docker ps shows that the command running in the container is bash. That would mean that unless you have started it manually inside the container, Rails isn't running.\n", "Q: Mouse problem in draftsight I have installed draftsight (CAD alternative app to Autodesk one) for Ubuntu but I am not able to use the mouse in the model space.\nThe \"arrow\" is moving slowly and delayded than in other applications and than the other part of the application (menu, labels).\nThe problem can be that the app is a beta version? \n\nA: I have learned of a partial solution from youtube comments and a few other locations.

I would like to play midi files in Firefox.\nFor example, I'd like to click on the files on this Wikipedia page and have them play in the browser and not have to download them and use a separate player.\nI did get a plugin for VLC to play them, but even when it is set to handle midi files in Firefox's preferences either Totem still opens (and does nothing) or VLC opens it in a separate window (depending on the setting).\nIs there a cleaner way of playing them embedded in the browser?\n\nA: I know this isn't the answer you want, but modern browsers don't play midi files. To the best of my knowledge Mozilla dropped support for NPAPI plugins around the first quarter of 2017. Wikipedia makes this clear.\n\nMusic files may occasionally use the MIDI format (.MID or .MIDI extension). MIDI is often playable without additional software, and some PCs have a MIDI-enabled player and sound card. However, for macOS (since 10.9 Mavericks), a MIDI file is not playable by both Safari and QuickTime pre-installed in the system and an alternative standalone player has to be used. The situation is similar with modern Firefox and Google Chrome browsers which do not support MIDI by default but require additional software (plugins, extensions, codecs) to play such files.\n\nOne solution is to download and play them in totem (a.k.a Videos) Totem requires a plugin for this that it doesn't automatically find. The solution to THAT is to be found in the fluidsynth package.\nAnother option mentioned by doug in a comment above can be found here: Audacious: How to play midi files?\nS number of popular MIDI files can be found here.\nSources:\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1149132\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Media_help\n\nA: If you have Rhythmbox music player choose it instead of VLC.\nRhythmbox can play MIDI files if fluid-soundfont-gm is installed. fluid-soundfont-gm can be installed from the default Ubuntu repositories in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu with the following command.\nsudo apt install fluid-soundfont-gm\n\n\nA: This Firefox addon is fine answer to the problem in september 2019. after adding on and click midi link the midi player open right up.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/midi-player/\n\n", "Q: ubuntu 15.10: How to set alt+tab to switch windows only in the current workspace?

While reading the git introductory material, I read a piece that brought this question to mind.\nHow do I use the Terminal to find out what my Default Text Editor is? \nAre there a General Commands that I can use to find this out? \n\nA: There is actually git var -l which allows you to list the variables, including GIT_EDITOR variable. Here's mine (private info is unset of course):\n$ git var -l\nuser.name=*****\nuser.email=****\nGIT_COMMITTER_IDENT=****\nGIT_AUTHOR_IDENT=****\nGIT_EDITOR=editor\nGIT_PAGER=pager\n\nAs heemayl already pointed out, editor command is the one set by /etc/alternatives/editor. In my case, that's nano (which I assume is default for Ubuntu, because I don't remember consciously making an effort to change my default editor). \nBut on other systems other than Ubuntu (or I should say which have no Debian's alternatives system) , there is no editor.  Let's, however read up the man git:\n\nGIT_EDITOR\nThis environment variable overrides $EDITOR and $VISUAL. It is used\n  by several Git commands when, on interactive mode, an editor is to\n  be launched. See also git-var(1) and the core.editor option in git-\n  config(1).\n\nAnd if we look through git-var it tells us\n\nThe order of preference is the $GIT_EDITOR environment variable, then\n  core.editor configuration, then $VISUAL, then $EDITOR, and then the\n  default chosen at compile time, which is usually vi.\n\nThus it is a mere perculiarity of Ubuntu that it has Debian's alternatives system. On other systems which don't have Debian's alternatives systems it would default to vi\n\nA: In Ubuntu, there is a generic editor command which is set by the Debian alternatives system.\nIf you do:\neditor foobar.txt\n\nthe file will be opened using the original editor e.g. vim, nano which is prioritized as editor currently.\nYou can check the details with:\nupdate-alternatives --display editor\n\nTo set a new editor as editor:\nsudo update-alternatives --config editor\n\n\nAlso note that bash checks some environment variables for tasks related to it, to be exact bash checks VISUAL, EDITOR one after another. If unset, bash defaults to nano (unless an editor you've installed has overridden this).\nSome processes spawned from bash check these environment variables too.\n\nA: The default editor is as defined by the EDITOR, or VISUAL, environment variable(s). \nThe default editor is vi if neither were defined. Add \nexport EDITOR=\"/bin/nano\" \n\nto your ~/.bashrc file to set, for example, nano as your default editor.\nTo see if the environment variable is set, you can use\nprintenv | grep EDITOR\n\nor\nset | grep EDITOR\n\nOne can dereference the value of the named environment variable by prefixing it with a \"$\"\n$ echo $EDITOR\n\nor\n$ echo $VISUAL\n\n", "Q: Two files fail MD5SUM checks on Ubuntu 15.10 USB disk I created a USB stick with Ubuntu 15.10 64bit, using Universal USB Installer. If I run the MD5SUMS integrity check, I get these two errors:\n./boot/grub/grub.cfg: FAILED\n./boot/grub/loopback.cfg: FAILED\nmd5sum: WARNING: 2 computed checksums did NOT match\n\nIs this expected?\nI've tried two USB sticks so far, so I don't think it's an issue with the USB stick. I've also tried extracting the .iso file and checking the MD5SUMs there, and it does not fail, it seems Universal USB Installer modifies these files.\n\nA: I noticed this too using Ubuntu 15.04's built-in Startup Disk Creator and the 15.10 ISO.\nThe changes are deliberate. They appear to be boot options which the Grub bootloader must pass to the Linux kernel to enable it to boot from external media (CD or USB) rather than an internal hard drive.\nFor example, compare line 3 from the file ./boot/grub/loopback.cfg in a text editor.\nFrom the ISO image:\n   linux   /casper/vmlinuz.efi  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper iso-scan/filename=${iso_path} quiet splash ---\nFrom the USB flash drive created with Startup Disk Creator:\n   linux   /casper/vmlinuz.efi  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper iso-scan/filename=${iso_path} quiet splash --- cdrom-detect/try-usb=true noprompt\nThe lines are identical except cdrom-detect/try-usb=true noprompt was added, and the same is true for all the other lines that have changed in both loopback.cfg and grub.cfg. This is an option for the Linux kernel to allow booting from USB or CD instead of an internal HDD [1].\nOn a side note, these changes were deliberate but it is possible for errors or corruptions to occur during the ISO download or writing to CD/USB. However, the probability of errors occurring is proportional to the file size [2], so you are much more likely to see bit errors or corruptions in larger files (a few GBs in size) than in small files like these (~1kB each). Also, the new files are slightly larger than the originals, but errors are more likely to result in bits being flipped or missed rather than new bits added.\n[1] - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromUSB\n[2] - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\n", "Q: How to download most of Ubuntu Software Centre?

One tool to do this is debmirror. It's downloading the complete repository and saving it to your hard disc.

I don't know how to solve this issue.Any advice would be helpful and deeply appreciated. \n\nA: You need to install the gcc-arm-linux-androideabi toolchain package first, either via the Software Center (or other package manager) or via the command line using\nsudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-androideabi\n\n", "Q: Why can I watch 1080p videos if my Pc has a lower resolution? When I type the following command in the Terminal: \nxdpyinfo  | grep dimensions\n\nI get the following output:\ndimensions:    1366x768 pixels (361x203 millimeters)\n\nAs far as I know these are the number of pixels that my monitor has along the horizontal and vertical axis respectively. \nHere is my doubt: When I am on Youtube and I am watching a video with a 720p resolution I understand the fact that my monitor can handle it since 720p<768p.\nHowever if I play the video at a higher resolution, for example 1080p, I can't understand how it is possible to actually appreciate the better quality of the video if my monitor has less pixels than the resolution I have selected (768p<1080p).\nHopefully the question makes sense. \n\nA: It's called scaling.\nThere is both hardware scaling (which is done by the video card or the monitor) and software scaling.\nThat is an example of software scaling.\nIt's much like watching a big picture, at some point if the image can't be rendered directly the image is passed to an algorithm which tries to resize it in a reasonable way (notice that resizing itself implies quality loss); the same goes for videos.\nMore on picture scaling\n\nA: You can't appreciate the extra quality.

An archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive).\n\nThere are more tools (like tar) but whatever other tool you use: make sure that that tool supports this ->\n\nThe original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction. \n\n\nA: The z flag of GNU tar (which is the version of tar shipped with Ubuntu) is used to speciy that the archive being processed is compressed using gzip, which is usually indicated by the .tar.gz (or, more rarely, .tgz) extension. In GNU tar, it is an error to use the z flag if the archive is not compressed with gzip, as you experience now.\nArchives using the .tar.xz extension are compressed with xz, and the corresponding flag in GNU tar is J. Hence, replacing z with J in your command should solve your problem. In addition, you may get a \"command not found\" error if the xz tools are not installed on your system, which can be remedied by installing the xz-utils package.\nAlternatively, you can simply omit the filetype-related flag altogether, and simply use -xvf; in that case tar will attempt to autodetect the compression format by analyzing the file. (You can probably also dispense with the v flag; it just prints a list of the extracted files, which is not usually useful.)\n\nA: I had a 'tar.xz', so I used unxz myfile.tar.xz to uncompress the file, so I got the archive file myfile.tar. Then using the regular tar command  on an archive file, I could extract the contents tar xvf myfile.tar.\n\nA: You can use the command below to untar .tar.xz files.\nSyntax: \ntar -xJvf File_Name.tar.xz\n\nExample: \ntar -xJvf etc.tar.xz    \n\n", "Q: Kubuntu 15.10: Steam not launching Anytime I try to launch steam it doesn't start and this comes up in the terminal:\nRunning Steam on ubuntu 15.10 64-bit  \nSTEAM_RUNTIME is enabled automatically  \nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(0)  \nlibGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so  \nlibGL error: failed to load driver: swrast  \n\nI am very new to Linux and I am running Kubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this would help since this is a solution for those running ArchLinux, but if you've got nothing else to lose:\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=193802\nremoving some files got it working for these users.\n", "Q: How to change default application for XML files?

But when I try to reset it by pressing AltF10 I'm prompted with some options like boot Ubuntu and memory test options were there.\nCan anyone please guide me on how to restore my Windows 8.1 back? Is this is possible? Thanks in advance\n\nA: Maybe you accidentally chose to use the whole disk for Ubuntu. When you cannot see a Windows boot entry in the GRUB boot menu you mentioned - you unfortunately have to reinstall Windows. As you said that you just installed Ubuntu, I recommend to first install Windows and then Ubuntu.  \nYou need a Windows installation media to do this. After you have finished the installation, reduce the Windows partition with GParted from the Ubuntu installation media - create a new partition from the unallocated space and format it with ext4 - then start the Ubuntu installer and choose Something else when asked and install Ubuntu to the new ext4 partition you created before.\n", "Q: gedit `Comment Code` plugin installed but not working I seem to have no trouble installing GEdit plugins, and in general GEdit seems to be working OK.  It also seems like the plugins got installed (at least to some degree) because the Comment code and Uncomment code options appear under the Edit tab.  \nThe only problem is that these commenting functions are greyed out and Ctrl+M similarly has no effect.  How can I fix this?\n\nA: The file should be of a recognised language by gedit, so that the plugin knows which comments it should use (#, --, <--...>, /*...*/, ecc...)\n", "Q: how to convert .svg image to .png?

How well it works for you might depend in the source for your SVG, but certainly worth trying.\nIt should be possible to do this with Image Magick, as noted in another Q&A, but I always find that a bit trickier to control, and there's a bit of a learning curve there. It also appears that the \"Converseen\" front-end hasn't been updated for Ubuntu 14+, and its website has issues (so far as I can see).\n", "Q: Reinstalled 15.10 and now steam controller unusable in game My previous install had issues that seemed to revolve around updating from 15.04 on a machine with full disk encryption on initial install. Things like using the latest kernel would hang on passphrase and htop showing significantly more memory usage than normal for no discernible reason. These were bearable until I got my steam controller and tried to play, steam big picture seems to have a larger resource footprint than the normal client and crashed my games repeatedly. To be clear, the controller was working as intended both on desktop and in-game before reinstall.\nAfter reinstalling, I downloaded the bare minimum of what I had on my machine before, ubuntu-restricted-extras vlc htop aptitude and steam. I did not try the controller right away, work got busy, so now about a month later, steam controller wont work. On wireless alone, the controller turns on and the haptic feedback is there but nothing happens on screen, same in BP mode. on wired the controller acts like the mouse portion of the presets on desktop and BP mode, in-game is more of the same and I cant access controller customization or community through the steam button on the controller.\nXinput has both valve software wireless controller when the dongle is plugged in and valve software wired controller when the usb is plugged. I have tried all of the valve troubleshooting suggestions and browsed about both here and steam's forums for a solution on and off for the last two days with no luck.\nI hope I have been clear enough about my problem and what I have already tried, Thanks for the help.\n\nA: I fixed it myself with help from a reddit post and some additional googling that came from said post.\nThere is a typo in /lib/udev/rules.d/99-steam-perms.rules that needs to be edited from *********==\"***\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"****\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"****\", ****=\"****\" to *********==\"***\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"****\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"****\", ****=\"****\" on both lines this appears. \nI replaced information that I did not need to edit with * in the unlikly event that those are specific to my machine and could cause issues for others if pasted directly as is. \nPlugging in the steam controller and starting Big Picture after doing this allowed for a firmware update from November 3rd 2015 to install that allowed the controller to function with default layout in game but would not allow for button customization.\nThe December firmware update, one that brings a gui with additional customizations for lights, feedback and such, still does not seem to want to download on linux, but if you can get the firmware.bin file you can manually install it by holding right trigger while starting the controller bringing up a usb storage device allowing you to update.

I am on windows and ubuntu dual boot. When I set automatic mount options on in the app disk, the system does not auto mount the drive. I need to click the drive to mount. When I set automatic mount options off and check mount at startup. It works but is mounted as root. As a result, I cannot put any file in trash.\n\nA: I've organized this answer going what is good to best answer in my opinion. It's not a requirement to do all of them and user discretion is advised :)\n/etc/fstab approach\nThe way I'd personally do it use users option. That way , a partition is available to all users - maybe I've car manual that my dad wants to read there with his account, maybe my mom also wants to open shared photo album using her account - whatever the reason may be. An example would be:\n# MY WINDOWS PARTITION\n\nUUID=4EBAAE53BAAE36FD /media/WINDOWS  ntfs noatime,nodiratime,users,rw 0 0\n\nHowever, yes, that's a security hole. So next better option is this to use uid= flag. Each user on a *nix system has unique integer number attached to them (run id command to find out your numeric id, or look into /etc/passwd file and find your username ). So, the next entry for me would look like this:\n# MY WINDOWS PARTITION\nUUID=4EBAAE53BAAE36FD /media/WINDOWS  ntfs noatime,nodiratime,uid=1000,rw 0 0\n\nudisksctl approach\nmount command wants you to specify a lot of information - user, filesystem type. These pieces of info you might not know how to find. There is an easier alternative, udisksctl. It will mount a partition as the user who runs it. Here's how I'd run it if I want to mount my Windows partition on my second HDD:\nudisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb2\n\nAnd that easily can be turned into a function in .bashrc file (define at the top)\nfunction mountWindows\n{\nudisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb2\n}\n\nNow you basically have a command for mounting Windows partition. If you place call to that function at the end of your .bashrc it will be running each time you spawn terminal window. Of course it's not exactly automation , but for someone like myself  who constantly has terminal window open - it's easiest automation method.\nThere's a small issue however - the call is made each time bash starts, meaning each time window is open. With a bit of editing we can include a check to whether or not the partition is already mounted or not. \nfunction mountWindows\n{\ngrep -q '/dev/sdb2' /proc/mounts\nif [ $? -eq 0  ];then \n  echo \">>> Windows partition already mounted\"; \nelse udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb2\nfi\n}\n\nNow, each time we spawn bash we quietly check if /dev/sdb2 is in the /proc/mounts file (only stuff that's already mounted is in that file). If it's there, we just say so. If it's not, we'll run udisksctl command.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 Startup USB does not contain wubi and cannot boot in Windows I downloaded Ubuntu 15.10 and created a startup disk with two different programs (xboot and pendrive...) The result in both cases is a startup disk that cannot start up/boot in Windows. And no .exe file also to start it from Windows. Only startup disks with older versions, e.g. 14.10 can be created in a proper way.\nWhy is that?\n\nA: The startup disk you've created is supposed to start on its own. That's why it is called a startup disk. Insert it in your computer restart the computer and you'll see the computer can boot from it. You cannot use it from within Windows. If it is a USB device then make sure the computer is booting from it.

The default driver was nouveau, but the proprietary nvidia driver was also installed and I easily switched to it. After reboot I got 3d acceleration (the difference can't go unnoticed!) and dual monitor support with no issues.\nLuckily it is a wubi installation so I could install alongside the original OS and then mount the original partition and copy whatever I needed... but I admit this solution sucks. I'm posting it just to let other miserable souls know it works.\nIf anyone has a better answer please add it.

If not, you're going to have to restart your task.\nIf this is your own code, I would highly suggest that you attach a debugger to your program. If it's someone else's and it's open source (it's Python so it should be), you can just add it in.\n\nA: Not knowing what the script or command is/was makes it harder for me to answer, but as a general rule: If nothing outstanding enough to force the Operating System to log it happened, it's pretty much lost, as far as I know.\nGood software developing practices involves writing \"Debug\" code, which will allow the program to leave messages about its own progress somewhere, either in a text file, or in /var/log/yourscriptname/last.log as example.\nIf your script contains such debugging code, those two links might be of use to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where are all the major log files located?\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxLogFiles\nIf there is nothing to be found, I would recommend reading the script to see if it contains debugging code, and if none is present, add something equivalent to Script finished at [time here] where needed.\n\nA: There's no general way to check if a given program was running when the system was shut down or died.\nDepending on your program you may guess e.g. on the modification date of soem output files.

Anyway, the solution:\nIf you can still boot into Windows, Destroy the partition(s) on which you installed Ubuntu. Unfortunatly, this is the only way I know of to get the error to go away. Boot back into your installation media. Go into try Ubuntu without installing. On the dash, search \"disks\" and choose the program that matches. Select your main disk and look at the \"new partition\" button (+) under your disk's graph. If this is greyed out, you cannot install Ubuntu unless you change your partition table (it's a crazy Microsoft thing). If it is not, manually make two partitions (as big as you wish), one Ext4, and the other SWAP. Now you must look at the other partitions. Partition 1 should appear as either \"Microsoft Basic Data\" or \"xData\". Partition 2 should appear as \"vFat\", \"Bootable Partition\", or \"Microsoft Boot Data\". Nothing else matters at this point. If something didn't match, then Ubuntu probably won't install unless you format the disk in GPT. If everything matched, then keep disks open and start the installer. It should work now that it has something to scan.  \nThis may not work, however, because with things like this you have to specifically know the machine (which is hard when you can't see the computer yourself!). If it still doesn't work, let me know, as I am very willing to help.\n", "Q: No network connection available I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 but it does not detect my network. Do I have to do this manually? Or is there an automatic network discovery tool?\nI am running strictly wireless right now and I did add wireless network details but it does not connect.\nThe output of lspci -nn | grep Network is: \nNetwork Controller [0280]: Intel Corp Wireless 7265[8086:095a] rev 61\n\n\nA: You should automatically detect a wired connection to your computer.  \nWireless would require you to connect to it.  Look for the network indicator in your panel, select the network you are trying to connect to, and fill in any useful details like the WiFi password.  From then on, it should auto-connect to the given access point.\nPersonally I'm using XUbuntu 13.10, so something as basic as this should be the same (or at least very close to what you need for an answer).\nIf this answer helps you, feel free to hit the checkmark next to the answer so I get credit for helping you.

The difference between these two commands is explained here.\n\nA: While @mat's answer technically worked for my (Kubuntu 17.10) system, it resulted in very poor graphic performance.\nThe solution that worked better for me was to uncomment the\nGRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\nline of /etc/default/grub, as it kept the boot splash almost as nice as the plymouth one, and more importantly didn't trash my graphic performance.\n", "Q: clean install, but with boot loader installed onto USB drive I'm starting a new job that requires full drive encryption for me to use my own computer. My new job will require telecommuting so I have to try to meet my new bosses security or I have to learn Windows again, I hate Microshaft so that is not an option. So here is the question...\nLooking for better security and getting ready to re-install Ubuntu 14.04 with full encryption on the hard drive. I was told that I might want to install the boot sector onto a USB Drive for better security. Is this really the best way to do it? How big of a drive should I use for the boot? Once booted can I remove the drive after booting into Ubuntu and put the boot USB up till needed or till updates are done? \nOr is there something I'm missing that is easier for the security. Yes my boss is paranoid about letting a Ubuntu computer any where near his network.\n\nA: Installing the bootloader to a USB Drive for may increase security a little but it will stop people from just turning on your computer and booting into the Linux. Without the USB flash drive plugged in. \nAny Flash Drive should do for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you Get up to Installation Type Select Something else then\nclick Continue\n\n\n*You will see this click on the drop down arrow and change your boot loader installation device\n\nNow your Boot loader will be installed on the USB device you selected. \n\nA: Having the boot loader (any of its stages) on a removable drive doesn't increase security – only obscurity. It doesn't classify as an additional authentication token, since it doesn't contain any secrets, just boot code. It also reduces ease of use.\nRather, you should do a normal installation with full-disk encryption with Ubiquity, Ubuntu's installer, and choose a secure pass phrase for boot authentication.\n", "Q: Does ubuntu 14.04 still have desktop web app integration?

I believe I have deleted my .ecryptfs passphrase files (~/.ecryptfs/ is empty) but that computer still is online with its drives mounted. I'm currently trying to recover the lost files with r-linux and will try creating a backup of my important files on a network drive but I'm essentially wondering:\nIs there a way to regenerate my .ecryptfs passphrase whilst the computer still is running? I did not take note of the original passphrase, I only have my login password.\n\nA: You might still have some .ecryptfs files still opened by some process, in which case they might not be really deleted yet. If they're listed in lsof you might still be able to copy/move them back. Especially look for the wrapped-passphrase file. \nThe best solution would be if you have a backup copy of your entire home, including the wrapped-passphrase file. If all the files were deleted then they may have been overwritten already, and losing the login key, wrapped-passphrase file, and mount key would mean they're locked forever too. Having a copy of the actual mount key would be helpful if the files are still there to read.\n\nOr, if the eCryptfs folder is still mounted, the key might be in the kernel keyring still. Take a look with\n$ keyctl show\nSession Keyring\n 802145592 --alswrv    999 65534  keyring: _uid_ses.999\n 542975566 --alswrv    999 65534   \\_ keyring: _uid.999\n 414895587 --alswrv    999   999       \\_ user: 1848e1d7b8a187fc\n 245849561 --alswrv    999   999       \\_ user: 554c7c95a5b5d6ee\n\nAnd you might see 1 (no fnek) or 2 (with fnek) entires like the last 2 above. The \"1848e1d7b8a187fc\" part should match the signature of the mount or fnek sig used by eCryptfs. You could read the key(s) with  \n\n\n*\n\n*keyctl read 414895587 - \"read\" prints it on stdout as a hex dump\n\n*keyctl print 414895587 - \"print\" dumps it to stdout directly  if  it's entirely printable or as a hexdump preceded by \":hex:\" if not\n\n*keyctl pipe 414895587 > piped-keyfile - \"pipe\" dumps the raw data to stdout\n\n\n(replace the numbers with the first part of the relevant line from the keyctl show output above)\nIf you extracted it with pipe, then later this command should add the key back into the keyring:\ncat piped-keyfile | keyctl padd user keydescription @u\n\nTo match the format of ecryptfs-add-passphrase I think changing the keydescription back to the 16 character signature to match the original keyctl show output should work.\n\nA file undelete program may be able to recover the recently deleted file, if it hasn't been overwritten yet. Programs vary by the filesystem you want to recover files on, or try testdisk (in Ubuntu universe repos) has excellent luck recovering deleted files from all sorts of filesystems.

When you use the option repeat=watch, Unison calls a helper program unison-fsmonitor which uses inotify to watch the filesystem for changes. It puts a \"watch\" on each file that you are syncing with Unison.\nBy default there is an upper limit on the number of watches a single user can evoke. On my machine that upper limit is only 8192. You can increase the number of watches by editing the file\n/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\n\nI would be a bit concerned that since you want to watch about 125k files and the default maximum is only about 8k, you might see a dramatic hit in performance if you increase the maximum by that much.\n\nA: You can add the line watch = false to your unison profile, and it should work, although without the \"benefits\" of the watcher.\n", "Q: install complete LAMP stack for 14.04 to install wordpress I want to install complete LAMP stack on my Ubuntu 14.04 in order to install Wordpress.\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nI am trying to install APACHE with the above and here's the error I am getting\ndpkg: error processing package libapache2-mod-php5 (--configure):\nsubprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nCan anyone recommend the best method to get the up and running.\nThanks\n\nA: There are some packages missing.

For android 4.4.4 development, I needed Java 6. But eventually I moved over to Android 5.0 development which needed Java 7. When I tried using sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre and sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk, It succeeds and after the installation completes, I try to set Java 7 as default by using sudo update-alternatives --config java. There I see 4 options like this.\nI chose the desired option i.e: java-7-openjdk-amd64. And exit. \nBut at the time of the compilation, it says: that I have java 1.6.x installed.

I've noticed that Glade v3.19 is missing in the Ubuntu Wily repositories. Is there a reason for this? Or, is there a way I can install Glade 3.19 or do I just have to wait until Xenial to come out?\n\nA: That's because Ubuntu is not a rolling distro.\nXenail would not help, since Glade is at version 3.18.3-1 there.\nPlease note that Glade 3.19 is not stable, it is a development version, as you can see in the announcement.\nEDIT: please note also that, if their release cycle follows Gnome standards, then the stable versions are with even numbers (3.14, 3.16, 3.18) while development versions are with odd numbers (3.17, 3.19, ...) so probably 3.19 will never see the light in Ubuntu; the next one will be 3.20.\n", "Q: \"Wi-Fi is disabled by hardware switch\" on Toshiba Satellite P855-335 My Toshiba Satellite p855-335 Notebook wouldn't turn the wireless on. \nThere are several existing threads on Ubuntu Forums which I've tried, for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2220855\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2249263\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2290251\nIn particular, none of the following helped:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have reset the BIOS to defaults.\n\n*I installed a fresh installation of 15.10 and pressed the 'wireless' key (Fn+ F12).\n\n*I have tried the 'Battery Trick' (of the second link above). If it's any help, the wireless LED at the bottom right corner of the laptop is showing red. \n\n\nThe following were suggested in some threads, but don't help:\n$ cat /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill2/hard\n1\n$ sudo echo 0 > /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill2/hard\nbash: /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill2/hard: Permission denied\n$ cat /sys/class/rfkill/rfkill2/state\n2\n\n$ sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\n$ sudo rfkill unblock all\n$ sudo modprobe iwlwifi\n$ rfkill list all\n0: Toshiba Bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n3: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: yes\n\nSome history:\nThe whole issue started when my laptop's battery ran out while in\nairoplane mode. We ended up shipping it back to the manufacturer, and\nthey replaced the motherboard. When it came back, it was stuck on\nhotspot mode with the wi-fi turned off. I deleted the hotspot mode,\nbut the Wi-fi is still turned off.\nI attach the results of the wireless-info script (\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=370108 ) here.\nUPDATE: If I use evtest and press the Fn + F8 keys (Next Track) followed by the Fn + F12 keys (Wi-Fi) followed by the the Fn + F8 keys (Next Track), followed by CTRL + C I get the following (http://pastebin.com/mzBa6W5H). \nSo it's possible that the WIRELESS button isn't recognised by Ubuntu.\nBut, if I press the MUTE button, nothing appears either, but Ubuntu does in fact mute the volume control.\nIf I type sudo rfkill event and press the Wi-Fi key 4 times, I get the following interaction.\n\n\n*\n\n*UPDATE: I've tried backporting to the latest stable version (4.4.2v) as described here, but it doesn't seem to change anything, even though modinfo iwlwifi shows the the driver has been backported.\n\n\nA: I looked around trying to find an answer for you and there is a user reporting that disconnecting the laptop from the mains power supply, removing the battery and then pressing and holding the power button for 30 seconds before replacing the battery and rebooting the laptop resolved the issue. Presumably this sequence is performing a factory reset on the BIOS or something or it could be just simply removing the battery did the trick either way it's worth a try maybe it will work for you also.\nhttp://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/44040-43-wireless-function-working-toshiba-satellite\n\nA: Give this a shot--\n$rfkill unblock all\n$rfkill list all shows the soft blocked decives too.\n\nA: Your laptop has no WiFi because it is in airplane mode, the same mode it was in when you sent it back to Toshiba. Press the Fn key and F12 simultaneously to turn Wi-Fi back on.\nIf this does not work check that your F12 key is working.\nInstall evtest sudo apt-get install evtest\nRun it and press the Fn + F12 keys. Sudo evtest then select keyboard. \nYou tried evtest with the combination Fn + F8 keys (Next Track) followed by the Fn + F12 keys (Wi-Fi) followed by the the Fn + F8 keys (Next Track), followed by CTRL + C. This showed no result for the Wi-Fi key combination, but the others were as expected.\nNext killall gnome-settings-daemon then xev | grep keycode then press Fn + F12 to see if a keypress event is detected.\nTwo key press events are detected for each keystroke.\n: state 0x0, key code 246 (keysym 0x1008ff95, XF86WLAN), same_screen YES,\nThis proves your keyboard hardware and firmware are performing correctly.\nNext sudo rfkill event and pressing the Fn +  F12 keys 4 times, gives the result \n$ sudo rfkill event\n1464557444.818056: idx 0 type 2 op 0 soft 0 hard 0\n1464557444.818150: idx 2 type 1 op 0 soft 0 hard 1\n1464557444.818155: idx 4 type 2 op 0 soft 0 hard 0\n1464557446.759506: idx 2 type 1 op 2 soft 1 hard 1\n1464557447.304231: idx 2 type 1 op 2 soft 0 hard 1\n1464557447.898459: idx 2 type 1 op 2 soft 1 hard 1\n1464557448.410745: idx 2 type 1 op 2 soft 0 hard 1\n^C\n\nThis shows rfkill is intercepting the event and responding properly, but the hard stop is not responding. If you look on the  Toshiba Satellite forumyou will find that this problem is pretty common, and seems to occur every time a new operating system is brought out. The response from Toshiba is always to update to the latest driver so its pretty conclusive the issue is a bug in the Intel Linux driver iwlwifi.\nNext try upgrading to the latest driver using backports. Unfortunately this did not work which means the bug is not fixed yet. In fact it is bug  1538289\nSo you need to report the bug. ubuntu-bug iwlwifi Follow the instructions, but instead choose 1538289 rather than opening a new bug.\nOnce you have done the community minded thing and reported the bug, you want your Wi-Fi back. It is reported that removing the BIOS battery, pressing the power button for 30S and the re-inserting the battery will restore the WiFi. You cannot do this as your battery is soldered in.\nYou could unsolder one end of the battery and hold the power switch for 30S. You should only do this if: you own the laptop, it is out of warranty, you have the tools and expertise to unsolder and solder the battery. None of these apply to you.\nA rather lengthy way of switching out of airplane mode is to install Windows 7, update to the latest drivers, switch the WiFi on, remove Windows and reinstall Ubuntu. There is an easier way... \nNow about that bounty\n\nA: It's a long shot, but it sounds like you may be hardware savvy enough to give it a go.  This is a total shot in the dark, but try pulling your wifi card and loading BIOS defaults.  Then boot up.  Hit Fn + F12 (not much should happen).  Then shut down, replace your card, and repeat the same process but see if it comes back after booting back up again.\nNow, this part is for the hardware timid because I don't know how comfortable you are with hardware.  If you know your stuff, then just skip this part.  \nTo remove the wifi card, start by pulling your battery and see if you can pull the screws off any cover plates.  Toshiba laptops are hit or miss as to whether you can get to the wireless card.  If you find it under one of the user access panels under the laptop, pay attention to which wire is plugged in where and touch something metal on the laptop like a video port to ground yourself from ESD.  Detatch the wifi antenna cables from the card, then unscrew the card and carefully remove it by lifting up and pulling the card out of the socket.  Wifi card removed.  Now follow the directions above.\nTo replace, just follow the exact opposite of the last paragraph, but remember to remove the battery and discharge any electrostatic buildup on a solid metal piece before touching anything electronic.  Then replace card and re-attach antenna cables exactly like they were before you removed them.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Do any of the other Fn Key combinations work in linux ? It seems like your laptop has a software controlled rfkill and is unable to activate it . This could be that the driver isn't fully supported or you have been unlucky that it has regressed.\nHave you tried doing that key combination whilst in the BIOS setup page ?\nThis should allow the switch to be flipped to on then you can leave it on until you can get the soft switch working in linux.\nThere is an outside chance that your wireless card has some dodgy firmware on it that is causing problems , if you can boot another os or maybe an earlier ubuntu livecd it should put different firmware in that might fix it or at least allow you leave the wifi killswitch on\n\nA: Well this is same problem that i faced by me long time ago while using my dell laptop. The solution to the question is very simple. There must be an 'Fn' key in your keyboard,right next to left 'ctrl' key. Well..just Press 'Fn'+'F2-key' (in my dell laptop it was F2 if if it fails just look for wireless marking on the 'F'keys and try that combination).\n", "Q: What is the exact connection between linux version / kernel and later on to install flash player and other programs?

In general though the version that is available depends more on which version of Ubuntu you are running, than on the particular kernel version.\n\nA: The exact kernel version is pretty irrelevant for most software you install!\nWhat is important is the distribution (Ubuntu) and its release version (e.g. 15.10 = \"Wily Werewolf\"). I haven't seen any application yet which would directly depend on a specific kernel version. All programs depend on other packages, some of them must meet a specific version number, for others it's irrelevant.

You need to go to Ubuntu package search then Search the contents of packages. https://packages.ubuntu.com/\nYou may then need to link files where filenames differ in order to get your executable to work. You may also need to download and compile some third-party stuff not in the Ubuntu repositories.\nUnfortunately this is a common problem with running executable not compiled using the target distribution. Who know what MacGyvering of shared objects were done inside of unity to make an executable. It's most likely different for osx since it is a singular platform with one structure, while Linux is multiple distributions with many different structures. Rather what you have there is an executable which can be executed as a Linux executable, but is missing the correct linkage to be run on any of them.\nWithout sharing your file, you are the person who has to research how to get that particular file to run - and get it to run on different versions of Ubuntu.\nI would like to note - I've had the exact opposite experience to you. Some years back I wrote something on Unity, and while I was expecting problems when I ran it on Ubuntu, it ran without any problems. The issues you're having are more than likely related to a component of your game. Maybe some 3rd party stuff?\nSorry for not being so very helpful, and responding to an old thread.

What would be the benefits of a partition installation vs a persistent USB installation on a 3.0 USB? \nDoes it matter which partition is used (ie: a volume that I shrink to add ubnuntu or an ssd drive added to install ubuntu.)\nWould a persistent USB installation be bootable with a secure boot environment? \n\nA: This heavily depends on what you are planning to do on Ubuntu. \nOption 1: LiveUSB\nI would recommend this for trying Ubuntu, but not for a permanent System, because it will not have a very good performance.\nOption 2: Virtual Machine\nThis may be a good solution, if you want to keep your current OS (Windows?) as main OS and use Ubuntu from time to time for specific tasks.\nOption 3: Complete Installation\nI would recommend this option, if you want to use Ubuntu as your main OS. You can decide for a dual boot configuration, if you want to keep your current OS. Regarding the question, whether to use partitions or two drives: This is also dependent of the hardware you have. Normally installing Ubuntu in a separate partition works fine.

I don't need a total answer but you can just push me in the right direction. Because i like to find stuff out by myself.\n\nA: I've done the same thing with a debian, using ssh.\nFirst of all, you should be sure that your IP is not dynamic (otherwise, look at a service like no-ip). After that, you have to open your ssh port (default, 22 - but I suggest to change it) in your router and you're free to access your ubuntu using ssh\nFor a grafic interface, I usually run a tightvncserver from ssh and then I connect to it with any vnc client\n\nA: What exact kind of access are you looking to get?  Just ftp access to files, or use your computer as if you were there?\nIf the former, then SSH would be your best bet.  Have your modem/router forward the SSH request ports to your computer, and just use sftp user@global.ip.address.here, to get in.\nIf the latter, there are a few different ways to set up a VPN, depending on your network hardware/setup.  First, if you just have a simple modem/router, you'll probably have to set up a server/service for the connection, and have your modem/router forward the ports to that server.  If you have a more intelligent modem/router, then you could configure VPN directly on that device.\nNote that with VPN, you will have to generate keys and certificates to create this link.\n", "Q: Getting 'Permission Denied' when running bundler command I need to install bundler for an application so here's what I'm doing (instructions from the application documentation directly):\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir ~/.gems\n\n*export GEM_HOME=~/.gems\n\n*gem install bundler -v 1.10.3\nAfter doing these three instructions, I run bundler -v and get the following exception:\n-bash: /usr/local/bin/bundle: Permission denied\nIt works fine if I run it as sudo.

(mdad software RAID) I'm well-versed in manually-partitioning for RAID0 or RAID1, but only with BIOS, and I would just give /sda an extra 1MB partition for GRUB.\nWith UEFI installed, however, I am not sure what to do with the ESP partition: just set aside 500MB on /sda or should I RAID0 250MB each on /sda and /sdb?\nEDIT: I am using a 2012 Mac mini, which does not have a hardware RAID card. Your results may vary.\n\nA: No, you do not RAID the ESP across multiple drives. Doing so will result in a failed installation (un-bootable). Just treat the EFI System Partition (ESP) as you would the Reserved BIOS Boot Area partition- create it first on either/any drive in the would-be RAID array, just don't create it on any of the other drives. When the time comes to create the swap and ext4 (or whatever floats your boat), each drive will lose however much space the ESP occupies on that first drive, so in my case I lost 500MB per drive- since RAID partitions must be the same size, if I take 500MB away from / to use for the ESP, I reduce the size of that partition by 500MB, which means that partition's counterparts on other drives also lose 500MB, only difference being the 500MB on the other drives isn't used for anything since the ESP is only on that first drive. I only have one other drive, so that's not bad.\nEDIT: This applies to RAID0 and RAID1.\n\nA: You should definitely not use striping (RAID 0) or any more advanced RAID level (like RAID 5) with the ESP. At first glance, you might think that RAID 1 (mirroring) should be OK; however, if something outside of Linux (like an EFI boot loader) were to write to the partition, that would result in inconsistencies that would cause problems. It'd be hard to rule out the possibility of something like that happening. Thus, I'd be reluctant to use RAID 1 on an ESP. If you want some redundancy, you could create a second ESP on your second disk and manually sync them every now and then -- perhaps even automatically via a cron job or a startup script.\nAll of this assumes Linux software RAID, of course. If you've got a hardware RAID card, the EFI will see the RAIDed drives as a single device, so there's no issue. With a motherboard-based software RAID, you'd need to check to see if the firmware understands the RAID setup.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on Lenovo S440 I'm getting really fed up of my current Windows 10 install on my Lenovo S440 ThinkPad (2.4 GHz processor, 8 Gb RAM, and a 16 Gb SSD swap drive), and would like to install Ubuntu 14.04 as a dual boot, to bring it in line with all my other devices. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this kind of install, or could offer advice on where to start?\n\nA: Did you mean a 160GB SSD drive?  16GB probably won't be big enough for both Windows 10 and Ubuntu.\nIf it is 160GB, then just download and burn the Ubuntu 14.04 iso to a DVD, and tell it to install alongside your Windows 10 OS.\n", "Q: Linux kernel release notes What is the difference between the Kernel versions 3.19.0-37 and 3.19.0-39.

Should I have selected the AMD 64-bit version despite having Intel Windows 7 64-bit?\nSee screenshot:\n\n\nA: The OS shown in VirtualBox Manager is the OS that is chosen when the VM is created.

I want to know the difference between them.\n\nA: It is not that difficult to get to know the difference, though you could easily google it:-) \nSince you are already here I will try to explain the difference.\nThe package manager is the easy way to install tools on ubuntu (or any linux distro), easy because when you try to install a tool it most likely (in most of the case) will need some additional libraries/packages (called dependencies) and there the package manager aid you by helping automatically to collect all dependencies and install them along.\nThe same won't happen with the manual package installation as if the tool has some dependencies, it will likely fail in installation and you will have to provide and install the dependencies 1by1 to satisfy and once you are done you can then install the package you were trying to install.\nSo when you type say: \n   apt-get install foo\n\nApt-get will collect all dependencies and ask you if you want to install them all along by telling that \"foo\" requires \"bar\" and so on.\nDifferently, if you have the package foo.deb and by trying to install manually:\n   dpkg -i foo.deb\n\nIt will fail because it needs also bar.deb (dependency) and so on, so the installation will become complicated.\nOr there is a 3rd way which is installing from source, called self-compiling using the source file.\nHere is some link to help you understand the concept:\n   http://askubuntu.com/questions/309113/what-is-the-difference-between-dpkg-and-aptitude-apt-get\n\n\nA: their the same as far as i know, the console version is just a faster way for people to tell you how to install it without having you search for and then download(probably the wrong version) a program.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu start up with the PXE rom?

The only way to install ubuntu server as a guest without internet is using VNC. Using VNC there is no need to remove network interface, it just automatically detect that the internet isn't available and skip the requirement to have mirror site available. I have tested is on ubuntu servers 14,15 and 16.\n\nA: The syntax of your virt-install command is incorrect for a no-network installation.\nthe --location argument requires a network connection for your guest.\nThe -c or --cdrom= argument needs to be used to specify the iso file name.\nI did the no-network test case, but using the a recent 16.04 64 bit server edition daily iso file.

It's hanging when loading a static class related to X11, which handles graphics. You can also tell this because it's part of the AWT API, which is part of the Java SE graphics libraries.\nTo properly debug this, you could create a Java core dump, or use a JDK tool like jstack to dump out all the threads.

I have been trying for about two days now to use the grub menu and have looked up many answers which have not worked. \nOne of the answers I found was to update the grub2 menu to include my usb listed in the boot menu. However, upon selecting my usb from the menu, after pressing Enter, it says Invalid EFI file path. I looked on the USB to see what files were present and I found a folder called \"EFI\". Inside is another folder called \"BOOT\". Inside of the boot folder, are two EFI files. \nI've previously tried using the code mentioned on many of the threads I've read that say:\ngrub> set root='(hd1,1)'\ngrub> chainloader +1\ngrub> boot\n\nI have also used the 'ls' to find which drives are available and have tried each drive.

I know that many others can benefit from a GOOD advice since I have seen many others who can't boot from a usb from Grub2. \nVery Best ~ Nya\n\nA: The numbers that come after --set=root can be found if you plug in your USB containing the Windows OS, open terminal, and run blkid. You'll then see the name of your USB device, along with its universally unique identifier (UUID).\nNext, explore your USB files and find where your EFI image is; it is most likely in the directory in the code that you already posted. Keep note of where it is because you'll need it.\nThen, boot into the Grub command and type the following:\ninsmod part_gpt\ninsmod fat\ninsmod search_fs_uuid\ninsmod chain\nsearch --fs-uuid --set=root (insert your uuid here)\nchainloader /your/efi/boot/file\nboot\n\nI hope I've helped.

It is exactly the same case as when you run the same script on different Terminals.\nThe script works on both.\nIf you don't want this to be the case, then create some conditions in the script so that it waits for the last one to finish.\nAnd as Alex's comment suggest, you can easily test this by having an infinite loop in a script which gets executed by a cron job.\n\nA: cron does not care how many scripts, same or not, you are running. It will just start the task at scheduled time.\nSo if you are good with running a script second time while the first one is running, there is no problem.\nAlthough it depends on the script but usually unless necessary most of time it might create unusual results due to race conditions created by running multiple instances of the same script simultaneously. To avoid that there are multiple mechanisms that ensure that only one instance of a script is running.\nThe main point is, if you are good with it, cron won't complain.\n", "Q: NTFS partition for all my files? (Windows and Ubuntu) I'm going to shrink my Windows partition to install Ubuntu, and I was wondering how many partitions I should make if I wanted to share files between both OSes. Can I share all my Ubuntu and Windows files with each other? By files I mean documents, multimedia (music, photos, videos, etc.)\nMy plan is to make the following partitions for Ubuntu:\n/swap [size: 4-6 GB]\n/ (root) [size: 20 GB]\n/media/myname [size: ?]\nThe \"/media/myname\" partition is where I'd store all my files for both Windows and Ubuntu, but I don't know if that would work. Please, let me know. Thanks\n\nA: Both Windows and Linux are capable of reading NTFS, so yes, you can create a multimedia NTFS partition to share your files (though not applications such as media players, which are compiled for a specific OS). You can create /home as a separated partition from /, and an additional partition for shared files, or share everything under /home (must be NTFS then). Personally I'd create:\n/swap 2GB\n/ 20GB, ext4\n/home [enough for your Linux-exclusive stuff], ext4\n/shared [enough for your shared data], NTFS\n\nIf you swapped more than 2GB to disk your system will already be crawling to a halt, no point on having 4-6GB swap nowadays.\n\nA: Yes this works. I have systems here, which are configured this way.\nI made the experience that ubuntu isn't as picky on filesystems than windows, so ntfs is a good option to work with both Systems.\nMaybe this side helps you too: https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Partitionierung\n\nA: You don't really need to have an extra partition to swap between Windows and Linux. You'll see the Windows disk space under Linux, so just linking it up will do.\nThe very minimum you need is just a single partition for all the Linux stuff. But apart from the root partition (mounted as /) you can also go for:\n\n\n*\n\n*swap - You know this one already and I don't feel competent to advise on the size.\n\n*/home - This one keeps user personal data and can be encrypted. It's a good idea to keep this one as a separate partition. It's like Users in Windows. You can link together directories like Documents or Pictures from both Windows and Linux. This way, as long as you store your stuff in the places where Linux points at the common directories, you'll see them in Windows. I'm not sure if Linux could mount an NTFS partition as /home, which could be another option. This might involve linking it on the other side with corresponding Windows directories under Windows, which I guess should be possible, but I don't know Windows well enough.\n\n*Other advanced fragmentation like separating the /usr. But if you're a beginner, you're not going to need it soon.\n", "Q: airodump-ng mon0 not woking with eth2 interface I am new to ubuntu os.I have installed aircrack successfully and trying to execute the  command  sudo airodump-ng mon0 but its not working.How to fix this issue ?\nError:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo airmon-ng start waln0\n\n\nFound 4 processes that could cause trouble.\nIf airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after\na short period of time, you may want to kill (some of) them!\n-e \nPID Name\n1382    avahi-daemon\n1383    avahi-daemon\n1433    NetworkManager\n14727   wpa_supplicant\n\n\nInterface   Chipset     Driver\n\neth2        Unknown         wl\n\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo airodump-ng mon0\nInterface mon0: \nioctl(SIOCGIFINDEX) failed: No such device\n\nalso tried with eth2 interface but no luck!\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo airmon-ng start eth2\n\niwconfig\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ iwconfig\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\neth2      IEEE 802.11  Access Point: Not-Associated   \n          Link Quality:5  Signal level:0  Noise level:0\n          Rx invalid nwid:0  invalid crypt:0  invalid misc:0\n\nppp0      no wireless extensions.\n\n\nA: The system is telling you exactly what the problem is:\nFound 4 processes that could cause trouble.\nIf airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after\na short period of time, you may want to kill (some of) them!\n\nPID Name\n1382    avahi-daemon\n1383    avahi-daemon\n1433    NetworkManager\n14727   wpa_supplicant\n\nYou want to kill all of the above processes (by using kill <PID> as a superuser).\nAfter that, everything else should work just as expected.\n", "Q: Issues with Autopilot on 14.04.3 I'm following the steps from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-openstack-with-autopilot for autopilot install.

I'm playing around with PDF documents. I have problems with rotation of pages using default document browser Evince document viewer.\nI got two files:\nFirst 'original.pdf' file with wrongly rotated pages.\nSecond. 'modified.pdf' file with pages rotation corrected by me.\nI deleted orginal.pdf and renamed modified.pdf -> original.pdf.\nBefore I renamed modified.pdf ,page rotation was good. When I renamed it to original.pdf pages are being rotated wrongly. All this thing for the same file I'm only renaming it. I can cancel 'wrong rotation' by renaming 'original.pdf' to any other name. Quite strange... Of course if I open the original.pdf file with another browser pages are rotated properly.\nMy guess is that Evince document viewer remember rotation setting from time when I was playing with original.pdf file and is applying this rotation rules to any file named orignal.pdf even if I delete the file and rename another file to original.pdf. Sth like rule rotate pages in orignal.pdf always by 90 degree clockwise`.\nIs my guess about this rotation is good? Is there a way to delete this history of rotation or deactivate it completely? I would like to see always files as they are, keep it real.\nThank you in advance for help! \n\nA: Congrats on starting your adventure with Ubuntu. You'll be hooked in no time! My answer uses shell commands, which on a *nix OS is a good thing to become familiar with. You can access the shell by pressing the key combination CtrlAltT. The shell/terminal will pop up; then you can cd to the file location, e.g. if it's in your Documents directory, type cd ~/Documents. You can type ls to make sure your pdf is there.\nYou are correct, this is very typical of a document viewer to make the rotation a display property. In order to truly rotate the pdf, try using \npdftk temp.pdf cat 1-endR output tempR.pdf\n\nwhich means, given a file temp.pdf, rotate 90° pages 1 to the end of the document and write out to the file tempR.pdf.\nFor details, see man pdftk and search for rotation, e.g.:\n The page rotation setting can cause pdftk to rotate pages and\n documents.  Each option sets the page rotation as follows (in\n degrees): north: 0, east: 90, south: 180, west: 270, left:\n -90, right: +90, down: +180. left, right, and down make\n relative adjustments to a page's rotation.\n\n", "Q: How can I make a shortcut to raise an application's window if it exists? I constantly switch between Sublime Text, Terminal and Chrome. I'd like to bind shortcut like \"Alt + 1\" so my current Terminal and current Google Chrome opens. \nRight now, each time i launch Google Chrome or the terminal, it opens a new window. Any idea ?\nThanks !\n\nA: The method in drizzle's answer will work, but has a few downsides \n\n\n*\n\n*It has a delay; when pushing the Super key, you'd have to wait about a second to make the numbers appear.\n\n*The order of the items in the launcher might be changing, depending on the applications you run. The number of Chrome might be different then.\n\nAlternative option\nYou could simply do with the command:\nwmctrl -a chrome\n\nwhich will raise the first found window with \"chrome\" in its name. That would however also raise the window I am writing in now (a firefox window, named: \"Shortcut to open current Google Chrome...\")\nThe use of the window's pid will prevent this. In my opinion, it is therefore more elegant to put the command:\nwmctrl -ia \"$(wmctrl -lp | grep \"$(pgrep chrome)\" | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }')\"\n\nunder a shortcut key (Alt+1 will work), given the fact that you'd need to have wmctrl installed then:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nHow to add the command to a shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*Install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*create a small script (open an empty file, paste the script below in it)\n#!/bin/bash\nwmctrl -ia \"$(wmctrl -lp | grep \"$(pgrep chrome)\" | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }')\"\n\nSave it as raise_chrome.sh\n\n*Add the script to a shortcut; choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\n/bin/bash /path/to/raise_chrome.sh\n\nto (e.g.) the shortcut Alt+1.\nN.B. Use an absolute path, not e.g. ~\nExplanation\nThe command is in fact a \"conversion\" of this one, and the explanation is similar:\nIn the section:\n\"$(wmctrl -lp | grep \"$(pgrep chrome)\" | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }')\"\n\nthe command:\nwmctrl -lp\n\nlists all windows, including their pid and window- id. The result is piped to \ngrep \"$(pgrep chrome)\"\n\nwhich filters (lists) all occurrences of Chrome windows.\nThen,\ntail -1\n\nwill give us the last item in the list, which is the latest created window (since wmctrl lists windows chronologically). \nawk '{ print $1 }'\n\nfinally, will give us the first string in the line (from the output of wmctrl), which is the window- id.\nThe command:\nwmctrl -ia <window_id>\n\nWill then raise the last created window of Chrome\nNote\nNo need to say that you can replace chrome in the command by any other application (process name), and place them under separate key combinations.\n\nEDIT\nuse the application as an argument\nSince you mention  Sublime Text, Terminal and Chrome, you might want to use multiple shortcuts, and run the script with the application as an argument. \nTo do so\nUse the script with slight difference:\n#!/bin/bash\napp=$1\nwmctrl -ia \"$(wmctrl -lp | grep \"$(pgrep \"$app\")\" | tail -1 | awk '{ print $1 }')\"\n\nand run it subsequently with the commands under the shortcut keys:\nsh /home/jacob/Bureaublad/raise.sh sublime_text\nsh /home/jacob/Bureaublad/raise.sh gnome-terminal\n\nand \nsh /home/jacob/Bureaublad/raise.sh chrome\n\n\nA: You could use alt-tab to switch quickly between the programs.\nYou can also use the Super button (aka Windows button) like this: Super+number. eg. Super+3 will open the third app in your app launcher. To quickly identify the numbers associated with the apps, press and hold the super button.\n", "Q: How can I disable and enable SSL in Apache (without a command if possible)?

I just got 6 more machines - HP DL580 G7s.  I rebuilt the cluster from scratch, and MAAS sees the new machines, and can commission them.  They show the correct number of cores, memory and disk, and show \"ready\".  The original Dell systems come on line and work just fine, and are allocated to, and provisioned by, juju.\nI tried allocating them in juju, MAAS started them, allocated them, marked them deploying, and then deployed, but in juju they never showed as other then pending.\nI remove-machined them in juju, but they were not released, so I forced them and released them in MAAS.  I tried to debug their hooks, to see what was going on, and I tried reallocating them in juju, even using add-machine and add unit --to, but they never were allocated again.  I was able to turn them on and off from MAAS for a while (this stopped).  I can still allocate, deploy and release them, get MAAS to commission them again and check their power status.\nWhat MAAS won't do is let me turn them on.  MAAS will let me re-commission them, and it cycles through, turning them on, running the scripts and shutting them down, as often as I want.  I can acquire, deploy them and release them, through MAAS.\nBut when I select any one or more to turn on, MAAS says \"1 node cannot be powered on. To proceed, update your selection.\"\nI can power them on using their iLO (IPMI) web interface, and when I do, I can shut them off with MAAS.  But, no joy on starting any of them through maas, or getting juju to put services on them.\nDoes anyone have any ideas on what might be the issue, what I can do to debug the problem, or want me to add log info from MAAS or juju?

I don't think it is answered, but it works.\nI'm not looking this gift horse in the mouth, but I remain perplexed.\n\nA: Off hand, I'd guess this is mostly an HP issue since the Dell stuff works fine.\nI'd suggest first seeing if there are firmware updates for your hardware.  There tends to be quite a few bugs in HP's iLO IPMI implementations though usually their power interfaces seem reliable.\nSecond, logs are in \n/var/log/maas\n\nThere's a lot of information in there for debugging.  \nLast, you can try some of this stuff manually.  Maas uses ipmi_chassis_config tool to boot machines.  You can try executing that directly from your machine. Docs are available in man pages or here: \nhttp://linux.die.net/man/8/ipmi-chassis-config\nSee /etc/maas/templates/power/ for some of the options on this.  Also check the versions of the ipmi tools on your machine and look for bug reports on that.\n\nA: I have been having other problems with HP not deploying. One of the things I can across which may help you was that the firmware of the ilo4 will not work with the latest which I think is 2.30. If you back rev it to 2.22 it might solve your issue.\n\nA: This sounds like a bug in MAAS, or in the iLO driver for MAAS.

I do not face any freezing problem with Windows 7, it runs smoothly. \nWhereas sometime in random interval I face freezing problem with Ubuntu. At this moment mouse key boards does not work. This problem persist even after upgrading BIOS.\nI have tried existing solution with no luck. Please let me know what all  other information is required to understand this problem.\n\nA: First check your laptop specification. Basically there is much trouble with some hardware for you kernel. and also the performance of your integrated graphic. \nIn case someone else finds this, a kernel upgrade fixed a similar problem.\nI had Ubuntu 14.04.2 kernel version 3.16.0-30, and doing a \"apt -y upgrade\" ended me up at kernel 3.16.0-49, and that solved the problem. \n", "Q: Save as MIDI when playing from VMPK & QSynth I have set up VMPK and QSynth along with JACK. It works and I can hear the tunes.\nBut what I want is to have the played tunes saved automatically as a MIDI file.\nI found this question here: MIDI to VMPK to QSynth\nThere is an answer to that question which shows how to save as WAV file. That did not work for me. The file is created but seems an empty file.\nCan anyone suggest me how to save MIDI and/or WAV from either VMPK or QSynth. Thank you.\n\nA: arecordmidi\nFirst I got vmpk working with fluidsynth on the CLI or qsynth through ALSA as shown at: Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard setup\nNow, after doing that setup to hear the keyboard presses, I also run the following on another terminal:\narecordmidi --port 129:0 out.mid\n\nwhere 129:0 is the vmpk output port found with aconnect -l just as was used for the fluidsynth setup on the other linked answer.\nOnce arecordmidi starts running, it immediately starts recording vmpk MIDI input to out.mid, until I do Ctrl+C to kill it. I can still hear the sounds at the same time from fluidsynth as before to know what I'm playing.\nLMMS\nLMMS was so incredibly easy to use for this purpose! After one hour of playing with I was able to record VMPK input through any of the synthesizer plugins it has (including e.g. ZynAddSubFX), and it can also record live while looping the other instruments!\nAll you have to to is launch vmpk, then on an instrument track (ZynAddSubFX in my case) I go:\n\n*\n\n*gear symbol\n\n*MIDI\n\n*input\n\n*VMPK\n\nThis is also shown at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpeP2th08ak\nNow I can already hear the Zyn sound coming from VMPK.\nThen to record, there are two cryptic looking record buttons next to play on the corresponding Piano-Roll view:\n\nThe right one allows you to hear other instruments at the same time as you record your track.\nThen there is a File > Export MIDI menu if you really want the MIDI.\nBut then I made the incredible discovery that LMMS also has its own virtual MIDI keyboard, with the default traditional ZSXDC bindings, so there isn't much point in using VMPK with it I think. When you click on the instrument, a keyboard for that instrument opens up, and then ZSXDC now play that instrument:\n\nThe only thing I could not find was how to change octaves with a keyboard shortcut as I can in VMPK, I could only move it by changing that small white square on top of the keyboard (the \"base note\"?) with my mouse: https://www.lmms.io/forum/viewtopic.php?p=63072\nArdour 5\nThis is another method I almost got working. And it is likely to be a much more realistic use case, as it allows you to play back the backing track while recording, and see live where your MIDI notes are landing.\nFirst you have to get VMPK to feed into Ardour 5. As mentioned at: https://discourse.ardour.org/t/vmpk-not-showing-in-midi-routing-grid/103387 Ardour 6 will have its own built-in keyboard so that won't be needed anymore. But on 5 you need to do the following.\nSet MIDI System to \"ALSA sequencer\" instead of the default \"ALSA Raw devices\". This can be done on a running project under:\n\n*\n\n*Window\n\n*Audio/MIDI setup\n\nor when starting to run a new session.\n\"Audio System\" should also be set to ALSA of course as that is what we are using.\n\nOnce that is done:\n\n*\n\n*create a new MIDI track in ardour\n\n*start running vmpk\n\nand then go under:\n\n*\n\n*Window\n\n*MIDI Connection\n\nyou will see something like:\n\nThe key thing is that there is a \"Hardware\" tab. This is vmpk!\nSo now, you just have to click on the area where there is a green dot on the screenshot to create that connection (the dot is not present when you first open the window).\nOnce that is done, I can now hear and see soundwaves moving on Ardour when I touch vmpk keys!\nSo then just start recording in Ardour as you would for any other audio:\n\n*\n\n*hit record symbol on the MIDI track we created and where we will record to\n\n*hit round red recording symbol on top (shift + r)\n\n*start playing (space)\n\nand as it plays, it will record vmpk keys and show them live in ardour, something like this:\n\nso you se that my random notes were registered!\nNow the only thing I haven't managed is to export the MIDI track! Not that it matters much I guess, since once inside Ardour, we generally have more desirable output options like .ogg, but still.\nTested on Ubuntu 20.04, I can't believe I'm wasting my life doing this stuff! :-)\n", "Q: What controls the device name in /proc/mounts? In /proc/mounts, my system used to show /dev/mapper/sda2_crypt as /. After used for some days, including kernel and software upgrading, the line changed to /dev/dm-0 as /. What happened? I booted into the old kernel and it was still /dev/dm-0.\n\nA: It's normal when you are using a multipath device.  Each multipath device has a World Wide Identifier (WWID), which is guaranteed to be globally unique and unchanging. By default, the name of a multipath device is set to its WWID. Alternately, you can set the user_friendly_names option in the multipath configuration file, which causes DM-Multipath to use a node-unique alias of the form mpathn as the name. For example, a node with two HBAs attached to a storage controller with two ports via a single unzoned FC switch sees four devices: /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, and /dev/sdd. \nDM-Multipath creates a single device with a unique WWID that reroutes I/O to those four underlying devices according to the multipath configuration. When the user_friendly_names configuration option is set to yes in /etc/multipath.conf, the name of the multipath device is set to mpathn. When new devices are brought under the control of DM-Multipath, the new devices may be seen in two different places under the /dev directory: /dev/mapper/mpathn and /dev/dm-n.\n\n\n*\n\n*The devices in /dev/mapper are created early in the boot process.\nUse these devices to access the multipathed devices, for example when\ncreating logical volumes.\n\n*Any devices of the form /dev/dm-n are for internal use only and\nshould never be used.\n\n\nYou can also set the name of a multipath device to a name of your choosing by using the alias option in the multipaths section of the multipath configuration file.\nFor more information see this The DM-Multipath Configuration File\n", "Q: Can't boot to Ubuntu directly I use a HP Pavilion machine with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 in dual boot.

Cron can never enter your sudo password.\n\nA: I notice you use sh to invoke the cronjob however sh is a subset of bash and might not be able to execute your cronjob. Also running the task manually is not necessarily the same as running it by cron. Please change sh to bash in the cronjob and see what happens.\nThe errormessage about MTA that you see in the logfile means you have no Mail Transfer Agent installed, meaning you don't have software installed to send mail messages.

Do you know any possible solution to resolve this problem.\nI heard that it has something to do with intel_pstate driver.\n\nA: The CPU does that by itself to save power. It's normal behaviour for any laptop running any OS. Take a look in BIOS and see if you can find something like \"CPU Power saving\" or something like that. It should do the trick.\n\nA: Your problem is a combination of: A known BIOS problem with that Dell LapTop, resulting in clock modulation being enabled when you resume from sleep; A fundamental incompatibility between the current version of the intel_pstate CPU frequency driver and clock modulation. The result is that the requested CPU pstate will always be the minimum, regardless of CPU load. The actual resulting CPU frequency will be a little variable within that pstate * the clock modulation value.\nTo fix the problem you can turn off clock modulation. To more or less workaround the problem you can disable the intel_pstate driver and use the acpi-cpufreq CPU frequency driver instead.\nPlease see here and here for more details.\n", "Q: Copy files over network while creating these files My Situation: I want to copy a file from one PC to another. Unfortunately this file isn't complete. There is a process appending data to this file (only at the end).\nIs there a way to easily copy this file without having to start from the beginning each time the copy-tool thinks, it finished?\nIs there for example any possibility to tell tools like scp/rsync/whatever to wait for example 20 seconds after finishing a download - and if the file changes, just download this extra bit of data?\nOr is there maybe a way to let the download start with byte X?\nDoes anyone know a solution? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: The best way would have been to have the process that is creating the file also create the remote file at the same time. Either by writing directly to the remote location or by using something like tee to both pipe data to, for example, an ssh connection and to a local file. That should have been done when you started the process though. \nSince the file is already being created, yes, you can use rsync for it. By default, rsync only copies the updated data so if you just run rsync every few minutes, you will get what you want. You could use a brute force approach:\nwhile :; do rsync -u source destination; sleep 20; done\n\nThat will run in an endless loop, copying source to destination only if source is different. Once the process that is creating the file has finished, you can stop it with Ctrl+C.\nA more elegant way would be to monitor the file. If it is being created on machineA and copied to machineB, you could do this from machineB (this assumes you have passwordless ssh set up):\nwhile [[ $(ssh machineA md5sum < /path/to/file) != $(md5sum < /path/to/file) ]] do \n    rsync -uv aa b\n    sleep 20\ndone\n\nNote that this will stop the first time the two files are the same. If you file creation process doesn't write for more than 20 seconds and then resumes, you will have to copy again manually. \n\nA: You might look into using incron for your rsync to run when file changes, i.e. IN_MODIFY, if this is a long term file sync you need.\nhttp://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2014/158/Monitoring-with-incron\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-inotify-examples-to-replicate-directories/\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/intrepid/man5/incrontab.5.html\nIf it's short term, terdon's last while loop may be quicker to setup.\n", "Q: Partitions on Ubuntu 14.04.2 How can I expand the Boot partition on Ubuntu 14.04.2 as it keeps telling me I have very little space left on that partition and I don't want to uninstall any files as I don't know what is necessary and what isn't?\n\nA: You probably have loads of old kernels installed. You can remove some of them as follows:\nFirst check your current kernel (you definitely do not want to remove that one)\nuname -r\n\nThen check which are installed with:\nsudo dpkg --list 'linux-image*' | grep ^ii\n\nAnd to remove an old kernel:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-OLDVERSION\n\nReplace OLDVERSION with the version of the old kernel you want to remove\nAfterwards update grub with:\nsudo update-grub\n\n(Updating grub is not strictly necessary since it should run automatically after you uninstall an old kernel, but it does no harm)\n", "Q: How to make my system delete all the files in a certain directory older than a certain time while keeping the directory structure intact? I have a directory on my machine, think of it as my own sort of tmp directory, but it's in my ~ directory. And I want to make it so that my system every 3 hours deletes all the files in (though keeping any directory structure intact, but still deleting all the files in all the levels of the directories recursively) that directory which are older than a day.\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, can this be done? And if so, how? I would like this to be fully automated with no users interaction needed. This should be something automatically started when I login, so I shouldn't need to run something on every startup.\n\nA: You should be able to delete all files older than 1 day in /home/username/directory and all directories below it with:\nfind /home/username/directory -type f -mtime +1 -delete\n\nAnd to schedule that command every three hours set it as a cron job:\ncrontab -e\n\nThen inside the crontab:\n0 */3 * * * find /home/username/directory -type f -mtime +1 -delete\n\nWhich runs your command every three hours on the hour (i.e. minute 0), so 3:00 am, 6:00am etc.\nGo the the cron and crontab manpages for more information on them.\n\nA: Using find:\nfind ~/tmp -type f -mtime +0 -delete\n\n\n\n*\n\n*~/tmp is the directory to be searched recursively, change this accordingly\n\n*-type f will look for only files\n\n*-mtime +0 which will match a file if it was last modified one day or more ago\n\n*-delete will just remove the matched file(s)\nHere the catch is -mtime +0, most might think of using -mtime +1 but find will ignore any fractional time while calculating days. So, -mtime +1 will match a file if the last modification was made at least 2 days ago.\nQuoting man find, -mtime has the same timing convention as -atime:\n\n-atime n\nFile was last accessed n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out how \n  many 24-hour periods ago the file was  last  accessed,  any\n            fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to have been accessed at least two days ago.\n\nAlso note that if you want precision, you should look at the -mmin option of find to indicate time in minutes.\nTo run it periodically after 3 hours, you can add a cron entry.\nRun crontab -e and add:\n00 */3 * * * /usr/bin/find ~/tmp -type f -mtime +0 -delete\n\n\nUsing zsh to remove the files:\nrm ~/tmp/**/*(.-m+0)\n\nAdding to cron:\n00 */3 * * * /usr/bin/zsh -c 'rm ~/tmp/**/*(.-m+0)'\n\n", "Q: Server should be SSL-aware but has no certificate configured [Hint: SSLCertificateFile] ((null):0) I've just started using letsencrypt on my server and it was running fine until I somehow massed it up.

I skipped around the steps in the installer, though I did auto-configure DHCP...\nAs far as I can tell, \"enp1s0f0\" seems to correspond to virtual machines, on CentOS/Red Hat, and I'm not sure why it's this instead of eth0...\nI have tried renaming it to eth0 (fwiw), but a reboot wiped that out. I also tried adding auto-config code to /etc/network/interfaces, but no luck with that, either.\nEDIT: Here's the interfaces file, more or less:\n\"# The loopback...\"  \nauto lo  \niface inet loopback\n\"# eth0\"  \nauto enp1s0f0  \niface enp1s0f0 inet dhcp\nAlso, I unplugged the Ethernet and plugged it into a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, which Ubuntu recognizes, still no Internet... Plugged it back into internal Ethernet port, now Internet works. I don't know why. I'd still like to know about the enp1s0f0 interface, why it's not \"en0\" and how it's different.\n\nA: As Thomas W mentioned, the naming scheme (enp1s0f0) replaced the old one (en0) in 15.10 and it is not indicative of any issues. \nI wish I knew exactly what I did to get an IP address (and therefore on the Internet), but I make those edits to the interfaces file (the part for \"en0\"), rebooted (still no luck), plugged in a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter (still no luck), plugged the ethernet cable back into the internal Ethernet port, had internet.\n", "Q: Need to press f12 for selecting os every time i boot Hi i have two Operating Systems installed,both on different hard disks .One is ubntu 14.04 and other one is windows 10.

Save the changes.\nThis should automatically make your system boot into Ubuntu. Before starting Ubuntu, it might show you the option to start Windows as well (usually the last option).

Is it possible to change the default behavior?\n\nA: If you hold the shift and control button while dragging your file to a new location you will get a link. (You'll see a little chain symbol) Basically if you drag to a different folder then it creates a link with the exact same name as the original file, but if you create a link in the same directory then it appends 'Link to' in front of the file name.

I have recently noticed that when downloading something with Firefox, if I select the option \"Open with xxx\" instead of just the \"Save file\" option, the file is then downloaded to /tmp and opened with whatever program I have selected:\n\nHowever I would like for this to change, so how can I make it so that the \"Open with xxx\" also downloads the file to my ~/Downloads folder (as well as opening it then of course with whatever I have selected, everything should be the same as before except for the download location)?\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18 and Firefox 42.\n\nA: You can do this by creating a script to run firefox and change an advanced setting inside firefox.\nFirst the script:\n#!/bin/bash\ntmp_folder='/home/your_user_name/Downloads/firefox'\nexport TMP=$tmp_folder\nexport TEMP=$tmp_folder\nmkdir $tmp_folder\nfirefox\n\nThis will create a special directory inside Downloads called firefox where all tmp downloads will go\nNow inside firefox open the advanced settings by typing about:config in a window. Search for a boolean or create a new one called browser.helperApps.deleteTempFileOnExit and set it to false\nNow when you run firefox using your script you get the desired results, i.e. all opened files are saved inside Downloads/firefox and will not be deleted. You can change the directory to Downloads of course as well.\n\nA: This task is better done by some kind of firefox add-on. Below is a (really bad) hack that works.

To get it, simply run:\nsudo apt-get install samba\n\nThen, you will have to set up shares for your network. You will want to edit the file located at:\n/etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nAnd add in a share entry. For example, if you wanted to share the folder /home/your_user/share, the bottom of your smb.conf should look like this:\n[Share]\ncomment = Shared\npath = \"/home/your_user/share\"\nwriteable = yes\nguest ok = yes\ncreate mask = 0644\ndirectory mask = 0755\nforce user = your_user\n\nTo share that folder in a way that Windows can easily create and manage files within it.  Now, on Windows, if you browse your Network, you should see an entry with your Ubuntu server's hostname. You can open that, and all of your Samba shares will show up.\nTo make it easier to access, you can Map Network Drive on your Windows machines.

This worked fine till some weeks ago. Now the contacts get still normally listed in my address book BUT if I search a contact this contact is shown more times. The number of the same contact that I see correspond to the number of executions of this:\nsyncevolution --import /path/to/file/allcontacts.vcf backend=evolution-contacts\nSo I think that I do not delete my old contacts properly before I import them again.

Or is there something comparable in Ubuntu?\nAppreciate the help.\n\nA: \n...so how do I explain to my security auditor, \"I know it's not the\n  latest version but it's not vulnerable because a third party\n  supposedly fixed the vulnerability in a maintenance release that is\n  dated prior to when the vulnerability was originally reported.\" ?\n\nThat's about right, as far as the explanation goes. If it doesn't make sense to you or security auditors, I am sorry, but that is the way most Linux distros (Debian, *buntus, RHEL, CentOS) have been working for years. I rather doubt it's going to change soon, so, may be Ubuntu is just not for you, and you should look at something like Arch Linux, Debian unstable, or other OSs.\nPS: You can check what's been fixed in a package in Ubuntu with the following:\napt-get changelog pkgname\n\nFor example, apt-get changelog openssh-server looks like this:\n\nopenssh (1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.3) trusty-security; urgency=medium\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*SECURITY REGRESSION: random auth failures because of uninitialized\n  struct field (LP: #1485719)\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*debian/patches/CVE-2015-5600-2.patch:\n  \n  \n  -- Marc Deslauriers   Mon, 17 Aug 2015\n  21:52:52 -0 400\nopenssh (1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.2) trusty-security; urgency=medium\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*SECURITY UPDATE: possible user impersonation via PAM support\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*debian/patches/pam-security-1.patch: don't resend username to PAM in\n  monitor.c, monitor_wrap.c.\n  \n*CVE number pending   * SECURITY UPDATE: use-after-free in PAM support\n  \n*debian/patches/pam-security-2.patch: fix use after free in monitor.c.\n  \n*CVE number pending\n  \n  \n  \n  ...\n\n\nA: Your mirror in sources.list may not have updated in a timely manner.

I wonder if Ubuntu dev's do read this, but here is the thing.. I heard that Fedora Server gets an official GUI for server to use. I mean the Ubuntu community is most advanced.\nHas Unity GUI invented \nHas Mobile OS and TV interface made.\nDon't you guys think that it is time to make GUI for Ubuntu server? Perhaps in the next release, which is on LTS side is in 2019... How to imagine it? \nLook at QNAP, Asustor, sinology, they all use open source Linux and we in the Ubuntu community don't have an equivalent? If I controlled Linux development across the board, I would ask them to make a version of their OS's available to the public. You might say, use Amahi or something similar.. Well I can't because, my ISP is relaying all their other services on my fibre connection. Which means I  can't make these options work simply because I don't have DHCP access on my network, or shall I say full control of it. Don't judge my ISP they are nice guys, it's just they want their services to work uninterrupted and I see the reason why.. If say I mess up somewhere I couldn't call ambulance, police, or fire fighters in case of emergency... I don't want to become hostage of my home server's mood, if you know what I mean. I want things to  work somewhat independent...  I am sure people will understand me in a way...\n\nA: The reason that Ubuntu Server runs without a GUI, is because an Ubuntu server is likely to run headless (no monitor, no keyboard, no mouse).  The advantage, is that this keeps hardware requirements lower.  Besides, administrating tasks such as a file server/e-mail server/firewall/etc. isn't going to require a GUI.\nIf, however, you really want a server that runs with a GUI, then you can follow this guide:\nhttp://www.htpcbeginner.com/install-gui-on-ubuntu-server-14-04-gnome/\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu making an interface as default network interface I am running an Ubuntu laptop which is connected to WiFi and is capable of accessing internet. There is my old desktop machine which do not have the WiFi card. So I connected my laptop to WiFi and configured a proxy server on this machine and connected the desktop and laptop via LAN wire.\nNow desktop is set to use the proxy server on the laptop machine. Problem is that laptop considers the eth0 interface as default interface and wlan interface as secondary interface. So when I connect the LAN to laptop, it cannot access internet using the wlan interface but it tries to connect over the eth0 interface( I think). how to assign the wlan2 as my primary interface. I am not asking how to share connection but how to change default connection\n\nA: Read man ip-route, and do:  \n# show current routes\nip route | tee routes.saved\n\n# delete old default route (YMMV, check output above)\nsudo ip route del default dev eth0\n# add the new default route\nROUTER_IP=\"the IP address of your router\"\nsudo ip route add default dev wlan2 via $ROUTER_IP\n\n# show new routes\nip route | tee routes.new\n\nAs you have probably noticed, if you do not have a default route defined (and pointing to a co-operative next-hop), almost all TCP/IP packets go nowhere.\n", "Q: Byobu automatically open windows on boot I really enjoy using byobu and the launch at login feature. I'm trying to figure out the best way to have a byobu session automatically launch on system boot, with several windows running different commands, and have it continue to automatically open that session when I SSH into the box.\nI've found ways to do each thing individually, I'm just wondering if there's a nice way to get all of these things working together?\n\nA: Example from https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/526275/start-python-script-in-byobu-session-at-startup\nbyobu list-sessions | grep my-app || byobu new-session -d -s my-app\nbyobu list-windows -t my-app | grep start-script || byobu new-window -t my-app -n 'start-script'\nbyobu send-keys -t my-app:start-script \"anything needed to start your app\"\n\n", "Q: Yet another question about turning off auto-maximize How does one disable the auto-maximize when one drags a window to the top of the screen in Ubuntu 14.04?

You'll need to shrink it down to less than the destination drive size. You should also create a partition of the same size on the SSD.\nThen you will burn a Clonezilla Live ISO to a CD, boot from the CD, and clone the partitions from the source drive to the destination drive. You'll follow these steps, except you'll choose \"part_to_local_part\". You may also need to copy the MBR using options under the \"Advanced\" menu. You can find more information about that here.\n\nA: If the SSD is equal or larger than the HDD, you can also use dd to clone the drive and exand the partition afterwards.\nIf sda is the source and sdb the target, it is as simple as:\ndd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1024\n\n", "Q: 14.04.01 32-bit: Missing g++ 64-bit include files when cross-compiling So, I've got 32-bit Xubuntu 14.04.1 installed. We have some interface code where we intend to release SOs for the various platforms we support, and Windows DLLs.  (Yes I know, binary release bad, but also not relevant here.)\nI'm trying to build 32-bit and 64-bit SOs with 32-bit 14.04.01, using -m32/-m64 gcc/g++ arguments.  The 32-bit version works fine, but the 64-bit version fails with\n/usr/include/c++/4.8/string:38:28: fatal error: bits/c++config.h: No such file or directory\n\nChecking in the includes, that file is genuinely present for 32-bit but missing for 64-bit.\nGoogling the problem, this seems to have happened in the past for GCC/G++ 4.6, but then is marked as fixed.  But 14.04.1 is using GCC/G++ 4.8, which suggests there's been a regression in those libraries in GCC/G++ 4.8.  Is this something that anyone else has seen?\nI could set up a new VM for 64-bit 14.04.1 if necessary and see whether that would pick up the right library versions. I'd rather not if possible though, because I've got a bunch of other stuff I'd have to reinstall as well.  Is there a better solution?  And if I did install 64-bit 14.04.1, would I definitely be able to cross-compile back to 32-bit without missing headers in the other direction?\n\nA: The 64-bit bits/c++config.h file is provided on 32-bit systems (and vice-versa) by installing the g++-multilib package, so you need to install that package either using Software Center, Synaptic, or via the terminal using\nsudo apt-get install g++-multilib\n\nThis is just a dependency package that resolves to g++-4.8-multilib for the default gcc/g++ version, and in turn depends on lib64stdc++-4.8-dev (64-bit compilation on 32-bit) or libx32stdc++-4.8-dev (32-bit compilation on 64-bit) - it is these that contain the actual header files.\nThere is an equivalent set of packages for the plain C compiler gcc.\n", "Q: GTK theme, Window theme, and icon theme for Guest Account Hi I want to change only the gtk, window and icon theme for my guest account.\nI looked at the CustomizeGuestSession guide but the first section I did not understand how to apply it to my need and the second section basically was explaining how to copy a whole accounts settings when I just want three little things.\n\nA: So I did some more digging and found how to change the gtk, window, and icon theme with terminal commands. This is a big find because it allowed me to add them to the auto.sh script mentioned in the first section and third point at the CustomizeGuestSession guide. Here is what I did in Ubuntu 14.04.\nI opened a terminal and entered\n    sudo gedit /usr/lib/lightdm/guest-session-auto.sh\nThen I added just above the section that says \"# disable screen locking\"\n# set gtk icon and winodow theme\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme \"gtk-theme name\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme 'icon-theme name'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme \"window-theme name\"\n\nI then made sure to copy my .themes folder from my home folder over to /etc/skel\nHope this helps others as well!\n", "Q: How to Install Ubuntu Desktop on RAID 1 I am having to rebuild my Ubuntu MYTHTV system (RAID 1) on new hardware due to power supply failure taking out major components (originally built on Feisty).

I have seen further comments that raid support has been removed from Ubiquity. \nThere appears to be 2 options to installing Ubuntu Desktop on RAID:-\n1) Install Ubuntu server 14.04 and add Ubuntu Desktop via apt-install.\n2) Install Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop from alternative disk and upgrade to 14.04.\nIf RAID support is being added to ubiquity then option 2 would be the better long term solution as it would be repeatable at a later date, and I do not know what other support issues there will be with server involved. \nIf RAID support is not being added then option 1 would be the better solution as 12.04 will not be available much longer.\nCan you advise please.\n\nA: Ubiquity does not yet have support for raid so you have to manually install mdadm and use  it to configure the raid, then choose \"something else\" in ubiquity and set the raid array to be used as your root filesystem.

These files can, in principle, be stored under any filename in any location on any ESP. (You can have multiple ESPs.) Thus, an EFI stores information on what boot loader to use in NVRAM. It sounds like your NVRAM entry for Ubuntu was lost or damaged.\nOne possible cause of this problem is if the disk is disconnected; some EFIs look for boot loaders described in NVRAM and, if an entry describes a non-existent file, delete that entry. This is fine most of the time, but if you disconnect a disk, any boot loaders it contains will become unreachable the next time you boot the computer. You didn't mention disconnecting your external Ubuntu-containing disk when you did your upgrade, but this practice is fairly common, so I can't help but think you might have done so, and your firmware therefore deleted the relevant entry.\nIf this was the cause, there are a number of solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-create the old entry -- You can use EasyUEFI in Windows or efibootmgr in Ubuntu to re-create your old NVRAM entry. In either case, you'll need to locate the old GRUB and tell the utility where to find it. This will be easier with EasyUEFI, which is a GUI tool; efibootmgr is a command-line program. You'll need to identify your ESP(s) and figure out on which one GRUB resides. ESPs are FAT partitions, so you should use GParted, parted, blkid, or some similar tool (in Ubuntu; or Windows equivalents) to identify ESP candidates and locate GRUB. On any given disk, the ESP is usually (but not always) the first or second partition. Note that, if GRUB has an entry for Windows, once it becomes the default, you should be able to select Windows from the GRUB menu. OTOH, if GRUB is on your external disk, unplugging it could re-create your current problem.\n\n*Rename GRUB -- Instead of re-creating the NVRAM entry, you can skip it by giving GRUB the \"fallback\" filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. This filename is used on removable media like OS installers, the idea being that the firmware needs a standardized filename to boot from removable disks that it's never before used. If you give GRUB the fallback filename, your computer should be able to boot GRUB from your external disk as if it were an OS installer. You'll need to use your firmware's built-in boot manager (as you seem to have been doing until now) to select which OS to boot.\n\n*Use a more flexible boot manager on your hard disk -- You can install a boot manager that actively searches for available boot loaders on your hard disk. I know of two that do this: the now-abandoned rEFIt and my currently-maintained fork of it, rEFInd. If you install either of these to your internal hard disk's ESP, it should detect and enable you to launch GRUB (or even your Linux kernels directly, in the case of rEFInd) on your external disk. You can test rEFInd by using the CD-R or USB flash drive version, and if it works, install rEFInd to the ESP on your internal disk.\n\n\nSome of these solutions may work even if I've mis-diagnosed the cause of your problem, but that really depends on what the real problem is. One critical question is: Where is GRUB installed? If it's on the same ESP as the Windows boot loader, the cause is likely something other than what I'm speculating about, and you could set up that GRUB to be the primary boot program and it should work pretty well. If GRUB is on a separate ESP on the external disk, you'll have to pay careful attention to which ESP is which no matter what you do.\n", "Q: Mouse clicks sometimes not working I have USB Razer mouse.

Even better, look beyond the directory name as the directory itself may contain more specific information.  For example, if the release is xenial, then in /dists/xenial/Release you will find lines like: \"Version: 16.04\", \"Description: Ubuntu Xenial 16.04\", \"Architectures: amd64 i386\".  In this case, that probably came from the ISO file \nubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso rather than ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso or ubuntu-16.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso, so it is out of date.  ubnfile1.txt (mentioned in another answer), on the other hand, wasn't terribly helpful.

Like Xen said, the major difference between the two is that they have different Desktop Environments.\nThe installer, unless you're using the MinimalCD image (which uses a text-based, ncurses UI and downloads the system files instead of storing them on the installer) is essentially the exact same as the default Ubuntu installer - just branded differently.\nThus, since the core of the OS is the same, unless you configure it manually the installers will install the OS in the same way other than the included software.\n", "Q: What is similar to nextpvr My dad wants to use Linux. I'll put him on a lightweight version because he wants to use it as Minecraft sever. He uses a PVR he got where he plugs his local antenna to his computer by using WinTV HVR and use a program called NextPVR he's able to record, look at a TV Guide, and record new episodes. Is there a Linux program that does the same thing or can I use NextPVR on wine?\n\nA: This list is by no means exhaustive. I would adivse you to try 2 or 3 of the open source options to understand which suits best your needs.\nMythTV\nThis is the most reputable option for Linux, has been around since 2002 - initially as an alternative to TiVo - and comes with plenty of features. It is released under a GPL licence and available from the Software Centre; detailed install and configuration instructions are available at the Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nKodi\nThis is another old guard programme that retains some popularity. Beyond live TV and personal recording, it also provides plug-ins to access streaming services such as YouTube, Amazon Prime or Spotify. Kodi is released under a GPL licence and available from a third party PPA; install instructions are available at the Kodi wiki.\n\nNote: Since you are installing a new system, you might wish to take a look at Kodibuntu. This is an interesting option if you are not intending to do much else with this system.\nSageTV\nA media centre that existed as a commercial product for about a decade. In 2011 it was acquired by Google, whom opened the code this year under an Apache licence. It counts PVR among its features, but it has not been developed that much since Google bought it. I could not find install instructions for recent releases.\ntvtime\nThis is a less popular TV programme with recording capabilities. The latest release is from 2005 but it seems to still have a relevant number of users.\n\nJRiver\nThis is a popular proprietary multimedia programme that is almost 20 years old. Among other things, it supports TV recording and keeps a TV station library. It still has a large community around it, an interesting option among the commercial software.\n--\nFinally, it might be a good idea to write a message to the NextPVR folk asking them for a Linux version, explaining that you will quit using their software if they do not do so.\n", "Q: I am new to linux and need help with ubuntu 14.04, Nothing Runs I used UNetbootin and installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop with a USB, it took a while and in the end I ended up just deleting my old Windows 7 OS and all the memory.

I want to upgrade it to 15.10.\nBut there is a EFI partition of size 200 MB in it.\nThere are total 4 partitions -\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*This is where I keep files\n\n*swap\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it safe to remove the EFI partition during installation and simply install over the existing Ubuntu partition?\n\n*Why is the partition there? What is its use?\n\n*If it is not safe to remove it, then how to configure it during new installation.\n\n\n\nA: First off, I'll answer your second question, \"Why is the partition there? What is it's use?\"\nThe EFI partition is created to store EFI-mode boot loaders and related files. \nThe Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) or its version 2.x variant, Unified EFI (UEFI) is a firmware type that is widespread on recent computers, especially those more recent than 2010. (Source, Ubuntu Wiki)\nAs for why it's there, it was most likely created when Ubuntu was installed, as most systems have EUFI mode enabled by default.\n\nSecond, \"Is it safe to remove the EFI partition during installation?\"\nYes and no. If you have Windows installed in UEFI mode then you should probably keep it, as they are in UEFI mode by default and you can't mix UEFI and BIOS/legacy installations. \nHowever, if Ubuntu is your only OS, then you should be able to disable UEFI mode and only work in BIOS version, which may have better support.\n\nThird, \"If it is not safe to remove it, then how to configure it during new installation.\"\nIf you follow the instructions here on the Ubuntu Wiki, then the installer should take care of it just fine, assuming you're doing a fresh install and using the automatic installer.\nTo sum up what that link is saying, you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a 64 bit version of Ubuntu (32bit can work, but it's very complicated.) \n\n*You'll also need to disable QuickBoot/FastBoot and Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT), and if on Windows 8 or newer, you'll need to disable Fast Startup.\n\n*Use a supported version of Ubuntu. Support for UEFI was added in 11.10, but more recent versions are far more reliable. 12.04 or greater is preferred.\n\n\nIf you're planning on doing custom partitioning, then it will be a bit more complicated, as you'll have to manually create a UEFI partition and configure Ubuntu to mount it at /boot/efi.\n\nA: Your efi partition is part of efi boot \nIf Ubuntu is your only OS, you do not need it, but you will need to configure your bios to disable efi boot (ie configure legacy boot)\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n", "Q: Software Updater turns inactive (grey in color) while configuring grub-pc I use Ubuntu 15.10. I updated the available updates today. Almost after an hour the software updater stays idle \"Configuring grub-pc\". I can browser without problem. Is it ok to kill job or restart. Can you suggest what to do?\n\n\nA: I can't confirm that it is safe to kill the job, but if it stays frozen, then you won't have much of a choice.\nWith some basic googling this seems to be a decently common issue, with a LP issue filed back on the 21st of May, 2015 against Software Updater for this exact issue. \nIt hasn't seen much activity, so it seems like it may be a fairly niche/one-off bug, but you can try killing the update manager and running sudo apt-get install libgtk2-perl and then running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade.\nIt shouldn't break things, but since I've never actually had this happen, nor would I be able to test it, I can't be entirely sure. However, we'll be more than happy to help if things do break.\n\nA: I ran into this problem consistently and I think I've found the cause and  solution:  I killed Software Updater process and followed the advice of previous poster \"RPi Awesomeness\" and typed sudo apt-get install libgtk2-perl at CLI. First Ubuntu gave an error and told me I had to type another command, which I did, and received an error about things being locked (presumably because of the killed process). So I rebooted, and tried sudo apt-get install libgtk2-perl again at CLI. This time a text screen came up about grub, which to be honest I had been messing around with previously because I need the bootloader to be on an external drive, while Ubuntu is installed on the internal drive.  I guess this text window had been there all along but while using the Software Updater it wasn't visible. So, the solution seems to be to do it from the command line interface.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Desktop Environment Help I have bought and install Ubuntu 15.10 installer disc from a local software store.

There is a complete background below (borne out of frustration) as to why I want to know this - but the basic question is how do I completely reset Xserver to the state it was in when I installed Ubuntu? I have searched over months for a way to do this and nothing has worked so far.\nThoughts on the general problem are also more than welcome. I am using Ubuntu-gnome 15.10. My linux/ubuntu knowledge is probably... \"intermediate\".\nGeneral Background\nI (unfortunately) own a laptop with hybrid graphics (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M is the secondary GPU). This has given me no end of problems. I use Ubuntu Gnome, and have reinstalled it more times than I can count.\nIn the past I have tried to use the recommended Nvidia binary drivers package provided in Ubuntu. This does work initially, however, quite often a simple \"apt-get upgrade\" will break X and dump me at a black screen after boot. It is then almost impossible to recover as even purging all Nvidia packages and using ubuntu-drivers at the command line to change to nouveau (deleting the xorg.conf file too) doesn't seem to restore my graphics (even though that makes no sense... as surely that puts me back at the start?). I try all the available Nvidia packages (purging each time) but always end up at the black screen. I then reinstall Ubuntu Gnome and use the exact same Nvidia driver package, and it works!\nThis drives me insane. Purging Nvidia drivers and deleting xorg.conf doesn't seem to be enough somehow. Something about nvidia seems to linger and isn't fixed until I reinstall.\nBumblebee\nMore recently I tried to install Bumblebee as a possible end to my problems (i.e. as an alternative to using the Nvidia drivers for the entire X session). I reverted my main driver to nouveau (in the additional drivers app provided in ubuntu) and installed bumblebee following the standard Ubuntu guide. It didn't work with my card (\"cannot access secondary gpu could not load gpu driver\"), so I tried to upgrade the Nvidia drivers that Bumblebee uses (again following the instructions). This broke X. I purged Bumblebee and all related packages and reverted to nouveau. \nX is still broken! and strangly an Nvidia based xorg.conf file is being generated on each boot (I deleted it and it comes back) even though I have purged all Nvidia packages....?\nQuestion\nAs such, I want to know the most aggressive way I can simply reset Xserver and all associated packages each time this happense so I don't have to do a full reinstall. I want to know this for the future as it would be nice to at least be able to restore my system to a state where I can boot to a GUI and then try different options.\nResearch\nI have already seen this and this. The first is the most relevant, but doing that never works for me. Simply purging the Nvidia drivers doesn't seem to be enough. Something about Nvidia seems to linger (e.g. now when I have a magically reappearing Nvidia based xorg.conf file even though I have no nvidia packages installed).\n\nA: Generally speaking you can reset xserver with\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nor \nsudo X -configure\n\nBut I've seen cases of people for which this didn't work.\n\nA: Neither dpkg-reconfigure or X -configure have worked for me.\nI had to delete my xorg.conf file and reboot the machine. After that, X seemed to automatically configure itself and I could finally see the GUI again.\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Trying to understand commands affecting unmounted drives I'm currently trying to understand some code I have found which unmounts a drive but then does operations onto it (which seems quite strange to me).\nThe situation is as follows:\nI have a mount named /dev/sda1 which points to a local hard drive.\nThen I have the command unmount /dev/sda*. Next is a command that unzips a file and pipes the result to a ntfsclone:\nntfsclone -r -O /dev/sda1 -\n\nAfter this there is another unmount /dev/sda*. followed by a dd with the output file being the same folder again: dd of=/dev/sda count=1 bs=.....\nSo in total its:\nunmount\nntfsclone\nunmount\ndd\n\nall going onto /dev/sda1.\nWhat I'm not understanding here is what is really happening there. I get that the ntfsclone is used to create a clone of the image of the hard drive while dd is used to (re)create the boot partition. What I don't get is the possible reason behind the umounts. Which is in essence my question here:\nWhat are the umounts for / what are they doing there / how does it affect the operations there (as they are going onto unmounted devices as far as I understand the operations there)?\nNote I only put in the parameters and codeparts I think are necessary to see what the commands do (thus the dd naturally also has a if parameter, ... .\n\nA: On one level, the kernel software is able to read and write a disk drive, but only entire blocks and/or sectors. On a higher level, a different piece of software (the file system driver) is able to see these blocks and sectors as a file system, and read and write files and directories. In order for the file system driver to work, a mapping must be made between the physical blocks on the disk and the folder structure. That is called mounting the disk.\nHowever, when copying entire disks, you don't want the file system to change once you have started copying. In order to prevent this you unmount the file system. Now, only the low-level commands are able to access the disk. ntfsclone and dd are examples of low-level commands that guarantee the file system is not changed while they are busy.\n", "Q: Can't fix GPG Error NO_PUB_KEY As the title, I have the so common \"GPG Error...NO_PUB_KEY\" error, but I'm not able to fix it at all. \nI tried both Y PPA Manager and the command line sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <PUB_KEY> but it doesn't work; indeed, the last one always returns something like that\ngpg: key 98AB5139: \"Oracle Corporation (VirtualBox archive signing key) <info@virtualbox.org>\" not changed\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg:              unchanged: 1\n\nThe problem started when I modified the sources.list file to delete two lines regarding a dropbox ppa.

This worked for me.  (I also checked that reinstalling the package caused shimx64.efi to show up in the output of efibootmgr -v instead of grubx64.efi, which was there while the problem was present.)\n\nA: First, go back into your firmware and disable the CSM (\"legacy boot\") support. If you were booting in a pure-EFI environment, as it sounds like you were, that option will do you no good, and could come back to bite you later. (See my page on the subject for more information on CSM's problems.)\nSecond, the error message indicates that your computer attempted to boot a boot loader that was not signed with an authorized Secure Boot key. (Some of the messages warning of such violations are pretty obtuse -- they vary from one EFI to another, and in some cases from one follow-on program to another, depending on where the violation occurred.) Such a message popping up after the computer has been booting successfully, and with no changes to your boot programs or firmware settings, is a big red flag.\nI saw no mention of updates to either GRUB or Shim, so your boot process should not have been affected by those updates. OTOH, it could be that something else has modified the boot path. This might be an innocent change that's gone badly and caused a glitch -- for instance, if you're triple-booting with another Linux distribution, it might have changed the boot path to an unsigned GRUB. If that's the case, you can change the boot order back to Ubuntu's GRUB (via Shim) with efibootmgr -- type sudo efibootmgr -v to see the current boot order (on the BootOrder line) and options (the bulk of the output). Locate the line for Ubuntu that launches via Shim and use the -o option to change the order so that it's first, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 0009,0000,001B if the desired entry is Boot0009 and two alternatives are Boot0000 and Boot001B. Another possibility is that an unrelated Windows update has interfered with GRUB. (Microsoft has the ability to update most computers' Secure Boot keys, and if they've bungled that or deliberately blacklisted Ubuntu's Shim for some reason, you might see the error you've described.)\nThere's a small chance that something malicious is happening -- some piece of malware might have installed itself in your boot path. If that's happened, then by disabling Secure Boot, you've already enabled the malware to run. There's no telling what the consequences might be if this is the case. I don't mean to alarm you; the odds of this having happened are low. If this has happened, though, it will take expert TLC to recover your computer, since pre-boot malware is notoriously difficult to extricate.\nUpdating your GRUB configuration is unlikely to do any good, although there's a slim chance that it might if you switch GRUB from booting an unsigned to a signed version of the kernel. (The last I checked, Ubuntu's GRUB would boot unsigned kernels, but that might change in the future. Some other GRUBs, like the one used by Fedora, are stricter and will boot only signed kernels.)\nYou can check your boot path with efibootmgr and verify that it's booting through Shim by default -- that is, the boot loader for the first item in the boot order should be EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi. If that's not the case, then you may be able to change the boot order back. If it is the case, then perhaps your shimx64.efi binary has become damaged (or worse, replaced by malware). Completely re-installing GRUB might fix the problem. (Boot Repair can do this fairly easily.)\n\nA: GRUB packages were updated yesterday (December 15, 2015) : 2.02~beta2-29ubuntu0.2.\nMaybe something went wrong during the upgrade, but there shouldn't be a security issue.  \nChange the BIOS settings back to the state in which you had installed Ubuntu.\nThen reinstall the GRUB boot loader to your Ubuntu installation  in EFI mode.\nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media - open a terminal and execute:  \nsudo mount /dev/sd*** /mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sd** /mnt/boot/efi\nfor i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\nsudo chroot /mnt\ngrub-install /dev/sd*\nupdate-grub  \n\nNote:  \nsd* = disk | sd** = efi partition | sd*** = system partition\nTo identify the disk and partition numbers you can use GParted.  \nBoot into BIOS and select Ubuntu as the default operating system.  \nUSN-Reference : Ubuntu Security Notice 2836-1: GRUB vulnerability \nIn case it does not work, you alternatively can try the boot-repair tool.\nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media, open a terminal and execute:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n", "Q: How to convert sshfs command to fstab entry?

I couldn't find much info on the security of Ubuntu (and Linux in general) update verification/security.\nThe connection appears to be plain ftp. but the packages are signed using a private key and the corresponding public key is stored in the system as a trusted key.\nSo what are the details? Is the package itself signed or just the hash? Is it an RSA 4096 bit key? What are the chances of a malicious entity being able to mess with the updates and who owns the private key?\n\nA: A concept called Secure Apt is used to verify the integrity of packages from Apt package repositories. The key methods are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Package maintainers generate and publish a list of checksums calculated by secure hash functions from their packages (binary and source).\n\n*They sign that list with their private GPG key.\n\n*Apt maintains a key ring with public GPG keys of verified package authors and maintainers.\n\n*Upon package download and installation, Apt verifies\n\n\n*\n\n*the integrity of the checksum list with respect to the key ring and\n\n*the integrity of the software package based on those verified checksums.\n\n\n\nFor more info visit the Debian Wiki on Secure Apt.\n", "Q: Why do samba users need to log on to the server first?

Problem with NVIDIA. How to set NOMODESET from GRUB I have ubuntu 14.04.3 installed on my new machine equipped with an nvidia geforce 970.\nNot to mention the pains I had in installing nvidia.352, last night I made a simple update and shut down. However, this morning I had the black screen login page instead of the graphical. There was a problem with nvidia I figured. So I tried to downgrade to an older version. It didn't help. Last thing I did was to purge nvidia. After reboot, however, this time I don't even get the black login page. Instead, the screen shuts down and there is nothing I can do.\nI tried with recovery mode through GRUB. However, no matter which one of the options I choose, I always get the same problem. The screen shuts down and I have to reboot manually. So no terminal, no login, just the system boot settings.\nAfter a fair amount of search, I found out that there is an issue with a concept called nomodeset which has to be set through grub. As this link suggests, I searched for the line starting with linux and ending with quiet splash to add nomodeset there. However, what I have is this:\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.19.0-33-generic root=UUID=f40f49f8-a44b-4709-b79b-0873ca3c3b72 ro /\n\nSo there is no quiet splash to add nomodeset to. However, if I anyway try to add either nomodeset or nomodeset quiet splash in the end of the line and then reboot, it halts and I need to reboot manually.\nSo my question is: Is there anyway that I can have at least an access to a terminal by modifying GRUB? \nAt this moment I need to have a terminal to try to recover my files if possible and then maybe install nvidi again.\n\nA: Remove the currently installed drivers and install the latest stable drivers supporting GTX 970.  \nStep 1 - Uninstall the old NVIDIA drivers - boot the PC - when the GRUB menu appears :  \nHighlight the Ubuntu menu entry and  press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line.\nPress F10 to boot the Ubuntu operating system.\nWhen the login screen appears press Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nEnter your user name and password - then execute :\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*  \nsudo reboot  \n\nStep 2 - Install the new NVIDIA drivers - boot the PC - when the GRUB menu appears :  \nHighlight the Ubuntu menu entry and  press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line.\nPress F10 to boot the Ubuntu operating system.\nWhen the login screen appears press Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nEnter your user name and password - then execute :  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-358\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: I could not yet make the system working by adding the suggested terms to the GRUB. However, when I run the same trick (adding nomodeset to the end of linux line in GRUB) on ubuntu USB boot, I can login as ubuntu (otherwise I have the same problem: screen shuts down).\nIs there any way that I can modify the booting procedure (GRUB, or installation of nvidia) for the main user on the failed ubuntu through this environment?

Looking (again) in my system, that is exactly what was done with e.g. my /etc/init.d/saned script:\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\nUsing absolute paths like you did will work as well of course.\n", "Q: Mono: Apache mod_mono installing issue on Ubuntu I am trying to install mod_mono on Ubuntu Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS.

Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).\n\n\nA: Hey I had the same problem today.\nFixed it by moving one of the old kernel images from the boot folder to a temp location to free up a little bit of space.\nThen try the other solution again.\nRegards,\nDori\n", "Q: Conky on ubuntu 15.10 shows window decoration After updating to ubuntu 15.10 conky show window borders and shadows. \n\nAny way I can get around it?\nHere is then content of the theme:\n#==============================================================================\n#                               conkyrc_seamod\n# Date    : 05/02/2012\n# Author  : SeaJey\n# Version : v0.1\n# License : Distributed under the terms of GNU GPL version 2 or later\n# \n# This version is a modification of conkyrc_lunatico wich is modification of conkyrc_orange\n# \n# conkyrc_orange:    http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=137503&forumpage=0\n# conkyrc_lunatico:  http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=142884\n#==============================================================================\n\nbackground yes\nupdate_interval 1\n\ncpu_avg_samples 1\nnet_avg_samples 2\ntemperature_unit celsius\n\ndouble_buffer yes\nno_buffers yes\ntext_buffer_size 2048\n\ngap_x 40\ngap_y 70\nminimum_size 300 900\nmaximum_width 350\n\nown_window yes\nown_window_type normal\nown_window_class conky\nown_window_transparent no\nown_window_argb_visual yes\nown_window_colour 000000\nown_window_argb_value 102\nown_window_hints undecorate,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager,below\n\nborder_inner_margin 0\nborder_outer_margin 0\nalignment top_right\n\n\ndraw_shades no\ndraw_outline no\ndraw_borders no\ndraw_graph_borders no\n\noverride_utf8_locale yes\nuse_xft yes\nxftfont caviar dreams:size=10\nxftalpha 0.5\nuppercase no\n\n# Defining colors\ndefault_color FFFFFF\n# Shades of Gray\ncolor1 DDDDDD\ncolor2 AAAAAA\ncolor3 888888\n# Orange\ncolor4 EF5A29\n# Green\ncolor5 77B753\n\n# Loading lua script for drawning rings\nlua_load ./seamod_rings.lua\nlua_draw_hook_post main\n\n## System information using conky capabilities\n\n# Header with base system info\nown_window_argb_value 102\nown_window_colour 000000\nTEXT\n${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:bold}${color4}SYSTEM ${hr 2}\n${offset 15}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color1}$sysname $kernel\n${offset 15}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color1}$nodename\n${offset 15}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color1}Uptime: $uptime\n\n# Showing CPU Graph\n${voffset 20}\n${offset 120}${cpugraph 40,183 666666 666666}${voffset -25}\n${offset 90}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:bold}${color5}CPU\n# Showing TOP 5 CPU-consumers\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color4}${top name 1}${alignr}${top cpu 1}%\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color1}${top name 2}${alignr}${top cpu 2}%\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color2}${top name 3}${alignr}${top cpu 3}%\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color3}${top name 4}${alignr}${top cpu 4}%\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color3}${top name 5}${alignr}${top cpu 5}%\n\n#Showing memory part with TOP 5\n${voffset 40}\n${offset 90}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:bold}${color5}MEM\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color4}${top_mem name 1}${alignr}${top_mem mem 1}%\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color1}${top_mem name 2}${alignr}${top_mem mem 2}%\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color2}${top_mem name 3}${alignr}${top_mem mem 3}%\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color3}${top_mem name 4}${alignr}${top_mem mem 4}%\n${offset 105}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:normal}${color3}${top_mem name 4}${alignr}${top_mem mem 5}%\n\n# Showing disk partitions: root, home and Data\n${voffset 28}\n${offset 90}${font Ubuntu:size=10,weight:bold}${color5}DISKS\n${offset 120}${diskiograph 33,183 666666 666666}${voffset -30}\n${voffset 20}\n${offset 15}${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:bold}${color1}Free: ${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:normal}${fs_free /}${alignr}${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:bold}Used: ${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:normal}${fs_used /}\n${offset 15}${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:bold}${color1}Free: ${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:normal}${fs_free /home}${alignr}${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:bold}Used: ${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:normal}${fs_used /home}\n${offset 15}${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:bold}${color1}Free: ${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:normal}${fs_free /media/Data}${alignr}${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:bold}Used: ${font Ubuntu:size=9,weight:normal}${fs_used /media/Data}\n\n# Network data (my desktop have only LAN).

When I run the curl -L https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -command I get a curl: (7) Failed to connect to deb.nodesource.com port 443: Connection refused error message. \nHow can I install node manually on Ubuntu Trusty? I assume the option I have is to somehow get the setup files on the server, add it to the repository and then run the sudo apt-get install nodejs command ,but I'm really not for certain.\nFYI: They've also blocked the git protocol.\n\nA: HTTPS really shouldn't be blocked - it may be another network issue (with DNS or certificates etc). Anyway, you could try different commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use HTTP instead:\ncurl -L http://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -\n\n\n*Use wget (or another downloader) instead, and execute it:\nwget https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12\nsudo bash ./setup_0.12\n\nAll curl -L https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash - should do is download the script and run it as root, so it can be done in other ways. However it may be a good idea to talk to the people who run the setup if HTTPS is blocked/scanned  - as generally doing that makes things insecure.\nYou can install nodejs from the Ubuntu repos (with apt-get etc), but it may be a older version (see here)\n", "Q: what directory is the tmp file in I'm a totally overwhelmed, brand new user.  \nhad a lot of problems during the install process while half asleep after a long day of fighting with windows and then giving up on the whole windows OS.  Anyway, i don't think I installed it properly.  I'm having trouble getting my computer to boot up from the Flash drive and without the flash drive plugged in i get no option to boot up in ubuntu.

Therefore, you cannot download the Ubuntu ISO while in a Live environment without saving it to your internal hard-drive. You will have to specify where to download the file to when Firefox prompts you as to what you wish to do with the file. \nHowever, since you are able to boot into this Live environment, all you have to do to get Ubuntu installed is click the \"Install Ubuntu\" icon in the launcher on the left. This will start the Ubiquity installer. When the list of options comes up, provided you have already made a back-up of what is important to you in Windows, just choose \"Erase Everything and Install\" to cleanly install Ubuntu over Windows.\n", "Q: How to reinstall ubuntu phone camera app?

On Windows, I had an Apache, MySQL and PHP stack and number of Apache Virtual hosts where the DocumentRoot(s) pointed to a directories within a directory I develop php and Java software for different applications and tested it in those virtual hosts, e.g. java_projects, php_ps_projects.\nI just got the LAMP stack working on the laptop and Virtual Hosts when they are located in /var/www\nI tried to point DocumentRoot /home/roy/websites/php_js_projects and modified <Directory /var/www/> to point to <Directory /home/roy/websites//> with the same attributes but get:\n\"Forbidden You don't have permission to access / on this server.\nApache/2.4.12 (Ubuntu) Server at cnrepperson_com Port 80\"\n\nI've done a google search and haven't seen any information on making this work or if possible.\nIs this possible and if so, what are the necessary steps?\nSure hope this will work as I would hate to have to develop and copy to test location.\nThanks in advance,\nRoy\n\nA: You'll need to ensure that the virtual user/group running apache2 (www-data) has at least scan access (x) to all directories in the path. E.g, the following commands (as root):\n# chmod o+x /home /home/roy /home/roy/websites\n# chgrp -R www-data /home/roy/websites/php_js_projects\n\nThe latter command will make all files in that directory tree be in group www-data, which is the group of the apache2. Of course, all published files also need to be group accessible.\nAnother way, that generally is better I think, is that you add user roy to the www-data group, and then set it up to keep the published files somewhere under /var/www, with a link from roy's home directory. In that way you have a more clear separation between \"private\" and \"public\" files.\n", "Q: Need to expand the size of /boot I want to upgrade to the newest version of Ubuntu, but I keep getting the error \"Not enough free disk space\".

The upgrade requires 90.6MB.\nI have tried using gparted to resize the partition that boot is on, but I have a problem.\nThere's plenty of free room left on my hard drive at 435 GB free, 25 GB used.\nI have 2 partitions. 1 is 255 MB, the other is 496 GB.\nThis is the warning message that appears in gparted\n\nWhen I click on resize/move for the main partition, the slider bar won't move.\n\nI've also done the automated clean up, but it doesn't remove enough of the files to leave 90.6 MB free.\nHow can I expand the boot partition?\n\nA: Even though it's not the answer to your question it might be the solution for your problem:\nYour boot partition's size of 250 MB is big enough - at least if you don't want to use the last 10 kernels.\nOpen a terminal and use the command ls -l /boot/vm* to display the installed kernels:\n% ls -l /boot/vm*\n-rw------- 1 root root 5825376 Dez 18 01:42 /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-70-generic\n-rw------- 1 root root 5825376 Dez 18 01:42 /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-74-generic\n\nIn this case there are two kernels which is fine. You should at least keep the previous version in case of problems. I think your list will be longer and you can use apt-get autoremove to remove the old kernels:\nsudo apt-get autoremove linux-image-3.13.0-70-generic\n\nIf your /boot/ partition was full because of old kernel versions you can remove most of them with this command and then proceed with your upgrade.\nUpdate:\nLook at these solutions, too\n", "Q: How can I transfer bookmarks from an old computer that ran Windows?

However, if I add more sites to my /var/www directory and change my 000-default.conf file to the following I get a mixture of errors. \nOne of the errors I get is that images no longer display correctly on the sites and show as placeholders. I'm referencing the images manually in my drupal code like so: /sites/default/files/filename.\nThe other I get is that the internal pages after the home page no longer work on my multiple sites when I do this.

I want to install 1:1.2.8-6ubuntu1.1. I believe that I need to sudo apt-get install nfs-common, but I'm not sure how to specify the version. I've tried the obvious of:\n$ sudo apt-get install nfs-common=1:1.2.8-6ubuntu1.1\nE: Version '1:1.2.8-6ubuntu1.1' for 'nfs-common' was not found\n\n\nLong question: I'm trying to install nfs-common over a docker image.  At first attempt, I just did apt-get install nfs-common.  This failed, presumably because:\n\nThe problem is that nfs-common has been updated in the backports repo, but portmap has not, and the new nfs-common and old portmap are not compatible. So to install it either disable backports, or use force version to install the previous version of nfs-common.\n— Source: Crunchbang.org: [SOLVED] nfs install failure.\n\nOK, I'm happy to force a previous version of nfs-common.  This would match another machine that was setup months ago, presumably before the latest version was available.  Going to that machine and running apt-cache policy nfs-common, I see it has installed 1:1.2.8-6ubuntu1.1.

At the moment I need to copy a large amount of files (3000+ images, each one up to 1 MB in size) from Ubuntu to Windows. Problem is, when I click eject on the drive in Ubuntu nothing happens. I've waited like 10 minutes, still nothing. If I press eject again or try to access the drive in the files browser, it tells me that 'another operation is already pending'. So the first time I tried, I just pulled it out after a couple of minutes (assuming nothing would happen, I've never had to eject something under Windows). Bad idea, most of the image files were damaged and could not be opened anymore using either OS. So I tried again, but it's been like 15 minutes and still nothing happened (the stick still shows up in the files menu) ...\nWhat might be causing this?

I am a big fan of gnome-screenshot on Ubuntu. When I press the print key on my keyboard, it captures the current screen and shows me a dialog asking what to do with the screenshot. \nUsually, I use it to copy screenshot to clipboard. Okay at the end, I like it.\nRecently I installed ArchBang and installed gnome-screenshot. Added the keybindings. When I press the print key then it asks me first what to do i.e. capture full screen, select area to grab and a window to capture. So, I have to select it first and then it goes for capturing.\nSo, there is one extra step here. I want to ask if it is Ubuntu specific version of gnome-screenshot. If so, can I use it in ArchBang?\nThank you.\nEdit:\nIn ArchBang, when I press the PrintScr button and then click on 'Copy to Clipboard' and then paste it somewhere, it works fine.\nBut, if I press PrintScr button and then click 'Copy to Clipboard' and close the dialog box and then try to paste, it doesn't work. \nAnd for the information, this thing worked great while on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Look at the package version names on https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screenshot. They all end in *-[D]ubuntu[U], where D and U are digits and dots. If the placeholder D is not 0, it stands for the current Debian version of the package (meaning, the source package was modified for Debian), while U stands for the current Ubuntu version of the package (meaning it was altered for Ubuntu).\nSome examples from the current state of the gnome-screenshot package in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*3.18.0-1ubuntu2\n\n\n*\n\n*upstream version: 3.18.0\n\n*Debian version: 1 (modified in Debian)\n\n*Ubuntu version: 2 (modified in Ubuntu)\n\n\n*3.16.2-0ubuntu3\n\n\n*\n\n*upstream version: 3.16.2\n\n*Debian version: n/a or 0 (not modified in Debian)\n\n*Ubuntu version: 3 (modified in Ubuntu)\n\n\n*3.4.1-0ubuntu1.1\n\n\n*\n\n*upstream version: 3.4.1\n\n*Debian version: n/a or 0 (not modified in Debian)\n\n*Ubuntu version: 1.1 (modified in Ubuntu)\n\n\n\nWe can conclude that Ubuntu doesn't use the unaltered upstream version of gnome-screenshot.

I would like to have something similar to everything in windows (using locate): every time I press a key, the file list that matches the current inputs gets updated immediately.  \nI am wondering is that possible to do real-time text completion in terminal and how should I do that?\nTo make it more clear, suppose I have this function implemented as \"foo\", then when I type foo a and hit TAB in the command line, it should give a list of all files with name containing a, then if I continue to type b (now the command becomes foo ab), then the file list automatically (without need to hit anything else) gets updated to those containing ab, and so forth.\n\nA: This Unix & Linux post describes what you want:\n\n... I've come across a great, universal tool:\n  command-line fuzzy finder. \nIt primarily allows you to “fuzzy-find” files (check the rich gif\n  animation by the link above), but it also allows to feed arbitrary\n  text data to it and filter this data. So, the shortcuts idea is\n  simple: all we need is to maintain a file with paths (which are\n  shortcuts), and fuzzy-filter this file. Here's how it looks: we type\n  cdg command (from “cd global”, if you like), get a list of our\n  bookmarks, pick the needed one in just a few keystrokes, and press\n  Enter. Working directory is changed to the picked item: \n\nIt is extremely fast and convenient: usually I just type 3-4 letters\n  of the needed item, and all others are already filtered out.\n\n\nIt may not be what you're looking for, but the Vim editor with the CtrlP plugin can be used for this:\n\n\n\nYou'll need to install one of vim, vim-nox, vim-gnome, vim-gtk or vim-athena for this to work. Installation instructions for CtrlP are provided in its website:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Clone the plugin into a separate directory:\n$ cd ~/.vim\n$ git clone https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git bundle/ctrlp.vim\n\n  \n*Add to your ~/.vimrc:\nset runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim\n\n  \n*Run at Vim's command line:\n:helptags ~/.vim/bundle/ctrlp.vim/doc\n\n  \n*Restart Vim and check :help ctrlp.txt for usage instructions and configuration details.\n  \n\nIf you have never used Vim before, it can be a bit intimidating. Run vimtutor to get an idea of it.\n\nA: You can write your own completion scripts for your shell.\nFor example, bash uses simple shell scripts / functions for completion. Install bash-completions if you haven't already and take a look at /usr/share/bash-completion/completions for some examples.\nIn your script you could simply call locate to get a list of matches and return them.\n", "Q: Slow and Unreliable Internet with EDIMAX EW-7811Un N150 My internet connection is slow and unreliable.

You can check using the iwconfig command (e.g. for wlan0):\niwconfig wlan0 \n\nTo disable power management use:\niwconfig wlan0 power off\n\nThere are also other parameters that may be adjusted to improve reliability (e.g. retry, rts, etc) using iwconfig and/or the iw command.

When I select this entry and select register it, enter the correct IP and the MAAS API key correctly and hit save, nothing happens. If theres any logs I should be looking at or anything else anyone can point me towards that would be helpful.\n\nA: If nothing happens after you fill in the MAAS registration form, then most likely Landscape isn't able to reach the address you provided.\nThe MAAS address has to be of the form http://<hostname-or-ip>/MAAS/. If that's what you are using, and if the hostname (or ip) is reachable from the Landscape machine, then inspecting the logs is a good idea. The most interesting log for this case would be the job-handler.log one, in /var/log/landscape-logs on the Landscape server node, or landscape-server/0 unit if you used juju to deploy Landscape.\n", "Q: Trouble with Deja Dup Restore I'm trying to restore from a Deja Dup backup. My original system was Zorin 9, but when disk fried I moved to Ubuntu 14 installed on fresh disk. I don't think this is causing any problems, platform is the same, just thought I should mention it.\nMost of the backup restored properly, but I was given a list of 46 files (unfortunately including some thunderbird inboxes and skype chatlogs I'd really like back) with the following error message: \"Could not restore the following files. Please make sure you are able to write to them.\" I thought this might be a problem writing to areas of the new drive, so I ran the restore again, this time to a folder on another drive. Those files are not present in either extraction from the backup.\nYes, I know, I'll find a better backup solution for next round. This is what I have to work with now.\nI'm wondering:\n1) Is there any way to get inside the duplicity archives and inspect for viable versions of these files?\n2) What is meant by \"Please make sure you are able to write to them.\"? What problem does this indicate?\n3) Anything else I might try? Or are these files just probably just corrupted or lost? The log seems to remember them as belonging to the backup, they must have been there at some point.\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes you can get to them.  You need to take a look at the .manifest file in your backups and figure out which compressed backup the files are in.  Then you need to manually unzip that backup and manually move the files where you want them.\nAlternatively, you can make restore those files using deja-dup, but restore to a different location.  Also make sure that you have read access to those backups with chmod 755 * in the deja-dup folder.\nWhat it means by \"Please make sure you are able to write to them.\" is that you need to make sure you can write to the restore location.  For instance, if you are trying to restore to /root/ as a normal user, that's obviously not going to work since you can't write to /root/.\n", "Q: My computer doesn't boot successfully 90% of the time It always gets as far as the Grub menu, but after that, when text appears briefly, the text is sometimes half a screen (which means it's going to boot successfully), and sometimes about two screens (which means it's not going to boot).

Does this security bug affect Ubuntu?\nIt involves pressing backspace 28 times to break into a machine.\nFrom Lifehacker:\n\nThe researchers, Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll from the Cybersecurity\n  Group at Polytechnic University of Valencia, found that it’s possible\n  to bypass all security of a locked-down Linux machine by exploiting a\n  bug in the Grub2 bootloader. Essentially, hitting backspace 28 times\n  when the machine asks for your username accesses the “Grub rescue\n  shell,” and once there, you can access the computer’s data or install\n  malware.\n\n\nA: This has been fixed in Ubuntu, reference: Security Notice USN-2836-1\n\nA: My understanding is that this will only affect people who use a GRUB password prompt, which is not the default on Ubuntu.\nSo a default Ubuntu installation was never vulnerable.\nIf you do use a GRUB password prompt (which is arguably not a very strong protection anyway, since a person who sees the grub screens has physical access to the machine) then you are protected if you've installed all recent security updates - in particular, if your grub2-common package is one of the following versions or later:\nUbuntu 15.10:\n  grub2-common                    2.02~beta2-29ubuntu0.2\n\nUbuntu 15.04:\n  grub2-common                    2.02~beta2-22ubuntu1.4\n\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS:\n  grub2-common                    2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1.6\n\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS:\n  grub2-common                    1.99-21ubuntu3.19\n\n", "Q: Building a light weight home server/NAS.

The target client computer(s) don't get to see the filesystem, only the files.\nSo the choice of filesystem is purely down to the RAID and management side of things on sghe NAS itself.\nTo that end I can highly recommend ZFS.

Points of potential interest:\n\n\n*\n\n*In this instance \"doesn't work\" means: it connects to the other networks, but it looks like no data is ever received (the network-manager icon says X KiB/s sent/received, and the sent will frequently show non-zero values but received seems never to show a non-zero value).\n\n*I've tried the proposed solutions at Wifi losing connection, weak signal, Intel 7260 adapter (various iwlwifi module options) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2300362 (latest iwlwifi microcode).\n\n*I've tried purging and reinstalling the network-manager package.\n\n*I've tried connecting an external USB wifi adapter (with a Broadcom chip, not Intel like the internal wifi chip) and got exactly the same result. This is when I realised something very strange is going on.\n\n*I've googled around and found various other \"wifi not working after upgrade issues\" but they all seemed specific to Broadcom chips.\n\n\nHere's the output of the wireless-info script when connected to a wifi network that my laptop used to work with but now doesn't: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sz858edudvpzgjj/wireless-info.txt?dl=0\nAnd for comparison here's the output of the script when connected to (the one and only) wifi network that my laptop still works with: https://www.dropbox.com/s/s8jfxut810c1r2d/wireless-info.working.txt?dl=0\n\nA: Inadvertently figured it out. After several months. Gah. The problem lay with the name resolution configuration (DNS settings). The settings I had worked with my home wifi but were incompatible with every other wifi network I tried. I only found out because I noticed that a service accessing a personal server of mine was working when my laptop was connected to some other wifi network, and the IP address for that server is set in /etc/hosts so no name resolution was required for it. After some digging around it turns out I needed to change the IP address for the name resolution service used by network-manager, defined in /etc/resolv.conf, from 192.168.1.1 to 127.0.1.1 (and then \"sudo service network-manager restart\").\n", "Q: Why does updating Ubuntu reset my boot order? Can I change this? I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu. Since I use Windows most often and just use Ubuntu to do development I'd like my computer to boot into Windows by default and only Ubuntu when I choose to. This works fine normally. However, invariably after I do a software update in Ubuntu, the boot order gets reset to Ubuntu first and Windows second. This isn't a huge deal, and is only a slight annoyance adding approx 1 min. to my boot time. Mainly, I just don't understand why or how Ubuntu does this. Every time it happens I go set the boot order in the BIOS and after and Ubuntu update the order resets back to Ubuntu on top.\n\nA: Ubuntu does this because it assumes you're installing it because you want to use it, so it makes it easy to boot.  If you want to change the default, find this line in /boot/grub/grub.cfg:\nset default=0\n\nand change it to\nset default=1\n\nAssuming that Windows is the second option in your grub menu.  If it's not, then replace 1 with [x-1] if x is Windows's place in the grub menu.\n", "Q: Input methods do not work I need to use English, Chinese and Spanish input methods on my computer.\nBoth the Chinese and Spanish input methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*show icon but they do not work\n\n*They currently function exactly the same as default English input method\n\n\nChinese:\n\n\n*\n\n*No Chinese pinyin candidates are shown.\n\n\nSpanish:\n\n\n*\n\n*tildas and Spanish n do not work either.\n\n\nSoftware:\n\n\n*\n\n*The same results for fcitx and ibus.\n\n\ndpkg --get-selections | grep ibus:\ngir1.2-ibus-1.0:amd64 install\nibus install\nibus-gtk:amd64 install\nibus-gtk3:amd64 install\nibus-libpinyin install\nibus-pinyin install\nibus-sunpinyin install\nibus-table install\nlibibus-1.0-5:amd64 install\nlibusageenvironment1 install\nlibusb-0.1-4:amd64 install\nlibusb-1.0-0:amd64 install\nlibusb-1.0-0:i386 install\nlibusbmuxd2:amd64 install\nlibusbredirhost1:amd64 install\nlibusbredirparser1:amd64 install\nlibustr-1.0-1:amd64 install\n\n\nA: Recently I had a problem with spanish input method (suddenly misconfigured).

Then, some weeks later, I installed Windows 10 on a separate 500GB HDD (Ubuntu deserves the SSD more than Windows!). \nBasically, my problem is that neither of the OS's know of each other, and in order to select the OS on startup, I have to enter the BIOS and manually boot off one or the other.

Both OS's work perfectly fine (I unplugged the Ubuntu disk when I installed Windows 10) and nothing is broken.\n\nA: You have to update grub's config file:\nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nThat should do the trick.\nIF grub isn't installed on /dev/sda (or the primary boot device, whatever that is) then run:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: Apache gives \"forbidden\" if the client's IP address is IPv6 [sorry, not even sure if my question makes sense].\nSome users of my website have been complaining that they are getting \"Forbidden\" apache error.\nAfter looking everywhere, I think the error is appearing whenever the requested user's IP address is IPv6.\nI tested this by using the tool \"www.browserling.com\".

Now when I turn on my computer it automatically boots into Ubuntu properly. Although If I boot and hold down alt it gives me one option which is to boot from \"Macintosh SSD\". Once selecting this my computer comes up with normal loading page and then goes to a circle with a line through it. Is it possible to boot back into OSX without reformatting my Macintosh SSD?\n\nA: Commonly if you don’t install refit/refind you can always boot OSX  in the way you described.\nThe icon you see indicates that the bootloader cannot  find / boot OSX\nprobably files or partition have been wiped / damaged\nDoes the HFS file system even seem to be there if you check in Linux?\ntry booting from a OSX Install stick to see if it even detects the contents of your OSX partitions or just do a repair / install from there.\n\nA: First, rEFIt has been abandoned for years, and doesn't work properly with the last couple of releases of OS X unless you jump through some extra installation hoops, so you're probably barking up the wrong tree if you're thinking of using rEFIt to solve your problems. That said, there is a fork of rEFIt, called rEFInd, that is up to date and that should work with (relatively) little fuss. (Disclaimer: I maintain rEFInd.) In fact, rEFInd might help you recover:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using any computer, download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of rEFInd.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from this download.\n\n*Try to boot your Mac with this version of rEFInd. If it comes up, you should see options to boot both OS X and Ubuntu. Try them both. (If there are multiple options, try them all. It's OK if some don't work, as long as you can boot both OSes via at least one option each.)\n\n*If rEFInd works, you can install it from OS X and it should work fine from the hard disk. You can then clean up the boot menu, if necessary, as described in the rEFInd documentation.\nThat said, what others have noted is a real concern: The failure symptom you describe could indicate damage to the OS X boot loader. If this is the case, you'll need to either re-install OS X or ask for recovery advice on a Mac forum. Recovery may well be possible, but this just isn't the best place to get that advice.\nIt's possible that we could offer some more advice if we could see the output (RESULTS.txt file) from the Boot Info Script. Post that file to a pastebin site and post the URL the site gives you here so we can see the output. This information might or might not provide clues about what's going wrong; if it's Mac-specific, the script might not provide the necessary information, and as I've said, a Mac forum would be a better place to ask about such things.\n\nA: It sounds like your issue is that your destroyed your OSX installation.

When I run the command sudo systemctl list-unit-files (I think the sudo is optional), I get output which shows all services and their state.\nHere is a snippet from my machine:\nUNIT FILE                                  STATE\n...\ndebian-fixup.service                       static  \ndebug-shell.service                        disabled\ndisplay-manager.service                    enabled \ndns-clean.service                          enabled \ndsmcad.service                             enabled \nemergency.service                          static  \nfailsafe-x.service                         static  \nfriendly-recovery.service                  masked  \nfuse.service                               masked  \ngdm.service                                masked  \ngetty-static.service                       static  \ngetty@.service                             enabled \ngpsd.service                               indirect\ngpsdctl@.service                           static  \ngpu-manager.service                        enabled \nhalt-local.service                         static  \nhalt.service                               masked  \nhostname.service                           masked\n...\n\nI wonder why some services are in the \"masked\" state. I think this means, \"this is better than 'disabling', because the service cannot be started, neither by hand or by systemd\".\nHow can I get more information about the state of a service unit? \nWho has put the units into their respective state? \nI tried, for example, \nsudo systemctl help dsmcad - that only brings up the documentation = ... line from the unit file. /etc/systemd/system/dsmcad.service\nNote: Here I know exactly what dsmcad service is and what it does, I have installed it myself. I am more interested in a general solution.\n\nA: mask is a stronger version of disable. Using disable all symlinks of the specified unit file are removed. If using mask the units will be linked to /dev/null. This will be displayed if you check e.g. by systemctl status halt.service. The advantage of mask is to prevent any kind of activation, even manual.\nCaution: systemctl list-unit-files is listing the state of the unit files (static, enabled, disabled, masked, indirect) and has nothing to do with the state of the service. To have a look at the services use systemctl list-units.\n\nA: 'mask' is a state of unit files which is considered as the \"third level of off\" (stop-1st, disable-2nd, mask-3rd). The services labeled as masked can neither be started manually (using the start command) nor by systems (at system boot). Therefore, use caution when employing the systemctl mask command on a service.\n\nA: hostname.service is masked as redundant because systemd sets the hostname (from /etc/hostname) very early on during startup.\nThis setting is provided by the Debian systemd package.\n$ ls -l /lib/systemd/system/hostname.service\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Apr  8 22:47 /lib/systemd/system/hostname.service -> /dev/null\n$ dpkg-query --search /lib/systemd/system/hostname.service\nsystemd: /lib/systemd/system/hostname.service\n\nSimilarly, Debian can now run without a shell script to halt the system, it's handled by systemd-shutdown (source code here) instead.\nIf a service has been masked manually, the mask will be installed in /etc/systemd/system instead.\nServices are also masked when they are removed on Debian/Ubuntu.  I don't know why.\n\nA: Since you are requesting information about the masked state, it is important to mention that it can be observed in a service that after started, had it definitions modified, reload (systemctl daemon-reload) and the new state is NOT ok.\nOne easy example to understand it is the following scenario:\na) the service is running well (already started)\nb) edit the service definition file and delete everything in its contents\nc) reload\nd) state masked will be observed too\n\nHence, the masked state may be originated from a improper service definitions.\nTherefore, the user may induce unmasked state by editing improperly the service.\nObservation: I'm not sure if it happens on purpose or it is a simple bug (default option), but it may be some interesting info to share\n", "Q: Why do inotify events fire more than once This question arises from another one that I had posed on Stackoverflow. I am using Watcher - the same issues apply to Incron - to monitor a folder and its child folders for changes and silently squirrel away those changes to Dropbox. \nI monitor the write_close event - IN_CLOSE_WRITE - for the purpose.  Originally I was watching the modify event, i.e. IN_MODIFY.  While this worked I found that when writing large files it would fire more than once.  That sounded fair so I switched to IN_CLOSE_WRITE since I felt that it was reasonably fair to assume that for a given file it would only occur once.  \nHowever, that is not the case. Even for a very small text file - just one character - created in Nano the event occurs two times. At best this can result in unnecessary traffic when the same file is synchronized on Dropbox two times. In my own case it leads to disaster since on the first event I perform the synchronization and then delete the server side file. The result - on the second event the Dropbox side file becomes a 0 byte file.\nI am dealing with this for now by making my synchronization script sleep for 10s \nbefore I do anything else and then I check that the file in question still exists prior to attempting Dropbox sync.  This works because on the second iteration the file is missing and the script just terminates.\nThis sounds hackish at best.  Perhaps not a bad hack but I would prefer to understand - just why does even the IN_CLOSE_WRITE event occur more than one time?\n\nSome additional information\n\n\n*\n\n*Check to ensure that there aren't multiple instances of watcher running.\n\n\nOutput from ps ax|grep watcher.py\n23880 ?        Sl     0:01 python /usr/local/bin/watcher.py restart\n24977 pts/0    S+     0:00 grep --color=auto watcher.py\n\nThe file system is ext4.  I should mention that I have encountered precisely the same issue with Incron.  I start the Watcher daemon up from a batch script executed via /etc/rc2.d.  Incron OTH starts up without any messing about by me via its default apt-get install incron installation.\n\nThe essence of my watcher.ini file is shown below.\n[DEFAULT]\nlogfile=/var/log/watcher.log\npidfile=/var/run/watcher.pid\n\n[job1]\nwatch=/path/to/watch\n\nevents=write_close\nexcluded=\nrecursive=true\nautoadd=true\n\ncommand=/home/datastore.php $filename\n\nI reduced the datastore.php script to the bare essentials to verify that it is fired up twice without any of my messy Dropbox upload + source delete code.\n#! /usr/bin/php\n<?php\nfile_put_contents('/tmp/watcher',$argv[1],FILE_APPEND);\n\n?>\n\nI then created a little file at the path in question and then examined /tmp/watcher.  The problem still persists - the file still has two successive entries for $argv[1].\n\nA: I've just had this using IN_CLOSE_WRITE and finally tracked down the problem.\nMy original script was reading in mail from stdin line by line and then writing each line to the file. This was causing incron to fire on every line write. I saw this based on the number of incron events and how many lines were in the file.\nI then changed the original script to read all of stdin in before writing the file. Once this was in place I no longer saw multiple incron executions on the same file.\n\nA: I don't have enough rep to post this as a comment, but are you sure that temporary, possibly-hidden files are not being created? I had a similar issue with inotifywait firing multiple times, but I realized it was because vim would create a .swp file when editing, which would fire an event when closing. It would also pick up the close event from the original file.\nIt sounds like you're noticing the event firing multiple files on the same file though, which is not something I've been able to reproduce -- this would only happen once for the temp file and once for the original.\nI tried a quick test with nano and I don't think it creates a temp file at all (at least for the few character case), but is there anything else in your setup that could rely on similar behavior?\n\nA: I am not sure, but most probably the first write_close writes file attributes into it, like creation time, and only after that it writes actual data.\nIn fact rsync creates a temp file and when everything is done it moves the temp file to the actual file in the same folder so it is easy to monitor has been normally created in when you use rsync, and move is an atomic operation. On the other hand there is something calle one shot in inotify, probably that using that we can trigger something on the first modify message, and as you suggested sleep for reasonable amount of time before starting the operation.

It would consist in deleting the windows partitions first, then expanding your ubuntu partition.\nIf you want to proceed with a clean install, you will have to delete all your partitions with the ubuntu installer, and then perform a clean install.\nOf course, the first step is to build a proper bootable medium. This seems to be your main problem here. You could use Unetbootin to do this. Its interface is quite user-friendly, you shouldn't have any problem with it.\nWhen you have your bootable USB drive, restart your computer, and accede your BIOS to select it as the boot medium.

I have been following this tutorial to make it work :: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/\nThere is a section of EFI boot fix int blog just mentioned. It asks me after the installation and before restarting run two commands \n1) sudo apt-get install efibootmgr\n2) sudo efibootmgr\nBut when I run the second command on the terminal I get an error saying ::\nFatal: Couldn't open either sysfs or procfs directories for accessing EFI variables.\nTry 'modprobe efivars' as root.\n\nI have tried searching but nothing makes sense to me, since I am very new to running commands on terminal (have always been working on windows).\nI want to dual boot Mac OS X and Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro.\nI have tried ignoring this step, and then my Ubuntu doesn't boot, it starts the Mac OS. Thanks for any help! :)\n\nA: Most modern computers, including all Intel-based Macs, can be booted in either of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI/UEFI mode -- This is the native mode for most modern computers (PCs introduced in mid-2011 or later, and all Intel-based Macs). This is a fundamentally new boot mode from the older BIOS system. It offers both advantages and disadvantages compared to BIOS. The efibootmgr program will work only if you've booted in EFI mode. (Note that UEFI is simply EFI version 2.x. Macs still use EFI 1.x, and so technically aren't UEFI; but 90% of what you read about UEFI booting still applies to Macs in EFI mode.)\n\n*BIOS/CSM/legacy mode -- Older computers have BIOSes, not EFIs. Most EFIs provide a feature called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables them to launch OSes designed for BIOS mode. This is often called \"legacy-mode booting.\" The CSM is intended as a stopgap tool for backwards compatibility. On Macs, it's often used to enable the computer to dual-boot with Windows (especially Windows 7 and earlier) in BIOS mode and OS X in EFI mode.\n\n\nUbuntu can boot in either mode, but knowing which mode you're in can be tricky. The surest way to tell is to look for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode. If it's absent, you've probably booted in BIOS mode. The mode in which you booted the Ubuntu installer determines whether it installed a BIOS-mode or EFI-mode version of GRUB.\nIn any event, your symptoms indicate that you've booted Ubuntu in BIOS mode, not in EFI mode. In most cases, this is undesirable. The easiest way to fix the problem is to install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. Several are available, as detailed on this page of mine. Traditionally, Mac users have favored rEFIt for this task; however, rEFIt has been abandoned for several years. My fork of it, rEFInd, is under active maintenance. Chances are if you install rEFInd under OS X, you'll be able to boot Ubuntu from the rEFInd menu when you next reboot. You may need to do a little cleaning up afterwards, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your disk probably has a hybrid MBR, which is an ugly and dangerous hack. It's unnecessary when booting all your OSes in EFI mode, so unless you're triple-booting with Windows, you should probably convert the hybrid MBR to a legal protective MBR. You can do this by making a tiny change with GParted or parted or by using gdisk: Type x to enter the experts' menu, followed by n to create a new protective MBR and then w to save your changes. Note, however, that if you're triple-booting with Windows, you probably need your hybrid MBR.\n\n*You may end up with extra boot options in rEFInd's menu. In particular, there may be a BIOS-mode entry for Ubuntu that might or might not work. You can eliminate it by editing (from Ubutu) /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is not among the options. Depending on what else you've installed, you may see other options you don't need and/or that don't work. You can customize rEFInd with other refind.conf options, like the dont_scan_files, dont_scan_dirs, and dont_scan_volumes options. Peruse the comments in the configuration file or read the rEFInd configuration documentation for details.\n\n\nA: Did you try typing \nsudo modprobe efivars\n\nlike suggested? This will load a kernel module required to access some EFI settings.\n", "Q: Several JDK on one machine I run Ubuntu with standar java that come with it (1.7).

While installing various programs, I get asked to download some packages that are required for it to work. Some of them are well known applications, where the read-me document is trustworthy whereas some other lesser known programs are the ones where I guess I need to be careful.\nSo, I'm trying to install a game known as Tennis Elbow, where the read me doc says:\n\nOn Ubuntu 14.10 64bit, the following instructions have been reported to work:\nsudo apt-get install libcurl3:i386\nsudo apt-get install libvorbisfile3:i386\n\n\nSo, how can we know if the files I download are safe or not?\nI know this seems like more than one question, but I basically need this game to work, and so I just need know if I it is safe to install the packages mentioned or not.\n\nA: Is it possible to install a malicious program using apt-get? Sure, but that requires there to be malicious software in your computer's listed repositories. That can happen:\n\n*\n\n*If you have added a malicious repository, it can provide malicious packages. PPAs, for example could contain malicious code. They can also provide any package (they could provide an ubuntu-minimal replacement that would infect everybody.\n\n\n*But not just PPAs. Software in the main repositories could be infected, either because the Ubuntu maintainer is hacked or disgruntled, or because the Debian upstream maintainer is hacked or disgruntled, or that the original developer is hacked or disgruntled and that bad code filters through uncaught.\n\n\n*Somebody has somehow managed to intercept your network traffic and has also somehow managed to either sign a packages' manifest or alter a binary package without altering the package checksum.\nBoth are incredibly unlikely unless you've been adding random keys, but even then it's hard to do without being at least partially on-site. It's a pretty complicated hack to pull off.\nBut is any of that it likely here? Is it telling you to install malicious software?\nNo. It's just asking you to install 32bit versions of these libraries because it uses them but was compiled against their 32bit versions.\nBut what are they? libcurl3 is used for downloading things within an application and  libvorbisfile3 is for decoding Vorbis-encoded audio.\nThe :i386 on the end of the package name means. It's specifying the architecture. In Ubuntu's case, we use i386 to mean 32bit, it's actually compiled with i686 processor instructions.\n\nIf you're going to be paranoid about anything, downloading and running a closed source binary from a random website is the real danger here.\n", "Q: I cannot install OR run a live session of Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 either with a USB key or DVD I use Ubuntu Unity but recently wanted to look at other distros such as elementary and gnome.

The long-lived branch delivers the current stable drivers which also are included in the official Ubuntu repositories. The short-lived branch intermediately delivers the latest official drivers with bug fixes and improvements. These drivers are distributed through the Proprietary GPU Drivers PPA and though they are stable, they are not officially tested on Ubuntu. This means, when you install them, you do it on your own risk.  \nRecommendation :  \nGenerally you should use the drivers from the official Ubuntu repositories.

But then one day, steam decided to stop loading with the infamous error:\nlibGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: swrast\n\nNow here's the case, I've spent like 6-8 hours trying to solve this, going to various forums looking for solutions, here's what I've done so far(at least that I can remember):\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting Nvidia driver and Steam in various orders through various methods, restarting computer like 20 times in doing that. (fail)\n\n*Tried to figure out why it couldn't pick up libGL by trying to open that little gear spinning program, that should fail the same way steam does and show why it did, but it didn't fail and showed basically bugger all to me (fail)\n\n*I've done all the system updating, everything I could imagine, still no results (fail)\nAdditional IMPORTANT (I guess) info: Now I've got them both installed and I've found that if I select Intel HD graphics card, I can load steam, but if I've Nvidia selected, no luck. Interesting thing to me is, that I can run other linux programs and even games (Like Doom 2 modifier Zandronum) it is just that Steam refuses to work, when Nvidia card is selected.\nLast bit: While providing help, keep in mind that I'm a complete novice at Ubuntu so try to keep it as simple as possible, also, I maybe could of done something wrong in the second method or misunderstood something, that's also a possibility, lastly, if I need to provide any other information, just ask nicely, I'll do it as fast as I can.\nP.S. Don't hesitate to ask 'Have you tried doing X?' Cause I might have forgotten about it, since I searched for the fix the day before posting this.\n\nA: SOLVED\nSo, after approximately another 4 hours of thinking and searching around the net, I deduced that the issue was due to the driver which I selected to install and I was right.\nThe Nvidia driver that I had was from Software & Updates>>Additional Drivers ,of course, the newest version.\nThe reason Steam worked 5 days before my post, was that I don't know how but I installed some outdated driver from a .run file, so I basically just recreated the process using the newest Nvidia drivers from their official website, here's what you have to do if you are having the same problem (don't worry, I'm an Ubuntu casual, it will be very easy to follow, also after the first 2 steps you won't be able to see your desktop, so prepare a paper and a pen, and write down these steps before doing anything):\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall whatever Nvidia driver you have currently installed, then download drivers that were made EXACTLY for your Nvidia card and linux operating (32-bit or 64-bit) system from the official Nvidia website.\nP.S. if you want the same exact steps as mine, keep the downloaded .run file in Downloads, also, write down its name on your paper, for example, mine was: NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-352.63.run\n\n*Press CTRL+ALT+F2 (the black screen that appears is what's supposed to happen, don't worry)\n\n*Type in your log-in info (The user name in lowercase letters, for example, mine was: benas. Then when asked, type the password)\n\n*Write sudo service lightdm stop or sudo stop lightdm whichever seems to be working for you. You'll know that it is working if you get no response from the terminal\"\n\n*Write sudo init 3\n\n*Write sudo -i or sudo su root You'll know that it's working just by looking at the very left of the line, were you are supposed to type the commands, it should say root before your name.\n\n*Write cd /home/yourusername(in my case was just: benas)/Downloads (Or it can be any directory where you put the .run file, just navigate to it)\n\n*Write sh The-downloaded-file-name-here.run (As mentioned earlier, in my case was: NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-352.63.run)\n\n*Press yes and I accept where nescessary, what I also told the installer to do, was to install the 32 bit libraries when it asked me if I wanted, I don't know if that has any impact but you can do it aswell, just to be safe.\n\n*Type reboot when the installer finishes, after this, Steam should load and play games normally.\nThis all complicating installation method was requiered for me, because I would get the: you appear to be running an x server problem, which this method seemed to solve.\nP.S. The only downside of the driver from official Nvidia site is that I'm no longer able to select my Intel HD Graphics card, other than that, everything's fine.\n", "Q: Is there an app for easily switching between screens?

I'd recommending reading this article if you want to know more about this: https://www.leaseweb.com/labs/2013/06/creating-custom-debian-packages/\nUpdate\nI don't know why I missed what you were asking before but to get multiple questions on the same screen at the same time you'd use beginblock and endblock:\ndb_beginblock\ndb_input medium foo/like_debian || true\ndb_input medium foo/like_debian2 || true\ndb_endblock\ndb_go\n\nThis should do the trick. Also, just FYI your db_get commands are only necessary if you want to get the previous value and since you're default is true and this is a postinst script they're probably not necessary in your example. Also keep in mind that not all interfaces support this beginblock/endblock so depending on how you're testing this you may or may not see it.

After i migrated windows 10 from my hdd to my ssd it worked fine.\nBut as i want to dualboot Ubuntu 14.04.03 i still have this task to do.\nSo i made a bootable usb stick for this Ubuntu version and wanted to install it. Therefore i created 3 partitions. 1 for the OS itself, 1 for the Home and 1 linux-swap partition. But gparted also shows me one partition, which filesystem can´t be detected. It´s 128 MB and i´m pretty sure it´s the MSR Partition for the ssd. So if i now want to install Ubuntu it stucks after i  need to check \"Download Updates\" and \"Third-Party Software\" and press Ok.\nI´m pretty sure this happens because of the msr partition, but i don´t know what to do about it.\nPlease Help!\nThanks.\n\nA: The acronym \"MSR\" means \"Microsoft Reserved.\" This partition is a standard part of recent Windows installations. It's basically unused space that Microsoft wants to be present so that its disk utilities will have some \"scratch space\" to be used for certain operations, if and when the need arises. This partition is almost certainly not the source of your problem. As it's present on the vast majority of new Windows installations, it's present on huge numbers of Ubuntu installations, so if it were causing problems, the Internet would be flooded with problem reports concerning the partition. That hasn't happened.\nOffhand, my initial guess about your problem is that the installer is having trouble accessing an archive site because of a bad Internet connection -- either a temporary problem or something more systemic. If so, you might do better to disconnect your computer completely when doing the installation. You won't be able to download updates while installing, but you can do so after installing, when you'll be better able to experiment with different repository sites to find one that works for you.\nThat's just my initial guess, though. It could be that something completely different is causing your problems. If so, you may need to debug the problem further, as described here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingUbiquity\n", "Q: problem with tp_smapi on ubuntu 15.4 lenovo thinkpad e440 I can not load tp_smapi on my ubuntu15.4 lenovo thikpad e440.

Anyways, since it also broke my network I had to route the host through the guest which connected using USB tethering(host's USB) and I got all of those packages back to bring the system back to stability.\nOut of curiosity, I tried doing a dist-upgrade again and it still says the same thing. I want to run dist-upgrade to get these packages upgraded: linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic openjdk-7-jdk openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jre-headless because the regular apt-get upgrade doesn't touch them.\nMy first question is: how do I upgrade these packages without getting the other beloved packages removed?\nAnd the second question obviously is: is it normal that dist-upgrade makes the system unstable? Shouldn't it replace the packages it removes with something better in case they were removed because of incompatibility with the new packages dist-upgrade wanted to install on the system?\nRegarding the possible duplicate flag: I did not add a PPA in the past month.\n\nA: Thanks to David's pointers and my research on sysvinit over the past few days, I found out the cause of this to be this debian repo : deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian squeeze main\nAs soon as I commented it out and updated the sources, I got rid of the incorrect dist-upgrade suggestions.\nEven though I haven't totally cured my ignorance on the difference between sysvinit and upstart, all I know from my research is that Ubuntu had replaced sysvinit with (POSIX)upstart when Adam was a boy (although Trusty still has a valid  candidate for sysvinit that may cause troubles by deleting upstart like it did on my system).\n$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list | egrep -v \"^#|trusty|^$\"\ndeb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian squeeze main\ndeb http://www.emdebian.org/debian/ squeeze main\n\nThis is essentially how I located the non-trusty repos. Just commenting out the first one did the trick.\nIf you accidentally remove these packages, do not restart the system for obvious reasons; the desktop environment is robust enough to work until a reboot even if it is removed. Then, try to see how you can get network; there's only so little you can do with the control-center out and no network-manager on the system. I employed the hack of using two network interfaces on a VM I had running on the VirtualBox and then routed the traffic from the host(ubuntu) through the guest which got its internet from USB tethering.\nAnd then just go ahead and type \"Yes, do as I say!\", when aptitude asks this:\nAfter this operation, 4,424 kB of additional disk space will be used.\nYou are about to do something potentially harmful.\nTo continue type in the phrase 'Yes, do as I say!'\n\nWeird how aptitude didn't even care a little while removing upstart but got upset when it came to sysvinit!\n", "Q: Blank screen after installing ubuntu on flash drive and booting it from computer with Windows 10 preinstalled After installing ubuntu on a flash drive and setting the bios to load OS from that drive, I boot to a blank screen.\n After a minute or so Windows will boot from the hard drive.\n I am working with an Asus gl552v, nvidia gtx 960m, Windows 10 installed.\nThis is my first time setting up ubuntu, or any OS really I am very new to this, any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nA: If your PC has UEFI/Secureboot enabled, it can as it should ignore USB devices as bootable media.  \nWindows then boots when it decides not to trust a USB peripheral.\n", "Q: Installation of Openstack via autopilot with only one Disk per Node I plan to use autopilot to install a Openstack cloud on a bunch of servers, which have single SSDs installed.

Can I perform 'sudo' actions with different password other than my login password?\nIs there any way to achieve this?\n\nA: No, you can not.\nsudo basically enables one to impersonate other user (by default root) by providing the credential for the user who is running the sudo command (given the user running sudo is in the sudoers file with sufficient privilege).\nAt most, you can run specific commands with NOPASSWD parameter so that those commands while running with sudo won't require your password but in all other cases you can not use any other password rather than your account's one.\n", "Q: \"java -version\" showing a different output. How to find the installed folder and configure JAVA_HOME and JDK_HOME? I downloaded and installed the JDK+Netbeans bundle from the Oracle website, but when I type java -version at the terminal, I get this output:  \n$ java -version\nThe program 'java' can be found in the following packages:\n * default-jre\n * gcj-4.8-jre-headless\n * openjdk-7-jre-headless\n * gcj-4.6-jre-headless\n * openjdk-6-jre-headless\nTry: sudo apt-get install <selected package>  \n\nFirstly, what does this mean? Are there multiple versions of java installed on my system?\nSecondly, there is a JDK folder that got created after I installed Netbeans+JDK.

Are there multiple versions of java installed on my system?\n\nNo, but the one you installed in /usr/local/jdk1.8.0_65 isn't located by other programs like netbeans or android that depend on Java. To verify it for yourself, just open up your terminal and add the folder containing java executable to your path variable like this:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/jdk1.8.0_65/bin:$PATH\"\n\nTo test whether this was successful, go to any directory and fire this command:\njava -version\n\nOnce that is a success, go to netbeans folder and execute it:\n./netbeans\n\nIf all other settings are good, it should run and so should android! To make the changes permanent, add the path modifier to your ~/.profile file (otherwise, you will have to issue the export command each time you open the terminal to work with java).\n\nA: \nFirstly, what does this mean? Are there multiple versions of java installed on my system?\n\nNo, these are package options to install to get java. You have currently chosen to install outside the package system. \nIt is simplest to use the package-supported versions of java if you can. This way you can simply update your packages, rather than having to install another JDK and change all of your pointers to the new version. \n\nThirdly, Android Studio isn't able to find JDK_HOME even though I gave export JDK_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.8.0_65 in bashrc.

(OS X El Capitan) I just downloades Ubuntu 14.04.3 (1GB) and I don't know exactly what to do next. Can someone please explain in detail what should I do. I also downloaded Virtual Box. Thank you so much for taking your time to answer :)\n\nA: Following is the step-by-step guide for you to install Ubuntu on VirtualBox on Mac OSX:\n\n\n*\n\n*At first open your VirtualBox app. When VirtualBox opens, click the New button.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Give your “virtual machine” a name (something descriptive is good, but it doesn’t matter). Make sure the Type: is set to Linux and the Version: is Ubuntu (64 bit). Then click the Continue button.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now you’re going to decide how much memory (RAM) you’re going to allocate to Ubuntu when it’s running, and how much to leave for OS X. As illustrated in the screenshot below, my total RAM is 4GB, so I allocated half of it to Ubuntu, and the other half to OS X. The more memory you give to Ubuntu, the faster it will run. The drawback is that OS X will have less to use while Ubuntu is running. At a minimum, give Ubuntu at 1GB (1024MB) of RAM. When you’ve decided how much memory (RAM) to give Ubuntu, click the Continue button.\n\n\n\n\n\n*On the Hard drive screen, select Create a virtual hard drive now and then click Create.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now select VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) and click Continue\n\n\n\n*Select Dynamically allocated and yep – you guessed it – click Continue\n\n\n\n*Give the “VirtualBox Disk Image” a name (again, doesn’t really matter, but descriptive is always helpful). Use the “slider” to determine the size you want to make the “hard drive” for Ubuntu. At a minimum, you’ll want to select 6GB – and that will not allow for you to install many programs, let alone store files etc. Keep in mind that because you selected “Dynamically allocated” in the previous step, that does not mean that VirtualBox is going to take up that space right away. It means that as Ubuntu needs more space, it will allow the “hard drive” to increase up to whatever size you set at this step.\nAs illustrated in the screenshot below, I opted to give Ubuntu 8GB. That’s enough for the installation and to install quite a few programs. If you have a big hard drive, you might as well allocate more rather than less, again – the space won’t be used until it’s needed. After you’ve made your selection, click Create.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Almost time to install Ubuntu! Click the Start button.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Right away you’ll be prompted to locate a file. Click the “folder” icon next to menu that says Empty (see screenshot below).\n\n\n\n\n\n*Navigate to the Ubuntu .iso file that you downloaded. Select it, and click Open\n\n\n\n*Now click Start\n\n\n\n*As Ubuntu boots for the very first time, VirtualBox will ‘pop up’ little messages explaining how the keyboard and mouse will work with your new ‘virtual machine’. Read them, then click the little X to close them.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Finally! Click Install Ubuntu\n\n\n\n*Ubuntu will run a quick test to ensure your computer is capable of running on it. Once it’s passed those tests, make sure to place a check in both of the boxes – Download updates while installing and Install this third-party software – then click the Continue button.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select Erase disk and install Ubuntu. NOTE: this is not going to ‘wipe out’ or erase any data in OS X. None. It is safe to click Install Now, so do just that.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click Continue\n\n\n\n*When prompted, select your Time Zone and then click Continue\n\n\n\n*Select the keyboard layout and language you want, then Continue\n\n\n\n*Fill in each field with the required information. When you’re done, Continue\n\n\n\n*Now it’s time to sit back and relax with that cup of coffee or tea. This may take a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Yay! It’s done! Click Restart Now\n\n\n\n*If Ubuntu doesn’t start loading, and you’re left at a screen with what looks a bit like gibberish, have no fear. Click the OS X “Close” button (the red one in the upper left corner).\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select Power off the machine and click OK. You’ll be left back at the main VirtualBox window. Just click the Start button again.\n\n\n\n\n\n*And you’ll boot into Ubuntu! Enter your password when prompted.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Welcome to the Ubuntu Desktop! At this point you should be connected to the Internet and completely ready to go – have fun!\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to run multiple commands in parallel and see output from both? Specifically, I want to run\nlsyncd lsyncd.lua\n\nAnd\nwebpack --progress --color -w\n\nWhich are both long-running processes. I want to see the output from both, interlaced in my terminal. It doesn't matter if the results are a bit jumbled, I just like to see that they're doing what they're supposed to.\nAlso, I want it to kill both processes when I press Ctrl+C.\n\nI'm trying\nparallel ::: 'lsyncd lsyncd.lua' 'webpack --progress --color -w'\n\nwhich seems to be working, but I can't see any output even though when I run those commands individually, they output something.\n\nA: GNU Parallel defaults to postponing output until the job is finished. You can instead ask it to print output as soon there is a full line.\nparallel  --lb ::: 'lsyncd lsyncd.lua' 'webpack --progress --color -w'\n\nIt avoids half-line mixing of the output:\nparallel -j0 --lb 'echo {};echo -n {};sleep {};echo {}' ::: 1 3 2 4\n\nSpend 20 minutes reading chapter 1+2 of GNU Parallel 2018 (online, printed). Your command line will love you for it.\n\nA: Using parallel (in the moreutils package):\nparallel -j 2 -- 'lsyncd lsyncd.lua' 'webpack --progress --color -w'\n\nSince the parallel process runs in the foreground, hitting CTRL+C will terminate all the processes running on top of it at once.\n\n\n*\n\n*-j: Use to limit the number of jobs that are run at the same time;\n\n*--: separates the options from the commands.\n\n\n% parallel -j 2 -- 'while true; do echo foo; sleep 1; done' 'while true; do echo bar; sleep 1; done'\nbar\nfoo\nbar\nfoo\nbar\nfoo\n^C\n%\n\n\nA: & to the rescue. It launches the two processes in parallel.\nlsyncd lsyncd.lua & webpack --progress --color -w\nThis will do the trick. \nDidn't read the kill part. A ctrl+C here would only terminate the second one. The process preceding the & runs in the background although it outputs on the stdout.\nThe shortest way to terminate both processes is:\n1. Type Ctrl+C once. It kills the foreground process.\n2. Type fg and type Ctrl+C again. It brings the background process to foreground and kills it too.\nHTH!\n\nA: You have more options. Run the first command and press Ctrl-Z. This puts the command to wait in the background. Now type bg and it will run in background. Now run the second command and press Ctrl-Z again. Type bg again and both programs will run in background.\nNow you can type jobs and it will print which commands are running in background. Type fg <job number> to put program in foreground again. If you omit the job number it will put the last job in the foreground. When the job is in foreground you can stop it with Ctrl-C. I don't know how you would stop both with one Ctrl-C.\nYou can also add & at the end which puts it running in the background immediately without Ctrl-Z and bg. You can still bring it in foreground with fg.\n\nA: There is a light-weight way of doing it without installing anyting.\nStep 1: Create a script file runner.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nlsyncd lsyncd.lua &\nP1=$!\nwebpack --progress --color -w &\nP2=$!\nwait $P1 $P2\n\nStep 2: Make it executable\nchmod +x runner.sh\n\nStep 3: Run it\n./runner.sh\n\nIt works like cream\nExplanation: \n\n\n*\n\n*some_command & means run some_command and put it in background\n\n*lsyncd lsyncd.lua & means run lsyncd lsyncd.lua and put this process in background.\n\n\nNote: this works with Debian based Linux distros like Ubuntu\n\nA: Using GNU parallel\n1. Output ordered by finishing time of each command\nYou could group your parallel executed commands by using parallel (install it with sudo apt install gnu_parallel) with the argument --group. This ensures, that the output of each command waits till the command has finished (avoids mixed output).\nExample:\nparallel --group 'echo -n {};sleep {};echo {}' ::: 1 3 2 4\n\nOutput:\n11\n22\n33\n44\n\nFrom the manual (man parallel):\n--group: Group output. Output from each job is grouped together and is \nonly printed when the command is finished.\n\n2. Output ordered by the order of input parameters\nAnother option is to control the output by the  order of input parameters by using the -k argument.\nExample:\nparallel -k 'echo -n {};sleep {};echo {}' ::: 1 3 2 4\n\nOutput:\n11\n33\n22\n44\n\nFrom the manual (man parallel):\n--keep-order, -k: Keep sequence of output same as the order of input. \nNormally the output of a job will be printed as soon as the job completes.\n\n", "Q: ${debian_chroot:-} Why bother with :-? \n*\n\n*.bashrc and bash.bashrc include:\n[ -z \"${debian_chroot:-}\" ]\n\n\n*Bash manpage states the following on parameter expansions of the following form: ${parameter:-word}\nIf parameter is unset or null,  the  expansion of word is substituted. Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.\n\n*Why write \n\"${debian_chroot:-}\"\n\nand not simply\n\"${debian_chroot}\"\n\n?\nAnswer I'm going with: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/3xb9sp/debian_chroot_why_bother_with/\n\nA: The part that you mention comes earlier in the .bashrc, while what's mentioned in the duplicate comes a little bit later, in the PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ ' part. They work together, though !\nSo what does the code you mention  say in terms of plain English ? Here it is for reference.\nif [ -z \"${debian_chroot:-}\" ] && [ -r /etc/debian_chroot ]; then\n    debian_chroot=$(cat /etc/debian_chroot)\nfi\n\nIt starts with this part ${debian_chroot:-}.  Do we have that debian_chroot variable set ? If yes, echo that variable, but if not - echo whatever comes after -. And what comes after - ? Nothing ! Exactly that !  Why bother ? What if the variable is set ? Then we don't need to execute body of the if statement and just use debian_chroot variable as is inside PS1 prompt later. Remember I said those two pieces of code work together ? OK, moving on.\nNext step, if we evaluated the variable to be blank, we check for existance of readable /etc/debian_chroot file. On Ubuntu 14.04 at least , there's no /etc/debian_chroot file. So whenever you start bash it goes \"Oh, so debian_chroot is not set and we don't have that file there . . .OK, leave only \\u@\\h:\\w\\$ inside the prompt ! \"\nNow what happens if we DO have that file ? \nxieerqi:\n$ sudo vi /etc/debian_chroot\n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \n\nxieerqi:\n$ bash\n(HELLOWORLD)xieerqi@eagle:~$ echo $debian_chroot\nHELLOWORLD\n(HELLOWORLD)xieerqi@eagle:~$ \n\nOK, trace the code again : do we have debian_chroot set ? No. Do we have that /etc/debian_chroot file ? Yes, so take its contents , and shove them into this users PS1 prompt.  Looks like that's exactly what happened in my output, right ?\n", "Q: Far Cry doesn't start I downloaded uplay and I redeemed a Far Cry 4 code.

I want this functionality so bad. (Fun note, my new machine is running way faster again)\nOn Windows you can press Super + Arrow keys to resize your window.\nAn example of this working almost perfectly on ubuntu 15.10 already is that you can drag your window to the right, top, or left to have it cover right half, full, or left half respectively.\nI'd like to do this without dragging and use my arrow keys ie. Super + Right would cause the window to cover the right half of the screen.\nI feel like it's as simple as finding the command that already does this and making keyboard shortcuts, but how do I find this command?\n\nA: I think, out of the box, Ubuntu  15.10 can do something very similar, except the key combo is Ctrl + Super + arrows.\n\nA: Thanks fossfreedom for pointing in the direction of CompizConfig Settings Manager.\n\n\n*\n\n*install compizconfig-settings-manager (sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager)\n\n*Go to the Window Management > Grid\n\n*Enter shortcuts there\nScreenshot of the compizconfig-settings-manager Grid settings\nedit:\nEven more fun is this project: https://github.com/pkkid/pygrid giving the same functionality without compiz.\n\nA: The functionality is built-in, Ctrl+Alt+Keypad.

What it should be is like the following:\n-rwxr-sr-x 1 root crontab 35984 Feb  9  2013 /usr/bin/crontab\n\nTo set your crontab to the above permissions, first change the ownership:\nsudo chown root:crontab /usr/bin/crontab\n\nThen set the permissions:\nsudo chmod 2755 /usr/bin/crontab\n\nThat should set your crontab to the correct permissions to run.\nEDIT:\nAlso, take a look at the /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ folder, you should see something similar to the following:\nterrance@terrance-ubuntu:~$ sudo ls -al /var/spool/cron/crontabs/\ntotal 16\ndrwx-wx--T 2 root     crontab 4096 Dec 17 22:08 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root     root    4096 Dec  1 07:24 ..\n-rw------- 1 root     crontab 1185 Dec 17 22:08 root\n-rw------- 1 terrance crontab 1130 Dec 17 21:47 terrance\n\nPay attention to your username.  If it doesn't have the proper ownership, change it by typing in the following:\nsudo chown username:crontab /var/spool/cron/crontabs/username\n\nAnd if permissions need to be set on that file:\nsudo chmod 600 /var/spool/cron/crontabs/username\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to dual-boot Windows 10 with Ubuntu This question has been asked several times, I am aware of that. However, the tutorials/responses that I have looked at mention partitioning the hard drive with certain specifications using GParted, which I don't know how to use or even how to open. I am running a Windows 10 Home system, and I would like to install Ubuntu alongside it (for various reasons). I already have the Windows 10 installation media and Ubuntu 15 installation media (on a USB drive). Where do I go from here?

If any other information on my system is needed, feel free to ask!\n\nA: GParted is simple to use. If you run the Live Ubuntu USB and select Try Ubuntu, it will load up Ubuntu from the USB. Click on the Ubuntu icon in the top left of the screen or hit your Windows key. Type GParted, and click on Gparted Partition Manager to open it. It will automatically scan for drives. In the top right corner of the window you will be able to select the drive you want to manage. They'll be called /dev/sda  /dev/sdb and so on. They should also tell you the size next to them. Select your SSD. Make sure it isn't mounted by right-clicking and clicking Unmount (If it's already unmounted it'll say Mount instead). Then Click the green arrow on top to resize the partition. A new window will open where you can drag the ends to the size you want. Probably about 150GB for Windows and 100GB for Ubuntu, but however you want. Then click on the gray area you just created, and click the White page with the plus symbol to create a new partition. Select the type you want (Probably go for NTFS and then when you install ubuntu it'll format it to the kind it needs, ext4, I believe). You may want to add a label to distinguish them later on. Click ok. Now click the green check mark to perform these actions. Don't interrupt it while it's messing with ther partitions.

At my high school, I am competing in a cyber security competition, and we are given virtual machines of operating systems with security vulnerabilities that we must correct. Ubuntu is one of the operating systems we are given. To assist myself in the competition, I have written a shell script that automates some tasks. It is a normal shell script that is meant to be run with Bash (I use #!/bin/bash in the script instead of the typical #!/bin/sh because it uses some Bash-specific features) but it always acts strange in the virtual machines.

Ubuntu 15.10 x86_64\nWhile trying to do an install of Bumblebee, I followed instructions to add the xorg-edgers PPA. A more recent tutorial advised against it. However, by then,it was already too late: several packages were already updated to the xorg-edgers versions.\nI thought I might be able to go into Synaptic and force-version these packages back to Canonical. This worked for some packages, but it quickly turned into a dependency nightmare. Some downgrades wanted to uninstall other packages, and some (libegl1-mesa-dev), if elected to be downgraded rather than removed, threatened to uninstall nearly every package currently installed, including everything xorg.\nIs there an easy way to roll back everything from a PPA back to Canonical?\n**In response to \"possible duplicate\", removing the PPA wasn't the problem, but rather rolling back the packages without causing a firestorm of dependency problems proved most challenging. However,in the suggested answer, the solution to my question was also given; namely, the ppa-purge solution.\n\nA: Yes, there is an easy way.\nJust install ppa-purge\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\nThen you should run it against the PPA you added, in this case:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nIt should disable the PPA and rollback any package updated from the PPA back to the ones in the Ubuntu official repository.\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/02/how-to-use-launchpad-ppa-add-remove.html\n", "Q: How to open Steam via terminal? Is there any terminal command to open Steam on Ubuntu 14.04 ? And if so, is there any command to open it's games, for example DOTA2?\n\nA: For launching games on Steam via command line, Steam used a URI-scheme for installing or launching games. You need to find out the 'appid' (application ID) for the game you are trying to launch (for example DOTA2 is 570) and execute a steam steam://run/[appid] command. (for example, using DOTA2, steam steam://run/570)\n\nA: steam is the command that will let you launch Steam from terminal. It's man page suggests there are no documented command line options (aka flags, like -abcd)\nPersonally have no idea how to launch games through command line, as my Steam on Linux is currently empty (don't game as much as used to), but will provide edit later once i find out\nEdit\nApparently Steam stores games in $HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/ directory. For instance, I've downloaded game called Capre Diem, which is in python, and uses a shell script to launch the actual game. To lauch it through terminal , I had to run \nbash .steam/steam/steamapps/common/Carpe\\ Diem/Carpe\\ Diem.sh \n\nBecause some games may be in variety of languages, my opinion is that there's no conclusive, singular way to run games from terminal. Rather, it takes looking around the directories in .steam/steam/steamapps/common/ for each respective game. \n", "Q: connect two bluetooth devices at once I have a bluetooth speaker and a bluetooth mouse..\nWhen I connect the mouse the speaker will start stuttering.

Well, I just updated Firefox on Ubuntu 14 to v43 doing sudo apt-get update, and my old extensions stopped working as they are not signed. Mozilla has apparently stated that:\nhttps://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/02/10/extension-signing-safer-experience/\n\nInstallation of unsigned extensions will still be possible on Nightly and Developer Edition, as well as special, unbranded builds of Release and Beta that will be available mainly for developers testing their extensions.\n\nhttps://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/\n\nThe Nightly and Developer Editions of Firefox based on 42 and above will retain the preference to disable signing enforcement, allowing the development and/or use of unsigned add-ons in those versions. Unbranded versions of Firefox based on releases will also be made available for developers, and are expected to be in place for Firefox 42 for release (and potentially beta).\n\nI don't want to install Nightly because I don't want to update every day; I don't want the developer version because it includes extra stuff I don't need. So, I wanted to try this \"unbranded\" Firefox build, which would apparently allow me to run unsigned extensions. But I'm looking everywhere for it, and I cannot find it. And Firefox 43 already landed, and (if I recall correctly), 43 > 42, so these \"unbranded\" builds should have already been available, no? \nSo, where can this unbranded Firefox be downloaded from? If it is not released yet, when will it be released?\n\nA: I appears that Mozilla has finally made unbranded builds available at the following location:\nhttps://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Extension_Signing#Unbranded_Builds\n\nA: \nThere are two temporary solutions that may help you out for a short\n  period of time.

How can I do that?\n\nA: The boot loader is using a piece of software called Plymouth.  \nTo work correctly you need to use KMS compatible graphics drivers and sometimes just a bit of luck - in Ubuntu prior to 14.04 Plymouth hasn't really changed for 5+ years and is showing its age.  It is being updated in 14.04 and hopefully will work in a wider number of cases.\nIf you are using proprietary graphics drivers (often NVIDIA or AMD) then these are currently not KMS based and can be a cause of a very short/missing boot Plymouth picture.\nOne technique I use is to force Plymouth to run in a rather old but still useful technique called a framebuffer.\nWith this you'll get a longer display of the picture - you'll still get one TTY switch when moving from Plymouth to GDM.

Something like open Terminal and run gotoheaven. In this way I do not have to re-write alias into the Exec entry. \n\nA: To be exact there is a method, i.e. running the alias in an interactive shell;\nI.e., create a desktop file with the following Exec= line:\nExec=bash -c 'exec bash -i <<<\"gotoheaven\"'\n\n\n\n*\n\n*bash -c '[...]': starts a non-interactive shell (this is required to take advantage of the <<< redirection) and runs [...] in it;\n\n*exec bash -i <<<\"gotoheaven\": replaces the non-interactive shell with an interactive shell and redirects gotoheaven to the interactive shell's STDIN, which sources ~/.bashrc and runs the alias.\n\n\nHowever since this requires more or less the same effort of copy-pasting the command from the alias into the new desktop file but runs an additional shell, I suggest you to just go for copy-pasting the command from the alias into the new desktop file as outlined in one of the answers to this question.\nYou seem to be stuck on the fact that the shortcut must run the alias and not an identical command, which just doesn't make sense unless you need to run the command in the environment set by ~/.bashrc (which doesn't seem to be the case). Just create a desktop file that runs the same command.\n\nA: Aliases belong to shell, they aren't external commands. So it's impossible to create shortcut for alias. \nHowever, it is possible to take the command you reference in alias and create .desktop file which is basically shortcut and  after Exec= put the command you wish to run\nHere's an example of what it would look like:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MyAppName\nType=Application\nExec=xdg-open /path/to/heaven\nTerminal=false\n\nIcon=/path/to/image.png field is optional. Terminal= part must be placed to indicate whether the output needs to be shown on terminal or not. In your case, I assume it's not necessary since you are using xdg-open to open some file\nYou may need to make the file executable by right clicking the file , opening Properties, and checking \"Execute\" under Permissions tab\nOr alternatively through chmod +x /path/to/MyAppName.desktop\n\nA: You can't have a shortcut for alias instead you can use this tricky to create a launcher named same as your alias name . In your terminal run the command:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop\n\nThis will launch  a GUI Dialog to create a launcher on your Desktop:\n\nGive a name such same as your alias name \"gotohell\" and in the command insert your command: xdg-open \"/path/to/hell\"\nNow you can find a .desktop file on your desktop named \"gotohell\"\n\nA: this worked for me\nin the command use bash -i -c \"your-alias-name\"\nthis also works when used for shortcuts\nif you run into problem replace bash with /usr/bin/bash\n-i makes it intractable which is needed if alias is from ~/.bashrc file (according to @NotTheDr01ds)\n-c makes it accept what comes after as the code for a bash prompt\n", "Q: Using efibootmgr to make drive a permanent boot priority without re-ordering the whole boot order I'm trying to write a script that runs at initramfs that uses efibootmgr to permanently set the highest boot priority without having to re-assign the boot order.\nefibootmgr -n 000A for example is perfect for this as it sets the drive 000A to be the boot priority but for the next boot only.\nefibootmgr -o requires that we list all drives and re-assign their order, which complicates the script as I would have to grab these values and parse them back to the efibootmgr command to re-order.\nIs there a way to change boot priority where I only have to reference the drive of the one I am trying to make priority rather than re-write the hierarchy?\n\nA: Short answer: No.\nLong answer: First, understand that EFI does not boot \"drives,\" except in certain limited senses or under limited circumstances. The most commonly-used boot entries revealed by efibootmgr are for EFI boot loader programs, which are stored as ordinary files on the ESP. This may seem like a subtle distinction, but trying to solve your problem without understanding it is likely to result in a buggy and/or limited solution.\nParsing the efibootmgr output is likely to be required to do what you want to do. This shouldn't really be very difficult; understanding a few common commands used in Bash scripts, like grep and cut, will take you a long way.\nAlternatively, if your goal is to restore a boot order that's lost because of a buggy EFI, you might look into the fallback.efi program. AFAIK, it's not available in Ubuntu, but it comes with Fedora. This program will restore a set of NVRAM boot variables from a file if they're lost. It's intended to be placed in the EFI/BOOT directory and launched from Shim (which launches it automatically), so that the firmware's boot entries will be restored should they be lost. This approach has some problems, like cluttering the ESP with yet more files and creating new hoops through which you must jump if you want to change the boot entries, but it may be what you need.\n", "Q: Change Terminal Name to be the Current folder Name How to change the title of Terminal to be the Current folder Name?\nfor example i'm in the folder test then the terminal title should be test as well.\nNote :\ni don't want the full path  that comes before the folder name(for example ../user/home..)\n\nA: This happens anyway, I don't get your point\nIn /home\n\nMoved to ~/Documents\n\nIf this does not answer your question, then you need to edit your question for clarity.\n", "Q: If I upgrade my system will my desktop manager change to Unity? I have an old Acer netbook which is running Lubuntu 14.10. I haven't used it in a while and after booting in it is prompting me to upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04.\nIf I go ahead with the update will it upgrade to the full version of Ubuntu, which I doubt will run well on old hardware, or will I get to keep Lubuntu?\n\nA: It will upgrade to Lubuntu 15.04, not Ubuntu 15.04. It will not replace LXDE with Unity (The differences between any flavor of Ubuntu is the desktop environment, so literally Ubuntu is the same as Lubuntu, only with Unity instead of LXDE.) Also, upgrading can have good effects, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Better security\n\n*More features\n\n*More useful stuff\n\n*etc.\n\n\nSo, you should go upgrade it, and 14.10 is old and end-of-life now.\nHere's an image to show it's old and end-of-life:\n\n\nA: It will update to the newer version of Lubuntu.\nThe update process doesn't ever change your 'flavour' of Ubuntu.

I now realise this is wrong but need some help trying to recover my Windows 7 installation as I have valuable need for it.\nWhat has happened is that Ubuntu seams to have taken control of the C drive and installed its own partition as the root/boot - grub only see's ubuntu on it, but the original C drive contents now shows up in e:\nthe windows setup disk wont see the original C: Windows 7 installation or the e: drive copy of the original c drive.\nI really want to get my E: drive back to C: and fix the Windows MBR and then install Ubuntu properly so it boots from grub but is installed on a partition on the d: drive.\nI really appreciate any help you could give, even if its really low level stuff.\nThanks :)\n\nA: I solved this.\nWhat had happened was the Ubuntu installer had taken over my SYSTEM 100Mb hidden folder and installed itself there. The installer did create the two 20Gb partitions, but appeared to have created another partition further into the 2nd drive for its system files called UBUNTU (see pics above). The Original C: drive containing my Windows 7 was still intact, however when booting into the Windows 7 set up CD and getting to command prompt it was identified as G:\nSo I assumed that what had happened was that Ubuntu had deleted my SYSTEM partition and used it for itself, and the Windows setup boot was enumerating the original C: drive as an additional drive G: (E: in the UI ), and Windows 7 original SYSTEM partition was now C: drive containing Ubuntu system files but all hidden.\nA little research on how SYSTEM is built and repaired yielded these two links.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/192772/what-is-the-system-reserved-partition-and-can-you-delete-it/\nhttp://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/231133-recover-windows-7-100mb-system-reserved-partition.html\nThe solution was to boot off Win 7 setup disk (you may have to play around with UEFI type settings in the BIOS to get Windows setup to see your original Windows C: drive - it came up as E: for during system setup boot, I don't know why, but sometimes the Windows setup disk saw nothing at all, so persevere with some of the UEFI and other boot type parameters in the BIOS if this happens)\nSo startup off your Windows setup disk again, get to command prompt...type these three commands in this order\n\nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\nbootrec /rebuildbcd\n\nand then restart.  This rebuilt my SYSTEM partition for windows and then I could boot and remove the spurious partitions created for Ubuntu. Hey presto back to square one, and I won't ever make my original mistake again! ;)\nThanks for your help mark you gave me confidence to progress this.\nCiao!\n", "Q: Desktop shortcut disappear I've created a desktop shortcut for Eclipse by creating a .desktop file in my desktop with the following content\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eclipse\nExec=/home/blesson/eclipse/eclipse\nIcon=/home/blesson/eclipse/icon.xpm\nType=Application\n\nHowever after rebooting my Ubuntu 15.04 the link has disappeared and I got a system error.

Contradictory to cl-netbox's answer my 15.10 detects all installed OSes and can boot them through GRUB (and I also have an ESP for each, I can generate a custom grub image with grub-mkimage or install other bootloaders and build a funny chain of bootloaders probably jumping around on all ESPs on some machines), not actually related to your question, but I wanted to mention it.

On some of my (headless) desktops it's almost too fast.\nIf you have problems with setting the bootorder in the UEFI setup screen, then check if efibootmgr works and has effect on the actual boot order of your machine (some report to efibootmgr that changes were applied just to discard them on next boot).\n", "Q: What does each part of the `ls -la` output mean?

In the package docs, it is mentioned:\n0. This installation is known to work easily if you use Mac OS X and have \ninstalled python and gsl using MacPorts.\n\n1. Modify the setup_cfg.py\nChange the 'GSL_INCLUDE' and 'GSL_LIB' variables to your path to the GSL\nheader and library files. For example:\nGSL_INCLUDE = 'some_path/gsl-1.15/include'\nGSL_LIB = 'some_path/gsl-1.15/lib'\n\nI am using ubuntu and installed gsl using\nsudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev\n\nHow can I find the gsl libraries path? 'some_path/gsl-1.15/include' ; 'some_path/gsl-1.15/lib'\nabhishek:/usr/lib$ pkg-config --libs gsl \n-lgsl -lgslcblas -lm\n\n\nA: If you installed the libgsl0-dev package, then its header files should have gone in /usr/include/gsl and its libraries in /usr/lib\nYou can confirm this by looking at the output of the command dpkg -L libgsl0-dev or by looking at the list of files online at http://packages.ubuntu.com\nI don't think it is possible to know from what you have posted whether the software you are installing is expecting the gsl subdirectory - that is, whether it wants\nGSL_INCLUDE = '/usr/include/gsl'\n\nor just \nGSL_INCLUDE = '/usr/include'\n\n(in C-language terms, that would be the difference between something like #include <gsl/cblas.h> and #include <cblas.h>). You may need to try both.\nNote that /usr/include and /usr/lib are standard search paths for tools such as gcc. Most often, when development packages install to such paths there is no need to set them explicitly - you will see that pkg-config --cflags --libs does not output any -I or -L include path or library path directives.\n", "Q: linux install on single boot macbook pro 6,2 novice here: i am trying to reasonable wipe anything remaining of this macbook for a clean linux install again.. while installing python/eclipse things got flaky and froze up and i had to shut down and restart.. downhill from there.. won't shutdown properly. won't boot.. so i'm ready for a new reformat of the drive and new install (i'm all backed up).. with that said. i am on a live usb and mounted the sda2 and ran the command 'efibootmgr' at the terminal.. what i got was:\n\n\n*\n\n*mint mint # sudo efibootmgr\n\n*BootCurrent: 0000\n\n*Timeout: 5 seconds\n\n*BootOrder: 0000,0080\n\n*Boot0000* ubuntu\n\n*Boot0080* Mac OS X\n\n*Boot0082* \n\n*BootFFFF* \n\n\nnot sure what this means other than ubuntu is booting 'first'. i only use the linux os. so do i need/want to have the mac os in this boot process? unless i need the mac os for something i don't know about. just thinking this might be the problem with things getting corrupted on a regular basis. simply just trying to run linux on an old macbook pro. any help/thoughts appreciated. thank you. \nupdate: i am logged in with a live usb and when doing a 'fdisk -l' command i find:\n\n     Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n    /dev/sda1               1        2047        1023+  ee  GPT\n    /dev/sda2       609517568   625141759     7812096   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n    /dev/sda3   *        2048   609517567   304757760   83  Linux\nbut when i run gparted: it shows /dev/sda1 as linux-swap and /dev/sda2 as ext4. those are the only 2 partitions. \nalso on sda2 i get \"...attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read while trying to open /dev/sda2 Couldn't find valid filesystem superblock..\"\n\nA: Read the contents from the following link:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation\nIt contains official installation instructions for Ubuntu on Apple computers.

I have the password stored, so I just keep hitting connect over and over again (5-6 second delay between prompts).  Eventually it will connect.  This doesn't happen with Windows.  This also doesn't happen if I connect to the 2.4 GHz band on the same exact router - only with 5 GHz.\nLike I said, it will eventually connect, but it is annoying to have to keep trying.  Any ideas what could be causing this, or how to fix it?\n\nA: First, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nIf these changes do not help, please try:\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\n\nIf it helps, make it permanent:\nsudo -i\necho \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nexit\n\nFinally, Network Manager will default to ethernet if it's available. Please make your tests with the ethernet detached.\nNext, I suggest you install the backports package:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\nwget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/2015/11/20/backports-20151120.tar.gz\ntar -zxvf backports-20151120.tar.gz\ncd backports-20151120\nmake defconfig-iwlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nNow we need the latest firmware. \nsudo apt-get install git\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenELEC/iwlwifi-firmware.git\ncd linux-firmware/firmware\nsudo cp iwlwifi-7265D-14.ucode  /lib/firmware\nsudo cp iwlwifi-7265D-15.ucode  /lib/firmware\n\nReboot and check:\ndmesg | grep firmware\n\nIdeally, the -15 firmware is loaded and performance is greatly improved.\nIf this helps, you will need to recompile every time Update Manager installs a later kernel, known as linux-image. After the requested reboot, recompile:\ncd backports-20151120\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-iwlwifi\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nPlease retain the file and these instructions for that time.\n", "Q: Can I minimize a window into a box on Unity?

If the process is not found as a command in /usr/share/applications, the file has a generic icon.\n\n\nGiving the boxed-window icons a different size than the other icons\nThe script names the created .desktop files always boxed_1.desktop, boxed_2.desktop etc, depending on the \"available\" name at the moment of creation (filenames, not the displayed name). \nYou can resize the files (in general), by right- click > icon size. The good news is that if you remove the file and recreate it, the size is remembered. Even if you create the file again after a restart. That means that if you ever resized the boxed windows (e.g.) 1-5, they will always have the same size when you (the script) create them again!\n\n", "Q: Gstreamer 0.10 on imx6 Board can't play video with audio I'm working with an imx6 board. \nI have to stream a video file, let's say a MP4 file called \"video.mp4\", from file to screen.\nFirst i had some problems trying to run only the video, eventually i managed to launch and successfully watch my video on screen. \nNow i want to listen the audio of the mp4 file while watching the video, pretty standard i guess.\nThe problem is: when i try to listen to the audio the video just freezes on first frame and i still don't get the audio.\nI've been trying a lot of pipelines for both video and audio and video/audio only.\nAll the pipelines that use playbin2 just freezes on first frame.\nI can successfully play the video with this pipeline:\ngst-launch-0.10 filesrc location=video.mp4 ! decodebin2 ! autovideosink\n\nThe pipeline i use to play video with audio is:\ngst-launch-0.10 filesrc location=video.mp4 ! decodebin2 name=dec ! queue ! autovideosink dec. ! queue ! autoaudiosink\n\nAs i say the problem is: when i try to play video and audio with decodebin the video freezes at first frame.

At the other end of the VPN link you also need to specify routing for packets to travel down through the VPN and go via the Pi to get to your computer.\nThat latter would be a route something like:\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n192.168.100.0   172.16.199.100  255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 tun0\n\nI.e.,:\nroute add -net 192.168.100.0/24 gw 172.16.199.100\n\n\n(Or whatever IP address is at the Pi end of your VPN).\nYour network topology looks like this (the black parts):\n\nThe VPN connection is in blue.\nThe routes you have, or need to have, are in green.

I have problems with video display, occurring in VLC, SMPlayer and in Skype. For VLC and SMPlayer I have found a workaround, for Skype not.\nThe problem is that the video does not resize and it remains on top of other windows, even when I switch to other applications. The Skype image flickers.\nDetails about the problem and how to produce it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean install of Ubuntu 15.10 AMD64 on an Asus\n\n*Install VLC and SMPlayer and Skype\n\n*Open any video in VLC\n\n*Resize the VLC window.\n\n\nWhat happens now is that the video itself does not resize. It remains the same size but is centered in the VLC window. The remaining space in the VLC window is filled with blue. This blue flickers blue/black while I resize the window.\nFurthermore, the video frame is on top of other windows, even when I switch to another application. It also overlaps with the pull-down menu of VLC itself, meaning that I cannot read most of the options in the menus because the video is on top of them.\nSurprisingly, when I go to VLC Tools, Preferences, Video, and select at Output \"OpenGL GLX video output (XCB)\" then the problem disappears and everything is normal. Same thing for \"X11 video output (XCB)\". The problem re-appears however when I choose \"VDPAU output\" or \"XVideo output (XCB)\" or, for that matter, \"Automatic\".\nSo for VLC I have a workaround. But for Skype I do not. The Skype problem is similar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Skype, make a call, activate the web cam.\n\n\nThe video of the person receiving the call is fine until I open my own webcam.

You can select Install Ubuntu for a direct install, or Try Ubuntu which lets you try Ubuntu, and if you want to install it there's an shortcut on the desktop to install it. When you get to the partition part, there should be an option saying \"Remove Windows and install Ubuntu\" (not sure exactly) with a message under it about something critical. Select it, and if the option isn't there, select the option \"Something else\" and delete the partitions that Windows uses (not your partitions with data, files, pictures, etc.) and make these 2 partitions:\n1: A ext4 filesystem one, and set the mount point to /. Install Ubuntu on that partition.\n2: This is not needed, but make a swap partition, which is a simple partition: A swap filesystem one. Make it as big as you want (but you should use something like 8-16 GB). Instead of using RAM, Ubuntu uses swap which is a kind of \"RAM partition\". You only need 1 swap partition if you have 2 Linux OS'es.

CUDA is an NVidia langauge/toolset requiring an NVidia graphics card.  Unless Mathworks (the company that owns Matlab) decides to support the AMD processor you are out of luck.  The link you give for the AMD tool that supports cuda is incorrect - it converts cuda code to a format that runs on the AMD GPU - this is not an implementation of CUDA and will NOT work with Matlab.\nIf you want to use an AMD GPU then you will have to do a lot more work to make it run with matlab.

That is what the Ubuntu installation wizard says. I am using a Thinkpad X220. I upgraded from Windows 7, and then \"reset\" (is that just reformatting?) Windows 10.  \nHere's an image: http://imgur.com/gallery/TmXf0Wq/new\n\nA: If Windows is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, then the relevant firmware options are already set appropriately. Don't change them. What's required is to boot the Ubuntu installation medium in the same mode. This is usually done by selecting the correct option in the firmware's boot menu -- namely, the entry for the medium that lacks the string \"UEFI\" to boot in BIOS mode, or the one that includes that string to boot in EFI mode. Your message should only appear in an EFI-mode boot when the installer thinks that Windows is booting in BIOS mode.\nNote that the installer might have been thrown off by something and be mis-reporting the boot mode. I recommend you check the partition table type code of the Windows boot disk with parted, as in:\nsudo parted /dev/sda print\n\nLook for the line that begins Partition Table -- it will be identified as gpt (GPT) or msdos (MBR). A GPT disk denotes an EFI-mode boot of Windows and an MBR disk denotes a BIOS-mode boot of Windows. If your computer has multiple disks, check them all, and if they vary, figure out from which one Windows is booting.\n", "Q: Cannot download files to SMB shared folder I have shared a folder on machine A running Ubuntu, see Cannot access shared folder on another Ubuntu machine for details.\nOn machine B (also running Ubuntu), I can access this shared folder through nautilus (read/write content).

The adapter is Cable Matters AX88179 which has open source drivers available for linux. \nThe installation requires the source files for the device's kernel which however are not on the device. I've tried installing the respective linux-headers but they are not available for the kernel image I have (found through uname -r). Installing the source or linux generic headers gives errors as I run out of i-nodes on the phone.\nIs there a way of cross-compiling the C drivers for the Aquaris?\n\nA: To cross-compile for Aquaris E4.5 on an x86 Ubuntu host you need the ARM androideabi toolchain. You can install that with:\n$ sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-androideabi\n\nThe Linux kernel source code for Aquaris E4.5 can be found on BQ's GitHub page. As documented on BQ's README file, you can build the kernel with:\n$ ./makeMtk -t krillin n k\n\nTo cross-compile the AX88179 drivers (I expect the procedure to be similar for other drivers but I haven't tested it on anything but the AX88179 drivers) I modified the drivers' Makefile as follows:\nexport ARCH:=arm\nexport CROSS_COMPILE:=arm-linux-androideabi-\nTARGET  = ax88179_178a\nOBJS    = ax88179_178a.o\nMDIR    = drivers/net/usb\nKDIR    = <absolute-path>/aquaris/out/target/product/krillin/obj/KERNEL_OBJ\nUSBNET  = $(shell find $(KDIR)/include/linux/usb/* -name usbnet.h)\n\nEXTRA_CFLAGS = -DEXPORT_SYMTAB\nPWD = $(shell pwd)\n\nobj-m      := $(TARGET).o\n\ndefault:\n    make -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules\n\n$(TARGET).o: $(OBJS)\n    $(LD) $(LD_RFLAG) -r -o $@ $(OBJS)\n\nclean:\n    $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) clean\n\n.PHONY: modules clean\n\n-include $(KDIR)/Rules.make\n\nMake sure to replace the KDIR value with your absolute path to KERNEL_OBJ in the aquaris directory.\nAfter this you get the cross-compiled kernel object, which you should then 1) transfer and 2) load onto your phone (the following commands should be executed on the phone after the kernel object ax88179_178a.ko is transfered):\n# modprobe usbnet\n# insmod ax88179_178a.ko\n\nEt voilà!

That is just the name assigned to port 7000, as that is the port number that was assigned for this specific service.\nYou will need to check what process is actually running on the port by looking locally on the server, with something like:\n# netstat -tanp | grep :7000\n\nThe above would print all the processes using this port, including the PID and name of the process in the LISTEN state that is watching for new requests.\n# fuser 7000/tcp\n\nfuser also can be used to see the PIDs of the processes using that tcp port, and then you'll need to check the ps output what are those processes.

As a user, I don't have any preferences for either of those. As a developer, I mainly use PPAs for the reasons below.\n\n*The more obvious are that you use Canonical's resources instead of your own, and that includes the GPG key management, for your users. Remember that when one adds a PPA using the ppa:you/yourpackage shortcut, everything is taken care of. Contrast this to the scenario where you have to instruct the user on getting your gpg key, adding it to APT, etc. Additionally it builds packages for several Ubuntu releases, once the package is \"buildable\".\n\n*Packages in a PPA are already crypto-signed. Launchpad will check out the source from wherever you deploy, build it and sign it with your PPA key. If you require more security (say, to prevent anyone from intercepting inside Launchpad), then you should use your own repository, and sign the package yourself. This is a rather 'tinfoil hat' scenario where you would prefer to manage your own repo, rather than trusting Launchpad.

I want to write some scripting for my server to read and parse emails in myemailaccount@walnutel.net to, for example, adjust the iptables firewall whitelist or blacklist. As I expand home automation, I will have more uses for this capability.\nDo I even need an email client? I wonder if merely having an MTA on my server can put incoming email somewhere in the file system where a script could then read and parse it.  I do have postfix installed which is giving me email sending capability (and giving me the MTA, I believe).\nThe email account the system would use for this is one provided by the neighborhood ISP (Walnut Communications). Currently, I neither use that email account for anything nor use my servers to read email for anything else. A side question I have along that line is 'Why am I even able to to send email without it getting authenticated through the Walnutel.net email account to give it the credentials or credibility that I thought the Internet's emailing infrastructure would demand?'\nIf I could just understand these two things, I could make a lot more progress. Note that the server is headless, CLI, and unattended, so I have no use for browsing an email inbox at/through it.\nEdit 12/25/15: I have learned that the email methodology I seek is called \"bash sockets\".  Unclear to me yet in my research is whether I'll for sure need to authenticate with my local email account credentials in order to send email reliably to my non-local gmail account, and whether I'll be required to use SSL (TLS, etc).  If required to use SSL/TLS to communicate with email servers, I fear I'll be VERY hard-pressed to find bash scripting examples of that.\n\nA: \nDo I even need an email client?\n\nYes, retrieving e-mail from a distant mail server is by definition a mail client's job. It does not need to be a full-fledged desktop program like Thunderbird however, fetchmail should do the job for you.\n\nWhy am I even able to to send email without it getting authenticated through the Walnutel.net email account to give it the credentials or credibility that I thought the Internet's emailing infrastructure would demand?\n\nFor the same reason you are able to write any address on the top-left corner of an envelope before putting it in the box without proving that you really live there: certifying the sender's identity is not a goal of the system.\n\nA: I succeeded in fetching and parsing of emails with bash-socket-scripting without any email client at all. This was made easy by virtue of my ISP (Walnut Communications) not requiring SSL to download emails from their mail server.  Had I needed to do this inside Cox Communications network who verbally stated that they require SSL to do the same, it would have been more difficult because the necessary openssl s_client -connect pop.cox.net:995 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs command seems to be interactive only.\nHere is bash script  for logging into a local ISP-provided email account not requiring SSL.

That means my system can no longer send me texts of home security events until I get scripting completed to authenticate to one of my authenticating email accounts that is still able to send me texts.  So, with shell scripting, I eliminated the need for an email client to fetch email, and once I get scripting working for outgoing emails, my security system will no longer need any third-party mailing tools, whether mailutils, procmail, sendmail, or etc.  The advantage for me is that I won't have config settings unknown to me and difficult/inconvenient to determine their appropriate values needed in my application.\n", "Q: My Bluetooth problem I had a friend who Bluetooth me a website, but I can't seem to find it.

I plan to install Ubuntu (14.04.3) on 'E' drive.\n When I check open up My Computer, I see the Windows logo on only the C drive so:\n1. Is it okay if I install Ubuntu (via live boot USB) on any of the other two drives without backing up Windows?\n2. Will doing so wipe the existing data on that drive even if I partition ~50GB only for Ubuntu?\n3. Will I be able to use the drive for storing files from Windows too?\nAlso, I should note that drive E is totally empty.\nThanks in advance for your responses.\nHave a great day!\n-Funky Space Monkeys\n\nA: An installation of Ubuntu, like and installation of Windows, will only use what you specify during the installation.  During the installation you will have the option of selecting the drive/partition where you want to install.  The selected drive/partition will be the only part that will be affected.\nWhen you install, you actually install on a partition.  During the install process you could select a drive (one of the default options) and allow Ubuntu to automatically partition the whole drive.\nBefore the default installation begin you will be advised that the drive will be changed accordingly.\nOr you can use an alternate option and select where you want it installed.  Performing option, you will be given the same warning/advice that changes will be made to that partition.\nUbuntu can use a Windows formatted drive/partition for reading, writing, and storing data.  However, Windows can't access a Linux partition.  While Linux can read and write to a Windows drive, you would loose some significant functionality that comes with Linux formatted drive, such as, fragmentation and limited access modes.\nWith Linux (just like Windows) you would have to have a boot manager (you would have to specify a boot drive).  This is a reserved space on the drive for performing the boot.  Ubuntu's default boot manage is Grub.  The Grub boot manager will work for both Windows and Linux.  It will be installed by default on the drive you select for the booting drive.  Installing the boot manager doesn't effect the data on any of the drives.\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted /usr/lib/python3.4 I am on ubuntu 14.04 and I accidentally deleted python3.4\nI am trying\napt-get install python3.4\ndpkg-reconfigure -a\napt-get install -f\n\nBut I am seeing the following errors\ndpkg: error processing package dh-python (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n python3.4-minimal\n python3-minimal\n python3.4\n python3\n python3-pkg-resources\n python-chardet-whl\n python-pip-whl\n python3-chardet\n python3-colorama\n python3.4-dev\n python3-dev\n python3-distlib\n python3-six\n python3-html5lib\n python3-urllib3\n python3-requests\n python3-setuptools\n python3-pip\n python3-wheel\n dh-python\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI also tried to completely remove python3.4 using \napt-get remove --purge python3.4\n\nand reinstalling. but it gives me the following errors\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index...\nSetting up python3.4-minimal (3.4.3-1ubuntu1~14.04.3) ...\nCould not find platform independent libraries <prefix>\nConsider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]\nFatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding\nImportError: No module named 'encodings'\nAborted\ndpkg: error processing package python3.4-minimal (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 134\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of python3.4:\n python3.4 depends on python3.4-minimal (= 3.4.3-1ubuntu1~14.04.3);

I like using apt-get install for my packages. However, I discovered that the repositories for apt-get is rarely updated after release. For example, when trying to install nodejs and npm today, I discovered that the repository still had version 0.10.29 and 1.3 respectively, while in reality they are at version 5.3 and 3.5.2 at the moment of this post.\nSo I'm wondering if there are any repositories for apt-get that are constantly updated with the latest stable release of packages? If yes, how do I set up apt-get to use those repositories? If no, are there other package managers/linux distributions that would suit my purposes better?\n\nA: NodeJS and NPM are not representative of typical packages.\nNode JS uses the semantic versioning system for identifying releases.\nUnder this system the 0 \"major\" number in 0.10.29 indicates that it is a new project undergoing a rapid rate of development,i.e. from the semantic versioning docs\n\nMajor version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.\n\nThe NodeJS version 0.10.29 came out mid last year and so it is not that old in terms of time, although in the case of this particular package alot of changes have occurred in that period, so for that reason I use a PPA for installing newer versions of node and NPM - but its not accurate to say Ubuntu packages are rarely updated based on what you have seen with NodeJs.  \nDepending on how \"cutting edge\" you want to be you may find the official Ubuntu repositories don't have the newest versions of the programs you want, its typically pretty trivial to find a PPA hosting packages with newer version, and if you are willing to do the work and deal with the technical difficulties open source packages can be compiled and installed from source.  \n", "Q: How to merge unallocated partition to linux partition I have a windows partition which was 500gb, then i installed ubuntu with a 40gb partition, now i am short of space, so i booted my ubuntu14 live cd and shrunk my windows paritition and got 88gb free unallocated space.\nNow i want to merge this 88gb unallocated space to my linux parition.\nWhat have I tried :- I tried to Move/resize this unallocated space from live cd, but it is greyed out.\nWhat I want :- How to merge this unallocated space to my linux partition such that my 40gb linux becomes (40+88) 128gb single partition.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:- I needed the 88 gb so i reshrunk it to 44 gb and gave it back to windows, now the unallocated space is 44gb, and all the screenshots are taken from Gparted by live boot.

Hey I have the box it actually has no speakers, it just makes me two cents per hour, pays my electricity bill monthly. Here is my issue, windows xp no longer safe and secure, Windows 7 shaky on this box as of its age. \nThe web radio and pages I use to get the payments work within firefox using ubuntu 14 LTS, However after two days it gets memory clogged.\nSo I am looking for a way to automate the following.\nUpon startup launch firefox goto a certain web page.\nclick the login link\nclick the ok link\nclick the music link\nclick the webradio link\nthen every night at 2 am or something reboot box.\nI can figure out only two of the things in the above list to do easily with bash scripting or terminal scripting and scheduling of tasks. but how do i simulate mouse movements and clicking.\nAlso moving much forward in time if I upgrade my other main computer to linux there is a much more involved automated task I perform with swagbucks.\nLooking for a linux alternative to winautomation www.winautomation.com\nThank you mike I wqill look at the imacro for firefox it should work if it will launch at firefox startup.\nHowever I have tried using imacros for my bigger job flow of automating swagbucks for an all day run while i am at work.\nThat work flow is as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*open swagbucks page if not logged in log in.\n\n*look for and click on engage link, currently i find the link div id using\n find element in winautomation \n\n*there is two types of workflows based upon 40+ different possible webpages \n that randomluy appear after clicking the link above.\n\n*currently i test for text on the web page if meter then player19 if discover\n then playerOther.\n\n*player19 waits for 60 seconds test for the word thin k in a certain spot if\n there clicks a link if not wait a little longer. this loops about 19 times.\n\n*kill the browser for cleaning up possible pop ups and stray windows. there \n is also in my current version script some failure testing in certain spots \n to start over because it their player and website is not very robust.\n\n*LPlayerOther launches a link waits 60 seconds their is a countdown in a \n certain spot, it changes randomly from 45-35-60-30 sometimes even 1:15. so \n once the timer number is compared to itself over 5 seconds with no change \n in value that is my target timer.\n\n*after countdown timer is met each iteration a link is clicked. this loops \n about 12 times, then restarts. there is some failure testing in certain \n spots here as well.\n\n\nI could export the winautomation job and post it if needed but then you would have to load the winautomation software to view it. It is not simple textual script.\nI think that this could be done should be done with java, or python just dont know where to start. and when i do i will probably loose some more hair, lol, learning or relearning the program script languages and never really had any luck with launching exterior programs inside java but that was ten years ago.\nOK so based upon the listed work flow above how could i accomplish automating it?\n\nA: *\n\n*To launch application like Firefox after startup, use Ubuntu's Startup Applications Preferences, accessible from Dash.\n\n*For automation inside Firefox you may use something like iMacros for Firefox\n\n*To reboot the box on regular basis, set up a cron job\n", "Q: whats going on with fdisk?

Solaar runs on startup like I would expect it to, but whenever I plug in my nano receiver Solaar says:\nFound a Logitech Receiver (/dev/hidraw1), but did not have permission to open it.\n\nIf you've just installed Solaar, try removing the receiver and plugging it back in.\n\nThe only way for this message to disappear and get Solaar to work correctly is to open a terminal and runsudo solaar. I take this to mean that it requires root permission to open the USB device read/write. I use Solaar to pair/unpair my devices so having a terminal hanging around all the time is both annoying and RAM-consuming (my laptop only has 512MB physical RAM).\nThe only way I know how to fix this is from back in my UNIX days where you put it in /etc/profile, but this only runs in Linux is the user logs in at a text mode shell (via a terminal or Ctrl-Alt-F2). Is there another way to give Solaar root permission at startup so that my mouse will work and I can get this annoying message out of my face?\n\nA: You can use a udev rule to give the current seated* user read/write privileges to the HID device representing the Logitech Unifying USB receiver. An example of such a rule can be found in the Solaar rules.d/42-logitech-unify-permissions.rule file.\nYou mentioned (un)pairing and a M315 mouse. If that is all you need, you can also try the solaar-cli tool which immediately exits after pairing. Alternatively, you can use the small ltunify utility which is describes at this page (basic invocation: ltunify pair and ltunify unpair).\nAs an additional note on file permissions, do note that anyone who can read from the hidraw device is able to intercept your mouse motions (and keyboard strokes if you have a wireless keyboard). If you are worried about that, do not install the udev rule and instead stick to sudo.\n*) seated means the user who is physically at the computer. This excludes SSH users for example who are not physically logged in.\n", "Q: How to check version of flex and bison on ubuntu 14.04 LTS?

How can I count the number of all files/folders that exist on a system, using the command-line?\nI can find it out using a GUI, simply by opening the properties window for the entire / folder, but it would be nice to know how to do it using the command-line.\nWould I need a whole series of commands, or will just one be possible?\n\nA: 1 method would be\nsudo find / -type f | wc -l\nsudo find / -type d | wc -l\n\n(sudo to prevent accessing errors)\nf for files, d for directories.\nThe /proc/ filesystem will error out but I do not consider those files ;)\n\nA: If you really want the total number of objects in your filesystems, use df -i to count inodes.  You won't get the breakdown between directories and plain files, but on the plus side it runs near-instantly.  The total number of used inodes is something filesystems already track.\n\nIf you want to use one of the find-based suggestions, don't just run it on /.  Use find -xdev on a list of mount points generated by something like findmnt --list -v -U -t xfs,ext3,ext4,btrfs,vfat,ntfs -o TARGET or something.  That doesn't exclude bind mounts, though, so files under bind mounts will get counted twice.  findmnt is pretty cool.\nAlso, surely there's a straightforward way to list all your \"disk\" mounts without having to list explicit filesystem types, but I'm not sure exactly what.\nAs suggested by another answer, use find -printf . | wc -c to avoid any possible problems counting funny characters in filenames.  Use -not -type d to count non-directory files.  (You don't want to exclude your symlinks, do you?)\n\nA: sudo find / -type f | wc -l\n\nwill tell you the number of regular files on your system, and \nsudo find / -type d | wc -l\n\nthe number of folders.\n\nA: Using zsh:\nAs root, for regular files:\nfiles=( /**/*(.D) )\n\nthis will take all the regular files including the ones starting with a . into the array files, now we can simply count the number of elements of the array:\necho $#files\n\nthis will handle all the edge cases e.g. unusual file names.\nSimilarly for directories:\ndirs=( /**/*(/D) )\necho $#dirs\n\n\nA: Another approach that leverages locatedb:\nlocate / | wc -l\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't require sudo\n\n*Much faster than the find based approaches (already pre-indexed)\n\n*Already applies -xdev: i.e. skips special files: /dev, /proc etc.\n\n\nDownsides:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not 100% accurate: includes directories, skips files under /tmp, may double-or-more-count files with newlines in their name, for example\n\n*Slower than the df -i approach\n\n*Reflects \"last ~24 hour snapshot reality\" rather than exact current state\n\n\nA: Since file / folder names can contain newlines:\nsudo find / -type f -printf '.' | wc -c\nsudo find / -type d -printf '.' | wc -c\n\nThis will count any file / folder in the current / directory. But as muru points out you might want to exclude virtual / other filesystems from the count (the following will exclude any other mounted filesystem):\nfind / -xdev -type f -printf '.' | wc -c\nfind / -xdev -type d -printf '.' | wc -c\n\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo find / -type f -printf '.': prints a dot for each file in /;\n\n*sudo find / -type d -printf '.': prints a dot for each folder in /;\n\n*wc -c: counts the number of characters.\n\n\nHere's an example of how not taking care of newlines in file / folder names may break other methods such as e.g. find / -type f | wc -l and how using find / -type f -printf '.' | wc -c actually makes it right:\n% ls\n% touch \"file\n\\`dquote> with newline\"\n% find . -type f | wc -l\n2\n% find . -type f -printf '.' | wc -c\n1\n\nIf STDOUT is not a terminal, find will print each file / folder name literally; this means that a file / folder name containing a newline will be printed across two different lines, and that wc -l will count two lines for a single file / folder, ultimately printing a result off by one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 after restart Wi-Fi, usb ports, LAN, not working!

Not Run off the USB in a virtual window. which is another problem that i had when trying to get an installation usb\n\nA: if you have windows installed you need a windows app that can make a bootable usb in order to install linux. so i think that you can use 'Linux Live USB creator' (http://www.linuxliveusb.com/) i usually use it and it works great for me.\nafter that if you have a UEFI bios you need to allow the legacy mode in there.\nall that you have to do is make a bootable usb with this tool, than allow legacy mode in your bios if it is uefi, after that boot from your usb and follow the installation instruction, in there you can chose the drive to use for the linux installation.\nif you have to use both windows and linux maybe you need to install grub or something like that, i don't know if ubuntu install it automatically, anyway searching it on google you can find how to install it for shure.\n\nA: It seems to me that you are just using the iso file as it is,that does not work, you have to download a special program to create a live USB of ubuntu to be able to install it\nI recommend you read this post about how to create the live USB\nfinally here you can find a full how-to create live USB and install Ubuntu dual boot with Windows\nI am glad you are using Ubuntu, it is great and it really is better that windows, but it is a challange also, there would be things you don't know and really recommend you to search a little more on google or duckduckgo, and forums, to find the answers to your next problems. \nThere are plenty of tutorials on itsfoss.com, omgubuntu.co.uk and howtogeek.com to help you get started. \n", "Q: Setting up SSL on Apache2 - Not switching after apache2 restart So, I've looked through literally dozens of tutorials online. \nI have apache 2.4.7 on a ubuntu 14.04 digital ocean droplet.\nI can reach my site fine with http, but want to switch it to https. \nI get certificates from letsencrypt and am trying to get them to go. \nI have setup my default-ssl.conf with the Virtual host as described in many of the tutorials. \nI use \na2ensite default-ssl.conf \nto enable it, and\nservice apache2 reload \n\nand \nservice apache2 restart \n\nto reload and restart apache2.

I'm very new to Linux and Ubuntu, my professor told me to download two programs for a project we're working on that are direct releases from nasa. and i downloaded their Linux file and it gave me a large cache of folders and files all of the files that say 'install\" are text documents and the directions are gibberish to me\nHere is where IRAF can be downloaded:\nhttp://iraf.noao.edu/\nAnd here is where DS9 can be downloaded:\nhttp://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html\ni have no idea how to install these.\n\nA: From the installation notes of the 1st link:\n- I am installing for the First Time:\n\n1)  Create an 'iraf' directory (preferrably /iraf/iraf) and unpack\n    the distribution file for your platform there.\n2)  Define $iraf in your environment (with a trailing '/')\n3)  Run the $iraf/install script to install the system\n\nI would do this like this: \nsudo mkdir /opt/iraf/\n\ndeals with the 1st bullet point. 3rd party software I always use /opt/ and not the /iraf/iraf/ they suggest. Put the download file into /opt/iraf with cp ~/Downloads/iraf*.gz /opt/iraf/ and extract it with cd /opt/iraf/ && tar zfxv iraf*.\nThe 2nd bullet point is done with\nexport iraf=\"/opt/iraf/\"\n\nIf you want this permanent add it in your .bashrc. I tend to do this when it all works as expected. \nThe 3rd bullet point is installing it. There is an \"install\" script you can start with cd /opt/iraf && ./install.\n\nRegarding the 2nd link. The README in the download states:\ncd saods9\nunix/configure\nmake\n\nSo it is similar to the 1st: create a dir in /opt/ called saods9. Put the download file into that, extract it, then do ./unix/configure and make. If you do not have all the dependencies for make install them and re-do the command. \nIf at any point command complain about permissions: use sudo. \n", "Q: nvidia: probe of 0000:01:00.0 failed with error -1 I have a problem.

I've had my Ubuntu phone, a BQ E5, for a week now, and after first problems with Internet access (it's ok now), I'm getting to like it. What I'm very unhappy with, however, is the fact that the scope seems to not just sit on the home screen, but actually be the home screen at all times ... I've customized the scope and I like the idea of having a scope or scopes rather than apps, ok, but ... I want a picture of my cat again on my home screen, please! And not the blinding, bright white color as the scope background ... (but that seems to be doable, just haven't figured it out yet).\nCan anyone help me, please, and tell me how I can change the home screen away from the scope and to a picture?\nThanks so much, Carol\n\nA: The scopes view is the home screen.

However, I am not able to use either a microphone connected to the computer's headphone/microphone jack's socket (is it normal to have the same socket for headphone & microphone) or a webcam (with inbuilt microphone) connected to that socket.. There is no other socket for a microphone. Both these input devices work on another computer, also with Trusty installed. I have tested this with Pulse Audio Volume Control: the port showing as Analogue Output or Microphone Unplugged (perhaps I should have rebooted?). Also alsamixer shows 0<>0 for Mic but 100<>100 for MicBoos.\n\nA: I've just found Launchpad answer \"No audio input with Ubuntu 14.04 and Intel NUC\" (#270122). This defined the same problem as I have. It states \"Turns out the jack is not a straightforward microphone jack, but one intended for a headphone and mic set. A splitter can be bought which splits it into two\". As I previously said I knew that the socket is a combined one for headphone & microphone, but I didn't realise that a splitter is required for the actual microphone to be 'picked up'. I've ordered a splitter: when it comes, I'll post the result (from using it) here.e\nPS I was using Linux kernel 4.3.3 in order to make wifi work (as opposed to kernel 3.19.0 as used by Trusty). I've reverted to kernel 4.2.0-22 as it's on the Trusty repos (and makes wifi work) rather than revert to 4.3.3 (which is intended for Xenial which I downloaded from the Linux kernels website).\n", "Q: Can I toggle the placement of the Unity Launcher on multiple screens? I run an asynchronous dual montior setup. My primary monitor is a 16:9 2560x1440 and my secondary is 10:16 1200x1920 setup. I use the primary for coding/gaming/videos and the secondary for browsing, and reference materials.I also prefer to keep the launcher on the secondary monitor as it is on the right hand side of my primary.\nThe problem is that some of my games seem to think that the monitor which the launcher is on is considered the primary monitor. Some games give me launch options where I can force it over to my preferred monitor but some I need to switch the launcher placement in the display settings. \nI would like to script a solution that allows me to quickly toggle the settings rather than needing to go into the screen display ui every time. I found ~/.config/monitors.xml and have tried swapping the primary monitor and then killing unity-settings-daemon and restarting it but that seems like it's not without side effects. Does anyone know a better way?\n\nA: Launcher positions\nLauncher positions can be defined by two parameters:\n1. Launcher on all screens, or just on one\nis set by the commands:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/num-launchers 0\n\nto show on all screens, or\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/num-launchers 1\n\nto show on a single screen\n2. The screen where the Launcher is visible\nIn the latter case (launcher only on one screen), the launcher is only visible on the primary screen. In  other words, we need to set (toggle) the primary screen. This can be done with the command:\nxrandr --output <screen_name> --primary\n\nWhat we need is a script to look up the currently set primary screen (from the output of the xrandr command), and choose \"the other one\", and so does the script below. \n \nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\n# Look up the currently set primary screen, set it to the other one\nscr_data = subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\nscrs = [[l.split()[0], \"primary\" in l] for l in scr_data if \" connected\" in l]\nfor screen in scrs:\n    if not screen[1] == True:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xrandr\", \"--output\", screen[0], \"--primary\"])\n\nIf you also need to make sure the launcher is set to show on a single screen, use:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\n# just to make sure the launcher is set to only show on one screen:\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"dconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/num-launchers 1\"])\n\n# Look up the currently set primary screen, set it to the other one\nscr_data = subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\nscrs = [[l.split()[0], \"primary\" in l] for l in scr_data if \" connected\" in l]\nfor screen in scrs:\n    if not screen[1] == True:\n        subprocess.Popen([\"xrandr\", \"--output\", screen[0], \"--primary\"])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as toggle_launcher.py\n\n*Test- run it by the command:\npython3 /path/to/toggle_launcher.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".

So the command is equivalent to cd, which switches to the current user's home directory.\nAs you reported, you end up with a prompt of ... ~ #, which, with default config means that you are logged in as the root user and that you currently are in root's home directory (~ is a shortcut for a user's home).\nOn a default Ubuntu setup, the home of root is /root. So cding to home doesn't work, as you are not in the root directory and therefore the shell doesn't know where to go. But you should always be able to cd /.

It detects it in the installer and command line Parted in both Legacy and UEFI mode, and I'm able to install it either way.\n\nA: Uninstalled Windows 10, and while Gparted doesn't see the SSD, I can install Ubuntu to it in either boot mode.\n", "Q: Create Startup Screen Is it possible to make my own screen instead of having those 5 orange/white dots.

Why did the line apt-cache search libgtk2.0 not give any result called libgtk2.0 also?\n\nA: -0 at the end means  that there was not a debian package yet.

I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 on this SSD (does not matter if I have to remove Windows for that) and use 1 TB HDD to store data.\nThe problem I am having right now is that Ubuntu installer does not detect SSD, it only shows 1 TB HDD. I have tried different versions of Ubuntu (14.04, 15.04, 15.10) but the same problem is there. Also, GParted (latest version with support for NVMe devices) is not able to show the SSD but Windows shows both SSD and HDD. SSD has NVMe controller type and PCIe as controller interface whereas HDD has AHCI controller type and SATA as controller interface and the SATA Configuration is RAID. There is no option in UEFI to change any of these options.\nI am not able to figure out why the SSD is not being shown on Ubuntu installer or GParted. Does anyone have any idea what can be the reason?\nEDIT : It looks like it might be because Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) is enabled. Can this be the reason that GParted and Ubuntu is not able to see the SSD? There is no option to disable it from the UEFI. How can I disable it from Windows 10? Also, only windows can see SSD and it has Windows OS installed on it.. Is it possible that it is locked so that no one else can see it?

Please try again with a newer version of GParted and you should no longer have any problems!\n\nA: First, you need to disable secure boot on your laptop. Startup your laptop and go into the BIOS - this is usually F2/F10 key. Change the setting in boot to disable secure boot and disable UEFI if its enabled. Use the legacy mode to install. When the Ubuntu install screen appears it will automatically setup the system with UEFI if its available.\nIf the above does not help, then you need to remove the disk from the laptop and put it into an another laptop or an usb 2 enclosure to find out if the disk is alright.\n", "Q: Empty curly braces and semicolon in bash What does\n{} \\;\n\nstring mean in bash?\nI've seen it a couple of times, for example, to find and delete all files by name one must execute\nfind . -name \"FILE-TO-FIND\" -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nWhat does this string do?\n\nA: Both {} and ; have special meanings in bash but in the context of find, it is find which actually interprets these two (actually we want find to interpret these two). \nFirst of all, -exec is an action of find. {} and ; are special parameters for the -exec predicate of find.\nThe syntax for the -exec action is:\n-exec command ;\n\nor\n-exec command {} + \n\nSo we need to keep {} and ; from being interpreted by shell beforehand.\nIn the context of find .... -exec:\n\n\n*\n\n*{} indicates (contains) the result(s) from the find expression i.e. find . -name \"FILE-TO-FIND\" in this case. Note that empty curly braces {} have no special meaning to shell so we can get away without escaping {}\n\n*As bash treats ; as end of a command, we need to escape this with \\ i.e. \\; so that it can be parsed by -exec not by bash itself. \n", "Q: 15.10 hangs on loading on Lenovo thinkpad tablet 2 I followed this instruction \nGot access to grub boot menu: Try ubuntu..., Install ubuntu..., OEM install..., Check disk...\nSelecting any item of menu leads to blank scren, couple of seconds blinking by USB then hangs.\nI've tried 14.10 amd64, 15.10 amd64 with same results.\nTried 14.10 x86, 15.10 x86 - these simply throw me to grub command line.\nReally appreciate any help on how can I diagnose the root cause of hanging ?\nOr probably any workarounds ?\n\nA: This is missing functionaltiy in grub2 / ubuntu  for UEFI 32-bit BIOS\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1341944\nIt might be a good idea to  copy  latest debian EFI loader to Ubuntu 15.10 64-bit boot , as the the last comment in the bug report suggests, and not the EFI loader which is mentioned in the instruction , as it refers to older 14.10 ubuntu installation .\nUpdate -  the Atom processor  in this tablet does not support 64-bit instructions, so we must use 32-bit Ubuntu installer, which in turn not support UEFI at all.\nSo better to try multi-arch Debian instead, according to Intel blogs.\nhttp://blogs.intel.com/evangelists/2015/08/11/update-on-ia32-uefi-and-linux-support/\n", "Q: What will be the default filesystem in 16.04?

Ironically, Wikipedia states\n\nIn 2008, the principal developer of the ext3 and ext4 file systems,\n  Theodore Ts'o, stated that although ext4 has improved features, it is\n  not a major advance, it uses old technology, and is a stop-gap.\n\nIt would be nice to get a few new features (ext5?) ... like built-in checksums to help detect and reduce bitrot (perhaps with file-by-file compression).\nbtrfs seems to continue to be around the corner but suffers from narrow adoption; and although Ubuntu has just announced zfs support, I don't think it is targeted to become the default.\n\nA: If there were any plans to change the default filesystem, they would be part of the blueprints for 16.04.

Also using compizconfig-settings-manager and re-enabling the Unity-plugin didn't help (although it was disabled, in case that's relevant information).\nI then just tried to install alternative desktop environments and display mangers, and that's where things started to get weird: namely, it turned out that lxde and openbox do work under both lightdm and gdm, while  unity and gnome-shell don't work on either (after login, just a background image appears and nothing more).\nOne additional thing that sometimes happened in lxde was that an \"Internal Error\" box showed up, containing (among others) the following information:\n\nTitle: xorg crashed with SIGABRT in __libc_message()\nCompizPlugins: No value set for `/apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/active_plugins\n\n(but this only showed up after I already reinstalled and changed many things, so it might be related to problem or not).\nNow, I have no idea where the failing is actually happening, but I suspect compiz...\n\nWhat I actually was doing before this happended:\n\n*\n\n*Installing 14.04 on a separate partition (1) from the original installation (2) (also 14.04)\n\n*Normal login, so the default unity, lightdm and ubuntu-desktop did work\n\n*Installing some programs\n\n*Mounting my old /home from the old installation, which is on a third partition (3), as /home for the new installation (and setting this in the new fstab)\n\n*Installing more stuff, and deleting some config directories/files from ~ which I thought are not needed anymore\n\n*At some point here, I have also used unity-tweak-tool, but only to increase the number of virtual workspaces\n\n*Resizing partitions (1) and (2)\n\n*Reboot\n\nAfter the last reboot, said things happended. I don't think the partitioning stuff plays any role, but I mention it for completeness; but maybe my reusing the old /home did something weird? On the other hand, I (think I) rebooted at least once with it mounted as /home of the new install, without problems.\nI also use a dual-monitor setup, but that has never caused any problems.\n\nThe question is: is there anything else I could do for getting unity back and gnome-shell work? Or should I just reinstall everything -- in which case, should I not just reuse the old /home, or would that not be a problem?\n\nA: Probably some configuration file has gone wrong. Most applications build a default configuration if they don't find thei config directory.\nUsing a console save your config directories (those starting their name with a \".\") into a new folder (e.g. ~/old_configs) - look what happens.\n", "Q: What is exactly Linux From Scratch? I want to developing a Linux From Scratch but is that custom Linux like based on some kind of linux ?

Can anyone help me to write a utility for Ubuntu that we all could use to stop /boot from becoming full?\nI would like a utility that can either a) remove old files regularly when boot is getting full or b) be run just before Update or Upgrade to remove old files in the boot folder to avoid \"lack of space\" errors.\nIf such a utility (or maybe a similar, more generic one) already exists, please could someone point me to it (and how to use it for only the unwanted files) to avoid re-inventing the wheel.\nThanks for all helpful answers. Bill\n\nA: The main reason why /boot becomes full (I suppose you have a different partition for it) are the kernel upgrades. Every time a new kernel is installed the old one does not get removed for security reasons, so you end up with multiple kernels.\nYou can follow the instructions from this website:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Documentation/RemoveOldKernels\nIt is from the official Ubuntu documentation, and explains the process of removing old kernels. It also has instructions for using a script to do it.\nWhen you are going to remove old kernels, ALWAYS remember to KEEP:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your current kernel (get its name with the 'uname -r' command);\n\n*The previous kernel.\nSo that you will have your current working kernel and a security version for recovery.\nAlso remember to regularly purge old kernels (2 in 2 months should be OK) so you clean up your /boot partition. Note that the /boot partition should have about 5GB, have you considered increasing its size?\n", "Q: Eclipse desktop shortcut keeps disappearing at every startup?

While this is not a problem for starting Eclipse, it is however rather annoying. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Install the desktop file using the following,\nsudo desktop-file-install /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop\n\nCreate a link file using the below command to open eclipse in command mode.\nsudo ln -s /opt/eclipse/eclipse /usr/local/bin/\n\nThat’s it , Now you can launch eclipse.\n", "Q: Do i need to install proprietary driver for AMD A8 APU? I m using default driver for my AMD A8-5550M APU with Radeon HD Graphics(dual graphics).But i also found that proprietary driver is also available. Do i need to install it? Does installing it will make any difference?\n\n\nA: If you don't have any problems with the Xorg driver, and no program require the fglrx driver, I'd stick to the default one.\nI've changed a lot between both drivers, so here are my experiences, also with an AMD A8 APU, but a different model:\n\n\n*\n\n*fglrx supports a more recent OpenGL version E.g. Bioshock Infinite requires fglrx, as the Mesa OpenGL version supported by the Xorg driver (in my case OpenGL 3.3) is too old to support the methods used by this game. And before anyone asks, yes, Bioshock Infinite has been ported to run natively on Linux. However, I've already played some games that would only work when not using fglrx.\n\n*The Xorg driver seems to produce fewer glitches when rendering the desktop. E.g. the menu item selection in Cinnamon's launcher would start to jump around with fglrx if the mouse was between two entries and not hovering the text, whereas the problem doesn't occur with the Xorg driver.\n\n*My boot animation was drawn in an incorrect screen ratio when using fglrx instead of the Xorg driver, although I mostly blame the unacceptably buggy UEFI implementation from HP.\n\n*Programs using OpenCL (perform certain calculations on the GPU rather than the CPU) only work with fglrx, and not with the Xorg driver.\n\n*I've heard and read rumors that the APU consumed less power when using fglrx, leading to a longer lasting on-battery-time, but I can't confirm this as I run my notebook on AC power 99% of time.\n\n\nSo it depends on what you need most: A driver of which you know it works (as you are currently using it) or one that supports newer technology, such as later OpenGL versions, e.g. required for some games. But as long as the Xorg driver works fine, you don't need fglrx.\nIf you decide to install the AMD proprietary fglrx driver, best fetch it directly from AMD's website, as the versions in Ubuntu's repos are not quite up-to-date.\n", "Q: How to search .tex files? I want to search methyldopa in .tex files by the Ubuntu search. I just included the files in my Dropbox folder which may be confusing Ubuntu's search tool. However, I see those files in Recent files of the search tool. I search also unsuccessfully methyldopa .tex but also doing unsuccessfully just methyldopa and limiting Type to Documents, Folders and Other. \nI run sudo updatedb and still unsuccessful searches. \nHow can you search .tex files in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS?\n\nA: Although you are looking for a GUI solution, I would like to share a command line solution, because I think it is quite handy and easy to use:\ntl;dr:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use grep -w methyldopa *.tex | cut -d\":\" -f1 if all files are in the same directory.\n\n*Use find -name \"*.tex\" -exec grep -H -w methyldopa {} \\; | cut -d\":\" -f1 in a directory, where all files sou want to find are in subdirectories.\n\n*Edit: Shortest Way (credits to @A.B.): grep -rwl methyldopa | grep .tex\nlong version with explanations:\nFirst Case:\nAll files, you want to search are in the same directory.\nThis is the easiest scenario. You can simply use \ngrep -w methyldopa *.tex | cut -d\":\" -f1 \n\nto find all .tex files containing methyldopa.\nExplanation:\nDirectory and file content:\nfile1.txt\nfile2.txt\nfile3.list\n\n#file1.txt\nfoo\nbar\nfoobar\n\n#file2.txt\nfoo\nfoobar\n1337\n\n#file3.list\nfoo\nbar\nfoobar\n\nNow, you can use grep foo * to search for foo in all files. This is waht you will get:\nfile1.txt:foo\nfile1.txt:foobar\nfile2.txt:foo\nfile2.txt:foobar\nfile3.list:foo\nfile3.list:foobar\n\nUsing the -w option, will prevent finding foobar:\ngrep -w foo *\n\nfile1.txt:foo\nfile2.txt:foo\nfile3.list:foo\n\nIf you want to restrict your search to files with a special ending, you can do the following:\ngrep -w foo *.txt\n\nfile1.txt:foo\nfile2.txt:foo\n\nLast, but not least, you can pipe the results to a cut command to extract only the filenames (-d\":\" sets the field separator to :, -f1 returns the first field of each line):\ngrep -w foo *.txt | cut -d\":\" -f1\n\nfile1.txt\nfile2.txt\n\nSecond Case:\nYour files are in different directories. In this case, you should use find to find the files first:\nfind -name \"*.txt\" -exec grep -H -w foo {} \\; | cut -d\":\" -f1\n\nExplanation:\nfind -name \"*.txt\" searches for files ending with .txt in your current directory and all subdirectories. You can use something like find ~/Documents/ -name \"*.txt\" to start searching at ~/Documents.\n-exec grep -H -w foo {} \\; searches for foo in each file that was found and returns something like this (the -H flag makes sure, that the filename is printed): \n./testdir/file2.txt:foo\n./testdir/file1.txt:foo\n\nLike in the first case, | cut -d\":\" -f1 cuts out the filenames from the output.\n\nA: For a graphical solution (and a more powerful one, when it works correctly --- which is most of the time) is to install recoll.\nYou will need to install it using the PPA --- look at the download instructions (scroll down to the part for Ubuntu systems). \nAfter having installed it, choose a kind of indexing (I do mine overnight for this still unresolved problem --- which is probably due to some strange configuration in my system), you have a very powerful tool to find files in your system (even contents of files like ODS spreadsheet or compressed archives ort similar things). \nIn your case simply call the Recoll interface: \n\n(I used \"puente\" as the search term because I have no methyldopa around ;-)) --- the search is written in the recoll query language.. \n\nA: I suggest to use Recoll for an indexed search with a graphical interface and a preview functionality! It is in the official repositories, easy to use and very powerful.\n\nA: Use the script which I call haetex for the system-wide search.

Read the sudoers manpage for examples of nastiness.  In particular, note that this line in sudoers allows the user to add any number of -o switches or other arguments to mount.  You may want to rethink your approach, e.g. by adding a script such as @Braiam proposes and allow running that through sudo without extra authentication.  The script then ensures that users can only run the specific form of mount that you want them to run.\nAlso, instead of allowing this for all users, you could also limit this to members of a certain group, e.g. you could create a group cifsmount and then have\n%cifsmount ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/mount -t cifs //*/* /media/* -o username=*\n\n\nA: You should instead make the user do the call of using sudo as sudo script. just check if the script is being run as root, if not ask for it\nif [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then\n   echo \"This script must be run as root, use sudo \"$0\" instead\" 1>&2\n   exit 1\nfi\n\nDon't try to capture the password of your users.\n\nA: I'm dumb!\nThe following script:\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"Password: \" -s szPassword\nprintf \"%s\\n\" \"$szPassword\" | sudo --stdin mount -t cifs //192.168.1.1/home /media/$USER/home -o username=$USER,password=\"$szPassword\"\n\njust works and:\n\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't create any files containing passwords\n\n*Allows the user to type only one password for multiple shares (including Windows ones)\n\n*Has no need for extra privileges to be granted.  :-)\n\nA: A general solution to these issues is to put the following preamble at the top of your sudo requiring scripts:\n#!/bin/bash\ncase $EUID in\n   0) : cool we are already root - fall through ;;\n   *) # not root, become root for the rest of this session\n      # (and ask for the sudo password only once)\n      sudo $0 \"$@\" ;;\nesac\n# now the present process is effective-UID  (root)\n# so there's no need to put sudo in front of commands\n\nany more commands here will run as superuser ...\n\nObviously, this has a downside in that if some commands in the script don't require sudo to run, there's an unnecessary elevation of privileges here.\nAnyway, thought I would share this little tip. The nicest thing about it, is that if you're already effective-uid root (e.g. if you already called it under sudo) it gracefully does the right thing. Also giving an error and forcing you to retype/rerun (with sudo) is less friendly.  \nYou may also want to check out the timestamp_timeout variable in man 5 sudoers which tells sudo to remember user credentials for a limited number of minutes (and can be fractional).\n", "Q: New Distro 15.10 Wireless No Longer Works I have TWO USB wireless network adapters, one is a REALTEK and one is an EDIMAX, both of them use the RTL8188CU chipset.\nThe used to work OOTB on previous versions of UBUNTU but now neither one of them will connect on 15.10.\nAre there any USB Network adapters which work Right of the bat or can someone point me in the direction of a workaround?\nMany thanks\nPaul \n\nA: I would like to reference this page on help.ubuntu.com.\nProvides information on troubleshooting wireless network.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/net-wireless-troubleshooting.html\n", "Q: second hard drive, encrypted (LUKS, but mounts separately) I have two storage devices in my machine.  When I installed ubuntu, it offered to format the SSD and install to it, which was what I wanted.  I didn't offer to do anything with the second.  Fair enough.  I can see that it's there with lshw.\nSo I can use LUKS to format the second drive and mount it at /home2.  On my desktop, this arrangement isn't too annoying, because the machine is up most of the time.  But having to do an explicit mount of /home2 isn't great on my laptop, there are just too many boots in its life.\nI don't think I have a preference on LUKS vs ecryptfs.\nWhat I'd prefer is to see the second storage device mounted when I login with my password decrypting it, as it does my home directory.  I don't see how to do this, though.  Any pointers?\nThanks.\n\nA: You could use eCryptFS and make a private folder on the second drive, it could decrypt automatically as you log in (see ecryptfs-setup-private and this other answer about a different ~/.Private (use a link).\nBut the second drive's partition would have to be mounted already. Having it in /etc/fstab should mount it automatically at boot time (unless the \"noauto\" option is present).\nOr you could just click on the partition's name in most file managers after logging in to mount it, but then the eCryptFS private folder wouldn't be automatically decrypted/mounted on login, and you'd have to call ecryptfs-mount-private yourself and probably re-type your login passphrase, or the wrapping passphrase.\n", "Q: installing Canon LBP 6230dn network printer on Ubuntu 14.04 I am very new to Linux world, last one week trying to install Canon LBP 6230dn printer in Ubuntu.

My situation is quite special, I like to buy an Ubuntu Phone for more safety and for having an open source OS.

They aren't actually that much of a hassle to use, and don't eat up too many resources.\nI'm afraid I don't know of any serious sign-language translators having a native Linux build or being open source. So emulators will have to do for now.\n\nA: You can get Android apps working in Linux with Chrome and ARchon.\nThe process is slightly involved, but not too bad.\nCheck out - https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk/blob/master/archon.md\nAlso you should let the developers of those apps know you would like Linux support and maybe you can post what that app is.

The output message is helpful and explanatory.\nIn the end, I only backed up the content of my ~/Documents!

The Boot Menu is typically F12, and BIOS on Lenovo is typically F2. For Boot Menu, press F12 when the \"Lenovo\" logo appears at startup, then select your disk drive to boot from DVD.

However, they don't resolve this new problem with having the scrollbars disappear unless you hover your mouse over the window.\nThis problem (after using all the disable overlay scrollbars fixes) is easily reproduced by bringing up Nautilus with a folder that has more items than will fit in one window.  I have always used a quick glance at the window to know if I were seeing the full contents of the folder by seeing the presence of a scrollbar.  Now I can't tell without constantly wiggling the mouse over the window.  Since I often have 10's of windows opened spreaded across three monitors, I spend a lot of time wiggling the mouse to identify if I have the full content in view, or the portion of the content that is in view.\nThe problem is also easily produced by running Eclipses which I also have multiple windows running with various editors.  I have to constantly wiggle the mouse on those windows also to check to see the portion of the text that is being displayed.\nThe closest question that I found that comes to this problem is How to disable overlay scrollbar hiding behavior.  That resolution is one of the ones I have used for years to remove the overlay.  This fix was introduced 4 years before this new behavior of bringing back the scrollbar, but hiding it unless the mouse is recently wiggled over the window.\nRunning these commands I get:\n$ export GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0\n$ gdbus call --session --dest org.freedesktop.DBus --object-path /org/freedesktop/DBus --method org.freedesktop.DBus.UpdateActivationEnvironment '{\"GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING\": \"0\"}'\n\nOutput:\n()\n\n\nA: With 15.10 Ubuntu switched to Gnome-scrollbars. Searching for this topic I found https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/37bp1r/how_do_i_disable_316s_overlay_scrollbars/ where it is suggested to use the following commands:\nexport GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING=0\ngdbus call --session --dest org.freedesktop.DBus --object-path /org/freedesktop/DBus --method org.freedesktop.DBus.UpdateActivationEnvironment '{\"GTK_OVERLAY_SCROLLING\": \"0\"}'\nI just tested these commands on UbuntuGnome 17.04, the scrollbars stopped hiding and were visible all the time without hovering over them.\nIf the commands work for you, you may add them to your ~/.profile-file.\n", "Q: Windows 8 / Ubuntu 14.04 desktop dual boot on multiple large disks I'm trying to install Ubuntu 14.04.3 desktop 64 bit developer edition with dual boot option with my Windows 8.1 PC having two disks (1- 1tb, 2- 3tb), but during installation if I choose Install Ubuntu alongside Windows then I get this error message: starting sector number, 4294967296 exceeds the msdos-partition-table-imposed maximum of 4294967295\nDisk Management:\n\nPartition style of Disk 0 is GPT, but for Disk 1 it's MBR.\nSystem information:\n\nWindows 8.1 came pre-installed when we bought the PC.\nIf you noticed I have allocated 200GB free space on Disk 0 for Ubuntu and I want to use this space for Ubuntu.\nHow can I install Ubuntu as a dual boot without losing my Windows?\n\nA: Based on that error message, it sounds like you're trying to install Linux onto the 3TB disk. Since you used the MS-DOS partition table for that disk (which I would recommend against doing that), you are not allowed to store any data beyond that 2GB point. It would probably make sense for you to convert that into a GPT disk so you can utilize all of your space!\nIn order to actually solve your issue, be careful to choose that 200GB partition on disk 0  as your Linux target (in Linux it will be presented as something like /dev/sda5).\nOne trick to preventing you from accidentally installing to the wrong device is to just unplug the additional drives before installing Linux. Simply plug them back in once you have your dual boot set up.\nI strongly recommend using manual mode to configure your partitions when installing Linux. It really isn't much more difficult than the wizard, but in my experience the wizard never seems to do exactly what I need.

What are the general rules for knowing when command options are prefixed by -- as opposed to -?\nEdit: An answer referencing a canonical source, such as steeldriver's is preferred. One suggested duplicate refers to Wikipedia which is okay but probably not as good as a GNU documentation link.\nSecond edit: I think the title is not my original so if it misleads, I'm sorry, it was not my edit. That probably explains why some comments direct me to the man page.\n\nA: In general, the single dash - introduces single letter options, where the letter is a mnemonic for the name of the option. \nThe double dash -- introduces long option names, where the name of the option is a whole word. \nAFAIK this convention was introduced in the 1980's by the FSF GNU utilities. Note that the POSIX standard recommends single dash options, except for a double dash to indicate the end of the option list. \nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*When and how was the double-dash (--) introduced as an end of options delimiter in Unix/Linux?\n\n*Command line options style - POSIX or what?\n\n*What is the general syntax of a Unix shell command?\n\nA: About arguments\nLike @kos mentions, the use of either -, -- or no hyphen at all is up to the choice of the developer of the program.\nThe command to run the program itself is the first argument (index 0), the second argument (and further) is defined by the application.\nAn example in python:\nif sys.argv[1] == \"peanutbutter\":\n    print(\"monkey\")\n\nwill print \"monkey\" if the application is called with:\n<application> peanutbutter\n\nIf the code is:\nif sys.argv[1] == \"--peanutbutter\":\n    print(\"monkey\")\n\nThe same will happen when the application is run with:\n<application> --peanutbutter\n\nAs simple as that. Often, either the use of - or -- is conventional.\n\nA: - is usually only followed by a single character. This is a heritage from Unix. -- is usually followed by multiple characters (generally words or sentences), this comes from the GNU project. Usually commands (mainly GNU utilities) come with two parameter types, - and --. For example, in the ls command, the -a and the --all parameters do the exact same thing, but one is an entire word and another is a single letter.\nHaving an entire word as a parameter may be helpful for scripts, for example, because developers can read them and interpret the commands' parameters more easily.\nIn the other hand, having a single letter parameter may become handy when you are in a terminal and want to run commands faster.\nIf you're in doubt about the parameters a command can take, you can try a few commands like:\ncommand --help\ncommand -?\nman command\n\nThe man command will give a more detailed explanation, but some commands do not have man (manual) pages.\n\nA: Generally a command line has three parts:\ncommand -option argument \n\nSo, - this one is known as option and -- this one is called long option.\nIt basically almost do the same jobs, but you have to defy your options clearly with the later one.\nHere are some example of - and -- you can use with the command ls\n\n", "Q: How to mimic Menu key using xte?

I tried\n\"xte 'key Menu'\"\n  b:11\n\nBut that doesn't do anything.\nI've read some examples that use SHIFT+F10 but that doesn't really solve my problem, mainly because some applications (I'm looking at you Dolphin) don't support mimicking the Menu key using SHIfT+10.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Try adding sleep command.

I only use it for printing and only wireless because I don't have a cable attached. The problem is it just stopped working. When trying to print something it loads the paper but then it's like the paper got stuck and you can hear the printer making a noise trying to get the paper, I guess. I searched for videos on how to get it to work when the paper is stuck and there are a lot of videos for that but when I watch them it looks like those are about a different problem than mine. So please anybody, I would appreciate it if someone could help. Thank you.\n\nA: There could be multiple issues here. It could be a driver related issue, or a hardware issue.\nDownload the driver, and install the package. Then make sure the proper driver is selected for the printer. \nIf you have done that, you could try to connect the printer via a USB cable to rule out wireless issues. \nIf that still doesn't fix the issue, you may have a worn out roller or something. \n", "Q: Cannot disable modsecurity engine on Apache 2.4, Ubuntu 14.04 I recently upgraded from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS, and I'm trying to cope with the changes in modsecurity.\nAt first, modsecurity seemed to be completely broken (it was listed as orphaned packages to be removed with autoremove). I autoremoved, deleted the old configs, and then installed libapache2-modsecurity.\nThis seemed to work, however for some reason it seems to be ignoring commands in my virtualhost files. In the past, I have created special rules for different types of sites, and completely disabled the rule engine on pages where it would throw tons of false positives (such as phpmyadmin, or wordpress administration) with the following commands in the virtual host file:\n<Directory /xxx/phpmyadmin>\n   SecRuleEngine Off\n</Directory>\n\nHowever, this no longer works. If I set in modsecurity.conf:\nSecRuleEngine On\n\nI cannot access the page at all - it immediately throws a 401 not permitted. The only solution I've found so far is to completely disable the engine in modsecurity.conf (even DetectionOnly will throw the errors):\nSecRuleEngine Off\n\nMy question is, has something changed in apache 2.4 that would ignore these directory-specific settings? I have tried surrounding it in an IfModule security2_module and also adding the command to a .htaccess file in the directory with no result.\nThanks!\n\nA: So I think I've figured it out, though I can't find any documentation on apache or modsecurity which would explain why it's not working the way it used to. Anyway, I'll post my solution here in case anyone else has the same problem.\nSetting the SecRuleEngine flag in the modsecurity.conf file now overwrites all other values in virtual hosts, so it's either all on or all off. Setting it on here also seems to ignore SecRuleRemoveById flags in virtual hosts as well, which is pretty bad.\nI've commented out the SecRuleEngine flag in modsecurity.conf, and I'm setting it on a folder-by-folder basis in my virtual hosts file. For example:\n<Directory ***>\n    <IfModule security2_module>\n        SecRuleRemoveById xxxxxx\n        SecRuleEngine On\n    </IfModule>\n</Directory>\n\nThis seems to be working for me now.\n", "Q: how to fix my partitions I have no idea about how i did but my partitions are mess.  \nI tried some solutions about similar issues which i found on ubuntu forums but no one worked.

LVM are more or less dynamic partitions which you can resize or manage otherwise while the system is running. To read something about what LVM2 is see: https://askubuntu.com/a/3833/178692\nSo your hard drive has three station designations which are sda1, sda2 and sda3.\nYou have a very large volume containing the root (ubuntu--vg-root) and the remaining part of the drive contains the swap (ubuntu--vg-swap_1). Since your hard drive is filled with the volumes you'll need to shrink one first before you can enlarge the other. Since you don't show how much space is used in each one I can't give you details about shrinking.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 freezes, shut down, suspend, restart doesn´t work (ACER Aspire E-15 Start) I am using ubuntu 15.10 and I am unable to shut down, restart, suspend, although logging off/on works. \nI have tried to update the grub with this command: sudo grub-update then my ubuntu system can't recognize the grub-update.\nI have also tried this:\n$ sudo apt-get update \n$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n$ sudo apt-get install unity\n$ setsid unity\n\nI have also tried from other comment, to change in BIOS from legacy to UEFI - but then my system just can't recognize that I have ubuntu system installed.

Normally, it will be automatically mounted under /media. If you don't find it there, use sudo disk -l to see its info.\nAssuming your system partition is /dev/sda1 then run the following commands in a terminal:\nmkdir mnt\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 mnt\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\nsudo chroot mnt\n\nYou will now be inside a chroot environment meaning that running commands here is equivalent to running them on your installed system. Firstly, try to reinstall GRUB2 to the device so that it copies the correct files into the /boot folder.\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\nFind out which packages installed that have files in the boot directory and reinstall them. This will replace the kernel images that have been deleted among other things. The command to find the package is:\ndpkg -S /boot\n\nAnd to reinstall them. For example, reinstall the linux image you told above:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-3.19.0-41-generic\n\nAfter all, update the grub loader:\nupdate-grub\n\nFinally, reboot your system\n\nA: I was able to reproduce this very same problem, here 's what I did to solve it\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Live USB.\n\n*Mount encrypted partition . You can do this following Tung Tran 's commands or through Nautilus graphical interface; which will interactively ask for the password of this partition.\n\n*Download the boot files that you require. You can download them the usual way Tung Tran 's described or with the command sudo apt-get install linux-image-4.4.0-21-generic. You can also download those files with your browser at ubuntu's official repository (http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/linux-image-4.4.0-21-generic)\n\n*Copy your files to the /boot directory of the mounted partition.\n\n*Reboot your pc and in case it doesn't boot automatically and GRUB menu appears, go to advanced options and select, your image just loaded. In this case that would be linux-image-4.4.0-21-generic\n\n", "Q: Skullcandy plyr1 spdif output I would like to use spdif output to my plyr1 headphones, but as skullcandy doesn't have a setup guide for them on ubuntu, I don't know how to.

In the following simple script, I am experimenting with the read command.\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"Enter a path to a file: \" file_to_copy\ncp $file_to_copy /tmp\n\nIf the user enters the entire path to a test file e.g. /home/$USER/test when prompted, the script executes as expected and makes a copy of \"test\" in the /tmp directory. However, if the user enters the shorthand ~/test, terminal returns the error cp: cannot stat '~/test': No such file or directory. Why is the command cp unable to find an equivalent representation of the file path when entered?\nIf I independently enter in terminal:\ncp ~/test /tmp\n\nthe test file is copied without incident, so it is probably a nuance of  variable assignment that I messed up, but I cannot figure it out.\nThanks.\n\nA: Try these commands in your script:\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"Enter a path to a file: \" file_to_copy\nfile_to_copy=$(bash -c \"echo $file_to_copy\")\nfile_to_copy=${file_to_copy/~\\//$HOME\\/}\ncp \"${file_to_copy}\" /tmp\n\nExplanation: \n\n\n*\n\n*The third line will expand env variable values if any present.\n\n*The fourth line in the above code will try to search for ~ in your file_to_copy variable and if found it will be replace by $HOME path.\n\n*And \\/ here \\ is a backslash escape sequence character for /, as we want to replace ~/ with $HOME/.\n\nA: What happens is that you literally ask shell to find ~/test from the directory the script is currently in. In other words, if you run from /home/$USER, it will be looking for file test in subdirectory named ~, not the expansion /home/$USER/test. \nWhat you can use is bash's eval built in, which will take any arguments and put them together as one command and let the shell run it. Now, shell will expand ~. \nxieerqi:\n$ ./copyScript.sh                                                                                                       \nEnter a path to a file: ~/test\nEntered /home/xieerqi/test\n\nxieerqi:\n$ ls -l /tmp/test\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 xieerqi xieerqi 0 Dec 21 01:14 /tmp/test\n\nxieerqi:\n$ cat copyScript.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nread -p \"Enter a path to a file: \" file_to_copy\nfile_to_copy=$(eval echo $file_to_copy)\necho \"Entered $file_to_copy\"\ncp \"$file_to_copy\" /tmp\n\nI'd suggest you also use quotes around the command-substitution $( . . .) , to ensure that files with spaces in them and special character will be properly captured into file_to_copy variable\nADDITION\nAs stated in the comments, eval built-in can be dangerous. \nPersonally, I use the readlink command quite often in my scripts and avoid using ~. And since in this script you ask for user input anyway, why not use command line arguments ? Like so:\nxieerqi:\n$ ./copyScript.sh testFile.txt                                \n/home/xieerqi/testFile.txt\n\nxieerqi:\n$ cat copyScript.sh                                           \n#!/bin/bash\n\nFILE=\"$(readlink -f \"$@\" )\"\n\necho $FILE\n# uncomment for copying\n# cp $FILE /tmp\n\ndirname and basename\nGNU coreutils provides two commands, basename and dirname. basename shows last element in the path , and dirname shows everything preceding last element. One could use bash's internal parameter expansion to do the same, but since we have these tools - why not use them:\nxieerqi:\n$ ./copyScript.sh                                             \nEnter path to file: ~/testFile.txt\nFile entered is  /home/xieerqi/testFile.txt\n\nxieerqi:\n$ ./copyScript.sh                                             \nEnter path to file: ~/sumFile.txt\nFile entered is  /home/xieerqi/sumFile.txt\nERROR, file doesn't exist\n\nxieerqi:\n$ cat copyScript.sh                                           \n#!/bin/bash\n\nread -p \"Enter path to file: \" FILEPATH\n\nDIRPATH=\"$(dirname \"$FILEPATH\")\"\nFILENAME=\"$(basename \"$FILEPATH\" )\"\n\nif [ \"$DIRPATH\" == \"~\"   ];then\n  DIRPATH=\"$HOME\"\nfi\n\nFILEPATH=\"$DIRPATH\"/\"$FILENAME\"\necho \"File entered is \" \"$FILEPATH\"\n\n[ -e \"$FILEPATH\"  ] || { echo \"ERROR, file doesn't exist\"; exit 1;}\n\n", "Q: Can I use UBUNTU SERVER AS A REGULAR COMPUTER?

My Laptop has Windows 8.1 and ubuntu (Although i use it less frequently than windows). I wanted to format my windows version as it has become really slower and battery draining is very bad. I wanted to know if I could do this without any affect on the ubuntu partition.\n\nA: Yes you can, you can even do it from Ubuntu, first\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nNow run this\nsudo gparted\n\nNow find your Windows partition and right click and choose delete\n\nNow click apply and Windows is gone, Ubuntu is untouched, and you can do whatever you want with the empty partition.\n\nA: \nI wanted to know if I could do this without any affect on the Ubuntu partition.\n\nYes, this is possible. \nAs long as you do not touch the Ubuntu partitions during your formatting of Windows 8 you will be fine. And you can format the partition from either Windows or from Ubuntu (using gparted).\nWindows will overwrite GRUB though and you will need to re-install it from the Ubuntu live session. There is a wiki page Recovering Ubuntu After Installing Windows on this. \nThings to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a backup of the files you deem important. \n\n*Operating systems need to be installed with the same configuration. So no fast boot from Windows (it probably will default to this), make sure you either install with or without UEFI depending on how it is set up now (Windows probably will default to UEFI). \n\n", "Q: Trusted kernel and Intel Trusted Boot I have searched and I have found this link explaining Trusted Boot quite detailed, but for Windows:\nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-trusted-execution-technology-intel-txt/topic/391211\nI see there is a kernel with trusted boot feature and it worked on my laptop enabled with this technology;\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the advantages of running a trusted boot kernel on Linux?  \n\n*What are the potential disadvantages of running a trusted boot kernel?\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: The trusted boot is explained for windows because it is fully implemented by Microsoft.\nIf you'd like to read about trusted boot on Ubuntu here there is an Ubuntu official wiki page that explains pretty good the steps.\nAbout your questions advantages/disadvantages, it is a dilemma in my personal opinion....\nTrusted boot is about enabling security at hardware/firmware level and not software level, which is a security countermeasure to avoid malware load before the operating system(s).\nSaid that, in the other end, by enabling security boot you are basically putting your system in the hand of Microsoft. Today Microsoft supports trusted boot for a number of Linux distros and it doesn't include custom Linux distros but Linux Foundation has implemented a generic loader signed by Microsoft that will allow any Linux to load, read this link from Linux foundation.\nThe problem is, this is always signed by Microsoft, in simple words there are two disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft is not a community such as Linux, it is a capital gain company and if it loses its interest towards Linux it can cut it out at any time.\n\n*You are losing your freedom\n\n\nThe history will tell by itself that there will be never a good relationship between companies like Microsoft and communities such as Free Open Source Software.\nI hope this will help you understand.\nThanks\n\nA: \"Trusted Boot\" is another name for what we'd call Secure Boot. I can't explain the sequence of components better than the wiki :\n\nIn order to boot on the widest range of systems, Ubuntu uses the following chain of trust:\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft signs Canonical's 'shim' 1st stage bootloader with their 'Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA'. When the system boots and Secure Boot is enabled, firmware verifies that this 1st stage bootloader (from the 'shim-signed' package) is signed with a key in DB (in this case 'Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA')\n\n\n*The second stage bootloader (grub-efi-amd64-signed) is signed with Canonical's 'Canonical Ltd. Secure Boot Signing' key. The shim 1st stage bootloader verifies that the 2nd stage grub2 bootloader is properly signed.\n\n\n*The 2nd stage grub2 bootloader boots an Ubuntu kernel (as of 2012/11, if the kernel (linux-signed) is signed with the 'Canonical Ltd. Secure Boot Signing' key, then grub2 will boot the kernel which will in turn apply quirks and call ExitBootServices. If the kernel is unsigned, grub2 will call ExitBootServices before booting the unsigned kernel)\n\n\n*If signed kernel modules are supported, the signed kernel will verify them during kernel boot\n\nIt works too (speaking from experience).\nIs it any better? On paper, yes, but I'm not sure. There still seem to be plenty of stories around of Windows users getting bootloader-level infections even with Secure Boot. It's supposed to be a faster boot too, but again, this isn't something I've really noticed.\nIf you have the option to disable it, you have an option if it doesn't work (or you want unsigned kernel images, or whatever). If you need it turned on all the time it probably will work because Microsoft (essentially) vouches for us.\n\nA: Unlike other answers suggest: Secure Boot != Trusted Boot.\n\nTrusted Boot takes over where Secure Boot leaves off.\n\nSecure Boot protects the bootloader, requires UEFI. (You should disable CSM.)\nTrusted Boot protects the OS kernel, requires a security chip, like Intel TXT.\n", "Q: Copy paste inside w3m command line browser in ubuntu server After browsing any link using w3m browser, that comes by default with Ubuntu server, I am not able to do copy paste content of webpage.\nI surf link using\nw3m <link>\n\nAfter surfing link, I pressed Ctrl+Insert but did not find any any copy paste option.\nI have installed gpm, but it also not allow to copy.\nPlease help me out.\n\nA: If you're on a server, use screen which provides a mechanism to copy program output/display content independently.

Currently I have installed Ubuntu & Mint on same btrfs partition on SSD ( /dev/sdb5 ). My btrfs pool consists of /dev/sdb5/\nWhat I want to achieve is data replication on HDD while keeping SSD performance: Something like this:\nFor read case it would be ideal for procedure to go like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*read from SSD\n\n*check checksum\n\n*if it verifies.. awesome, give me the data\n\n*if not, fetch data from HDD and perform error correction through duplicate data\n\n\nI'd manually run (some tool I'm not sure which one... btrfs check --repair perhaps?) every month or so to check HDD checksums and corrected them via SSD data against bitrot.\nFor write case:\n\n\n*\n\n*write to SSD\n\n*sync to HDD when write requirements are low, thus not slowing down the system. \n\n\nIs this possible and how would I do it?\n\nA: bcache and dm-cache can use a disk like a SSD as a writeback cache. flashcache and rapiddisk are interesting too. All of them add lots of complexity to your storage stack, if you don't know what you're doing you can easily lose data.\nHonestly, for a general purpose OS workload, it's probably a complete waste of time. These sort of stacks are targeted at IO intensive applications like databases. If you're just trying to experiment I would suggest setting up a different data disk target so you can tinker without wiping out your operating system. Use fio or vdbench to measure your perf.\n", "Q: Boot script issue after formatting computer I am new to Linux, currently using Linux Mint. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to ditch Windows altogether. So I formatted my entire hard disk and installed Linux Mint.\nI got a warning during the installation that I should install a EFI boot partition but I ignored it.\nUpon reboot it couldn't locate the OS so I went into BIOS and switched from UEFI to Legacy.\nI was finally able to boot Mint but upon hitting suspend, it crashed and said \"Boot script table modified\" and shut down.\nI figured using \"boot repair\" would do the trick, so I tried to boot from my USB key but every time (even in UEFI mode) it goes to \"(initramfs) prompts/busybox\" and waits for an input. So I can't even get to the LIVE USB to run \"boot repair\".\nI know I messed up really bad. Does anyone know what's going on?\n\nA: The solution is simple, go to your boot menu when starting your computer and change the option to Legacy Boot. This should fix the problem. This occurs while using Ubuntu also.\n", "Q: Constant reset of full-speed USB device using ehci-pci Running 14.04.3 Ubuntu Desktop on old HP 8510w laptop with USB 2.0 ports only.\nHi, looking at /var/log/syslog or executing dmesg | tail yields the same warning on the constant reset of USB device 008, which apparently is a parallel port.\n$ dmesg | tail\n[13820.044078] usb 2-3.1.2: reset full-speed USB device number 8 using ehci-pci\n[13823.116151] usb 2-3.1.2: reset full-speed USB device number 8 using ehci-pci\n[13825.419253] [UFW AUDIT] IN= OUT=lo SRC=127.0.0.1 DST=127.0.0.1 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=64 ID=727 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=40729 DPT=9058 WINDOW=43690 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 \n[13825.419268] [UFW AUDIT] IN=lo OUT= MAC=00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:08:00 SRC=127.0.0.1 DST=127.0.0.1 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=64 ID=727 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=40729 DPT=9058 WINDOW=43690 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 \n[13825.932046] usb 2-3.1.2: reset full-speed USB device number 8 using ehci-pci\n[13828.236068] usb 2-3.1.2: reset full-speed USB device number 8 using ehci-pci\n[13829.566026] [UFW ALLOW] IN= OUT=eth0 SRC=192.168.1.36 DST=76.74.178.246 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=64 ID=14119 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=41592 DPT=8080 WINDOW=29200 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 \n[13831.052112] usb 2-3.1.2: reset full-speed USB device number 8 using ehci-pci\n[13834.124069] usb 2-3.1.2: reset full-speed USB device number 8 using ehci-pci\n[13836.940083] usb 2-3.1.2: reset full-speed USB device number 8 using ehci-pci\n\n$ lsusb | grep \"Device 008\"\nBus 002 Device 008: ID 067b:2305 Prolific Technology, Inc.

I am new to GIMP and have an image that is 700x400 in size. I want to add a text to this image, but not on the image.

I'm writing an upstart job for a service that is configured using environment variables, and a lot of them (> 20). \nThe way this was handled so far was usually to run it from a Ruby launcher that used Ruby's Dotenv gem to load the configuration file. I want to replace the launcher with a straight forward upstart file (to reduce the amount of custom code I need to maintain) but I ran into the problem of how to set up all the environment variables needed by service.\nMy initial take was:\nscript\n   . /etc/default/service-conf\n   /usr/local/bin/service\nend script\n\nbut just sourcing the file doesn't export the variables, and I don't want to add a lot of export commands to the script, mainly as it will be completely unmaintainable and unreadable mess.\n\nA: There are several ways to tackle the problem of exporting variables defined in a source file, including all kinds of hacks (for example, the weird export $(cat file | xargs) hack documented in this answer), but the simplest way to just enable \"Mark variables for export\" flag in your shell, before sourcing the environment file. \nHere is the bash documentation for this feature - look under -a.\nWhile the script tag in upstart does not use Bash as a shell - it uses the default POSIX shell implementation in Ubuntu, called dash which also support this feature, calling it allexport.

Because Adobe Flash is so insecure I want to install Shumway as an alternative as I currently have nothing installed so am having to do with the built-in HTML5 players on the sites which have them, and most don't so I mostly can't do anything which requires something like Flash.\nSo I went to the Mozilla Shumway page where I went to the section describing how to enable it in Firefox, however after following its instructions and going to the about:config section of my browser I could not find anything when I searched for shumway.disabled.\nSo how do I enable/install it? I am running Firefox 43 (the current release) on Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: Sadly the Shumway project has been retired (click show info next to Product: Firefox Graveyard).

And can you please explain the first command a little. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: The first part of your two commands (cat FILENAME) is always the same and just prints the specified file's content to the STDOUT stream. I will not explain it any further.\nThe point of our interest is the grep part.\nSyntax of grep:\ngrep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]\n\nYou can pass grep some options to tweak its behaviour (e.g set the used RegEx flavour or control the output formatting), but those are not used in your case.\nThe next single argument must be the pattern to match, where a regular expression (\"RegEx\") or a fixed string (if grep is called with the -F option) is required. In your example, this is the install or \"\\ install\\ \" part. I will explain it in the next paragraph.\nAfter that, you specify the source of the data to match. This can either be a file name, or nothing. In the second case, grep will read from the STDIN stream (standard input: normally what you type with the keyboard), where you pipe (|) the output from the previous command.\nHow to correctly pass the \"PATTERN\" argument?\nThe pattern parameter must be a single argument. That means, you can't just pass several words or anything containing spaces or shell special characters here, because spaces are treated as argument separators in Bash and probably every other shell as well, and shell special characters such as ; will break the command.\nBut you have two options to include spaces into the pattern to match anyway:\n\n*\n\n*Put the entire string to match in single ('...') or double (\"...\") quotes. This way, the shell parses the entire quotes-enclosed string as one argument and passes it on to grep.\n\n\n*Escape every space in the pattern with a backslash (\\). That means, you write a backslash before every space which you don't want to be seen as argument separator by the shell. But note that if you want to have an actual backslash in the pattern, you must escape it as well, by writing another backslash before it.\nIf we now analyse the difference of your two grep command examples, we see the difference in what they match:\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep \"\\ install\\ \"\n\nThis matches the pattern install. (Note the leading and trailing space!)\nHere we see both methods: double quotes around the entire pattern and backslash-escaping the spaces inside it. It's superfluous to be honest, one would have been enough. Although it doesn't hurt in this case, you should not do this and decide on one method. Usually I would recommend to use quotation marks, as it's easier to read.\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep install\n\nThis matches the pattern install. (No surrounding spaces.)\nHere the pattern only consists of the word install, nothing else. No spaces.\nDifference between your commands:\nAs I said, the first of your examples only matches the word install when it is surrounded by spaces. It would not match if e.g. there's a full stop or any other character directly before or after it instead. It would also not match the word directly at the beginning or end of a line.\nThe second example does not care about any spaces before or after the word install. It also matches at line beginnings and endings as well as if it is surrounded by any punctuation. It even matches if there is a word containing this letter sequence anywhere, e.g. \"uninstall\", \"reinstall\" or \"installation\" too!\nExample with correct/useful backslash escaping:\nAs in the example you provided the backslashes are superfluous, here the same example without quotes, but with backslash escaping only instead:\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep \\ install\\ \n\nOr if you want to match the string \"I like Ubuntu\" in a file /home/you/path with spaces/textfile without using quotes, you would do that like this:\ngrep I\\ like\\ Ubuntu /home/you/path\\ with\\ spaces/textfile\n\nYou see that you must escape spaces in path- or filenames as well - or quote them. The line above is equal to the line below:\ngrep \"I like Ubuntu\" \"/home/you/path with spaces/textfile\"\n\n\nA: The second (simpler) form will match the given string anywhere in a line: so for example it will match strings like installation, re-install, installed etc.\nThe first expression will only match install where it has a space at each end. The backslashes are something of a red herring since the quotes are already enough (and the first one - needlessly - escapes the i rather than the space): however it could have been written using just backslash escapes as\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep \\ install\\ \n\n(NB there is a literal space character at the end of the above command).\n\nAdding a single space to the pattern is a bit of a hack IMHO: it won't work if the pattern is separated by other whitespace (tabs or line endings). A better option might be to use explicit word boundaries e.g.\ngrep '\\binstall\\b' /var/log/dpkg.log\n\nor use the -w (--word-regexp) switch \ngrep -w 'install' /var/log/dpkg.log\n\n(although these include hyphens as well as whitespace - so the equivalence isn't exact). If you really want whitespace separated instances of the pattern, then you can use the [[:space:]] POSIX character class e.g.\ngrep '[[:space:]]install[[:space:]]' /var/log/dpkg.log\n\n\nA: The first command:\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep \" \\install\\ \"\n\nAs @ByteCommander pointed out, there may be a typo and the command should be\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep \"\\ install\\ \"\n\nThis would match the string install with a trailing and a leading whitespace. This could also be achieved by using grep -w \"install\". Also, the \\ is not needed, when you use quotes.\nThe second command:\ncat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep install\n\nThis command also matches strings, that contain install. For example \"installed\".\n\nTest Case:\ncontent of testfile:\nfoo\nbar\nfoobar\nfoo bar\n\nRun:\ncat file1.txt | grep foo\nfoo\nfoobar\nfoo bar\n\ncat file1.txt | grep -w foo\nfoo\nfoo bar\n\ncat file1.txt | grep \"foo \"\nfoo bar\n\n", "Q: Connection closed by remote host after pressing tab for autocomplete I am connecting to a virtual box installation of Ubuntu 15.10 using putty:\nWelcome to

Press any key to continue\" Messages? It seems like a never-ending fight at the moment, I'm able to fix it every time it happens, but having migrated to an 18 month old SSD pulled from a different (fully working) machine, I now seem to somehow corrupt something whenever I shut down Ubuntu.\nThe machine will work fine for a couple of days solid running, then start behaving oddly - most recently setting the root partition to read only, mid-session. I reset the computer from the power menu, and there don't seem to be any error messages, and then when it reboots I get the error:\nError: Environment block too small.\n\nPlease Press any key to continue...\n\nPressing any key does nothing, and so I boot to a live CD and run boot-repair, as described here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nThis seems to fix it a little bit, and so I then follow the instructions on this previous answer to get my \"environment block\" back to normal.\nError: invalid environment block. Press any key to continue\nOnly trouble is that it only seems to last short while!\n* What have I done wrong? \n*I accepted all the defaults when installing Ubuntu onto the SSD - should I have done something to run some kind of scan of the disk to avoid any bad sectors?\n* I've run a SMART test which seemed to hint that there weren't any issues - what else can I try?\n*Boot Repair creates a boot log, which is here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/14120685/ sda is the SSD\n\nA: This may not be a universally applicable solution, but it turns out that the case was bending the power line to that disk bay, and the new SSD liked that less than the spinning disk did. Over time the power would work loose to that disk, causing write failures in use and corrupting everything. The old spinning disk was more resilient to this, for whatever reason.\nI only noticed this problem when I ran the computer with the case lid off for 6 months, and had no errors. I ran various trials monitoring SMART diagnostics for temperature, voltage etc, and discovered this intermittent fault.\nThe solution was to change the arrangement of the disks in the case, and to use a right-angled power lead on the top-most disk power lead.\nHope that helps someone else. \n", "Q: Move apps and configurations from 64-bit to 32-bit I have Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit with a bunch of apps and configurations.\nI want to move all that to another computer with a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit.\nIs this possible?

What is the best Desktop Environment for use of Steam and games. I have had many problems with Unity in the past and there must be a better Environment. What is the SteamOS Desktop? Should I be using that? \nThanks for the help!\n\nA: Well what version of unity do you have ? Second if you think a light weight desktop enviroment will make your game run faster than, you can install the Lubuntu xubuntu environment inside ubuntu. Lubuntu is the most light weight. You can use their environment instead of unity. However, unity will still be on the system, just not in use. \nI currently have xubuntu (second lightest weight) , and am running it alongside unity, which is unstable, but really beautiful.

I have connected a Dlink USB 3G modem to Samsung Notebook and set up a WiFi Hotspot on it. So I am currently using the internet on all other devices in my home using this WiFi Network. \nCan I share the files on one laptop with other one over this WiFi network? If yes, how should I configure both computers?\nAlso if it is not possible how can I share files over internet, so that I can access those from my other laptop and also from any other computer(outside my network, say from computer in my college) over internet? (I don't want to setup a FTP server).\nI tried Bit-torrent Sync but for different locations I have to set different passwords.\nAlso how can set my Mobile Broadband connection (3G using USB Dlink Modem) to redial automatically? because sometimes it gets disconneted automatically.. The inbuilt option in Ubuntu's Default connection manager works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't work especially when modem gets disconnected due to removal of USB cable or due to spike in electrical wires when speed of an electrical fan is changed from the Regulator.\nThe connection will dial itself automatically when the option \"Enable Mobile Broadband\" is selected, but when the connection gets disconnected due to reasons stated above, the \"Enable Mobile Broadband\" option get unchecked and hence the connection will not be able to dial itself automatically.\n\nPlease give in detail instructions. \n\nA: For your first question, how to transfer files over the same WiFi network, you can use Samba. You just need to configure a Samba shared folder in one computer and access it on the other.\nDirectly for nautilus (the file manager), right click on the folder you want to share, click on local network share. A new window will appear, if you click on Share this folder a poupup will appear asking you to install some components. Accept and wait for the installation. \nWhen the installation finishes tick the options you think are appropiate for you. When only I have access to the network and I've not sensitive data in the folder (or I mount there other folders or put symbolic link to only the files I need) I tick all of them. You can leave blank the Comment field.\nOn the other PC (or any device, such as smartphones), open nautilus and click on Browse Network and click on the hostname of the other PC and after on the share name you set in the other PC.\nYou can also click on Connect to Server and in the Server Address filed type smb://other_pc_ip/folderName .\n", "Q: Regional formats are set to German while file managers still show English formats Although I am Austrian, I prefer to use Ubuntu in English, while of course I do not want to miss my regional formats.\nThese are the current settings in /etc/default/locale:\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"de_AT.UTF-8\"\n\nAnd this is a screenshot of dolphin:\n\nIt shows American time formats.

In that case, it wouldn't be the first qt app I have encountered with this particular bug.\nOne thing you may want to try is to create the file ~/bin/dolphin, give it this contents:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport LANG=de_AT.UTF-8\nexport LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\nexec /usr/bin/dolphin $@\n\nand give it execution rights:\nchmod +x ~/bin/dolphin\n\nThat file works as a wrapper when you start Dolphin.

That's strange but I can't find where can I choose a screen saver and configure when will it start. There is no button named anything like \"screen saver\" in the Settings Manager.\n\nA: The short blunt answer is sense 14.04 you can not have a screen saver other then the blank black. You will have to install xscreensaver or gnome-screensaver \n\nA: I don't believe Xfce comes with a screensaver. I use the \"Switch off after\" setting in the Xfce Power Manager to switch off my monitor.\nThe \"Blank after\" and \"Put to sleep after\" settings don't give me even a blank black, but do trigger the login window as configured on the Security tab.\nThis is seriously non-intuitive, as the Security tab implies that Light Locker only activates \"when the screensaver is active\", and since nothing on the Display tab (or elsewhere) mentions a screensaver, I assumed it wasn't set up. Where's my \"screensaver\" setting, even if it's only for black?\n\nA: Those settings are located in the power management settings. You can directly launch that using xfce4-power-manager-settings.\n\nThe blank option makes your screen display the black color but does not turn it off! I don't know what is the difference between sleep and switch off because both seem to make my monitor enter standby mode.\n", "Q: Internal Realtek SD card reader rts522a not detected in Ubuntu Studio 14.04 on HP Envy I installed Ubuntu Studio 14.04 on a new notebook HP Envy and the internal SD card reader (Realtek rts522a) does not mount.

However I cant boot from it on UEFI machines, even if secure boot is turned off. Is there any way to make it UEFI compatible?\n\nA: I haven't tested this but it should work. First, you have to prepare the USB drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and launch GParted on the running OS from the USB.\n\n*Shrink a partition to make a 200 - 400 MB space at the end (or the beginning, but not in the middle of the drive). Make a new primary partition in that space and format it as FAT32.\n\n*Put the esp flag on it using GParted.\n\n*Mount it using terminal.\n\n\nTo make it EFI bootable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install package grub-efi-amd64-bin.\n\n*Run sudo grub-install --target=x86_64-efi /dev/sdaX where X is the number of the FAT32 ESP partition you created earlier.\n\n*Run sudo update-grub. It should detect and add Ubuntu to the boot menu.\n\n*Check the ESP partition. You should find a file at /efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi.

Still don't know what is actually causing this problem with updates today...?\n\nA: This seems to be related to ROS, the Robot Operating System, the main user of Collada.  It may be a problem with having both ROS-Indigo and Ros-Jade (different versions) installed.  After doing the suggested\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/collada-dom2.4-sp-dev_2.4.4.1-ubuntu1~trusty1_amd64.deb\n\nto unjam the package system, I did a \"sudo apt-get autoremove\", which removed lots of old ROS-Indigo stuff.  After that, \"sudo apt-get check\" showed no errors.\n\nA: I solved the problem. Apparently, I had third party repositories which were causing the problem. I removed them with the following:\nsudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ /etc/apt/sources.list.d.bk/\nsudo mkdir /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\n\nI then ran sudo apt-get install -f\n\nA: Answer proposed by @colby worked for me.

Basically, you must have  additional entries in /etc/fstab file for any additional partition besides root or swap.

The next DVD I tried - I got the same error as above. \n\nA: I succeeded to resolve this issue, but just temporarily. Indeed, setting regionset was what was needed.\nFirst, in order to set it you need to insert any DVD that is read by your player. Essentially, it can be a simple data DVD. And this is very misleading, since when you set the region code, you set it for the device, not the inserted DVD.\nImportant: you have limited numbers of trials to set region code on your drive.\nThen, you do\nsudo regionset /dev/sr0\n\n(my dvd is mounted on sr0) and select on of the following values \nE.g. USA is 1, Europe is 2, China is 6 and so forth.\nAlso, if you wonder how to choose this value - on the DVDs you have, you probably have a small label with a planet picture and a number - this is the actual region code you need to play this DVD.\nFun fact: all my DVDs are region code 2, but some used to play and others - not before I set region code.\nStill, the issue remains open to me for some stable permanent solution.\n", "Q: My Pulseaudio is skipping, how to fix?

When I used the burner xfburn I kept getting the hash \n758061ca3be30128dca74e3f73b5dd6e76fb5047c0c4e0743f22786fb0a02dd0  /dev/cdrom\n\nSo I changed burners to K3B and it would give me the hash\nd7559c90efece2b38021804cc34011eb2cb161fff2afe6894985083bd41232d5  /dev/cdrom\n\nSo I am unable to verify the correct DVD sha256sum hash. I have also used the burner that comes with my system which is Xubuntu 14.04. I also tried K3B burner which comes highly recommended online. I'm out of ideas. \nPlease help me get the correct hash...OR is the DVD's with the wrong hashes fine to burn? And its some bug in Xubuntu's DVD Rom system? Has anyone gottent the correct hashes for the DVD burned with this ISO?\n\nA: Hashing /dev/cdrom has the effect of hashing also potential blank space at the end of the DVD, which changes the output hash: this is because ISOs are padded with zeros at the end until their overall size matches a multiple of 16 sectors, or 32768 B, before they are burnt.\nIf you want to hash the DVD, make sure that you're hashing the same number of bytes of the original image; in the commands below, make sure that $total is divisible by $bs ($bs is arbitrary, but I suggest using a number \"bigger enough\" than the default 512, as the default 512 usually slows down the reading; maybe this isn't relevant for DVD-ROM drives, but just to make sure):\ntotal=\"$(du /path/to/image.iso | cut -d $'\\t' -f 1)\"\nbs=8192 # make sure that $total is divisible by this number\ndd if=/dev/cdrom iflag=fullblock bs=$bs count=$((total/bs)) | sha256sum -\n\n\nA: This isn't how it works. You can't hash the device; not in a way that does anything constructive anyway.\nThere are two meaningful verification steps you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the ISO has downloaded correctly using the single checksum.\n\n*Check the contents as burnt by using the included md5sum.txt. You have two options here\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot and select the media test from the first menu.\n\n*Mount the CD (automatic on most desktops, just stick it in), open a terminal and CD into the directory and run:\nmd5sum --quiet --check md5sum.txt\n\nWe use --quiet so it only prints out errors and not a huge list of OK messages. If you have a sha256sum-generated file you could use this too but it isn't included on the 14.04 images.\n", "Q: Files in \"/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/\" taking a lot of space, how to free it?

I first tried the \"Erase Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and reinstall,\" but got hung up on the first step of \"detecting system\" (or whatever it said...).

When I try to install Nvidia drivers for my Quadro Ubuntu does not boot and I had to reinstall Ubuntu.\nPS: I am dual booting and the graphics card works on windows and does not have this problem.\n\nA: Install the drivers 352 which support the NVIDIA Quadro K620M this way :  \nHighlight the Ubuntu entry in the GRUB boot menu and press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line - press F10 to boot.\nOn login screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1 - enter your user name and password - then execute :\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot  \n\nOpen NVIDIA X Server Settings -> Prime Profiles to switch between intel and NVIDIA graphics.  \nIf you have to adjust the card to to be used in BIOS, select NVIDIA or  switchable graphics mode.\n\nA: I am not sure about this Lenovo model, but I have had similar problems a while ago with another Lenovo laptop having two graphic adapters.\nFor Windows, Lenovo had a special driver that was able to change the graphic adapter while working. The Intel adapter was meant for standard work and was using a lot less power which was good for battery. The NVidia used more power and provided 3D graphics and better performance.\nI am pretty sure there is no such driver for Linux. I gave up since I didn't use any advanced graphics and used Intel on my laptop. It was sufficient for me.\nI think you can configure the graphic adapters in BIOS. In that way you might succeed to run NVidia in Linux but you can forget fancy switching in Windows in that case.\n", "Q: I can't install AutoDockTools 1.5.6 on Ubuntu 14.04 I tried executing command 'source install.sh' and the Terminal install the AutoDockTools packages.

If you get the normal Ubuntu media, you can start a Live session from it, without installing. This is a good way to try it out, and verify that it runs fine on you machine.\nBTW, if you CPU is not very old, it should support HW virtualization.

If you have a good enough reason to do so, please share.\nOK, I know that this question has been asked a lot before, but I could not find any questions that exactly relate to my case. I just got a new PC with Windows 10 on an SSD. With my previous PC I had two hard drives, one with Ubuntu, one with Windows 7. I dual booted flawlessly with that setup. Now, I have moved these two HDD's to the new PC, but I would like to know how I can use my HDD with the existing Ubuntu on it to dual boot with the new Windows 10. \nIn summary:\nMy new PC has Windows 10 installed.\nI moved my HDD containing an existing Ubuntu installation to the new PC.\nI would like to set this up such that I can dual boot with windows 10 and ubuntu. Note, both operating systems are already installed on different HDD's, but the ubuntu installation was installed alongside Windows 7 originally (see extra info below). I just need to make them dual boot together. I can already boot into Ubuntu through my BIOS settings (by making the HDD containing Ubuntu the primary HDD), but I would not like to do that every time.\nExtra info:\nWhen I boot from the HDD containing Ubuntu, the grub menu comes on, with Windows 7 still as an option, but I cannot boot into Windows 7 though.\nThank you\n\nA: Eventually you need to make an entry for Win10 in grub if the reconfiguration did not add one. Further, you might want to check if the BIOS (EFI or legacy) has a specific boot-order that queries your Linux HDD first. This shows Grub first and lets you decide which system you want to boot.  \n\nA: Try running the following:\n\nsudoo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nSelect your HDD that contains Ubuntu and let grub rebuild it's boot menu. It should detect and add the Windows Option in your grub menu.\n", "Q: Upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04? I have Windows and Ubuntu 12.04 running.

If /home is on separate partition choose \"do something else\" and manually assign where root and /home are. \n\n*Install the software\n\n*After you first reboot you may want to compare what you have in the /home and in your backup (of /home).

Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run :\nsudo chown -R \"$USER:$USER\" \"${HOME}/.gnome2/accels\"\n\nThen, try to launch firefox again.\n\nA: Instead of changing folder/file permissions, maybe you should go with changing the owner of folder.

Can he/she access my data becaus ecryptfs was not able to umount the decrypted file direcotry?\n\nA: That's not quite how ecryptfs works. Your data is stored in an encrypted, obfuscated form on disk. (see ls -lL $HOME/.Private) ecryptfs mounts a stacked filesystem on top of your $HOME, and decrypts the files (data and metadata) on-the-fly, as you access the files through the ecryptfs filesystem (which uses the underlying ext4 (or whatever) filesystem on disk for data storage). The results of the ecrypts filesystem (files, metadata) exists ONLY in the virtual memory of the running system. If your disk is hot-unplugged, all that is taken away is the encrypted, obfuscated disk storage. Also, your computer will be unhappy.\n", "Q: Which partitions can be deleted?

If you want to make sure your other Python packages are also up to date, follow the instructions here.\n\nA: I think it's worth mentioning that what I'm explaining below is if you expect pip to point to Python 2 and pip3 to point to Python 3.  The reason I mention this is because when you upgrade pip3, it also takes over the pip command as well.  This is a somewhat strange convention because by default python points to 2.x and python3 points to 3.x.  That being said...\nIf you want to have the latest versions of python 2.x pip and python 3.x pip3 coexist on the same machine (using pip for 2.x and pip3 for 3.x), you need to do the following:\nsudo apt-get install python-pip python3-pip --yes\nsudo python3 -m pip install pip --upgrade --force\nsudo python -m pip install pip --upgrade --force # this line associates pip with Python 2\n\nThe other answers provided by others fail to mention that after running sudo pip3 install pip --upgrade you'll end up with the pip command installing packages in the python 3.x directories instead of the python 2.x directories.\nPart of me thinks that we should just leave pip be after upgrading pip3 (even if it pip -> pip3), but there's a danger there that people already have an expectation that pip functions like python - both pointing to python 2.x.  In other words, people are probably trained to use pip/python for python 2.x just like they are trained to use pip3/python3 for python 3.x.\n\nA: pip install -U pip\nThe shortest I know.\n\nA: Update the pip version using\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt install python3-pip\n\n\nA: If pip install -U pip is used then pip first uninstalls itself and may hang up in the middle of the whole process.

While there was nothing wrong during installation and even booting up a Live-version, while normal booting the screens turns off. More precisely: when I start the computer, the Screen turns on, runs through BIOS Post and finally shows up grub menu. After choosing Ubuntu, the screen turns off instantly (when normally the violet screen with the blinking dots appears), and keeps of until the boot is finished. Then it turns on and presents me the login screen.\nWhile this is not such a big problem, I am wondering why this happens...\nAbout my System:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Xeon E3-1231v3 \n\n*8GB DDR3 Ram \n\n*Nvidia (9800GT) -> due to mysterious circumstances it became a 560 ti \n\n*ASUS H97 Pro Gamer\n\n*Hitachi/Apple 320G 2.5\" HDD GPT Disk partition table\n\n*Ubuntu fresh installed on the wiped disk (obviously in EFI mode)\n\n\nWhat I’ve tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*update-grub\n\n*Getting into tty works, the screen shows up everything fine\n\n*Getting into tty during boot turns on the screen\n\n*Getting into tty during boot randomly displays the boot animation (sometimes it does, sometimes not, eventually depending on when pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 ?)\n\n\nA: It's a question of video support in the various stages of the boot process...\n\n\n*\n\n*Early on the firmware (EFI) is handling the video display. Everything up to and including GRUB relies on this support.\n\n*Early in the Linux boot process, the kernel is in control of the display. The kernel has a number of video drivers, including both text-mode and video drivers, some of which are generic and some of which support specific cards. It sounds like the correct one is not being used, or it's been misconfigured in some way.\n\n*Late in the Linux boot process, the X server takes over the display, and X has its own drivers. This is obviously working for you.\n\n\nGiven your symptoms, there's a chance that the kernel's text-mode video support is not working even after you boot the system. Ordinarily, if you hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 (or any other function key through F6), you should see a text-mode login screen. Hitting Alt+F7 (or occasionally F8) should bring you back to X. If this doesn't work, and you instead see a blank display, then your text-mode video support is bad. There are a number of possible more specific causes, like a lack of a video driver, the wrong video port being active (built into the motherboard vs. an add-on card, for instance), and the video driver doing something wrong for initializing the video card. You may be able to fix this by adding kernel options, but details depend on your video hardware and maybe even your computer. This question and answer provide suggestions for solutions to a more serious variant on this problem, and they might help you, too.\nA less severe type of problem might be partially fixed by removing the quiet splash options from the kernel command line. You can do this in GRUB by hitting e to edit an entry, then removing quiet splash from the kernel options line. This variant assumes that the problem is just in the kernel's use of graphics mode and that text mode works fine. If this is the cause, then you'll probably be able to log in using text mode by hitting Ctrl+Alt+F1, and removing quiet splash at boot will result in a verbose text-mode boot rather than the boot with the Ubuntu logo. As with the previous scenario, adding kernel options might enable the regular logo to appear, but which options you'd want to use depends on your hardware and perhaps other factors. As I'm not an encyclopedia of solutions to these problems, I can't offer specific suggestions on what to try -- but the above linked-to question and answers might be helpful.\nOne more thing to note is that there are two or three sets of X drivers for Nvidia chipsets. Which one you use affects not just X, but kernel drivers, because some Nvidia drivers (especially the proprietary ones) require kernel support, which in turn means that the kernel needs certain drivers be active and others not. Thus, changing your X drivers can influence the behavior of the system before X even starts.\nOverall, video support in Linux is a pretty complex web!\n", "Q: apt-get install not work at all when i use command sudo apt-get install git it's return below erorrs and it's return for any application to install below : \nSetting up util-linux (2.25.2-4ubuntu3) ...\nupdate-alternatives: error: cannot stat file '/usr/bin/nodejs': Too many levels of symbolic links\ndpkg: error processing package util-linux (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 2\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n util-linux\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nupdate with sudo apt-get update not working and report below erorr\nFetched 7,032 kB in 5min 32s (21.2 kB/s)                                       \nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/paullo612/unityshell-rotated/ubuntu/dists/vivid/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/paullo612/unityshell-rotated/ubuntu/dists/vivid/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

This was a behavior introduced with Firefox 22 as explained here. To reverse this you will need to follow these steps (taken from the linked article):\n\n\n*\n\n*Type about:config into the address bar and hit enter.\n\n*Confirm that you will be careful if this is the first time you open this page\n\n*Use the search at the top to filter for plain_text.wrap_long_lines.\n\n*Double-click the value to set it to false which deactivates the feature.\n\n*To restore the original value at any time, repeat the steps abov\n\n\n\nNot exactly what you are after but probably as close as you will get...\n\nA: If you want to see whether there is one long line or whether there are several short lines - there is a simple way to tell. Just resize your Firefox window (to a larger width, if possible). If the text re-flows to fit the new width then it is a single long (logical) line. If it keeps the same lines, then these are multiple short lines.\nYou can also get some hint when resizing to a smaller width. If you have multiple short lines they may wrap into two lines but you will be able to detect the line breaks.\nThis method works with many text-centric web pages, for example this one. Other web pages display text with a fixed line width regardless of the window size (this very page is an example). With these pages, resizing won't provide any information, unless you tweak the text properties (e.g. as suggested by @andrew.46).\n", "Q: dpkg --configure -a hangs when found initrd image I have an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS \"Desktop\" with GitLab.\nThe system runs in a virtual machine on a Windows Server 2012 R2.\nThe machine runs daily automatic updates for \"Important security updates\", \"Recommended updates\" and \"Unsupported updates\".

Better sync the data of the partition with the folder using grsync, and pay ATTENTION at the pop-up help of the \"?\" at the Basic Options tab of grsync. Be sure not to delete the existing contents of sda6!\n\n*Delete Swap and sda5 partitions.\n\n*Create a new Swap partition at the end of the disk.\n\n*Extend sda6 to fill the empty space.\n\n\nThis way you keep the WinRecovery partition, in case you need it.\nBut if you want a 15GB partition for future test or permanent installs you could skip steps 3,4,5. At the time of the GPartEd-screenshot seems plenty of free space in sda6.\n", "Q: Slow Boot time on ubuntu 15.10 The computer has recently been switched from Windows XP to Ubuntu and although it is faster it isn't as fast as I had expected.\nThe computer has:\nUbuntu 15.10 64bit\n2x1GB of 667MHZ DDR2 Ram\n320GB HDD (less than 70GB used)\nNvidia GeForce 8500 GT (512MB)\nIntel® Core™2 Duo CPU E8500 @ 3.16GHz × 2\nA boot chart has been attached to help.\nBoot chart\n\nA: Thank you for sharing useful hardware specifications.\nUnfortunately you are having very \"dated\" hardware.\nMost relevant is the very small amount of the RAM.\nThis is the main reason why the boot time is slow.  \nMore important is the overall performance of the system.\nYou should consider to install the light-weight Xubuntu.\nAlternatively you can replace the 2x1 GB with 2x2 GB.\nBut it is not really recommended for this \"old\" PC.\n", "Q: Dealing with ubuntu partitions for the first time I have recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 by using a bootable usb flash drive. After installing the software gparted I see that I have the following partitions:\n\nFor what I understood, the OS is installed in the partition /dev/sda2 and it uses 10.81 GiB out of 461.38 GiB. Am I correct?\nHere are my other doubts:\n\n\n*\n\n*How come do I also have a /dev/sda1 partition? I don't recall to have create it in the past.\n\n*What does fat32 mean, /boot/efi mean?\n\n*Is it necessary to keep it? Or is there a way to get rid of it and merge the 512 MiB with the second partition?\n\n*How is it possible that I have 1.02 MiB of space unallocated? Is it necessary to keep it? can I merge it with the biggest partition or with the linux-swap? How do I do that?\n\n\nA: Mostly hg8 has provided good answers; however....\n\nHow is it possible that I have 1.02 MiB of space unallocated? Is it necessary to keep it?\n\nThe answer to which hg8 has linked on this one is poor. In order to optimize performance on a variety of disks, most modern partitioning tools align partition start points to 1 MiB values by default. (See this article I wrote for technical details and some benchmarks for one particular disk technology.) Thus, there will be a close-to-1MiB gap at the start of the disk, since there's a small bit of space used at the start for partitioning data structures. GParted hides this gap because it's unimportant.\nMany tools, including libparted (used by GParted, parted, and the Ubuntu installer) also align the ends of partitions. This isn't necessary for optimizing the performance of the partition being created, but it enables the next partition to be properly aligned without a gap. One consequence, though, is that there's often about 1 MiB of unused space at the end of the disk. In your case, it's a tiny bit more than 1 MiB (I'm guessing because a rounding error caused it to be too big, although that's just a guess), and GParted is showing it, unlike the gap at the start, which is hidden.\nSmall ~1 MiB gaps betwee partitions, or at the start or end of the disk, are no big deal. Your disk in particular is 465.76 GiB in size, so that 1.02 MiB gap is (1.02 / (465.76 * 1024)), or 0.00021%, of your disk's capacity. It's trivial. You can certainly extend the partition to fill that gap by using another tool (like gdisk -- you'd delete the existing partition and create a new one with the same start point but an end point a little further out); but then to use the space you'd need to extend the filesystem it contains, and the filesystem's own data structures might not even make use of the extra space. Furthermore, mucking about with partitions in this way carries some danger, so you'd be risking your entire OS installation to get 0.00021% more disk space. If you're that desperate for disk space, you need to buy another disk, not waste time trying to recover enough disk space to hold about 1/600th of an Ubuntu .iso file.\nSo: Don't worry about it.\n\nA: \nFor what I understood, the OS is installed in the partition /dev/sda2 and it uses 10.81 GiB out of 461.38 GiB. Am I correct?\n\nCorrect.\n\n\nHow come do I also have a /dev/sda1 partition?\n\n/dev/sda1 is the EFI partition which contains the GRUB boot loader files.\nIt is created automatically during the Ubuntu installation.\n\n\nWhat does FAT32 mean?\n\nFAT32 is the file system format of the EFI partition.\nRefer here for more informations about the FAT32 file system.\nIf you continue, you will see that /dev/sda2 is in ext4 format. It's another file system format.\n\n\nIs it necessary to keep it? \n\nYes! Do not delete it or your Ubuntu installation won't boot anymore.\n\n\nHow is it possible that I have 1.02 MiB of space unallocated? Is it necessary to keep it? \n\nRead the answer from @Rinzwind for a good explanation of this small partition.\n", "Q: Failed to fetch message while upgrading I typed the command\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nand got the following error\nW: Failed to fetch http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n\nand similar other messages\nPreviously, I had typed the following commands from an answer on this site\nUpgrading to a no longer supported version\nusername-M:~$ sudo cp -v /etc/apt/sources.{list,backup}\n[sudo] password for username: \n'/etc/apt/sources.list' -> '/etc/apt/sources.backup'\n\nusername:~$ sudo sed -i 's/us.archive/old-releases/' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nthe problematic sources.list file\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04 _Precise Pangolin_ - Release i386 (20131017)]/ precise main restricted\n\n# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to\n# newer versions of the distribution.\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted\ndeb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted\n\n## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the\n## distribution.\ndeb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\n\n## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu\n## team.

I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS but it is not working properly and it takes a long time to open apps and browser. Please suggest me which version of Ubuntu will be best suitable for this  netbook.\n\nA: Rahul, I'm sorry to say, but I think you already have the right OS installed. I have the same Acer Aspire One ZG5, upgraded to 1.5gb RAM. When support for WinXP was stopped, I removed it from mine and installed Ubuntu 14.04 32bit. It does take time to open applications, and it lags when streaming video(especially on sites that have advertisements). This Acer Aspire is a limited and slow computer when compared to newer technologies. But there is something about this laptop that I love. I can't explain it. I am using it right now to write this. I still use it for watching videos, Netflix, Youtube(with some lag), and everything else even though I have other options. I also bought an extended battery for mine as well. I hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine. If I find out any ways to speed it up I'll spread the word.\n\nA: Max out the ram at 2gb and get a SSD for the hard drive and it super speeds these little netbooks. I use my netbook for work. it is an HP 110 running 10.04. I mostly use it for troubleshooting network issues and email at work. I would like to upgrade to 14.04, but I have become too attached to the netbook GUI.\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on the ZG5 and it works. It works best with the Lubuntu desktop or, at least, using 2D Unity. I will use 12.04 as long as it supported. But I can imagine that 14.04 Lubuntu will still work  (--if I am not mistaken then 14.04 does not offer the 2D version).\n", "Q: Newly installed Firefox 43 crashes when videos are played Both my wife and I have 12.04LTS on our desktop PCs.

Please help.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: It is not recommended to use telnet, but instead to use SSH.  The reason for this, is that telnet communications are unencrypted, and vulnerable to eavesdropping.\nYou can make your PHP server allow remote connections via SSH by installing openssh-server:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n\nIf you still want to use telnet, then according to your output, it would appear that port 4444 is not open on you Linux box.  Assuming you've not setup a firewall on that computer, it would appear that your server is not running the telnet server.  To install that service:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install telnetd\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: In your netstat output, the line\n\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:4444          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1611/php\n\nIndicates that php (process id 1611) is listening on TCP port 4444 on the internal address 127.0.0.1.  That's on the loop-back interface, and can only be reached from the local host, your Ubuntu machine, not from the Windows box.\nIn contrast, e.g., your chromium-brows... (PID 1744) listens on 0.0.0.0, which is special, meaning \"all interfaces\" (so it should be reachable from the outside, e.g., the Windows machine).\nYour nmap UDP probe reports the port \"closed\" because php uses the TCP protocol.\nI find lsof useful for investigating what's listening, but .  To get some output on my machine, I'll ask for port 22 (SSH) instead of 4444:\n\n$ sudo lsof -P -i :22  \n  COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\n  sshd    2152 root    5u  IPv4  10192      0t0  TCP *:22 (LISTEN)\n  sshd    2152 root    6u  IPv6  10194      0t0  TCP *:22 (LISTEN)\n\nYou see it listens on \"*\" (all interfaces).  As in your case, a UDP scan won't find it open:\n\n$ sudo nmap -sU 127.0.0.1 -p 22\n   \n  Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-12-22 13:53 EST\n  Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)\n  Host is up (0.000048s latency).\n  PORT   STATE  SERVICE\n  22/udp closed ssh\n\n  Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.37 seconds\n\nSo much for the explanation of what you saw.  To fix, you should instruct your PHP server to listen on 0.0.0.0 or * instead of 127.0.0.1 or \"localhost\".  I don't know that program; if you cannot change its configuration, you could always use ssh or iptables to forward the port.\n/Quigi\n", "Q: ps does not work after upgrading to 14.04 (/usr/bin/dpkgd/ps: error while loading shared libraries) I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04, now on starting my terminal and running ps throws the following error :\n\n/usr/bin/dpkgd/ps: error while loading shared libraries: libproc-3.2.8.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nHow can this be resolved?\n\nA: When I update 12.04 to 14.04, the same problem.

If it doesn't, then you have a corrupted/not working ISO. Download another one.\nSecond question: Don't burn a bootable USB! Use tools like Pendrive's Universal USB Installer to install it to your USB. Also, you don't wanna copy the ISO to the USB and it's done. \n\nA: I'm sorry you are having so much trouble. I don't see where you indicated what type of computer system you have, and what operating system you currently use. I see you downloaded Ubuntu 14.04.3-desktop-amd64 iso. How new is your computer system? Does it use 64-bit addressing? Is your BIOS the newer EFI? \nCan you boot from a DVD? \nIf you describe your system (make, model, date of manufacture) and tell us what you are currently running (some version of Windows, or Mac OSX), we might have more ideas of what problems you could be facing.\n\nA: *\n\n*Also with windows it would be better to do an integrity check on large downloads, but you can skip it. \n\n*Have you ever tried making a bootable windows install usb stick? Within Linux it is easy but from Windows it takes a bit more effort.\n\n*Well even my mother installs and runs Ubuntu so I am pretty sure you can also. The easiest method if you do not have Ubuntu to make a stick is indeed burn a dvd.\n\n\nYou're lucky, you gain all the time you lost back because the system is actually ready for use after install.

I tried to find solution for my problem by searching in Google but I could not find any thing.\nRecently I migrated from windows and so I am new to Ubuntu 14.04. But I need to continue some works in Windows yet. So I installed Oracle VM VirtualBox and tried to create a virtual machine of type Windows 10 as described here except of I used a boot able DVD. Before I could install Windows 10 by that DVD but now when I try to create virtual machine, screen remains in this state and setup does not start:\n\nDo you know what cause this problem? How I can solve this problem?\n\nA: In a virtual machine, Windows 10 needs the host (your computer) processor to support Intel VT-x/AMD-v. AMD-v is always enabled, but Intel VT-x is usually disabled, so you probably have an Intel processor. Try going into your BIOS (the startup screen should say something like Press [some key] to enter Setup, press that key) and look for an option like “Intel Virtualization Technology,” “Intel VT-x,” “Virtualization Extensions,” “Vanderpool,” or something like that and enable it. Hopefully that should solve the problem.

A368-480F/ is the directory that appears when I plug my USB into my computer. The first time I call this it does what I want and copies over my files. If I call it again immediately without unplugging the USB, the script doesn't say anything and returns, just like it should. If I umount the USB, unplug it, plug it back in, and re-source the backup script, everything is copied over again, which is not what I want.\nI've tried using stat on a file in the backup before and after unplugging the USB, but I didn't see any difference. Not sure if this holds for every file that gets copied.\nSo, my question is, \"why is this unwanted copying happening, and how do I make it not happen?\".\nI'm using Ubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: Remember that VFAT/FAT32/FAT16/et al... Microsoft's glorious filesystem, only stores file times with a minimum resolution of 2 seconds.  Meaning that if your source file has a mtime of 13:35:47, VFAT will save it as 13:35:46.  Meaning your source file will always be newer.\nThe cp command has no mechanism to deal with MS's weirdness, files will always be copied.\nTo properly deal with VFAT's lossy time storage, I'd suggest using rsync.\nYou gave this cp command as an example:\ncp -vau /home/jordan/local-directory/ -t /media/jordan/A368-480F/BACKUP/\n\nAn equivalent rsync command would be:\nrsync -va --modify-window=1 /home/jordan/local-directory/ /media/jordan/A368-480F/BACKUP/\n\nThis will copy files from src to dest, recursively, copying all attributes as is possible to represent on VFAT. (Permissions, owners, groups, .. well... dang near everything ... doesn't copy to VFAT, just data, and the EVEN timestamps)\nThe --modify-window=1 option allows file timestamps to differ by up to 1 second when determining newness.\nI like to add the -P (--partial --progress) option, as it allows easier restarting of copy operations, showing a nice progress bar as it goes.\nrsync -vaP --modify-window=1 /home/jordan/local-directory/ /media/jordan/A368-480F/BACKUP/\n\nOf course, rsync allows MUCH more, including copying between systems, snapshotting backups, and others, see the rsync man page.  My fingers can type -avzP as rsync options by themselves I believe.\nNo, I am not a fan of VFAT.  NTFS is better, but proprietary.\n", "Q: Boot repair hanging on purge kernels then reinstall last kernel I'm running 14.04.3 from live cd trying to move grub from a failing hard drive that had windows on it that's no longer used (sda).

I have a separate home partition so it was easy and it worked again but without windows and then trying to get windows back grub stopped working too. \n\nA: Oldfred is on the right track. To elaborate and provide further advice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Somewhere along the line, you inappropriately changed the partition type code on /dev/sda1 from that for an EFI System Partition (ESP) to that for a BIOS Boot Partition. The former is required to boot a computer in EFI mode, whereas the latter is used by GRUB in BIOS mode to boot from a GPT disk. Making this change by itself would not have caused problems, but combining it with other mistakes (like installing a BIOS-mode copy of GRUB) could be -- and seems to have been -- disastrous. To correct this problem, you must do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the \"bios_grub flag\" to a \"boot flag\" with parted or GParted; or change the type code from EF02 to EF00 in gdisk, cgdisk, or sgdisk. (These two program families have different ways of identifying type code information.) If you fail to make this change, you're likely to run into further problems in the future.\n\n*You must also create a new FAT32 filesystem on the partition. GParted provides a GUI tool for doing this; or you can type sudo mkdosfs -F 32 -n ESP /dev/sda1 to do it from an Ubuntu Terminal.\n\n\n*Windows boots in EFI mode from GPT disks. Thus, in your case you do not want to go anywhere near BIOS-mode booting, even for Ubuntu. Unfortunately, many tutorials recommend enabling the EFI's Compatibility Support Module (CSM) when installing Ubuntu as a routine matter. This is a Bad Idea, for reasons I elaborate on here. It appears that you enabled your CSM (aka \"legacy boot support\" or some similar term), which in turn resulted (along with the type code change) in GRUB damaging your ESP. You should go back into your firmware setup utility and disable the CSM! It will do you no good and could lead you down a path to further trouble in the future.\n\n*You must re-install your Windows boot loader to make it bootable again. You should ask on a Windows forum about doing this.\n\n*You must re-install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux to make it bootable again. Boot Repair should be able to do this; or you could use my rEFInd, as Scott Stensland has suggested.\n\n*Completely re-installing both OSes is another option, although it's not really necessary. Also, that path could easily lead you into yet more trouble if you don't first address the fundamental problem of the CSM (or fully understand how to control your boot mode, which is a tricky subject).\n\n", "Q: Mount share in fstab for multiuser access I have a network share that is mounted through fstab with the following line:\n//[url/share] /media/mountpoint cifs credentials=[credentialfile],iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,uid=alpha,gid=alpha,nobootwait 0 0\n\nThis works great on all pcs in our network where alpha is the only user.

I've become really frustrated trying to get a stable BIOS config with this motherboard (every boot produces an Overclocking failed! message and none of the even low-key default options avoid this message with an i7 3930K - this board rules as the hardest motherboard I have ever configured in the last 10 years!) and now it can't boot a vanilla 15.10 USB drive.

This can be done by pressing e on the grub menu entry and then inserting nomodeset on the Linux line. \nThis seems to be a problem caused by the most recent kernel and Nouveau, not Ubuntu.\n\nA: I found the solution to this, somewhat unexpectedly. The answer is wait 10 minutes.\nMy research had indicated that the message itself is not the problem. What is occurring is that the next part of the bootup process is completely silent when a problem occurs. I suspected it was video card related and tried some different cards but unfortunately they were all Nvidia cards and none of them had any impact on the problem.\nAs it happened, I was looking at different kernel possibilities than that in the standard desktop install USB (on my Mac) and I looked over to the Ubuntu install to amazingly see the initial install screen with it's choices.\nWhatever is happening, it takes about 10 minutes for that step to timeout.

It have windows 8.1 pre-installed OS.I dual boot it with ubuntu 14.04. It was working fine. But then, I realised that i don't need windows no more. So, I deleted windows completely(and the recovery partition also) and installed ubuntu 14.04. I think it was my biggest mistake. As you know that I have dual booted before, so I have configurated BIOS settings like disabling secure boot and enabling boot from dvd. A blue screen from where I have booted ubuntu in my laptop(I was thinking that it belongs to my laptop. but, its not because after removing windows, that screen was also gone. I think that was made for recovery). But now many functions are not working correctly like wire-less card is not working. So now, I want to dual boot windows 8.1 and ubuntu 14.04. I know the fact that to dual boot, I need to install windows first and then I have to make partition for ubuntu and then ubuntu will be installed. I have an original iso image of windows 8.1 with key.I don't have recovery disc. I have made its bootable usb and dvd. But, when I try to install windows, It doesn't boot neither dvd nor usb. I can't install windows 8.1. What should i do now?\nThanks.\n\nA: *\n\n*To boot from other devices than the main drive you need to go into your BIOS settings or call a menu at the computer start up and choose what device to boot from. If you know this and did this, then there must be something wrong with your DVD and USB stick.\n\n*You may want to search for and check how to install Windows after Ubuntu.

System froze. Reboot to contiuous login loop and what do you mean? Yesterday it said there was an update available, and would I like to install it. Since previously I had issues and an update corrected them, I figured this would help fix the quirky idiosyncrasies and freezes we were experiencing. Wrong. It froze the installation at a prompt to allow Windows fonts. I couldn't select \"OK\", and I couldn't cancel the install. Everything else was still working, but I couldn't get rid of that update window. I finally decide to power down, but it would not. You could select it from the menu, then you could select power down from the log-out option, but in no instance would it power down. It only kept repeating the cycle. I finally select log-out, which only brought me to the log-in screen, which would not allow me to log in. I powered it down by holding the power button  and re-booted. I am now in perpetual log-in loop. I cannot even log in as guest.\nI searched \"Ubuntu continuous log-in loop\" on my XP desktop and began reading results. This is when I find that every remedy is geared to those familiar with Ubuntu. Each one requires typing a line of code in SOMEWHERE. What good is telling someone to type a line of code without telling them how to get where you are supposed to type it in? \n\"In the grub menu\". GRUB menu? What the heck is a grub menu? If I find a grub I feed it to my chickens! \n\"Look at your dmxp\" (Or some such thing. I can't remember now) What the heck is that? Where do I find it? When I do, what the heck am I looking for?\n\"Look at the logs and xsession errors\"  ????????!!!!\nThere are several more such recommendations, all of which have absolutely no meaning to someone who just came on the scene. I was, however, able to glean a few things along the path. First, if you hold the shift key while booting, it will come to GNU GRUB (2.02~beta 2-9ubuntu1.4) I now have 4 options, NONE of which were ever discussed in any of the remedies. I found that if I go to \"Advanced Options\" I can go into recovery mode. (Which was mentioned in one remedy, but never how to get there!) OK, Recovery mode does not work, so the rest of that remedy is moot. Recovery does not work, period.\nPLUS, nobody ever mentioned anywhere at any time about selecting e' to edit the commands before booting or c for a command line\". Which one do I need, and what do I do when I get there?\nTHEN  I find ctrlaltf1 somewhere in the quagmire of fixes. AH! This must be where they say to type in the selected codes! What the heck is sudo? Why does it tell me that the line I tired has to be entered manually? \nI have now spent more time trying to repair and get this laptop working than I have in actual use. Does it get better from here? All I want to do is get out of continuous log-in loop and have a stable, operating machine. \nDo you think that I need to be lead by the hand down the file path of repair? Let me tell you most assuredly, YES!!!!\nPLEASE when you give an answer on these forums, give each step, and possibly some explanation of what is happening in said step. I want to understand just what it is I am doing, or about to do.\nDo NOT tell me that I need to do a complete install and lose all of the email my wife has saved. If you do, then YOU come HERE and tell her yourself! SURELY there has to be a remedy somewhere to at least get back in, get the emails backed up or off, and then re-install.\n\nA: ha, ha. Question of the day.\nI'll give you a possible tip on how to get the emails.\nIf the /home directory is not encrypted, boot up a live session. This means starting the operating system from a DVD or USB. There you will see the disk with the installed instance of Ubuntu. Enter the /home directory and then the directory of your wife. There you will have to tell the file browser to show you hidden files. In the image below it's at the bottom of the menu with the down arrow.\n\nDepending on what e-mail client your wifes' using, the mails will be at:\n\n\n*\n\n*default - .local/share/evolution/mail (This means you need to enter the directory \".local\", then \"share\", and so on).\n\n*thunderbird - .thunderbird - and then it may be in different places and you may need to look for it, but by dafault it will be in a directory with a name ending in \".default\", then \"Mail\", possibly also \"ImapMail\" if she uses the IMAP protocol.\n\n*some other client - .someOtherClient - and then an appropriate subdirectory path\n\n\nFrom her home directory you she may also want some other things like photos, music, documents, etc. Good news is that if the system was not configured by a creative IT genius, everything should be in her home subdirectory. I strongly advise you backup the whole home directory, ie. the one which has the name of your wife.\nNow, if the /home directory is encrypted, you should be able to enter it from a live session (same as with me first tip for non-encrypted one) after entering the encryption password, which most likely is the root password of the Ubuntu instance, if the /home directory was created at the same time. If you have problems with that, you'll surely come back with feedback.\nThat's all the tips I can give you. I hope they help. But first of all, I hope you manage to fix your Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Portable Batch System I am working in a server (I am not the admin) where I must run jobs in .pbs format so I can disconnect my computer while a job is running.\nThe problem is that I cannot run in .pbs format the same commands I'm able to run in .sh format, it says:\nerror while loading shared libraries: libftgl.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nThis library is located in /usr/lib264.\nI tried to export this library but I may have done it wrong.\nHow to do it exactly? \n\n\nA: The problem is that ld (the GNU linker) can't find the library, because the library isn't either in an ld trusted path nor the library's path has been made available to ld by other means.\nSo you should make the library's path available to ld.\nSince you don't have administration privileges, you'll have to override your local ld settings, which can be done by adding the path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:\nprintf \"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\\\"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib264\\n\\\"\" >>~/.bashrc\n\nAnd by sourcing ~/.bashrc to apply the changes to the running shell:\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nThe \"right\" way to make the libraries contained in /usr/lib264 available system-wide would be to add a .conf file containing the library's path in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and to update the ld cache.\nThis requires administration privileges, so it does not apply to your case; however I'm leaving this for other people stumbling across this answer.\nFirst, one should add a .conf file containing the library's path in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/:\nprintf \"/usr/lib264\\n\" | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/other_libraries.conf\n\nThen, one should run ldconfig to update the ld cache:\nldconfig\n\nAfter that, the library's path should be available to ld system-wide.\n", "Q: How to uninstall apps in Ubuntu 14.04 I know it would seem like a simple task.

Thanks.\n\nA: Using LaTeX!\n0) Install LaTeX if necessary\n1) In the following latex document replace x.pdf by your file.pdf\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\RequirePackage[a4paper,top=3cm,left=3cm,right=3cm,bottom=3cm]{geometry}\n\n\\usepackage{pdfpages}\n\\usepackage{fancyhdr}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\fancyfoot[RO]{Braga}\n\\fancyfoot[LO]{2015}\n\\fancyfoot[CO]{===}\n\n\\fancyhead[LO]{Lecture notes of askubuntu}\n\\fancyhead[RO]{\\thepage}\n\n  \\includepdf[pagecommand={\\thispagestyle{empty}},pages=1 ]{x.pdf}\n  \\includepdf[pagecommand={\\thispagestyle{fancy}},pages=2-]{x.pdf}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n3) run pdflatex addfooter.tex and a addfooter.pdf will be created. \n4) adapt the headers, footer (left,center, right), tune margin's sizes, etc.\nUpdate:\nAlthough LaTeX version give us more control over the details,\nas @steeldriver, pointed out,\nin some situations a pdfjam command line is the best choice. Typical use:\npdfjam --outfile newfile.pdf --pagecommand '{}' oldfile.pdf\n\n\nA: I actually found a much better solution myself. Rather than doing it manually as suggested above, and wasting time on figuring it out, the easiest way is to simply install jpdftweak package. It does this and more with a couple of mouse clicks. Enjoy! \n", "Q: Gnome Encfs Manager, data recover I removed the stash with data from manager. Is there a way to recover stash with data? \nTestdisk about my folder when I try to recover it: No file found, filesystem may be damaged.\n\nA: It depends on whether you selected to remove the stash from the file system too. In that case encfs manager seems to delete the encrypted folder. Do you still see the encrypted folder? It might be hidden, i.e. starting with '.'.\n", "Q: Upgrading Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 to 2.4.10-2 on Ubuntu 14.04 Help me to upgrade my apache , there is a security issue 2.4.7\nApache HTTP Server Request\n Smuggling Vulnerability via\n Invalid Chunk-Extension\nCharacters, CVE-2015-3183\nI tried to upgrade and update still seems 2.4.7.\n\nA: You don't need to.

So change option to opt and all is well.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrestore (){\n        echo \"Restore\"\n}\n\ndeploy () {\n        echo \"Deploy\"\n}\n\necho \"Select any option to proceed...\"\nselect opt in \"deploy\" \"restore\" ; do\ncase $opt in\n\n        restore)\n        restore;\n        break;;\n\n        deploy)\n        deploy;\n        break;;\nesac\ndone\n\n", "Q: Bulk email sending issue with Ubuntu 14.04 (Linode VPS) I have an email server on Linode.com with the following specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04\n\n*Apache & MySQL\n\n*Postfix, Dovecot, Spamassassin, Postgrey, RoundCube, sievemail components.\n\n\nProblem: Everything works fine but when I try to send bulk email to more than 15 recipients, it gives the error \"Too many recipients\".

How to uplift that limit? \n\n\nA: Postfix does indeed have a limit on the number of recipients in a single message, which is specified by the smtpd_recipient_limit configuration directive. Its default value is 1000, but it can (of course) be modified in Postfix's configuration files. To obtain its current value, run\npostconf | grep smtpd_recipient_limit\n\nIn this case the limit was set to 16, and so Postfix rejected messages with more than 16 recipients.\n", "Q: Fresh install Ubuntu 14.04.03 boots every second time Fresh install.
