["Q: If an internal HDD is not mounted, is it still in function? I have a probably stupid question, but I'm gonna try anyway\nI have both a SSD and a HDD on my laptop: if my HDD is data only, and not mounted unless I need something inside (there's no \"eject\" icon next to it in Nautilus, just to be clear) is it still in function? \nI'm asking for a simple reason: since SSD have no moving parts, do I still need to be careful while moving my laptop because of the HDD? Or when it's not mounted the head is safely placed and there's no risk usually associated with moving a powered laptop with a working HDD?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: If none of the partitions on your hard drive are in use (swap ?) , then yes the drive is not \"in use\". It can still be damaged if you hit or drop your box hard enough though ;) \n", "Q: mupen64 installation Hey I am a new ubuntu user, I heard Mupen64 is a good emulator for n64, I really want to install it, I went to the software centre I didn't see it only the add-ons. I went online to look for it, I found another person ask the same question but unfortunately the guy who answered the question and said that the asking for the terminal code was a bad question so he gave a link. I clicked the link and ubuntu asked what program to open it in. I don't know to find the programs and what program I need to find, I also went to the mupen64 website and downloaded it but I don’t know how to run it. can anyone help?\n\nA: You can install mupen64 with:\nsudo apt-get install libmupen64plus2 mupen64plus\n\n", "Q: How to properly set up a 'network drive' in Ubuntu 14.04 I've got a NAS in my home network, which can serve files both via CIFS or NFS. Some of the shares require a username and password and I want all machines to automatically mount the shares on boot.\nWith my Windows machine, I simply connect a network drive, give it a Drive letter and put in the username and password.\nWith Ubuntu 14.04, I'm not sure what's the right way to do it. First, should I use CIFS or NFS? Second, how to set it up? I found way too many \"how to's\" and they are all different somehow, so I'm really confused now. Isn't there the way to do it? :)\nEDIT:\nI decided for CIFS (thanks to the comments), then followed these instructions as suggested. After creating the .smbcredentials file, as well as some folders within the /mnt/ directory, plus adding a line to my /etc/fstab file, I thought I was done. However, there is a problem left. When running mount -a:\nmount error: could not resolve address for readynas: Unknown error\nThe line in fstab looks like this:\n//readynas/public /mnt/readynas/public cifs iocharset=utf8,credentials=/home/domdom/.smbcredentials,uid=1000 0 0\nApart from that, I've got some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where would you usually mount those shares to? /mnt sounded like a good place to me, but some people suggest /media.\n\n*Why do I have to download and install cifs-utils when Ubuntu is able to mount the shares without? I can do that via the file manager (Browse Network, readynas (CIFS), ...).\n\n*The instructions say to secure the .smbcredentials file with two commands, then immediately add that they don't work with recent Ubuntu versions anymore. So, I just go without them? Or do I need to do something else? Is this insecure?\n\n*In another source, 'sec=ntlm' is added to explicitly set the security mode; I wonder if I need that and how I figure out whether or not I do.\n\n\nMan, I wish this was more straightforward.\nEDIT 2\nI replaced 'readynas' with the actual IP address and added the 'sec=ntlm' option. This way, I got it to work, though I still don't understand the details (see questions above). Plus, I feel like using the IP address is more of a workaround, but at least it does work.\n\nA: If you are sharing with Windows , go with CIFS. You can do NFS with windows , but last time I looked it takes more work. See How do I mount a CIFS share? or http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently .\nPlease update your question with specific details and/or configuration information if you come across a problem.\n", "Q: Need help installing/updating graphics card I just recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my ASUS Ultrabook S56C.

How could the system detect that they need to be upgraded, but didn't detect them when I tried to remove them?\n\nA: zsh, unlike bash, has a different glob/wildcard/expansion system, so it works differently so php*might not work as you expect.  So are instead of sudo apt-get remove php*, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quote it:\nsudo apt-get remove \"php*\"\n\n\n*Bash it:\nbash -c \"sudo apt-get remove php*\"\n\nN.B. Whilst also being a bad idea (as previously pointed out), sudo apt-get remove php * returned the names of files and foldersin the current working directory (likely your home directory) because of the * - but this also means if you have any files in hte terminal's current working directory beginning with php, you may have a problem using php* to request stuff, as it might include those filenames in the expansion.\nAnother N.B. php5-fpmphp5-gd and php5-snmpphp5-sqlite might of been part of the update, as some of the packages being updated needed those packages as new dependencies. By php5-fpmphp5-gd and php5-snmpphp5-sqlite, you probably meant php5-fpm, php5-gd, php5-snmp, php5-sqlite... (looking at the output you provided, it was because newlines occurred at those points) you probably should of ran:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge php-pear php5-cli php5-common php5-curl php5-fpm php5-gd php5-intl php5-mysql php5-pspell php5-readline php5-recode php5-snmp php5-sqlite php5-tidy php5-xmlrpc php5-xsl\n\n\nA: aptitude is an alternative to apt-get which makes it easy to match multiple package names using regular-expression-like patterns.\nFor example, to list all installed packages whose package names contain the term \"php\":\naptitude search ~iphp\n\n\nEdit: when using zsh shell, quote the argument so it doesn't break on the tilde:\nsudo aptitude search \"~iphp\"\n\n\nOr to uninstall them:\nsudo aptitude remove ~iphp\n\nor \nsudo aptitude purge ~iphp\n\nConsult this reference for more on the aptitude search syntax.\nNote: aptitude is more powerful than apt-get and therefore makes it easier to hose your system.  Always check which packages it is planning to remove, install, or downgrade before you confirm that it should go ahead.  For example, sometimes in order to satisfy your request to uninstall a package, aptitude would need to uninstall a bunch of other packages that depend on it.\nIf you're wondering what caused php packages to be installed in the first place, you can do some detective work by searching for reverse dependencies for a package: which packages depend on a package.  Recommended dependencies are installed by default but it is possible to override this and install a package without its \"recommends\" dependencies, or remove some \"recommends\" dependencies without removing the original package.\nTo list packages which are currently installed which also depend on, say, php5-fpm:\naptitude why php5-fpm\n\nThis should work most of the time, but for various reasons sometimes it can be impossible for the system to tell what caused a package to be automatically installed - maybe it was once a dependency of something but after an upgrade it's no longer depended on, etc.\nIf you get a command not found when trying to use aptitude, you need to install it on your system, like this:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nNote: in the past, it was common to warn people not to use apt-get and aptitude interchangeably to actually modify the system, because they couldn't keep track of which packages were automatically installed by each other.  This is no longer an issue (since at least 3 years ago), and they both use the same way of recording which packages were automatically installed.\nEdit: fixed aptitude why command\n\nA: You can use purge, autoremove & remove. I am using autoremove as an example for this.\n$ sudo apt-get autoremove 'php*'\n\nyou can also use aptitude\n$ sudo aptitude remove 'php*'\n\ncheck the installed packages\n$ sudo apt-cache policy 'php*'\n\nif all of them are none so all of the php app aren't installed \nif there's an installed package you can delete it by \n$ sudo apt-get autoremove 'packagename'\n\nNote: purge and remove are not the same. purge removes the package and its configuration and remove removes the package only.\n", "Q: How to make ubuntu install avoid bad blocks? I know this may be a duplicate, but I think my case is unique enough to warrant another question. I have a 320gb 7200 rpm hdd with the last half of the disk basically perfect, but the first half has (I think) some physical surface imperfections from being knocked around in a car while running. I checked the disk after that incident, and it said the disk was failing. I continued after that, and while it still said the disk was failing, it didn't change, nor did I have any problems with anything other than the first half of the disk. I have some screenshots taken a few minutes ago of what the disks application says about the disk from the SMART data. I switched the disk from an old 32 bit computer to a 64 bit one, and want to install 64 bit ubuntu without wiping out the 32 bit zorin os on the second to last partition. The ubuntu installer fails when I try to install on the first half of the disk, where part way through installation it says I/O error, and the installer crashes. I want to know how I can make the installer avoid the bad spots and install regardless. Here is a bit of what the smart data says: reallocated sector count: 0 sectors, threshold 5, worst 1, normalized 1, reallocation count: 4459, normalized 9, worst 9, threshold 0, uncorrectable sectors: 0 \n\nA: I found that the issue was not a write error with the installer having issues with bad blocks, I found it was an issue with a bad ISO download, and this a corrupt DVD. I re downloaded the image and re burned it, it installed perfectly. I have a new disk coming, but I don't think it is necessary, I'll just install windows on the other drive and keep my Linux disk from getting bumped around too much.

Do this before you actually try to install it in the BIOS.\n", "Q: Recovery Partition in Windows 8 hogging space Ok, I am trying Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1. I have used Ubuntu briefly when I had Win7 but that was many many years ago, and went by a lot easier.\nThe issue I'm having is that Windows 8.1 has a recovery partition that is hogging 9GB of my hard drive. This has caused  me to not have any space to do almost anything in Ubuntu. Can I safely remove Recovery? If I do remove it can the space freed be used for Ubuntu? Does simply deleting apps and files from Windows 8.1 matter for space in Ubuntu?\nI also want to add that Ubuntu is installed and working, however any Ubuntu apps won't install and Ubuntu won't update due to lack of memory.\n\nA: In the Windows 7 era, pre-installed versions of Windows typically came with programs to create a set of recovery DVDs. These could then take the place of the recovery partition. I don't know offhand if Windows 8 installations come with similar tools. (I'd expect them to use USB flash drives today.) You could look for such a thing. If it exists, use it, and it will then be (relatively) safe to remove the recovery partition.\nIn Linux, partitions are mounted to particular directories. For instance, your main Windows partition might be mounted to /windows. In this scheme, deleting files in Windows will make space available in Ubuntu, but only under /windows. You don't normally install programs there, but you might be able to use that space for storing user files. Also, there's a caveat: For native Linux use, NTFS is slow and lacks features that Linux requires for some purposes. Furthermore, Linux includes no good NTFS recovery tools (ntfsfix does only the most basic checks and flags the partition as needing attention in Windows). Thus, if you want to use space exclusively in Linux, or for tasks such as holding additional Linux programs, you've got to resize your partitions, shrinking the Windows partition(s) and giving space to the Linux partition(s). You'll probably have to use a Linux live CD/USB for this task, since GParted won't let you resize a partition that's in use.\nAlso, if you delete the Windows recovery partition, its space will be unusable unless and until you resize partition(s) to fill its space, or create a new partition in its place.\nFinally, note that resizing partitions is inherently dangerous. This is especially true if you change the start point of a partition. You should back up any important data from a partition before you attempt to resize it.\n\nA: I'd advise great caution here. I've just been through the same excercise trying to improve my free space on a Acer E11, which only has a 32Gb SSD built in to it. There was just 18Gb of disk allocated to Windows, and there was 10Gb recovery partition.\nThe OS identified itself as Windows 8.1 with bing. The 'bing' is actually a code for a sub-version of windows that makes use of some of the recovery files during boot, and as such it cannot be removed. Added to that the recovery partition is locked, so you can't re-size it with any tools, unless you can do it outside of windows, and with UEFI thats quite a task.\nAssuming you've got an OEM built system, then there will be lots of 'free' goodies from the manuafacturer, and one of them will most likely have a button that allows you to create a recovery backup. On my machine the backup needed to be done to a device connected to the USB port with at least 16Gb of space. I know, the recovery partition is only 10Gb!! But I think they were thinking of USB memory sticks, which these days come in powers of 2 sizes (4Gb, 8Gb, 16Gb etc).\nI tried installing from a windows 8.1 install disk, which worked, but actually ended up using up more space. I also tried installing windows 7, but as my machine has USB3.0 ports and no optical drive, it lost its connection to the USB external DVD drive as soon as it go into the setting up windows section.\nIn the end the only way to save space was good old-fashioned housekeeping. Delecte unwanted programs (mine had a 360Mb copy of Office 365 the you could activate by buying a susbscription), carefully decide which, if any of the manufacturers free gifts you are ever going to use, then get rid of the rest. Uninstall windows features that you don't use. Disable hibernation if you don't use it (this is a massive saving - it takes up as much room as you have RAM). Finally run disc cleanup and select \"clean-up system files\", this allows you to delete the backup copies of files that windows update has replaced.\nI started with just 6Gb free, and after housekeeping, I've got just 6Gb used, 13Gb free (thats less than half the size of when I started).\n\nA: If your trouble is to save space, you can use bleachbit on windows and linux. It will removes the caches of a lot of apps, the history and a lot of stuff. You should be really carefull about options you choose, because some features are in beta and could definitely crash your computer. But if you do it carefully, you can save a lot of space.\nOn windows only, you can use ccleaner, which further than remove the caches, can also detects copies of files. (On the same link, defraggler is also usefull to better organize your memory, which is healthy for the pc, but it's another subject)\n", "Q: Backup Problem In Ubuntu 14.04 When I'm Backing Up My Files Using the Backup Application, at the last time it shows a error that\n\nCould Not Backup The Following files make sure you are able to open them\n/home/neel/.cache/dconf\n/home/neel/.dbus\n\n\n\nA: It's a bug in Ubuntu backup (deja-dup). https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/deja-dup/+bug/1313034\nYou can adjust the rights of the folders.\nOpen a terminal and copy these commands:\nsudo chown \"$USER:$USER\" ~/.cache/dconf ~/.gvfs\nsudo chown -R \"$USER:$USER\" ~/.dbus\n\n", "Q: Cannot download youtube-dl I was trying to download a video from YouTube using youtube-dl, but I got the sig error, so I tried to update youtube-dl to the latest version and it wasn't working.

It is an international project that aims to develop\n  software frameworks for the development of software, to program\n  end-user applications based on these frameworks and coordinates the\n  efforts for internationalization and localization as well as for\n  accessibility of that software.\nGNOME is part of the GNU Project.\nBefore GNOME 3, GNOME used the traditional desktop metaphor but in\n  GNOME 3 this was abandoned in favor of GNOME Shell where switching\n  between different tasks and virtual workspaces takes place in a\n  separate area called the Overview. Also in GNOME 3, Mutter replaced\n  Metacity as the default window manager, the minimize and maximize\n  buttons no longer appear on the titlebar by default, and Adwaita\n  replaced Clearlooks as the default theme. Many GNOME Core Applications\n  also went through redesigns to provide a more consistent user\n  experience.\nThese changes received mixed reaction from the user community, though\n  the outcome is not yet clear. The MATE desktop environment, software\n  forked from GNOME 2, aims to retain the traditional GNOME 2 interface\n  while keeping it compatible with GNOME 3. The Linux Mint team\n  addressed the issue in another way by developing the \"Mint GNOME Shell\n  Extensions\". This led to the Cinnamon user interface, which attempts\n  to provide a more traditional user environment based on the desktop\n  metaphor, like GNOME 2.\n\nUnity is a great desktop environment and you don't NEED any other\ndesktop environment BUT if you don't like Unity you MAY install gnome.\n\nA: \"Gnome 3\" is a desktop environment, and like its predecessor \"Gnome 2\" or another offspring \"MATE\" they define the look and feel of windows, buttons, menus and icons and how they act together. The \"Gnome Shell\" or \"Unity\" further defines a certain default configuration and behavior of your user interface.\nGnome 3, Unity and many new applications are built on the GTK+ 3.x library to handle their Graphical User Interface. Whereas Gnome 2, MATE and many older apps still use GTK+ 2.x. Luckily GTK+ 2.x and GTK+ 3.x can be used together at the same time (just not by the same process). So with Gnome 3 or Unity you can still install and use older apps based on GTK+ 2.0. And with Gnome 2 or MATE you can use new GTK+ 3.0 apps!\nTo compare different desktop environments you can have installed Unity, Gnome 3 and MATE simultaneously (MATE is planned to come in Ubuntu 14.10). Then you can choose one of it each time you log in. Installing Gnome 3 in Ubuntu 14.04 is explained here: How to get gnome shell 3.12 on ubuntu 14.04\n", "Q: How can CUPS dynamically determine the IP address of a network printer? I am trying to set up CUPS to access a network printer.  Its IP address was assigned via DHCP by the internet router, which is also the DHCP server.  I understand that this address may change from time to time.  How can I instruct CUPS to obtain the printer's IP address?\n\nA: You have two options here\nIf you have control over the DHCP server you can set it to assign a static dhcp address (oxymoron I know) to the printer. Most commercial routers I have personally encountered have this feature (see the manual or try to find this in your router configuration)\nIf you do not have control over address assignments, most printers will either have a hardwired hostname or let you select one for it in the network configuration for the embedded print-server. The hostname should be routable from the local network without any additional configuration. For example if your printer has an assigned hostname of HPLASERJET5900 you would simply be able to use that in your CUPS configuration (ex. HPLASERJET5900:9100 (for HP direct printing). You can use the hostname instead of the IP wherever you are required to input it. \nIf you have a more complicated network topology, (say printer is on a different subnet) you will have to configure your network so the hostnames are routable from other subnets. \n", "Q: Belkin n52te driver install I tried fallowing this thread How do I configure a Belkin n52te gamepad to work? and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=948833 to get my Belkin n52te to work. neither of which worked.\nwhen I did the ubuntuforums way I got this error \"lookuperror no uinput device-nodes found\"\nusing the other I got no hardware found when running the jnostromo.\nlsusb gives me 2 different n52te's \nBus 002 Device 011: ID 050d:0200 Belkin Components Nostromo SpeedPad n52te Gaming Keyboard\nBus 002 Device 007: ID 050d:0415 Belkin Components \nI tried switching between these two and neither worked either.\n\nA: The first link in your post also requires you to manually populate a .map file to program the n52te.  The pystromo-mon.py will read the file in the .config/pystromo directory and make the n52te use those keys.  Alot of trial and error on my part was needed to make it work but I have my n52 and n52 running just fine now that I know what to do.\nI have been in contact in the past with a developer who has made a tournament authorized programming tool w/gui for the Nostromo gamepads, along with the Razer version..\nHere is a link to his site. http://sourceforge.net/projects/kbmaster/\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Play M3U from browser I want to listen to online radio station from TuneIn (This is an example radio station).

I am new to Ubuntu and anything Linux based.\nI'm getting pop ups almost every day telling me of important updates I have to/can install, and am wondering what these updates that come out so regularly actually do?\nIs their purpose to improve the user experience in the sense of adding features (ie making the OS more cluttered) or actually improving performance? If they are simply adding features, I would rather turn them off.\nNow I know there are different types of updates, the security updates are self explanatory, I am however talking about the  \"recommended updates\".\n\nA: Security updates are obviously the ones you need in order to keep you system secure.\nRecommended Updates and other usually contain non-critical updates which fix some bugs in the program or some broken package etc... and do not affect the security of the system. They generally improve the system stability in various ways.\nYou can expand the technical description tab within the update panel, select the specific update and see what the update entails, then you can choose to update or not.\nSee here for further reference.\n", "Q: Which Git GUI can show list of files inside stash?

Everything is SLOW as hell. Going from a desktop to the next is slow. Unlocking my workstation kind of fades out the lock screen and fades in the desktop. The animation takes about 5 seconds!

You can check this with the command\n$ echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK\n\nIf the agent value begins /tmp/ssh, you have the commandline ssh-agent acting as your agent.\nAs a workaround, you can use the old style shell command\n$ ssh-add\n\nto add you key to the keyring. This does not work well with all graphical programs, however.\n\nA: I was able to solve the issue by adding the following lines in my \"~/.bashrc\"\n\neval `gnome-keyring-daemon --start`\nUSERNAME=\"reynold\"\nexport SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\"$(ls /run/user/$(id -u $USERNAME)/keyring*/ssh|head -1)\"\nexport SSH_AGENT_PID=\"$(pgrep gnome-keyring)\"\n\n\nA: I was finally able to find a solution for this annoying problem (Ubuntu server 14.04) in Atlassian support - step #4.

My question is when I install Ubuntu 13.10 and remove Win7  will there be a problem with this router?  What should I do to set it up on Ubuntu?  Will the old password work with Ubuntu?\n\nA: Yup. It should work since the password is put on access to WiFi.\nUbuntu should automatically find your WiFi.

Yes. the old password will work with Ubuntu. No operating system will change the security information in your router. Regardless of OS it can be helpful to know your routers security details.\nUsing WEP or WPA, TKIP or EAP, etc. There's lots of good information to be found simply by googling router security settings.

Backticks get cumbersome/confusing when you start needing to do nested quoting.  Ex:\n$ FOO=`echo \"foo's\"`\n$ echo $FOO\nfoo's\n\nReplacing the backticks with $() yields the same output, and is easier to read (fewer quotes of varrying angles to discern):\n$ FOO=$(echo \"foo's\")\n$ echo $FOO\nfoo's\n\nThat, and each quotation mark (single quote, double quote, backtick) means something different in the shell, so using $ can help remove a level of complexity.  And the developer who follows you will thank you, for he/she will have an easier time figuring out what you did.\n\nA: Use dollar. Backticks are semi-deprecated, because they are more complicated to use (see the link), and there are no advantages to them unless you're doing code golf and absolutely need to save a single character. They probably won't be removed from popular shells anytime soon though, so you're safe using either for now.\n", "Q: how to test if the apt cache is up to date with bash I'm searching a way to test in a bash script if a cache update is needed (to avoid unnecessary apt-get update when the apt-cache have been updated recently).\ncan someone help me?\n\nA: Well as  Tuomas found out on ServerFault, there's an APT::Update::Post-Invoke-Success invocation pinged off by default in Ubuntu.

Using that service code, you should be able to find what equipment your Dell was built with, although someone may have changed out some devices since the time the computer was built.\n", "Q: Disable touch of the tablet in Ubuntu Unity 14.04 I've searched beforehand and the only suggestion I've found is this one but it doesn't work, at least not on my system (Ubuntu Unity 14.04 x64).\nI need to disable the touch on my WACOM Bamboo Manga CTH-470 tablet so only the pen tip and eraser are recognized and not my hand when I accidentally touch it.\nI know of this temporary solution:\nxsetwacom --list\n\nto list the output of the tablet (example)\ninoki@innerdistance-Satellite-L650:~$ xsetwacom --list\nWacom Bamboo 16FG 4x5 Pen stylus    id: 11  type: STYLUS\nWacom Bamboo 16FG 4x5 Finger touch  id: 12  type: TOUCH\nWacom Bamboo 16FG 4x5 Pen eraser    id: 16  type: ERASER\nWacom Bamboo 16FG 4x5 Finger pad    id: 17  type: PAD\nthen\nxsetwacom --set # touch off\n\nUsing\ninoki@innerdistance-Satellite-L650:~$ xsetwacom --list | grep TOUCH | cut -d ' ' -f 8\nTOUCH\ninoki@innerdistance-Satellite-L650:~$\nhas shown only the \"TOUCH\" word exactly as above.\nI need to make it permanent, so I don't have to insert the command every time I want to work with my tablet.\n\nA: in my case worked this: \nxsetwacom -v --set 'Wacom Intuos Pro M (WL) Finger touch' gesture off\n\ntest\nxsetwacom -v --set 'Wacom Bamboo 16FG 4x5 Finger touch' gesture off\n\n\nA: Rather than rely on fixed character positions and cut, you could use sed instead, like this:\nxsetwacom --set `xsetwacom --list | grep TOUCH | sed -r \"s/.*id: *([0-9]*).*/\\1/\"` touch off\n\n\nA: First off, you still need to add the new command to your autostart configuration so that it's disabled to start with:\nxsetwacom --set `xsetwacom --list | grep TOUCH | cut -c 40-42` touch off\n\nThen try putting the following into a new file: /etc/pm/power.d/99_touchdisable:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nac_power ()\n{\n    xsetwacom --set `xsetwacom --list | grep TOUCH | cut -c 40-42` touch off\n}\n\nbattery_power ()\n{\n    xsetwacom --set `xsetwacom --list | grep TOUCH | cut -c 40-42` touch off\n}\n\nThen run sudo chmod 755 /etc/pm/power.d/99_touchdisable\nRestart your tablet and try unplugging/plugging in your tablet.\nIf it doesn't work, check to see if you have different power profiles enabled.

My question is, how can I fix a failing hard drive using Ubuntu? \n\nA: With the limited Information you gave it is hard to tell. You can do the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Start ubuntu from a liveCD or USB-stick.\n\n*Open the Disk Utility (just type the name into the dash)\n\n*Select your harddrive, click on the gear icon -> SMART Data and Tests.\n\n\nThere you can see the state of the disk, Temperature and any errors and FAILS it has.\nYou can even check it for problems with the Start Self-Test button.\n", "Q: bash : update apt-get only if apt cache is older than 10 minutes I'm trying, with a script, to test if apt cache is older than 10 minutes old\nif [ \"($(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Z /var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp)) -ge 600000\" ]; then\necho true\nfi\n\nBut it even when the cache is 1 min old, this return true. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: What you are doing is not substraction ,rather you are putting a \"-\" symbol between two values. You can see this by trying.\necho \"($(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Z /var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp))\"\n\nwhich gives in my case\n(1403616665 - 1403583368)\n\nThe correct statement should be\necho \"$[$(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Z /var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp)]\"\n\nwhich correctly gives\n33297\n\nAlso due to the outermost quotation marks, the statement \"($(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Z /var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp)) -ge 600000\" is considered as first value, which is compared to nothing, that's why it gives always true result.\nRounding this all up, the script would be\nif [ \"$[$(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Z /var/lib/apt/periodic/update-success-stamp)]\" -ge 600000 ]; then\necho true\nfi\n\n", "Q: Does Hard reboot damage my Ubuntu Some times my laptop gets stuck due to excessive usage of RAM when I open bulky applications. So if it does not respond I shut down the laptop using the power button. Does this damage Ubuntu in any way? Can it give rise to security problems or vulnerabilities?\n\nA: Obviously you will loose the amount of data that is in your RAM at that time and hasn't been written to disk, yet. Also there is a theoretical chance of data/file-system corruption.\nFrom my own experiences I can tell you that I'm hard-resetting my PC 4-5 times a day over the last 5 years and never had the problem of corrupted filesystems. I think ext3/ext4/ufs are pretty robust for this kind of failures.\nIn opposite to this I think NTFS is far more prone to this. On my Windows gaming rig I have a ~15% chance of file system corruption after a blue-screen and I'll have to to boot from disk to run a file system repair tool in that case ... **sigh**\n\nA: You run the risk of causing filesystem inconsistencies. It is better, even when out of RAM, as this normally still works in such situations, to use the alt-sysrq sequence, as that will attempt to shut things down as cleanly as possible (if it fails, then you're no worse off than if you pressed the power button, but if it succeeds then you're potentially better off). The sequence is as follows:\nHold down the alt key and the key marked \"sys rq\" at the same time (if you're on a laptop you might well need to hold down a special key on the laptop to get to the \"sys rq\" function). With those keys held down, press and release the following letters in the following order:\n\n\n*\n\n*R - this regains control of the keyboard from any applications that have grabbed keyboard focus\n\n*E - attempt to cleanly terminate all processes\n\n*I - attempt to immediately terminate all processes (will get rid of everything that failed from previous key)\n\n*S - sync all filesystems (this is the most important part)\n\n*U - remount all filesystems read-only (sometimes this is needed to flush data to disk)\n\n*B - perform hard reboot (replace with O to turn off the power instead of rebooting)\n\n\nA: It won't cause security problems or vulnerabilities.\nBut it can cause damage on your OS and loss of data depending on the tasks that are running at the time.\nThat being said, your computer still shouldn't get stuck at high ram usage.  \n\nA: Maybe this will help a little, by default ubuntu and others swappiness are set to 60 , when your system reaches 60% of ram usage it changes to swap which is slow.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open this file on gedit or nano using: gksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf OR sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\n*Add this to the end of the file: vm.swapiness = 0\n\n*Save the file and reboot.\nAlso when it gets slow you should check if it is really using swap which slows down the system, otherwise the above changes wont help.\n\nA: In my case I don't hard boot intentionally, it happens on electrical trip and every time this so called ext4 corrupted.

My present set up is that I have 2 HDD on my Ubuntu BOX.  1-160GB HDD which has the Ubuntu OS(12.04LTS). 2-2TB HDD which has all the Data.  Basically I want to add the another HDD to the Box on a RAID configuration and I do not want to destroy any data on either HDD's... Is it Possible? if so how can I go about doing so?\n\nA: I'm presuming one of the drives has the data you want to save. (One of the 2TB drives).\nLet's say drive A has data, and drive B is blank.\nYou'll need to create a degraded raid on drive B.  Start the raid on drive B and rsync all of your data over the newly created raid.  Once that's done, you can add drive A to the raid, and it'll sync up and become part of the raid.\nFor example:\n#create degraded raid (in this case /dev/sda1 is the blank drive)\nsudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 -l raid1 -f -n 1 /dev/sda1\n#create a file system on degraded raid.\nsudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/md0   #pick whatever fs you like here. ext4/xfs is my preference\n#mount raid\nsudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/newRaid\n# mount data you want to keep\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/oldData\n#copy data from old drive to newly created raid.\nsudo rsync -avP /mnt/oldData /mnt/newRaid\n#unmount old data drive\nsudo umount oldData\n#add drive.\nsudo mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/sdb2\n#leave computer on until cat /proc/mdstat reposts as done.\n\n", "Q: How to login again after logout ubuntu in Trying ubuntu live CD I try Ubuntu 14.04 by using live CD and I logout that and now I can't login again because it asks me input username and password.

The PostgreSQL protocol does not reveal the actual server version for the connecting clients at connection start-up phrase (see http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/protocol-flow.html ). Thus, the scanner should be able to connect and authenticate into the PostgreSQL server making it capable to issue SELECT version() SQL query (see http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/functions-info.html). If a scanner was able to run this command, it needed to authenticate. \n\n\n*\n\n*enable authentication;\n\n*block PostgreSQL TCP ports with a firewall\n\n\nHiding the OS version.

So, how do I install windows?\n\nA: Short answer: You should use a VM with VirtualBox or Qemu.\nIf you are willing to risk it:\n\n*\n\n*Create a partition to host your Windows installation (I use Disks because it comes with my distro, you can also use fdisk, gparted or something else).\n\n*Run your Windows installation by either:\n\n*\n\n*Restart your PC with the Windows disk.\n\n*Make an image of the Windows disk and run it with Qemu with your hard drive mapped.\n\nqemu -hda /dev/sda -cdrom winxp.iso -boot d --enable-kvm\n  \n  \n*Reinstall GRUB following this guide: Reinstalling GRUB\n  \n  Note that, if you used the qemu approach, it's likely that your system is working and reinstalling GRUB would be as easy as\n\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Search Bar Missing Letter 'e' I got a weird problem in Ubuntu 14.04, when I use the dash bar search, if I type in a lower case 'e' it just displays an empty space instead of the actual letter.

This is my first experience really using UEFI, so I was a little surprised that the install process didn't just work for me. No matter what I did, I always ended up with a prompt saying   \n\nUnable to find a medium containing a live file system  \n\nand I was unable to type anything, though that may be due to my wireless keyboard (wired is on the way). This prompt always comes  up after sitting at the Ubuntu loading screen for about ~2-3 minutes.\nI made sure the ISO I downloaded was fine by checking the MD5Sum. Rebuilt the bootable usb (using UNetbootin) twice, no luck. The only thing I was not able to do was turn off secure boot, because I was not able to find the option on my motherboad (Gigabyte 970A-UD3P). I'm not even sure if that's a UEFI feature, or if it's just a Windows 8 feature.\nI have verified that I am indeed using USB2.0 ports, and not USB3.0. I am rather lost and not sure how to proceed at this point. Any more guidance would be greatly appreciated! I really despise developing on Windows -_-\nEDIT: more attempts:\nOk, I have tried this some more. I have now used Rufus, LiveLinux USB Creator, and Universal USB Installer. None of these have done it either. I have bought a brand new flash drive, that didn't work. Every single time it is the same story. Ubuntu loading screen for about 2 minutes, then kicked into an ash console with the message of \"Unable to find a medium containing a live file system\".

My experience with it is limited, but the last I heard, its support for EFI-mode booting was poor or non-existent. In my experience, the most reliable way to create an EFI-bootable USB flash drive of an Ubuntu installer is to use dd in Linux, or a port of dd to Windows or whatever other OS you can use:\nsudo dd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nChange the if= and of= options as appropriate.\nIf you're using Windows, my limited experience with Rufus has also been positive.\nFor more on EFI-mode installs generally, see my Web page on the subject or the Ubuntu community wiki. Both provide accurate information. Much of the advice on the Internet about EFI-mode installs is misguided.\n\nA: First decide which firmware interface to be used EFI or Legacy mode . This will help you to decide.\nFor uefi + Windows 8 see @Luis Alvarado's answer at installing-ubuntu-on-a-pre-installed-windows-8-64-bit-system-uefi-supported.\nIf you can't boot try the following.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Use legacy mode (no uefi)  \n\n*Use USB 2.0 port (no USB 3)  \n\n*Remove all unwanted devices (USB, memory card)\n\n*Disable QuickBoot/FastBoot from Windows\n\n*Try UHCI or OHCI Host Controller (no  xHCI)  \n\n\nFor error  \n\nUnable to find a medium containing a live file system  \n\nAs you get this error after loading the boot-loader you can load the operating system to RAM but edit and adding toram option to the kernel.

I have a Thinkpad T440 on Ubuntu 14.04.  I use fingerprint-gui to allow me to login and use sudo by swiping a fingerprint.  The worrying part is that anyone can run the fingerprint-gui program to reprogram the fingerprints -- so, anyone can get into my computer, given a few minutes!  This seems like a gaping security hole.  How can I patch this?\n\nA: It is possible for someone to reprogram a user's fingerprints provided they have already been authenticated as that user. However, the developers of the program do not consider this an issue under their current security model.\nYou can see this forum post for an explanation of their choice:\nhttp://home.ullrich-online.cc/fingerprint/Forum/topic.php?TopicId=324#1063\n", "Q: Asus G73gj Fan runs full speed all the time.

Can I use dual boot safely (with proper disk partitioning) due to constantly writing and erasing a specific part of the SSD as a effect of the partitioning. Or is it recommended to make the partitions for the Operating Systems as small as possible and therefore create one big data partition used by both systems. and do i need to make another partition with unallocated space or will one big data partition with probally 40g-50g free space suffice     \nFor school/data I use DropBox and am able to play games from external HDD\nAnd does Virtualbox need the same partitions as a Dual boot and provide the same problems?\nI hope that anybody can help me with my problem :)\n\nA: For the hard drive part of the question, when doing things on a VM, you will make a virtual hard drive on the already existing file system. for example if you have windows as the host system, the virtual drive will just look like another file to windows, but in the VM it will be the hard drive for the VM. SSDs reallocate blocks as needed, so it shouldn't matter about the fact that the OS for the VM is running in all one file. \nabout you having 8gb of memory and not using a swap, that should work depending on how many programs/processes you have open. and remember that the Host machine OS and the Guest VM will both have to share the 8gb of memory, but how you divide that 8gb is up to you. If you want the full 8gb of memory to go to one OS, you might want to consider setting up your system as dual boot instead of using VMs. \n", "Q: Recovered Ubuntu, but it still launches corrupt version I am Ubuntu newbie, so this one may be obvious.\nWhile playing with some Ubuntu themes, I have messed something up with my Ubuntu 14.04 (keyboard stopped working and Unity looks damaged too - no bars etc.), so i used Advanced options in GRUB Menu and picked up one of the previous versions.

I have seen this happen before. I think an easy way to resolve this is with grub customizer. First install it. information is here: https://launchpad.net/~danielrichter2007/+archive/grub-customizer \nWhen you run it you'll get something similar to this: \n\nSimply uncheck the boxes for the kernel that is giving you problems and keep the ones you want to use checked. \nThen click Save and Then File and Install to MBR\nThis should get you through until the next kernel update by which time you may find the problem is resolved.\n", "Q: Peaceful coexistance of Intel and Nviidia GLX I have an optimus laptop, so both intel and nvidia cards.  It has worked fine for years (running 12.04) using bumblebee.  Yes, I know there are better options by now, but it works fine.\nProblem is, for various reasons I needed the CUDA 6 toolkit, which means an external install.  Unsurprisingly, it squashed my GLX library.\nCurrently the nvidia hardware works fine, but the Intel hardware (that is, my xserver on :0) can't successfully load GLX.  I would hazard a guess that perhaps it has something to do with the intel xorg initialization log containing\n[    77.269] (II) LoadModule: \"glx\"\n[    77.269] (II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so\n[    77.277] (II) Module glx: vendor=\"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n[    77.277]    compiled for 4.0.2, module version = 1.0.0\n[    77.277]    Module class: X.Org Server Extension\n#...\n[    77.469] (EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)\n\ndpkg -S agrees that /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so \"belongs\" to xserver-xorg-core, so I'm reasonably sure that a forced reinstall of that package would put libglx.so back to the \"correct\" version.  The only problem is that that would break the nvidia side.\nIntel doesn't use an xorg.conf, Nvidia uses one via bumblebee.\nIs there a way that I can get these two drivers to coexist in peace?\n\nA: You might try to restore the original /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so from xserver-xorg-core . That's what I did in a similar situation. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*First confirm that it has indeed been replaced by the nvidia install:\ndebsums xserver-xorg-core | grep libglx.so\n\nIf it shows FAILED, it means that it has actually been replaced, and you could try to restore the original.\n\n*To restore the original, first find the .deb filename for your installed package:\napt-cache show xserver-xorg-core | grep Filename: | head -1\n\nIt should show something like this:\nFilename: pool/main/x/xorg-server/xserver-xorg-core_1.7.6-2ubuntu7.12_i386.deb\n                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n\n*Locate where you can download that file from, and download it. (Usually a Google search on the filename, marked with ^^^^^^ below, is enough.) Save it on /tmp.\n\n*Extract the needed file from the package:\ncd /tmp\ndpkg --fsys-tarfile xserver-xorg-core_1.7.6-2ubuntu7.12_i386.deb | tar xvf - ./usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so\n\n\n*Rename the file you are about to replace (just in case you need it later):\nmv /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so.orig-20140914\n\n\n*Copy the original file to its correct place:\nmv ./usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so\n\n\n*Restart your X (logging out and back in from my graphics session was enough here).\n\n*Run glxgears (or your preferred GLX program) to confirm everything is dandy now. \nThe above is tested and working on my oldie Ubuntu 10.04 desktop (no Unity for me), should work on your 12.04 install too if you follow the indicated procedure for finding out the .deb package name (which will be different than mine). \n", "Q: Installing ATI Catalyst 14.20 beta on Ubuntu 12.04 throws error The Internet is full of this kind of issues, like the guys from ATI wouldn't even bother to test their installers.

However, I want to have it setup so people can just download files by connecting to its external IP address, then enter some folders and download the files with their browser. I would like it to be FTP or HTTP, but setting either of these up seems very complicated. How should I go about setting this up? I tried using GADMIN-PROFTPD but it always crashes.\n\nA: The simplest and safest method would be via HTTP, as this would be read only.\nUbuntu has good documentation for setting up a working LAMP stack here.

When you compile something you tell the compiler (more or less):\n\n\n*\n\n*read this file.\n\n*process and link it\n\n*write the output here\n\n\nSo, what you are seeing is perfectly normal in most (if not all) languages possible.

After a logout/login cycle, most of my unity functions are back, can I can be productive again.  The GUI widgets in most applications look kde-ish, but at least now the system fonts make sense again.  I can't tell if this is a qt or gtk configuration issue.\nNone of this fixed my problem that I could not change the desktop image, even after trying with shotwell, gsettings, the unity settings panel... What eventually solved that part was turning on \"icons on desktop\" in the gnome tweak tool.  It doesn't matter that I have all the icons turned off, \"icons on desktop\" has to be enabled, or nothing will change the desktop image.\n\nA: Same problem here, last night installed kubuntu-desktop on my Ubuntu 14.04 and the language icon dissapeared and menuitems style was changed.\nThings that I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*System config theme setted again to Ambiance, improved some things.\n\n*Resetting unity: unity-tweak-tool --reset-unity (No visible change).\n\n*Edit the file located at: $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini (this was the final solution).\n\n\nThe changes made to settings.ini:\ngtk-theme-name=Ambiance (changed from value okygen-gtk)\ngtk-icon-theme-name=Ambiance (changed from value oxygen)\nFinally login into Unity again and the problem was solved. The best part is that the change is persistent, so Unity and KDE keeps their respectives styles.\n", "Q: Getting dropbox to sync at start-up problem Dropbox: I expect it to sync at start-up, with the dropbox icon in top bar.

In Win 7, there's a drop down in PuTTy that lists the Serial Adapter on a given USB port, but there's no equivalent in the Ubuntu/Linux version of PuTTy.\nI've tried to research the issue myself and learned a little about the lsusb command and even tried to substitute some of the info from a lusb -D command into PuTTy but with no luck.\nI then tried to find Linux drivers for the device with no luck.  \nAlso, if there's something silly I did not do, please call it out so I can help myself and potentially others in the future!!!\n\nA: I needed to launch PuTTy with sudo; specifically, \"sudo putty\" from a term window.\n", "Q: KDE 4.13.2 update breaks login from LightDM on Kubuntu 14.04 One of the KDE updates that rolled out in the last couple of days broke my ability to log in to KDE from lightdm using the lightdm-kde-greeter.

I have wicd, hplib and psensor installed. But they all always a run at startup in KDE environment.

Anything inside the /usr/ or /etc folder will have been installed by your distribution.\n\nA: KDE provides a wonderful tool in systemsettings (\"Startup and Shutdown\" -> \"Autostart\") for managing your personal autostart services (in either of the .kde directories) however it doesn't cover systemwide autostart scripts provided by your distribution packages, or created by the gnome apps.\nSometimes however it can be useful to override your distribution autostart preferences, for example I don't like having the printer-applet running as I don't own a printer, but it seems a shame to uninstall it in case I need it.\nThe correct way to disable a package installed is actually to copy it to your personal autostart folder. Anything of the same name in ~/.kde/share/autostart and/or /usr/share/autostart/ (also can be ~/.kde4/Autostart) overrides the .desktop file in the default installations. Once we have copied the .desktop file we can make changes.\nAdd the following line to the .desktop file you have just copied:\nHidden=true \n\nKDE also restores your session when you log in, so if psensor is running when you log out, it will be started up again when you log in. To change that, just close psensor (i.e. actually quit the program, don't just close the window). If psensor is not running when you log out, it should not start up again when you log back in. \n", "Q: Weird internal microphone level This is abnormal properly, when I set this mic level into 40-50% level, the level is too high than normal level condition (usually quite low level).

But Can I install xubuntu desktop environment from xubuntu's iso file (Instead of online by apt-get)?\nHow to do that?\n\nA: On an installed Ubuntu install, cache of installed packages is stored at /var/cache/apt/archives so they don't need to be downloaded again if they are needed to be re-installed.\nOn an install disk (Ubuntu 14.04, should be the same as the Xubuntu one), the compressed file-system appears to be at casper/filesystem.squashfs. So you should be able to decompress the squashfs file (I wouldn't do it as root, odd things may happen then), and extract the cached deb archives. Then you could install from the debs the dependencies listed here. \nThe problem is that the packages may be installed on the compressed filesystem, but not cached, so installing from the disk becomes impossible. I tried this with a normal Ubuntu install disk (a 1GB 14.04 one downloaded from here - using the command unsquashfs '/run/media/wilf/Ubuntu 14.04 LTS i386/casper/filesystem.squashfs in a empty directory), and there were no cached packages.\nAs cached packages use up an awful lot of space, when trying to fit a system installer to a ISO which has to fit on a CD or DVD, it is not surprising these are left out - especially on the Xubuntu disk, as it is more for low-spec systems. Unless you copy the installed data over, which is not a good idea, you can't really install from the iso. Cached packages may be included on the larger 4GB install ISOs available for some systems.\nSo you are probably stuck with installing xubuntu-desktop - great idea though.\n\nA: The command dpkg-repack can help you by following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*First List packages required for installing Desktop-Environment (Here example for xubuntu-desktop:\nsudo apt-get install  xubuntu-desktop -s | grep Inst | cut -d \" \" -f 2 > file1\n\nAbove command writes required packages' list for xubuntu-desktop in file1.\n\n*Use Try without installing option from live Environment from ISO (By either of 2 ways):-\n\n\n*\n\n*Add entry of ISO in GRUB and directly use Live Environment (try OS without installing)\n\n*Burn ISO to DVD and go for Try Without Installing\n\n\n*On Live Environment Run following command:\nsudo xargs dpkg-repack < file1\n\nAbove command dpkg-repack creates deb files (in the directory where command is run) of all packages listed in file1 because Xubuntu's Live session contains all packages in installed condition! (Move/Copy them to your storage)\n\n*Now You've all required debs in a directory. Restart and come  Back to your Ubuntu (Default) OS and install packages either of following ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd to directory containing all debs and run dpkg -i *.deb\n\n*OR (Recommended as standard method is APT) Install with help of Local repository\n\nIn brief : By this method you can get required debs by dpkg-repack from live session of distro's ISO and install them to current OS\nNote/warning: Here same version of Ubuntu & Xubuntu used if there is old/update then dependency issues may brakes/downgrades current packages\n\nA: The ISO file contains the live image of the xubuntu, while for installation you need debs which are often found online but if you want to do offline install you may need to download the debs and then run them or use something like aptocd \n", "Q: Lost files on upgrade to 14.04 I used a usb stick to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04.

At first hand it depends on your settings.\nStart software-properties-gtk and select the Updates tab. At the bottom you find the label \"Notify me of a new Ubuntu version\", and that's the one. If you have the \"For long-term support versions\" selected, you will be notified only after the 14.04.1 release.

The kernel is the key underlying component that interfaces between the physical hardware and presents this in a controlled way that desktop software can usefully use and allow the user to control.\nBluetooth dongles are mostly USB based.   Most hardware today are USB2 based or USB3 based.  The kernel uses different modules to interrogate these two versions.\nAssuming you are using USB3 to connect, there may be an underlying issue with the USB3 kernel module called XHCI.\nso what can I do...\nYou should really test the latest kernels (at the time of writing 3.16 series) - but if you want continued support you need to work with the Canonical kernel developers to identify a solution.  Raise a bug-report - include details of the bug report that you've installed the latest kernels and they did/didnt work etc.\nAs a workaround, many BIOS's have the ability to downgrade USB3 ports - downgrade them to USB2 speeds.  This is called \"XHCI PRE-BOOT MODE\"\nIf you disable this mode, this should force the kernel to see your bluetooth device as a USB2 based device.\n\nA: Install driver packages and all the necessary packages for bluetooth devices to work:\nsudo apt-get install bluez bluez-alsa bluez-audio bluez-btsco bluez-compat bluez-cups bluez-dbg bluez-gstreamer bluez-hcidump bluez-pcmcia-support bluez-tools bluez-utils python-bluez bluewho indicator-bluetooth libbluetooth-dev libgnome-bluetooth11 libbluetooth3 python-gobject python-dbus\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, it was solved when selected mode (in sound setting) to  High Fidelity Playback(A2DPslink)\n\nA: For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:\n1) Go to the bluetooth icon, typically top right of your screen\n2) Set Up New Device...\n3) Device type: Headphones... other audio devices.\nThat should make the speakers visible.\nSelect, continue & enjoy.\n", "Q: is there any way to put notes on pdf in evince?

There you can just press Ctrl+A to add an annotation.\n\nA: EDIT:\nOn newer versions of Evince (a.k.a Document Viewer) you can edit annotations by pressing the pencil button on top left of the app window (tested on Evince 3.30.2).\nORIGINAL:\nOn the left sidebar, where Thumbnails is usually shown, click on Thumbnails and select Annotations.

There will still be GRUB's first-stage boot loader installed in the disk's MBR, but if it's not causing problems for you, it's safer to leave that alone.\nWith that done, you can try again.

I have a bunch of 16gb normal speed sdhc cards, so if I use them I'm not worried about them getting damaged, but I was wondering: is swap on a 7200rpm 320 gb hard drive that is also the drive ubuntu is installed on better or worse than an sd card with the only use as swap?\n\nA: If you're unconcerned with damage to your SD cards then it really depends purely on speed. Your 7200rpm internally is likely slower than your SD card's internal read/write speed, but actually getting data to drive will likely be the biggest bottleneck. Unless your SD card reader is very new, the 7200rpm HDD connected with a SATA should be significantly faster.\nYour SD card is unlikely to have a decent microcontroller to address spent/damaged memory very efficiently (how SSD's address increased memory failures), so you'll more than likely not notice any failure until you get a catastrophic failure for the SD card.\nIf you're using anything \"mission critical\" on this system, then you should definitely not be going with the SD cards.\n\nA: The SD cards will perform significantly worse for swap and it may reduce their lifetime.\n\n\n*\n\n*Flash media is asynchronous in its access speed.  Performing many separate read actions is very fast, faster than usual on a hard drive.  However, performing many separate small write actions is very slow, often an order of magnitude slower than on a hard drive.\nWhen you swap to disk, your workload will consist of many small write operations - the worst performing workload for it.\n(In case you're wondering, modern SSDs get around this issue with very sophisticated firmware trickery, which simpler Flash drives like SD cards don't have).\n\n*Flash media has a limited number of write cycles.  This limit is high enough that normal consumers don't need to worry about it - it'll usually be in the tens of thousands of writes.  However, if you are swapping then it will increase the wear on the drive quite a lot.  Probably not enough to observe any problems over a short timespan.\n\nA: While you can use an SD card for swap (Raspberry Pi does this, for example) it is not ideal. Use your hard drive, as it much faster than an SD card. Also, an SD card will eventually wear out from heavy usage due to the limited number of writes.\n\nA: Based on my comment here\nThe first thing to consider is the use case for the swap drive. \nIs this swap drive going to be used often because the system has less memory and is used for running many different applications simultaneously? \nIf yes, then it's definitely better to go with a swap on the main drive, since many writes to the SD will degrade performance, and in cases where the system wrote a swap page to a corrupted SD, the system will crash and need to be restarted with a new SD. \nIf no, then you need to consider the speed of the SD card controller (and also the speed the SD card itself supports i.e. the class of the SD card). For this case, @thomasrutter's answer is what you should follow. \nThe second case to consider (I'm adding this, which is not a part of the OPs question but is relevant with today's laptops) is whether the main drive is a SSD drive or a rotational drive. \nFor SSD drives, I'd always recommend using an SD card for swap (or no swap at all) because the SSDs are still very expensive, and it's financially sound advice (to degrade the SD which is cheap instead of the SSD, which is many times more expensive). \nFinally, let's consider the case for a machine with a large enough RAM and an SSD drive. For these machines (laptops/desktops) the main memory would be sufficient for almost all work loads. Therefore, I'd recommend tuning the swapiness to 0. (the swap would only be used for cases where to main memory is fully used up, or for enabling hybrid suspend/hibernate). For these systems, I'd definitely recommend a swapiness of 0 with a SD card as the swap drive. The reason is that each time you suspend, a number of writes are made to the swap, and degrading an SD card is way cheaper than degrading an SSD drive. \n", "Q: Making master pdf editor default for .pdf files I have followed the answer posted by Moderator Mitch user 59676 and created mpe.desktop file, right clicked on the file and 'open with other application' - 'show other applications' did not list master PDF editor so unable to make as default.\n\nA: Add %f at last  in Exec of Desktop file (and put it in /usr/share/applications).

Should I set them myself in apache2.conf like this?\n<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>\n    StartServers 2\n    MinSpareServers 2\n    MaxSpareServers 5\n    MaxClients 200 #must be customized\n    ServerLimit 200 #must be customized\n    MaxRequestsPerChild 100\n</IfModule>\n\n\nA: Have you looked for these settings within /etc/apache2/conf.d/?  It's likely that these settings are kept in separate included files to aid with packaging.\n\nShould I set them myself in apache2.conf like this?\n<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>\n    StartServers 2\n    MinSpareServers 2\n    MaxSpareServers 5\n    MaxClients 200 #must be customized\n    ServerLimit 200 #must be customized\n    MaxRequestsPerChild 100\n</IfModule>\n\n\nYes, you can place them in apache2.conf (though do look for them in other files in conf.d/ as mentioned above).\nYour MaxRequestsPerChild seems very low - this can be in the thousands.\nIf you are running mod_php your MaxClients should be lowered significantly, unless you have many gigs of RAM.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14 organizes all the module-specific configs in separate files under /etc/apache2/mods-available/, so the MPM prefork stuff is now located in /etc/apache2/mods-available/mpm_prefork.conf\n", "Q: install Window 7 after Ubuntu 14 Can I install Window7 on an existing Ubuntu 14 laptop by shrinking the Ubuntu 14 partition, installing Windows 7 into the created freespace, and running Boot Repair to get the Grub boot menu with both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.\nHere is the layout of my partitions as shown by GParted:\nPartition     FileSystem   Size           Flags\n/dev/sda1   Fat32          512.00 Mig      boot \n/dev/sda2   ext4           224.42 Gig\n/dev/sda3   linux-swap       7.97 Gig\n\nDoes this still look ok in terms of installing Windows after shrinking /dev/sda2?\n\nA: Not recommended, as Windows likes to delete everything already existing on the drive.

Note: The legacy Skype for Linux application (v4.*) is now discontinued and was removed from Canonical’s partner repositories, so this question and its answers are obsolete. Please refer to a newer answer of our canonical Skype installation question.\nSkype 4.3 is just released with considerable improvements. As a regular Skype user I want to use the latest Skype on my Ubuntu 14.04, but there is no updates from Update Manager. Even in Skype website only Skype 4.3 is available only for Ubuntu 12.04. Is there anyway to use this latest Skype on Ubuntu 14.04 or how much we have to wait for the update?\n\nA: Install From Ubuntu Software Center\nAs of August 2, 2014, you can now install Skype 4.3 directly from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nTo do this, you must first enable the Canonical Partner Repository, using the following steps (based on steps provided by OMG! Ubuntu; see source):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Search for and open ‘Software Sources’ or 'Software & Updates' in the Unity Dash\n  \n*Select the ‘Other Software’ tab\n  \n*Check/tick the boxes next to the two entries headed ‘Canonical Partners’ \n  \n*Exit, and hit ‘Ok’ on the software reload prompt\n  \n\nThen search for Skype in the Ubuntu Software Center and install it as you would any other software.\n(Source)\nInstall From Skype's Website\nYou can download the latest version of Skype as a .deb package directly from its website. Choose the 12.04 (multiarch) version if you're running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or newer; it'll still work if you're on i.e. 14.04 LTS, because that's just what Microsoft lists as the minimum Ubuntu version.\nOnce you have it, run the following commands to ensure your system is clear of any previous installations:\nsudo apt-get remove skype skype-bin:i386 skype:i386\n\nThen double-click on the downloaded .deb file to open it in the Ubuntu Software Center and install it like any other software.\nAfterwards, also run the following command in the terminal to ensure that support for the indicator menu is available:\nsudo apt-get install sni-qt:i386\n\nNow you can find Skype in the dash, run it and enjoy it!\n(Source: WebUpd8)\n\nA: Step 1: Remove previous version.\nsudo apt-get remove skype skype-bin:i386 skype:i386\nsudo apt-get install sni-qt:i386\n\nIt is Important if you installed older version of Skype on your Ubuntu, Clear the old Skype folder before installing latest version. Then clear that by using:\nrm -rf ~/.Skype\n\nStep 2: Preparing to Installing Skype.\n\n\n*\n\n*Users of 64-bit Ubuntu, should enable MultiArch if it isn't already enabled by running the command\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n\n*Update repositories and \"updates\" list:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Optional, install GDebi (see below):\nsudo apt-get install gdebi #(read Why you need to install gdebi...)\n\nStep 3: Installing Skype\nMethod 1: Download and install from file\nwget download.skype.com/linux/skype-ubuntu-precise_4.3.0.37-1_i386.deb\nsudo gdebi skype-ubuntu-precise_4.3.0.37-1_i386.deb\n\nMethod 2: Install Skype from Canonical Partner Repository\nSo add the Canonical Partner Repository to \"updates\" list by following the command:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner\"\n\nThen install Skype via the Software-Center or via the Terminal.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install skype\n\nsource\n\nWhy you need to install gdebi instead of using dpkg or Ubuntu software center.\ndpkg (for Debian package) is a software tool from the command line is responsible for installing, creating, deleting, and managing Debian (packets deb), the type of packets processed by Ubuntu. It also allows the Debian package management from sources outside the apt repositories.\nTo install packages, dpkg has a graphical interface, gdebi , you can use if you prefer to avoid the command line.\ngdebi is an application installation and management of Debian (.deb) packages. This is a utility that works both in graphic mode console and allow the installation of packages outside of APT deposits : from a website, CD-ROM, portable media, etc. \nIt has the same functionality as apt-get or Ubuntu Software Center : it ensures that the package to be installed is compatible with the version and architecture of the Ubuntu system in which you try to install it, and also ensures that all dependencies required by the package are satisfied. Otherwise, the dependencies are downloaded from the Internet. Using tabs, gdebi also provides access to important information such as folder paths in which to install the various files from .deb package.\nFinally gdebi is a lightweight deb packages installer which was the default in Ubuntu Desktop. Now Ubuntu uses Ubuntu Software Center which is slow and sometimes you get The package is of bad quality error.\n\nRead more about GDebi:\nTo install a package you have downloaded from a website, rather than from a software repository. These packages are called .deb files. Because they may have been created for a different Linux distribution, you might find that there's dependency issues with Ubuntu, meaning that they may be uninstallable.\ngdebi is a simple tool to install .deb files. It has a graphical user interface but can also be used in your terminal. It lets you install local deb packages resolving and installing its dependencies.. It automatically checks packages for their dependencies and will try to download them from the Ubuntu software repositories if possible. You may first need to install gdebi - simply install the gdebi package using one of the package managers like dkpg, Synaptic or open a Terminal and type sudo apt-get install gdebi.\nOnce you have installed gdebi, use the File Browser to find the package you want to install.\nDouble-click the package to open it with gdebi. If all dependencies have been met for the selected package, simply click the Install package button to install it. gdebi will warn you if there are unmet dependencies, which means that there's dependencies that aren't resolved in the repositories that you're using.\n", "Q: DHCP3-server not working correctly I installed dhcpe-server with apt-get install dhcp3-server, and I want to configure it on terminal.

I can startup Chrome, but sometimes I want to use Firefox without addons, without having to shutdown the normal installation to restart without addons, then restart with addons again, and then having to login to gmail, lastpass etc. \n\nA: I suppose you can solve your issue by creating a new Firefox profile. This new profile won't include the add-ons or history or bookmarks from your other firefox profile(s). So here is how to create a new profile:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all your Firefox windows.\n\n*Now open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+t and type:\nfirefox -p\nThis would open the firefox profile manager.\n\n\n\n 3.

The new Software Centre tends to get broken anyway, so if you can I'd reccomend using the older version or even a package manager instead.\n\nA: No, there is not currently a way to do it more cleanly than that - unless you write some solution up yourself. \nNow, if you wanted to do that, likely what you'd want to do is have some scripts like: \n#!/bin/bash\n# sets a dark theme\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme \"Some-Dark-Theme\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme \"Numix-Circle\"\ncp ~/.path/to/some/dir/softwarecenter-dark.css /usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css/softwarecenter.css\n\nAnd of course, you could have another script do the same thing in reverse - or even just have the script only be concerned with toggling the softwarecenter.css\n\nA: As far as I know there isn't really a fix for this yet it's not just the software center it's a couple other applications as well but if you want a software center that works with themes use the lubuntu-software-center it's also more stable \n", "Q: MAAS JUJU cloud-init-nonet waiting for network device I have a node that has successfully been commissioned into a MAAS pool, i.e., got Declared->Commissioned->Ready.

The default source is the charm store. The above command is the same as running:\njuju deploy cs:trusty/mongodb\n\nSince you are running on a trusty host, juju defaults to looking for a trusty version of the charm.

Wipe the drive if desired.\na) If you have data on the drive that you need to keep, back it up.\n\nb) Fill the drive with zeros which will blow away the MBR and all data by:\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX \n**or** if you want a progress report as you wipe the drive use\n\nsudo dc3dd wipe=/dev/sdX in both cases sdX should be changed to sda, sdb, or whatever drive you are wiping. \n\nIf you are not certain, you can identify the drives using fdisk -l\nsource: Remove lvm to install Ubuntu\nStep 2) Partition the drive.

I won't be discussing partition table types here as that's beyond the scope of this answer.\nFrom  the menu choose device and then create partition table.\n\nClick apply - Gparted will apply the change and rescan the disks\nd) format with a filesystem of your choice. I will use ext2 in this example. choose the filesystem that you prefer. ext4 is my preferred filesystem.\nRight click on the unallocated line and select new, adjust settings if necessary here then click add.\n \nStep 3) Format the drive (put a file system on it) I used ext2 (the default)\n\nClick the green check mark to apply the format. You will be warned. Click apply\n\nWhen the process is complete you'll get the below. you can expand details as needed then click close.\n\nsource: experience - full manual is here: http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual\nStep 4) Mount the drive: Where you mount it is where the space will be. I will mount to the empty directory at /srv using old-school methods. You can use blkid as covered elsewhere on the site if you so choose.\nIn the image below you can see that I ran fdisk -l to insure I had the right drive designation prior to running the mount command `sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /srv\n\nStep 5) Set permissions at the mount point properly so that the appropriate users/groups can use the drive - currently only the owner root has full access.\nsudo chmod -R 777 /srv will give full read/write/execute access to the drive for everyone. Restrict as you see fit. for more information on permissions see the chmod man page.\nsource: experience, man chmod\nYou can also change ownership on the drive with chown if desired. See the man page for chown by running man chown in a terminal. If you wish to have the drive mounted every time you boot, you'll need to edit fstab (some would call this a permanent mounting). Editing fstab has been covered in great detail both here and elsewhere on the site. for an example issue the command cat /etc/fstab which will show you the current list of drives and with what options they are mounted at boot. cat /etc/mtab will show you all current mounts. \n\nA: To simply use the drive as an extra storage space\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the storage device however you need to. Open a terminal (default CtrlAltT) and type sudo fdisk -l to figure out the name of the drive. Probably sdb but this depends on your setup. In this case I'll use sdb but you should adjust accordingly. Note this assumes an unused or wiped storage device with no existing partitioning scheme and no critical data stored on it. If you have data on the device you need to access you should be looking for mounting instructions instead and move on.\n\n*Open gparted and make sure you select that drive from the dropdown in the upper-right.\n\n*Select Device->create partition table. \n\n*Create one large partition and format it to ext4. Give it a label of \"data\" or something. note the name of the partition, probably sdb1\n\n*Use sudo blkid /dev/sdb1 to get the UUID of the partition. Take note of this UUID, as you'll need it later.\n\n*Create a directory that will be the mount point for the drive sudo mkdir /media/bigdata should work.\n\n*Add a line to /etc/fstab by using (sudo nano /etc/fstab) to automatically mount the partition on boot:\nUUID=<the drives uuid>  /media/bigdata    ext4   defaults 0 2\n\n\n*Run sudo mount /media/bigdata or reboot.\nAnd you're done.\n\nA: You mentioned that you wanted to delete Windows XP so this example will completely delete and format the new spare hard disk (backup and save any data you do not want to delete). \nOpen \"gparted\" or run the command sudo gparted in an open terminal.\nLook for the newly added storage drive, right click on it, select format to > ext4, click the icon to apply the changes and select to accept the changes before closing gparted. This will delete and reformat the drive to ext4.\nNow, backup fstab with this command:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstabcopy\n\nEdit fstab:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nRemove or delete all the stuff YOU wrote to /etc/fstab and do NOT delete the original entries from your installation. When you are done, use CTRL + o to write the changes, press ENTER to accept the changes and use CTRL + x to exit the file.  \nNow, run:\nsudo blkid\n\nHere is an example output:\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"e7444e4d-f844-4724-b17b-a4449244481j\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"5444cdcf-4443-40b9-af38-1444cd4448da\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"99444f5c-7444-4ee7-b550-79bd2444b0fw\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sdb1: UUID=\"1579e689-3965-47db-83a7-665cceeb6aff\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nYou can see in this example, the lone only single partition with no swap space is listed as /dev/sdb1. I will use the UUID in the example below.\nRun: \nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nand enter the following line using the proper UUID that was listed when you used the blkid command earlier. Here is the example line you need in fstab:\nUUID=1579e689-3965-47db-83a7-665cceeb6aff /media          ext4    defaults 0       1\n\nWhen you are done, use CTRL + o to write the changes the file, press ENTER to accept the changes and use CTRL + x to exit the file. Save any other unsaved work and reboot the computer.\nYou do not need to mount the drive after you reboot.\nAfter you reboot the drive will no longer show as a seperate device in Thunar.\nTo access the storage drive after you reboot, open Thunar and go to the file /media, this is where the drive is now mounted.\nTo mount the drive in a seperate folder, edit the fstab entry to read /media/storage instead of /media (or name it /media/awesomefilename . . . whatever you want).\n\nA: besides the mentioned,  since you said xubuntu, I'm assuming you run a desktop operating system.\nUubuntu (plain) by itself for desktop tasks doesn't grow that much, and usually 10GB for / is enough for day to day usage. However, your /home/ folder might start getting bigger in time, if you go online, save data, modify data, run programs, etc..\nIf you are like me, and save documents in you /home//Documents-music-etc.. then a good idea would be to move the /home folder to a bigger partition/hard drive.\nIn linux you can literally mount chuncks of the system on different devices and it will work.\nThus in recovery mode you could do the following:\ninstall rsync and format the new hard drive as an ext4 chunk.\nmount it in a temporary location and rsync the data from the old to    the new one.\nmkdir /tmp/tmp_home\nmount /dev/newpart /tmp/tmp_home\nrysnc -avpr --delete --sparse --progress /home/* /tmp/tmp_home/\n\nchange your fstab to mount the new partition as /home\nUUD=<new partition> /home <type> defaults   0 2\n\nreboot into normal mode and check if things are working once you synced the data on the new drive.\nreboot back into recovery mode and delete the data from the old drive, once you made sure your new home works.\nmake sure you don't nuke your home directory on the new partition..\numount /home ; rm -rf /home/*\n\nnow you would have old space - sizeof(/home) occupied on the original drive, and all your data in that directory on the new drive with both drives as a dependency.\nThis is safer and is somehow a just a bunch of disks setup than using them in pools/raid0 format. In this case if one drive fails.. you still have the other.\n\nA: Though the above will work, I'd do this as I am lazy (slash then rebuild).\nUse Gparted to view the drive through the GUI. find and clean/delete the drive partitions, add a new primary partition. this will effectively reset the permissions on the drive partitions as they will be destroyed too.\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nalso when on the root of the partition you cannot copy files to, you can do a chmod:\nsudo chmod -R 777 /whereeveryourdrivenameis\n\nyou can check gparted for the location of the drive you'll like to process.\n\nA: Open a root session of nautilus or your file manager, go to the drive after using gparted to wipe it, right click in the root of the drive and go over to the permissions tab. Go to advances or your manager's equivalent and set the group to \"users\" and owner to your user name, make permissions for the owner and group (if you like) full access with permissions to both create and delete folders and files.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit Laptop cannot remain powered off.

I can ONLY turn off the computer by pressing and holding the power button. \nUPDATE OF PROBLEM: The unintended reboot only occurs when the laptop is plugged in, i.e. not on batter power.\nThe problem occurs when using the shutdown button on the upper right of the screen OR when I try command line options such as:\nsudo shutdown now -P\n\nor\nsudo init 0\n\nI have tried to solve it with the following:\nsudo apt-get install laptop-mode-tools\n\nbut to no avail. I also tried booting from a live-cd into Ubuntu 13.04, then attempting the shutdown, again without success. \n\nA: I had the same issue with a brand new Lenovo Flex 2 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. After a lot of trial and error (online research, Lubuntu 14.10 live CD, installed Windows 7, updated BIOS) I fixed it by disabling xHCI on the BIOS. Hope it works for you, otherwise you might want to try unloading the xhci module BEFORE shutting down the laptop.\n", "Q: Installing Tizen SDK on another partition in Ubuntu 12.04 I'm a newbie with Ubuntu & I'm trying to install tizen SDK but my boot partition is full, as I'm using Ubuntu alongside Windows 7, but I do have another partition that have enough space to run the tizen sdk, but I don’t know how to install it, is it possible to install it?\n\nA: You can download it from the webpage https://developer.tizen.org/downloads/tizen-sdk but you have to download sdk manager and sdk image for your system. Then after dawnloading, open the terminal and write commands as below. First go to your folder where you downloaded it, for example if u downloaded it in the downoads folder type in terminal: 'cd Downloads' and then type 'chmod +x tizen-sdk-Your version-ubuntu.bin' but now the version i used to download is 'tizen-sdk-ubuntu32-v2.2.71.bin'. After u did that type again './tizen-sdk--ubuntu.bin', for mine it was './tizen-sdk--ubuntu.bin'. Then its a window that u will see. click advanced and put your sdk image over there and then keep going until its finished....Hope it works\n", "Q: What is UNIX and what is the relation of it with Linux When I hear linux I always hear UNIX, Solaris and GNU and frankly I don't understand any word of this only Linux, so could some one explain to me what is each one?\n\nA: The complete answer, about difference between this:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux = Kernel\n\n*GNU = It's a project about Software Libre\n\n*Solaris = OS like Unix\n\n\n:)\n\nA: There is also a somewhat more detailed poster, I vaguely remember, but for a quick summary, that should be enough:\n\n\nImage from Wikimedia commons: Unix history-simple\n(For the details (all), see GNU/Linux Distribution Timeline 12.10)\n", "Q: Set GRUB2 to boot from a .vmdk file So, basically I have installed Windows 7 in a Virtual Machine, and I want to boot the Virtual Machine's hard drive up on my PC, my grub2 and 40_config files can be found by clicking those hyperlinks.\n\nA: This is primarily a VMWare question?

I am a new Ubuntu 14.04 user (having moved from Windows XP at the advice of a friend), and I'm loving it!  I like Unity a lot, but one thing that I dearly miss is the Windows Start Menu's folder-like structure to categorize applications in folders (e.g. Games, Internet, Graphics, etc.).  I found and installed XFCE, and I installed the Whisker launcher, and I really like that a lot because they had a similar folder/menu structure of the Windows Start Menu, but Unity works very well on my machine and has obvious advantages over XFCE / Whisker.  I'm wondering, is there some kind of application that I can use in Unity to simulate the Start Menu like functionality of XFCE/Whisker?  For example, is there an application which I can dock in Launcher that LOOKS like the XFCE/Whisher launcher?

The fact that it's not working suggests you've got a flaky firmware. Therefore, I recommend you check your manufacturer for a firmware (they'll call it a \"BIOS\") update. If one is available, install it and try again.\nIf that doesn't work, try opening an Administrator command prompt in Windows and type the following:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nThis might get it working properly, but I can't make any promises about that.\nIf this fails, and if the computer is new enough, I recommend you return it to the store for a refund, since at this point the conclusion is that the firmware is so badly broken that the machine isn't fit for use, you shouldn't accept it, and the manufacturer has to be made forcefully aware of the problem.\nIf that's not an option, there are uglier workarounds, such as the backup-and-rename-files option on the Advanced tab of Boot Repair.

What am i missing can someone elaborate? \n\nA: TL;DR\nApache does appear in your netstatoutput, and it is running. That's why your wget call works. However, it's bound to your IPv6 address instead of your IPv4 one. Address mapping handles the translation when necessary.\nGoing for the docs\nThere's obviously some IPv6-IPv4 fallback mechanism here. As a matter of fact, I don't use IPv6 on my local network, yet :\n$ netstat -tunla | grep LISTEN | grep 80\ntcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN\n\nIt is important to note that no matter how you address your machine, it's still the same service and port in the end. The rest is mainly up to your browser and DNS resolution services. However, for more information on how Apache handles this, you may want to have a look at their documentation :\n\nOne complicating factor for Apache administrators is whether or not an IPv6 socket can handle both IPv4 connections and IPv6 connections. Handling IPv4 connections with an IPv6 socket uses IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, which are allowed by default on most platforms, but are disallowed by default on FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, in order to match the system-wide policy on those platforms. On systems where it is disallowed by default, a special configure parameter can change this behavior for Apache.\n\nBasically, this is about handling both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets in way that will avoid most problems related to cross-platform compatibility and socket handling. As you can read, on Linux platforms like Ubuntu, this problem is solved using IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. The documentation also states :\n\nIf you want Apache to handle IPv4 connections only, regardless of what your platform and APR will support, specify an IPv4 address on all Listen directives.\n\nWhich would give something like this in the ports.conf file :\nListen 0.0.0.0:80 # Or...\nListen 127.0.0.1:80 # Or...\nListen 192.0.2.1:80\n\nResulting in one of the following netstat outputs...\n$ netstat -tunla | grep LISTEN | grep 80\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN \n$ netstat -tunla | grep LISTEN | grep 80\ntcp        0      127.0.0.1:80              127.0.0.1:80            LISTEN\n$ netstat -tunla | grep LISTEN | grep 80\ntcp        0      192.0.2.1:80              192.0.2.1:80            LISTEN \n\nA beautiful, yet IPv6-not-ready, listener. The above setting is usually set in /etc/apache2/ports.conf (or directly in apache2.conf for older versions). The default value is Listen 80, which performs an automatic binding, i.e. conforming to the IPv6 specifications given in the documentation.\n", "Q: Can't find my app in a dash, something is wrong with .desktop file?

The inner read command is reading a line from find's output, not from stdin.\nYou can restructure like this: send the find output to the while loop on a different file descriptor. This leaves stdin free for the inner read.\nwhile IFS= read -u3 -r -d '' FILE; do\n    if [ \"$FILE\" != \".\" -o \"$FILE\" != \"..\" ]; then\n        OUTPUT=$($FILE $STATUS)\n        case \"$OUTPUT\" in\n            *disabled* )\n                read -p \"Do you wish to start $FILE ?\" yn\n                case $yn in\n                    [yY] | [yY][Ee][Ss] ) $FILE start ;;\n                    [nN] | [nN][Oo] ) ;;\n                    * ) echo \"Please answer yes or no.\";;\n                esac\n                ;;\n            * ) echo \"App $FILE is running\" ;;\n        esac\n    fi\ndone  3< <(find /etc/init.d/* -name '*' -print0)\n\nThis uses a process substitution, instead of a pipe, to read from find\n\nA: The context this time provides the answer. You are piping the output of find into the entire while loop, and that includes your inner read as well... meaning, your \"read yn\" will also read from the very same output that \"find\" provides, as opposed to from your keyboard.\nI also dislike your general handling of looping over files. A simple:\nfor file in /etc/init.d/*; do\n   echo Processing $file\ndone\n\nusually works well nowadays, even for larger amounts of files.\nIf you really must use find, you could perhaps wrap your handler inside another script, and call it for each file with:\nfind /etc/init.d -type f -perm +111 -exec myhandlerscript.sh {} \\;\n\nThis will find all files with executable permissions, and call myhandlerscript.sh for each one with the name as argument. Inside the script, the file name will appear inside the $1 special variable.\nIf it really must be in the same file, wrap the code inside a function, export it with \"export -f myfunction\", and use \"-exec bash -c 'myfunction \"$0\"' {} \\;\" as a parameter to find.\n\nA: Your usage of the \"read\" command doesn't seem to be quite right.\nread -p \"Do you wish to input data ?\" yn\n\nThe -p switch expects a string right next to it, which will be used as the Prompt. Thus it thought that \"yn\" was something to display, rather than the variable to store the answer in.\n", "Q: Packages are not installling on ubuntu 12.04 I tried to install imagemagick using following command\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick --fix-missing\n\nBut while installing I get following error\nnginx-full : Depends: nginx-common (= 1.4.7-1+precise0) but 1.6.0-1+precise0 is to be installed\nE: Unmet dependencies.

That is how redirection works. As a workaround, try this:\nscript -c 'cat /dev/urandom|hexdump|grep -i \"ffff f\"' -f random\n\nThis will basically write all screen output to the file.\n\nA: cat /dev/urandom|hexdump or hexdump /dev/urandom writes continuously to the stdout and if you press Ctrl+C nothing will be executed after this. But you can limit the output with head\nhexdump /dev/urandom | head -n1000000 | grep \"ffff f\" > random  \n\nthis will grep in the first 1000000 lines of the output and writes the result to a file.\n\nA: Use the --line-buffered option for grep (and also get rid of the useless cat):\nhexdump /dev/urandom | grep --line-buffered -i \"ffff f\" > random\n\nThis way the output is not buffered but every line put into random immediately. I would also recommend to use tee in your pipe to see how many lines have been produced:\nhexdump /dev/urandom | grep --line-buffered -i \"ffff f\" | tee random\n\n\nA: You will need to write the output of cat /dev/urandom | hexdump to a file before you execute it the next time. The script below should accomplish what you are trying:\ncat /dev/urandom | hexdump |\n  while IFS= read -r line; do\n    printf '%s\\n' \"$line\" >> random;\n  done\n\nIFS is used to split the output into lines here.\n\n(Source)\n", "Q: Making a live CD of my ubuntu install i want to make a CD of current ubuntu install.

However, occasionally I need to write German umlauts as well (ß,ä, ü, ö). There is the compose-key sequence that I just used to type the sample umlauts, which works, but I find it rather inconvenient. Is there a way to configure for Apple-stype umlaut generation (on my mac: OPTION+u, release, then the character you want as umlaut, e.g. OPTION+u, release, a --> ä)? I find this more convenient. Of course I could just add a German keyboard layout to switch to, but that I would also find rather inconvenient.\nI gooled extensively, and I found some pointers on how to make this work in general, but none those methods seem to work with ibus.\nAny ideas?\nThanks a bunch!\nJan\n\nA: Well, all you need is to edit the keyboard layout and add a dead key for AltGr+U. Let’s start:\nWell, if you use US keyboard layout you need two additional things: right-alt and the dead key.\nLet's do this in steps: \n1. Backup the current layout:\nFirst of all, make a backup from the US layout, so open a terminal and type:\ncd /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols\nsudo cp us us.bkp\n2. Open the layout file for editing: \nEnter in the same terminal:\nsudo gedit us\nYou can see lines like this:\ndefault\npartial alphanumeric_keys modifier_keys \nxkb_symbols \"basic\" {\n\nname[Group1]= \"USA\";\n\n// Alphanumeric section\nkey <TLDE> {    [     grave,    asciitilde  ]   };\n…\n\nNow you can make changes in the basic block which begins on the 3rd line here.\n3. Enable right-alt or AltGr:\nAdd the line include \"level3(ralt_switch)\" which makes something like this:\n    xkb_symbols \"basic\" {\n\n    include \"level3(ralt_switch)\"\n\n    name[Group1]= \"USA\";\n\n4. Add the dead-key: \nFind the following line:\n    key <AD07> {    [     u,    U       ]   };\n\nand change it to something like this:\n    key <AD07> {    [     u,    U,     dead_diaeresis       ]   };\n\n(be careful about the *comma* after the capital U).\n\nNow your layout is ready.\n5. Save and close the file.\n6. Make changes take effect:\nReturn to the terminal and run the following command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data\n7. Log out!\nOr if you have more than one layouts, just change the layout once.\n\nAlternatively\nyou may want to insert additional characters just with a single right-alt hit, i.e. AltGr+U for Ü, AltGr+A for Ä, AltGr+O for Ö, and AltGr+S for ß. In this case, instead of adding the dead-key (step 4) you should:\n4. Add characters to the 3rd level:\nAdd all characters one by one, like this:\nkey <AD07> {    [     u,    U,     udiaeresis,     Udiaeresis       ]   };\nkey <AD08> {    [     i,    I       ]   };\nkey <AD09> {    [     o,    O,     odiaeresis,     Odiaeresis       ]   };\n…\nkey <AC01> {    [     a,    A,     adiaeresis,     Adiaeresis       ]   };\nkey <AC02> {    [     s,    S,     ssharp       ]   };\n\nAgain, be careful about commas and the capitals – they are necessary.\nAll the rest is the same.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 16.04, you can achieve this simply by switching to the \"English (Macintosh)\" layout in the settings panel:\n\n\n", "Q: Installed 14.04 Ubuntu desktop ..want to upgrade kernel Whenever I boot into this OS, Im encountering lot of bugs which are making the system unstable and stop functioning.

As is, the user will have to manually enter /path/to/directory/ via the command-line.\nInstead, I want to prompt the user to enter the paths through a GUI interface.\nSomething like this:\n\n\nWhat commands can I use to prompt the user with a GUI selection window that returns the file path to the command-line?\n\nA: I know this is 8 months old and also that the OP's question has been answered. However, yad has been mentioned but no example has been offered. Here's my solution using yad.\nDIR=\"/home\" \\\ni=0;for location in source destination\ndo\n((i++));selection[$i]=$(yad --center \\\n--width 350 \\\n--form \\\n--title=\"yad example\" \\\n--text=\"Select $location directory\" \\\n--field=:LBL \"\" \\\n--field=Path:DIR \"$DIR\" \\\n--separator='' )\ndone;\\\necho \"Command to run is \\\"rsync -av --delete ${selection[1]} ${selection[2]}\\\"\"\n\nThe way it works is like this. We put yad in a for loop, setting the variable $location to source for the first pass and destination for the second. The output is placed in the array selection[] for which the variable i is used as the index. This is set to 0 at the start and incremented with each pass. Hence the source is saved as  ${selection[1]} and the destination ${selection[2]}.\nThe DIR=\"/home\" on the first line sets the dialog default.

How can I do that?\n\nA: What about minimizing your window after creating it?\n$ (mate-terminal --window-with-profile=Background --title=xxx  --command top >/dev/null 2>&1 &); sleep 0.1; xdotool windowminimize $(xdotool search --name xxx|head -1)\n\nI use Mate instead of Gnome but it should work just the same if you replace mate-terminal with gnome-terminal:\n$ (gnome-terminal --window-with-profile=Background --title=xxx  --command top >/dev/null 2>&1&); sleep 0.1; xdotool windowminimize $(xdotool search --name xxx|head -1)\n\nFirst, i create new window with mate-terminal and I assign name using --title=xxx option. After that I use xdotool search --name xxx|head -1 to find id of this window and I pass it to xdotool windowminimize. sleep 0.1 delay is necessary because window needs a little while to be created.\nInstead of using window title you can also use other search options:\n$ xdotool search Usage: xdotool search [options] regexp_pattern\n--class         check regexp_pattern agains the window class\n--classname     check regexp_pattern agains the window classname\n--maxdepth N    set search depth to N.

Default is all screens\n--desktop N     only search a specific desktop number\n--limit N       break search after N results\n--name          check regexp_pattern agains the window name\n--title         DEPRECATED.

(If you have already installed wmctrl you have to remove it). \nDownload the version from github https://github.com/geekless/wmctrl/archive/master.zip and install it (follow the INSTALL file -> ./configure then sudo make install). If you get error: X11/Xmu/WinUtil.h you have also to install sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev and then try again.\nThen you can run from commandline this for example:\ngnome-terminal -x sh -c \"ls; bash\" & disown && sleep 3 &&  wmctrl -i -Y  $(wmctrl -l | awk -F' ' 'END{print $1}')\n\nExplanation: \n\n\n*\n\n*gnome-terminal -x sh -c \"ls; bash\" & disown run gnome-terminal in background and execute a command (in this case ls)\n\n*sleep 3 wait until the gnome-terminal window appears (you can experiment with this value, 3 seconds could be to short or to long, depends on your hardware)\n\n*wmctrl -i -Y  -i ->  Interpret  window  arguments as a numeric value, -Y -> Iconify (minimize) the window \n\n*$(wmctrl -l | awk -F' ' 'END{print $1}') or $(wmctrl -l | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f1) get the window id of the last opened window (should be the window id of gnome-terminal in this case)\n\n\n\nTo simplify it you can add a function to your $HOME/.bashrc file:\ngterm-min() {\n    gnome-terminal -x sh -c \"$1; bash\" & disown  \n    sleep 3   \n    wmctrl -i -Y  $(wmctrl -l | awk -F' ' 'END{print $1}')\n}\n\nthen you could use it like this:\ngterm-min \"ls -la\"\n\n\nA: I based my solution on some of the answers given for minimising and maximising windows. In this case, though, I wanted to target just this Gnome Terminal (but not other Gnome Terminals), so I gave it a name using --title:\nnohup gnome-terminal --title=\"Tiny Terminal\" --window-with-profile=Background --command \"$argv\" >/dev/null 2>&1&\n\nAnd created a Devil's Pie rule for windows named \"Tiny Terminal\":\n(if\n(is (window_name) \"Tiny Terminal\")\n(begin (minimize) )\n)\n\n(If you prefer, you can use gdevilspie to create this rule in a GUI.)\nThis achieves the original desired affect. However, when I tried it out, I realised that I also wanted the terminal to restore to a maximised state, which is addressed in a separate answer.\n\nA: Here is how I launch \"The Language Tool\" server, without sleep, witout loop:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nLT_WIN_NAME='The Language Tool'\n\nxterm -geometry 126x12+0+0 -T \"${LT_WIN_NAME}\" -e\\\n java -cp languagetool-server.jar org.languagetool.server.HTTPServer --allow-origin \"*\" &\nxdotool windowminimize $(xdotool search --sync --name \"${LT_WIN_NAME}\")\n\n", "Q: Screenshot (CTRL + SHIFT + PrtScn) not in clipboard CTRL + SHIFT + PrtScn has suddenly stopped working.\nI'm still able to select an area, but the image is never copied to the clipboard.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: For me, this problem occurred when I was not starting gnome-settings-daemon. I am using the Awesome window manager and my setup scripts did not start gnome-settings-daemon. For me, just running gnome-settings-daemon & in a terminal fixed it. The better solution was to make my Awesome WM startup scripts start it, which makes it automatic.\nIf you are using the standard Gnome setup (i.e., not using a separate window manager), then this solution probably doesn't apply to you.\n\nA: I had the same issue (v16 with cinnamon) and I solved by adding custom shortcuts to the command @moondboom posted in the comment:\n\nGo to Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom shortcuts > Add custom shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter a name\n\n*Enter the command gnome-screenshot -c -a -e shadow\n\n*Enter the keyboard bindings\n\n", "Q: I broke software updater by making python3 default I tried to make Python 3 the default Python version by running:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 10\n\nThis broke Python 2 programs, so I tried reversing the process and finally I tried:\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python2.7 /usr/bin/python2.7 10\n\nwhich made python2.7 the default Python version but Software Updater doesn't run and running aptdcon in a terminal gives:\nbash: /usr/bin/aptdcon: /usr/bin/python3: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nI tried reinstalling Python 3 but got:\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/python3_3.4.0-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nHow do I revert this mess?\n\nA: I managed to solve the issue myself. The problem was the broken symlink in /usr/bin\nFirst I identified where python3 is. I guessed that the python3 binary would be in a similar folder as python2. So I typed ls -l /usr/bin/python. \nThis gave me /usr/bin/python -> /etc/alternatives/python2.7. \nSince in /etc/alternatives/ there was no python3, I repeated the process \nls -l /etc/alternatives/python2.7 gave \n/etc/alternatives/python2.7 -> /usr/bin/python2.7\nA simple ls /usr/bin/python3.[1-9] listed all the python binaries available. The one I was interested in was python3.4.\nThen I simply created a symlink with sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.4 /usr/bin/python3.\nProblem solved.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 & remote desktop Till now I'm working with ubuntu 12.04 on a standalone pc (no display,mouse,keyboard).\nI installed xrdp and i'm using windows remote desktop connection.\nIt's working fine with juste one adjustment : put that in the .xsession\ngnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d\n\nThis morning I tried installing ubuntu 14.04, xrdp, .xsession adjustment and ... no working anymore.

Can't we just always use the second? Most of the times I see that the pipe is used if multiple commands are chained together. If however, the output is redirected to file, as in echo 'hello' > filename, the output redirection operator is used. What am I missing here?\n\nA: I believe the < > operators are used for reading/writing files whereas the | symbol is used for piping the stdout of one command to another.\ncal | less \n\nlets you view the output of cal in a command called less.\ncal > less\n\nputs the output of cal into a file called less.\n\nA: *\n\n*| are used to send the output of one command as input to the another command which comes next after the pipe symbol.\n$ echo foo | grep -o 'f'\nf\n\n\n*To redirect the output of one command to a file , you may use an output redirection > operator.\n$ echo foo > file1\n\nIt writes foo to file1. You don't need to manually create that file.\n\n*If you want to redirect the output to many files then you have to use tee command.\necho foo | tee file1 file2\n\nIt writes foo to file1 and file2. You don't need to manually create that files. Now the file1 and file2 contains only the string foo.\n\nA: There's a lot of talk about output redirection but I thought this question was about input. I'm going to ignore > and >> because they've nothing to do with input. Instead I'm going to focus on <, <(...) and |:\n\n\n*\n\n*< expects to read from a file into STDIN while,\n\n*<(...) provides a file handle to the STDOUT of a command (... here)\n\n*| pipes STDOUT from one process into the STDIN of the next\n\n\nSo the < isn't directly equivalent to a pipe (it's reading from a file) and the <(...) is reading from the right place, but it's giving a file handle as an output. You need to combine them to offer an equivalent to a pipe.\na | b\n< <(a) b\n\nJust reading that, I hope that full explains why the pipe exists. It's much more readable.\n\nA: The key point to remember is that pipes are inter-process communication device that allows two processes ( and that's what commands really are) to exchange data, while redirection operators are for manipulating where particular process writes. \nIn the video Unix Pipeline, the creator of awk language and one of the original people who worked on AT&T Unix Brian Kernighan explains:\n\nFirst, you don't have to write one big massive program - you've got existing smaller programs that may already do parts of the job...Another is that it's possible that the amount of data you're procesing would not fit if you stored it in a file...because remember, we're back in the days when disks on these things had, if you were lucky, a Megabyte or two of data...So the pipeline never had to instantiate the whole output\n\nAs you can see, within the context which the pipelines were created, they actually were not just communication device, but also save storage space and simplify the development. Sure, we can use output/input redirection for everything (especially nowadays with storage capacity being in the range of Terabytes), however that would be inefficient from the storage point of view, and also processing speed - remember that you're directly feeding output from one command to another with |. Consider something like command1 | grep 'something'. If you write output of command1 first to a file, it will take time to write everything, then let grep go through the whole file. With pipeline and the fact that the output is buffered (meaning that left-side process pauses before right-side process is ready to read again), the output goes directly from one command to the other, saving time.\nIt is worth noting, that for inter-process communication, there's a use case of named pipes, to which you can use > operator to write from one command, and < to let another command read from it, and it's a use case where you do want to have particular destination on filesystem where multiple scripts/commands can write to and agree on that particular destination. But when it's unnecessary, anonymous pipe | is all you really need.\n", "Q: i have installed ubuntu 14.04 but unable to update or install any third party software i have installed ubuntu 14.04 but unable to update or install any third party software.\nEven i am trying to install video codec for video file but not working.\nPlease see below:\nroot@samiul-Inspiron-N5010:/home/samiul# sudo apt-get install libavcodec- extra-53   libavcodec53 ffmpeg\nReading package lists...

So the magical incantation is this:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-vpnc-gnome\n\nThen you can simply add a VPN connection by launching the configuration of Network Manager and importing a .pcf file with the settings. Or by using a drop-down dialog in the settings of Network Manager and adding the required information. Easy as pie...\n\nA: On Ubuntu, you don't need to install the Cisco VPN Client: NetworkManager includes support for Cisco IPSec VPNs. The following steps will walk you through a successful installation and configuration of your VPN client.\n1) Ubuntu ships by default with the plugin for the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), but we need the plugin for the Cisco Compatible VPN (vpnc), that provides easy access to Cisco Concentrator based VPNs. To install the vpnc plugin, open your terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-vpnc\n\n2) Find Network Connections in your Dash, and in the VPN tab select Import to choose your .pcf file, or Add if you want to manually enter your authentication details.\n3) In the configurations, make sure to go to the IPv4 Settings tab, click on Routes and activate the option to use the VPN connection only for resources on its network,\nunless you want all your traffic to be significantly slowed down.\nHope it could help.\n\nA: You will first need to get the vpnc package and install it. Fire up a terminal and enter this command:\nsudo apt-get install vpnc\n\nYou will then need to make a text file with the following information:\nIPSec gateway *gateway.to.use*\nIPSec ID *groupname*\nIPSec secret *passwordforgroup*\nXauth username *myusername*\nXauth password *mypassword*\nDomain \"\"\n\nThis file should have a .conf extension and should be placed under the /etc/vpnc directory e.g. /etc/vpnc/default.conf.\nTo connect if you have default file then no need to provide configuration file name as asked in 1st command, you will need to enter:\nsudo vpnc <conf file name (without extension)>\nsudo vpnc-connect (will automatically use /etc/vpnc/default.conf)\n\nTo disconnect, you will need to enter:\nsudo vpnc-disconnect\n\nYou can find more details under this How-To\n\nA: I have tested and found below code active in ubuntu 16.x in terminals with command line.

Self creating files may waste your time due to typo errors etc.\npcf2vpnc utility in Linux will automatically convert file in Linux conf format. Yu replace it with /etc/vpnc/default.conf\nand just enter below command without config files\nlike so:\nsudo vpnc --enable-1des\n\nOr without des if your Cisco system supports it:\nsudo vpnc\n\nThis command will get default file from /etc/vpnc folder as described above. \nsudo apt-get install vpnc\n\nInstalling VPN PCF files on Ubuntu \nThis will convert a pcf to a vpnc configuration:\n pcf2vpnc original.pcf new.conf\n\nAccess Cisco VPN\nInstructions for VPN connection or How to Connect VPN from linux box:\nsudo vpnc --enable-1des /etc/vpnc/new.conf\nsudo vpnc /path/to/new.conf\n\nHow to disconnect:\nsudo vpnc--disconnect\n\nAll commands are tested and verified from system.\n\nA: Note that the network-manager-vpnc may not work, but the procedure described here by seedkhan, using just vpnc may work ! This suggests that there may be a bug in network-manager-vpnc ! More on that is here and some evidence also here. \n", "Q: How can I download Ubuntu packages and take them home for installing?

Most (if not all) providers of Ubuntu software will provide the .deb packages somewhere on their site, it's just not always easy to find.  \nBe sure to download the right .deb for your system, x86 for 32 bit and x64 for 64 bit.  \n\nA: It depends on the software you want to install, can you give an example?\nFor a lot of software there are .deb packages avalible.\nDownload them and install them at home with: sudo dpkg --install *.deb\n\nA: Downloading and installing offline packages is a tedious task on ubuntu.\nBut if you have no other options here is what you do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/\n\n*Go to \"Search Package Directories\" -> Type the name of your package(software) -> Select you Ubuntu version -> click search.\nIf your package matches in multiple search results you will be redirected to a page to select from a list of search results.

Download the package by clicking on the architecture of your Ubuntu version( 32bit ie i386 else 64bit ie amd64).\n\n*Now install by double-clicking the .deb file. \n\n*If you are lucky enough(very rarely) you will get your software installed. Otherwise the installation will fail by saying \"dependencies are not satisfiable\". This means your package depends on some other package and you need to install that dependency package first.\n\n*Thankfully you get all the links to the dependency packages on the download page of you package with red bullets (mentioned in step.3.)\n\n\nOR\nIf you can somehow get another PC with Ubuntu connected to Internet, your life is a bit easy.

Is it possible to enter a chroot without using sudo? If so, how? I've tried googling, but all I get are results about crouton.\n\nA: You can look at the schroot  package. It provides a way to grant user access to one or more chroots on your system. The configuration allows each chroot to be accessed by only certain users or groups and allows bind-mounting of directories from the host system into each chroot as desired.\nOnce it is configured, it is easy for an ordinary user with no root privileges to run\nschroot -c chroot1 -- cmd ...\n\nFor some more description and examples of how to configure schroot, read\n\n\n*\n\n*Schroot - Debian Wiki\n\n*schroot - chroot for any users\n\nA: These days chrooting without root-permissions is possible with unshare command provided by mount namespaces.\nPlain Unshare\nSuppose you want to chroot into ~/Projects/my-backup directory, and run inside it the ~/Projects/my-backup/bin/bash binary . So you run:\n$ unshare -mr chroot ~/Projects/my-backup/ /bin/bash\n\nHere:\n\n*\n\n*-m means you can use mount --bind inside the new chroot (note that mounts will not be visible to the outside world, only to your chroot)\n\n*-r makes it look as if you are root inside the chroot\n\n*chroot … is the usual chroot command.\n\nPossible pitfalls:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have environment variables set correctly. For example, upon chrooting into an Ubuntu from Archlinux I was getting errors like bash: ls: command not found. Turned out, my $PATH did not contain /bin/ (on Archlinux it's a symlink to /usr/bin/), so I had to run:\nPATH=$PATH:/bin/ unshare -mr chroot ~/Projects/my-backup/ /bin/bash\n\n\n\n*Note that /proc or /dev filesystems won't get populated, so running a binary that requires them will fail. There is a --mount-proc option, but it doesn't seem to be accessible to a non-root user.\n\n\n*chown won't work unless you do some complicated setup with newuidmap and newgidmap commands.\nBuildah Unshare\nThis has advantage compared to plain unshare in that it takes care of the needed setup for chown command to start working. You only need to make sure you have defined the ranges in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid for your user.\nYou run it as:\n$ buildah unshare chroot ~/Projects/my-backup/ /bin/bash\n\n\nA: There are many ways you can do this , some easier and some more difficult. Some more secure, some less secure. And then there are all the opinions about all the options.\nIMO , chroot are the least secure and the most work to maintain. There are scripts and packages to try to lessen the work, but they remain, IMO, the least secure. There is no real way to manage resource allocation with chroot.\nLXC is next, and you can manage LXC with graphical tools, both graphical (virt-manager) and web tools exist. The problem, IMO, with LXC is that it is in rapid development. Still LXC is a bit more secure and easier to assign resources then chroot, although doing so is a bit complex and requires knowledge of cgroups.\nI would suggest openvz. The problem with openvz is that it is not supported on Ubuntu hosts. You can, however, use Fedora, CENTOS, RHEL or Proxmox. Proxmix is based on Debian so most similar to Ubuntu. All these OS have graphical tools to manage guests and allocate resources. Proxmox is web based and will transition to LXC once the Proxmox project considers LXC to be stable enough for \"production\" environments.\nYou could use XEN, vbox, or kvm, but all these options have a bit higher overhead then chroot/lxc/openzv. Management is easier as they all have graphical tools, all are secure, all allow resource allocation.\nIMO, Proxmox is going to be the easiest, most secure option. Second choice would be LXC on Ubuntu using virt-manager.\n\nA: You could install all of them a lxc container with all needed programms, including a shell, the minecraft server and a ssh-daemon or a full linux system. \nYou would have to start the container with its sshd and minecraft-server as root, but the users of it would be restricted to your lxc.rootfs.\nIf you have enough IP-adresses you could assign each of them one of those, otherwise you could start the sshd and the minecraft server on mutual exclusive ports.\n", "Q: Why can't I dual-boot with windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04?

I am working on Ubuntu 12.04 with cloud-init 0.6.3-0ubuntu1 \nMy question is can I upgrade it to 0.7.5-0ubuntu1.1?\n\nA: Short answer: there is no supported path for running versions of cloud-init newer than 0.6.3-0ubuntu1 on Ubuntu 12.04.\nHowever, some information on the general process may help you out.\nFor currently supported versions of Ubuntu you can upgrade to the latest supported cloud-init with 'apt-get upgrade'.  At this point Ubuntu 12.04/precise is out of support, so this specific question is mostly no longer relevant.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, cloud-init very much followed the standard Stable Release Updates policy in Ubuntu.  We only backported bug fixes but left the major version the same.\nIn 16.04 and going forward in 18.04, we have an exception to the SRU process.

But I want to know if it is compatible with this computer...\n\nA: Don't try to install a 32-bit version of Ubuntu on a computer with a 64-bit UEFI. (The vast majority of 64-bit UEFI-based PCs have 64-bit UEFIs.) At best, you'll end up with Ubuntu installed in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, whereas Windows will be in EFI/UEFI mode. This is awkward to manage and can be limiting.\nInstead, use a 64-bit version of Ubuntu and install it in EFI mode! Note that many Web sites give poor instructions that involve switching the computer to BIOS mode to do the installation, followed by repairing the damage done by this poor decision late in the process. See my Web page on EFI-mode installations or the Ubuntu community wiki on the subject for better advice and procedures.\n", "Q: Bluetooth with Centrino Advanced-N 6235 on Ubuntu 14.04 The hardware is present:\n$ lspci | grep Centrino\n04:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6235 (rev 24)\n\nAnd the Bluetooth, iwlwifi, and iwldvm modules get loaded:\n$ lsmod | egrep 'iwl|blue'\niwldvm                232285  0\nmac80211              626557  1 iwldvm\niwlwifi               169932  1 iwldvm\nbluetooth             395423  10 bnep,rfcomm\ncfg80211              484040  3 iwlwifi,mac80211,iwldvm\n\nIndeed, there's bluetooth output in my startup log:\n$ dmesg | egrep -i 'iwl|blue'\n[    2.598945] Bluetooth: Core ver 2.17\n[    2.598994] Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized\n[    2.599006] Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized\n[    2.599010] Bluetooth: L2CAP socket layer initialized\n[    2.599016] Bluetooth: SCO socket layer initialized\n[    2.637552] Bluetooth: BNEP (Ethernet Emulation) ver 1.3\n[    2.637557] Bluetooth: BNEP filters: protocol multicast\n[    2.637570] Bluetooth: BNEP socket layer initialized\n[    2.683477] Bluetooth: RFCOMM TTY layer initialized\n[    2.683493] Bluetooth: RFCOMM socket layer initialized\n[    2.683501] Bluetooth: RFCOMM ver 1.11\n[    2.802024] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)\n[    2.802106] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: can't disable ASPM; OS doesn't have ASPM control\n[    2.802169] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: irq 106 for MSI/MSI-X\n[    2.829897] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: loaded firmware version 18.168.6.1 op_mode iwldvm\n[    2.981631] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: CONFIG_IWLWIFI_DEBUG disabled\n[    2.981638] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: CONFIG_IWLWIFI_DEBUGFS enabled\n[    2.981640] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: CONFIG_IWLWIFI_DEVICE_TRACING enabled\n[    2.981644] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: Detected Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6235 AGN, REV=0xB0\n[    2.981921] iwlwifi 0000:04:00.0: L1 Disabled; Enabling L0S\n[    3.054692] ieee80211 phy0: Selected rate control algorithm 'iwl-agn-rs'\n\nAnd the wifi portion of the card is working great!

What is GATT?\n\nI have determined now that this radio and driver work fine with wifi and bluetooth on a different motherboard, so I'm assuming it's a hardware conflict with something on the particular motherboard (a Gigabyte J1800N-D2H).\n\nCuriously, the same problem persists on a different J1900 motherboard, leading to suspicion that this is a chipset conflict. This time the dmesg log is showing a firmware crash on startup, which I don't recall seeing previously. The log and lshw output are in a gist here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/mikepurvis/ee7bc8fb85ff7ae64a9d\n\nA: This has finally been figured out. The issue is that the bluetooth function of the 6235 is supplied by a separate interface, over the USB connection in the MiniPCIe port. Neither the J1800 or J1900 motherboards I am using have the USB portion of the MiniPCIe port connected.\n\nA: Centrino Advanced-N 6235 works great in my HP DV6-7010US on Ubuntu 14.04. The bluetooth did not work initially and was unable to find any solutions in the forums.  I saw a review on Amazon where they said FN + F3 was needed to choose between Wifi, Wifi+Bluetooth, or neither on an Acer. On my HP that combination didn't work so I pressed F12 a couple times and the bluetooth indicator appeared. Now everything is working as it should.\n", "Q: Why can't I cd into any subdirectories of my home folder? I am using Ubuntu 10.04.1 in a terminal window. When I am in my home user directory like /home/jeg#, I cannot cd into any directories below this. For example, if I enter cd downloads, or cd /home/jeg/downloads, I get the message No such file or directory. But when I do a ls command it shows me all the directories and files below /home/jeg. I can go into any other directory, so why is this a special case?\n\nA: Ubuntu is case sensitive (files and directories named with capital letters are different from those named in lowercase)\ntry cd Downloads\n\nA: All directories are case sensitive. The other directory that is confusing to many users is the desktop:\ncd ~/Desktop\n\nThe tilde symbol ~ is shorthand for /home/any_user; in your case, /home/jeg. You can use it to jump from anywhere to /home/jeg. If, for example, you were in the directory /etc/modprobe.d and wanted to get to /home/jeg/Desktop, it is only necessary to type the command I listed above.\nFinally, the hashmark # after /home/jeg in your question implies that you are running as root. One of the many safeguards in Ubuntu is that root privileges are granted sparingly and temporarily as root privilege allows modification of the system by, potentially, the person at the next desk, drive-by viruses, and more. I recommend you exit from root privileges and use sudo instead.\n", "Q: Command menu in aptana studio 3 is not working in ubuntu 14.04 The command menu of Aptana Studio 3 is not showing  in a Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nOther menu items are working fine.

I'm trying to comprehend and reproduce this\nI read this section in the book Learning The Bash Shell;\nMy question about it is below it:\n\n\"Notice that we used double quotes around variables (and strings containing them) in these echo examples. In Chapter 1, we said that some special characters inside double quotes are still interpreted, while none are interpreted inside single quotes.\nA special character that \"survives\" double quotes is the dollar sign—meaning that variables are evaluated. It's possible to do without the double quotes in some cases; for example, we could have written the above echo command this way:\n\n$ echo The value of \\$ varname is \\\"$ varname \\\".\n\n\nBut double quotes are more generally correct. Here's why. Suppose we did this:\n\n$ fred='Four spaces between these words.'\n\n\nThen if we entered the command # echo $fred, the result would be:\n\nFour spaces between these words.\n\n\nWhat happened to the extra spaces? Without the double quotes, the shell splits the string into words after substituting the variable's value, as it normally does when it processes command lines. The double quotes circumvent this part of the process (by making the shell think that the whole quoted string is a single word).\nTherefore the command echo \"$fred\" prints this:\n\nFour spaces between these    words.\n\n\nThe distinction between single and double quotes becomes particularly important when we start dealing with variables that contain user or file input later on.\"\n\nMy question\nI have tried to practice with this, but I am confused. Do I put-\n$ echo The value of \\$ varname is \\\"$ varname \\\".\n$ fred='Four spaces between these words.'\n\nin a file? Like enter # nano, then put it in there? Or do I just enter it into the terminal? Neither are working. When I entered # nano fred and put it in that file and made it executable and changed \"varname\" to \"fred\" and ran ./fred, I got this as a result:\nThe value of $fred is \"\"\n\n\nCan you explain what am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I've tried to break this down a little bit for you, using your own examples/text as well, check it out:\n$ cat fred    \n#!/bin/bash\n\nfred='Four spaces between these    words.'\n\necho \"The value of \\$fred is $fred\"\n\necho \"The next line being printed is simply the results of # echo \\$fred\"\n\necho $fred\n\nRunning the bash script above prints the following to the terminal/stdout:\nThe value of $fred is Four spaces between these    words.\nThe next line being printed is simply the results of # echo $fred\nFour spaces between these words.\n\nAs well, you can view a terminal video of this here: \nhttp://showterm.io/98f56243f60551b338b9f\n\nA: I think you should put:\nfred='Four spaces between these words'\necho \"The value of \\$fred is \\\"$fred\\\"\"\n\nYou can enter this into terminal, by right-clicking and selecting Paste, or Ctrl+Shift+V), or by entering it one line at a time. e.g:\n                \nYou can also create a script with this in - run nano ./echofredscript and paste in:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#The bit above is a shebang line (look it up on wikipedia).\n#These are comments and will be ignored\n\nfred='Four spaces between these words'\necho \"The value of \\$fred is \\\"$fred\\\"\"\n\nYou can then save it with Ctrl+O and exit with Ctrl+X, then run this to make it executable:\nchmod +x ./echofredscript\n\nThen this to run the script:\n./echofredscript\n\nThis should result in:\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*No spaces between the $ and the variable name (e.g. $varname not $ varname)\n\n*The \\ character tells the shell to treat the following character as a normal character. In this case you need to escape the quotes around the variable so they appear in the output, and the first variable so it appears as $fred not Four spaces between these words.\n\n\nThis might also work so you don't have to escape the quotes, but you would still need to escape the variable:\necho \"The value of \\$fred is '$fred'\".\n\n", "Q: Default directories on any ubuntu I have been using windows for a long time.

The new standard is 3.0, see\nhttps://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html\n\nSome of the highlights:\nThe source is now valid DocBook XML, with the appropriate tool changes.\nNew directories, including /run and /sys.\nRemoval of older compatibility directories, such as /usr/X11R6.\nMany typos fixed, and clarifications made to ambiguous sections.\n\nVarious distros are in various stages in implementing the new standard.\n\nA: *\n\n*/var - where logs and stuff are stored\n\n*/home - where the user's files are stored - Windows equivalents \\Users\\<username> or \\Documents and Settings\\<username>\n\n*/media (or /run/media on some systems, i think used to be /mnt or something) - where devices such as USB sticks are usually mounted - the directories within can be the equivalent of D:\\, E:\\ etc. Windows assigns a letter to each partition and the file manager uses that, whilst Linux use device names (e.g. /dev/sdb1) and mountpoints (e.g. /media/my-memory-stick)\n\n*/ the root of the filesystem - equivalent of C:\\ on Windows.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB\n\nA: It's worth noting, in addition to the other answers, that:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/bin is a bit like C:\\Program Files (stores programs, with the difference that /usr/bin has just binaries of programs while C:\\Program Files has folders containing binaries and other files.\n\n*/home is almost exactly like C:\\Users - every user gets a home directory like /home/ramvignesh. Inside this home directory, for each user, there are Pictures, Downloads, Documents, Desktop folders like in Windows.\n\n*/bin is not unlike C:\\Windows in that it contains many of core files of the operating system. It isn't the only folder that does, though.\n", "Q: Cant delete folders I'm trying to delete folders in Ubuntu 14.04 but the delete option isn't available.The folders can be deleted using the terminal or the delete button but there is no delete option wen right clicked What should i do in this situation?\n\nA: Under Nautilus(The file manager)=>Edit Menu=>Preferences=>Behavior Tab\nCheck the \"Include a Delete command that bypasses Trash\" checkbox\nThat will add a \"Delete\" entry whenever you right clicked a file\n\nA: Type in terminal\nsudo nautilus\n\nand then enter your password, it will be temporary, but you will have full read-write permission for every folder and file your computer.\n", "Q: Any way to enable dynamic/automatic brightness adjustment? My Lenovo ThinkPad X201 Tablet has a very bright screen (400 nits!), which is good for when objects on the screen are dark (say a night scene in a movie), but it is of course very blinding when objects are bright/white. I find myself continuously changing the brightness when watching a movie/video like this, and it is quite annoying. \nIs there any utility available that will automatically change display brightness depending on if objects on screen are bright or dark? I know this is an option built into some desktop monitors (in the form of Dynamic Contrast I believe), but I have not found the same kind of thing for laptops. \nTo clarify, I would like a utility (or simple script, even) that turns the brightness (as in the backlight) up when the majority of stuff on screen is dark/black, and dims the brightness down when the majority of stuff on screen is bright/white, to take full advantage of this bright screen.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: You could have a look at WildGuppy which will adjust your brightness according to the light it gets from your webcam (not according to your screen content though).\n\n\nA: Run this command:\nsudo apt install brightness-controller\n\nYou will see the brightness controller:\n\n", "Q: Juju - configuring a service by clicking on charm with stand-alone implementation - LXCa I brought up a local/stand-alone JUJU environment that creates LXCs for each service deployed.  What I notices is that I can't be redirected to the service configuration screen when clicking on the \"charm\" (Iam using a mac, OS X, Fusion) within the \"juju-gui\". This is the case with Wordpress, mysql, as well as a charm that I created.\nRelationships, as it appears on juju-gui and defined via command line or juju-jui, appear to be only a \"green line on the screen\".  The charms that I loaded via local repository came up ok, and did not show green on juju-gui until completely up, but relationships (green line) do not appear to have any meaning other than graphical picture - no status.\nIs this because I am in a stand-alone (local) dev environment?\nI am running 14.04.\nThanks....\n\nA: I think there are two questions here...\nHow to get to the services configuration screen from the Juju GUI\nThere are two places, The inspector which shows up when you click on a service allows you to configure the charm, which will configure the service. If you want to get to a configuration UI for the deployed service, say in the case of Wordpress which has it's own admin panel. You will need to check the readme for the charm for this information. The unit's IP address can be found in the Inspector which was previously mentioned. You can also get this information from the command line by running juju status. There is some stuff in the pipeline to simplify this functionality in the GUI.\nWhy is my relationship always green\n\n\n*\n\n*Green - when the relationship hooks are running and/or completed successfully.\n\n*Red - when a hook on either end has failed.\n\n\nSo it's likely that your environment relations are working as expected because the relation lines never turn red.\n", "Q: Why can't I start Eclipse after I killed it once?

How can I connect to 2 WiFi networks at the same time with only 1 WiFi-adapter?\nI have two separate wireless networks, to which I need to connect the Ubuntu-PC simultaneously: The first with internet access and the other one without internet access.\nI tried to create a Virtual Interface and even though there doesn't seem to be an error, it did not appear in the Network Manager.

Can I replace the driver ath9k, if it doesn't support virtual interfaces?\n\nA: That would be much convinient to add as comment but it would need 50 reputation score. Sorry\n\nI have found another answer in this topic and it has a little extra just to save some time.\ne.g.\n\nAbout using both interfaces at the same time and the message about\nthem not being unique: This is probably because they both use the same\nMAC address. You can try to change the MAC address of the new\ninterface before activating it. \n ip link set dev <dev-name> address <new-mac-address> \n\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/592296/using-iw-to-add-a-virtual-wireless-interface-getting-the-error-no-such-device\n\nA: Yes you can, if your card support it. First of all look the documentation of iw and especially the page of virtual interfaces. Unless you are running 14.04, that is, due to a bug in udev scripts (probably fixed in 15.10, but no confirmation yet). \nNote that in the following description wlan0 is my normal WiFi interface and wlan1 is the name I choosed for the virtual one (it's quite arbitrary). You have to adapt this to your system, of course. \nYou can create a new virtual interface with: \nsudo iw dev wlan0 interface add wlan1 type station \n\nif your adaptor/driver support it, it's done --- you now have two interfaces; otherwise you will have some type of error or the interface will not appear. \nYou can check if the new interface exists by typing \n sudo ifconfig -a \n\n...and see if the wlan1 interface shows up. It will appear in the Network Manager too anyway: \n\nYou can remove the virtual interface with \nsudo iw dev wlan1 del\n\nI really never used it --- I tried to connect twice to my router and havoc arose (but that probably is normal). Moreover, you will probably need to see if packet forwarding between the two interfaces is enabled by default or not, and you probably need to play a bit with the routing after that. But it's a start. \nPD --- one of the thing you will probably have to change is the MAC number of the \"virtual\" interface, which is by default the same as the other, and will create problems almost for sure. \n", "Q: Quick question: Will a fresh install Ubuntu detect my Raid-0?

Now, my existing install of Ubuntu no longer detects my C: drive.\nDoes Ubuntu not natively detect Raid drives or do I simply need to reinstall Ubuntu?\nMust Ubuntu also be on the Raid to detect it?\n\nA: First: Upgrade. 13.04 is out of support.

I have simply been choosing linux-generic-lts-trusty without giving it much thought.\nShould I choose one over another ?\nAlso, while we are talking kernels, is there an intel atom netbook optimised one available for Ubuntu, and if so should I really be using that ?\nEDIT : I have added the kernel selection page screenshot.\n\n\nA: When I doubt, for a desktop, use the generic kernel. For a server use the server kernel.\nIf you are going to run a kernel that is optimized for your hardware, I suggest you compile your own. It is intimidating to do so, but, with modern options, it is  not that difficult.\nAfter you install ...\nGet the source\nmkdir ~/src\ncd src\napt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\nInstall the necessary packages to compile\nsudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\nNow you have all the parts you need to compile. The ubuntu kernel source code has already been patched.\nIn the \"old days\" you would have to know your hardware and select what to optimize and what to compile. These days you simply run the following command in the kernel source directory\ncp /boot/config-your_kernel_version .\nmake localmodconfig\n\nlocalmodconfig will examine the modules you are using and compile those (so no need to know your hardware).\nGenerally the defaults from localmodconfig are fine. You can run \nmake menuconfig\n\nand go to the CPU section and see what, if anything, applies to your CPU. If you do not understand the options, go with the default.\nThen run\nmake\nmake install\nsudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install\n\nAnd update grub, boot to your new kernel.\nSee:\nhttp://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/kernel#easy\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel\nNote: my instructions deviate from the ubuntu wiki, the ubuntu wiki will build the generic kernel unless you change the scripts in the debian directory and the .config files. I modified the config with localmodconfig ;)\nSee also : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile#Reasons_for_compiling_a_custom_kernel\nNote: It is highly unlikely you will see a performance boost over the generic kernel. You might be able to benchmark it, but it is not going to make unity, your desktop, firefox, or other applications run faster.\n\nA: These are all generic kernels. But different versions.\nIn 14.04 `linux-generic' points to 3.13 kernels\nquantal, raring and saucy should point to the same kernels, because these meta packages are for compatibility with upgrades from 12.04.\nNow there are also utopic and vivid for 3.16 and 3.19.\nI suggest installing 3.13 because it will be supported till 14.04 end of life, or vivid as the latest.\nYou can see life cycle of these kernels here:\n\n\nA: In most cases, simply use the latest AND longest supported generic kernel. I made my own kernel, it is really small, but no real difference in performance. I lost some hardware support - if my computer fails in any way, I can fix it easily with the generic kernel, but not with the compiled one.\n", "Q: alt-f2 stops working and other issues when using a mac keyboard on 12.04 Trying to switch to an apple keyboard on Ubuntu 12.04 brings up a number of issues.  There's lots of old information out there on google, I'm going to post this as the current solution.\n\n1) On a regular keyboard, you're used to having alt next to the spacebar, and the silly Windows, \"Command ⌘\", or \"Super\" key sits unused between ctrl and alt. But apple puts their ⌘ key right next to the spacebar making the alt key you use all the time harder to thumb.  Trying to fix that with xmodmap and .xinitrc has no effect outside of terminal applications.\n2) alt-f2 to run commands doesn't work anymore? That was actually broken until 12.02, but should be fixed now.  That stumps you until you realize:\n3) that the f* keys across the top by default now do nifty/useless things like changing the volume of the music. There's a \"fn\" key where the useless \"insert\" key used to be that you have to hold to get them to do their normal behavior.\n4) The naive approach of using Settings / Keyboard / Shortcuts / System has the \"Show the run command prompt\" Disabled and italicized, and you are unable to enable it\n\n5) Some instructions on the web tell you to use ccsm, the \"CompizConfigSettingsManager\" under \"Gnome Compatibility\" and enable the \"Run Dialog\" but it stubbornly stays disabled:\n\n6) The \"PrintScr\" key at F13 doesn't do anything, with or without the \"fn\" key.\n\nA: The answer is surprisingly simple. \n1) Under Settings / Keyboard / Layout Settings / Options you can swap around the alt/⌘ keys to your liking. I'm trying this option, which swaps Alt and ⌘ just on the left side of the keyboard. But the other option \"Control is mapped to Alt keys, Alt is mapped to Win keys\" also works, while removing the stupid \"⌘\" key entirely.\n\n2) The alt-f2 key was already there, just hidden behind needing to hold down \"fn\". You can change that behavior to what you really want by\n$ echo 2 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode\n\nand to make that permanent\n$ echo options hid_apple fnmode=2 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf\n$ sudo update-initramfs -u -k all\n\n3) You can set up the \"PrintScr\" stuff yourself in this settings dialog. Use the f13 key and the settings will change it from \"Print\" to \"Tools\". Here's a picture of half of the settings having been changed.\n\n", "Q: How do I install the LSI megacli in Ubuntu?

User matttbe provided a links on how to recompile Cairo-Dock (and specifically how to do so in Ubuntu) and stated that to disable all actions that will occur after scrolling on an icon remove these lines below from the src/cairo-dock.c source file:\ngldi_object_register_notification (&myContainerObjectMgr,\n    NOTIFICATION_SCROLL_ICON,\n    (GldiNotificationFunc) cairo_dock_notification_scroll_icon,\n    GLDI_RUN_AFTER, NULL);\n\n", "Q: Why my usb mouse stays on after shutdown?

I can't reinstall windows because I don't have my product key. Are there any other solutions?\n\nA: You've got a mixed-mode installation -- Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and Windows in EFI/UEFI mode. This is an awkward situation at best, and resulted from your following poor instructions (or perhaps running into a problem when following good instructions and improvising). The solution is to install an EFI boot loader for Linux. There are several ways to do this, but the two easiest are likely to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you haven't already done so, disable Secure Boot on your computer. (You can re-enable it later, if you like.) Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a medium with it. You should then be able to boot to rEFInd. If rEFInd enables you to boot both Windows and Ubuntu, you can then install the Debian-package version of rEFInd on your computer, which should take over the boot process and enable you to boot either OS directly.\n\n*Boot an Ubuntu emergency disk in EFI mode and run the Boot Repair program. This should set up GRUB in EFI mode, which in turn should enable booting both Ubuntu and Linux. Note that this option is more of a \"leap of faith\" than the first, since it involves modifying your on-disk and in-NVRAM settings without first checking that anything will work. It can also be tricky to boot an Ubuntu emergency disk in EFI mode if you don't know your way around your particular firmware's settings.\n\n", "Q: Where is my Ubuntu OS files located?

Everything works great with the chainloading boot. I can boot into whichever OS I want without a problem.\nThe only annoyance I have is that when I go to the windows bootloader from Grub, it's not the Windows 8 GUI bootloader, it's the generic black/white boot.\nHow can I restore it to the normal Windows 8 bootloader without messing up the way my computer boots? By the way, before installing Ubuntu I chose Windows 7 as the default boot...I don't know if that has something to do with it.\n\nA: Ok, so here's how I solved the problem.\nI restored my Windows 8 graphical bootloader, which wiped grub out of the boot partition. At that point I only had Windows 8 and Windows 7 in the boot menu. I added Grub 2 to the Windows 8 bootloader menu using EasyBCD. Now I can enter the Grub 2 boot menu from the Windows 8 GUI bootloader without any problems.\nI guess it still is a chainloading type of boot, but now I don't have any legacy bootloaders.\n\nA: The guide you used is for legacy booting. I assume that the GUI Boot you are talking about depends on UEFI booting.\nYou would possibly need to convert from MBR to GPT partitions scheme. As that may cause data loss, I'd recommend making backups of all partitions, discard the old partition table, create an ESP, (install a default UEFI bootloader like gummiboot), restore the backups, install and configure EFI bootloaders for every operating system.\n\n\n*\n\n*For Linux you can use the live media. To backup use the raw image functionality of the disks tool (slower) or a tar backup. Learn how to use grub-install and grub-update. Try avoiding boot-repair, you wouldn't learn much, only be more confused.\n\n*For Windows use DISM/imagex to create WIM images of the partitions (DISM is the imagex replacement on Windows 8 and recommended, but I just can't find a good SU question now). Configure the Windows EFI bootloaders with bcdboot (Windows 7 is missing some options, but it can install EFI bootloaders).\n\n\n*\n\n*DISM capture (backup) example:\nDism /Capture-Image /ImageFile:c:\\my-windows-partition.wim /CaptureDir:C:\\ /Name:\"My Windows partition\"\n\n\n*DISM apply (restore) example:\nDism /apply-image /imagefile:N:\\Images\\my-windows-partition.wim /index:1 /ApplyDir:C:\\\n\nI recommend staying away from everything about legacy booting or guides for booting pre-2012/Windows 8.\n", "Q: What Ubuntu version should I use What Ubuntu version should I use?

By \"swapping\" I mean putting another hard drive into an empty hard drive bay in the Dell Dimension, and then switching the cables from the old hard drive to the new hard drive.\nIn order to boot the computer from a USB flash drive you need to enter your BIOS setup utility by pressing one of these keys, usually: Delete, F2 or F10 as soon as the motherboard splash screen appears when the computer is booting. Dell computers usually use the F2 key to access the BIOS. In the BIOS menu, change the boot order so that the USB flash drive, which is usually called USB-HDD in newer computers, is the first entry in the boot sequence, and then save your new BIOS settings and exit the BIOS setup utility.\n", "Q: After bringing up openbox, \"aplay -l\" requires sudo.

However, I couldn't make the operator \">filename.txt\" work... Here is my script:\nfor i in {1..10000000..10000}\ndo\n    time ./merge $i>nn\ndone\n\ncan somebody help me out?\nUpdate:\nThe answer is: \n{ time ./merge $i ; } 2>> time.txt\n\n\nA: time is a bit funny. It's a Bash built-in so the first thing you need to do is limit it to the right command. You can do that by grouping it with braces or subshelling with parenthesis.\nThen you need to note that it outputs to STDERR. This won't be redirected by default but we can fix this by redirecting STDERR into STDOUT and then redirecting that.\nFinally (as choroba spotted before me) using > will overwrite by default. Doing it in a loop will result in just the last iteration showing in the file. You want >> which will append.\n{ time ./merge $i ; } >> nn 2>&1\n\nIf you don't want any original STDOUT, and just want the time output, you could run this instead:\n{ time ./merge $i >/dev/null 2>&1; } 2>> nn\n\nThis is junking all the output of the ./merge command and is just redirecting the STDERR from the wider block.\n\nJust as a test harness to show this working:\n$ for i in {1..10}; do { time echo $i >/dev/null 2>&1; } 2>> nn ; done\n$ wc -l nn\n40 nn\n\nThat's 10×4-line time blocks (the echo output is suppressed).\n\nA: You are overwriting the file in every iteration of the loop. Either, redirect the whole loop to the file\nfor i in {1..10000000..10000}\ndo\n    time ./merge $i\ndone > nn\n\nor, use append:\nfor i in {1..10000000..10000}\ndo\n    time ./merge $i >> nn\ndone\n\n\nA: time prints its results to standar error, not standard output. You therefore need to redirect the former with 2> instead of the latter with >. Your next issue is that you are capturing the output of ./merge and not of time. So, you need to group the time and ./merge commands and then redirect their output. This can be done either by running them in a separate subshell or by grouping them in the current shell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run in a separate subshell\nfor i in {1..10000000..10000}\ndo\n  ( time ./merge $i ) 2>> nn\ndone\n\n\n*Run in the same shell\nfor i in {1..10000000..10000}\ndo\n  { time ./merge $i; } 2>> nn\ndone\n\nIn this particular case, there is no practical difference between the two approaches. \n\nA: The bash intrinsic time is not the same as /usr/bin/time.  The latter will allow you to append to a file:\n/usr/bin/time --append --outout=outputfile command\n\n", "Q: Automatic display detection not working correctly anymore on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Is there a way to check history of all updates automatically installed by \"Software & Updates\"?  \nToday after updating some packages, automatic detection of connected displays was somehow changed.

I am planning to go for a Lenovo Ideapad Z510 which comes along with Windows 8.1. Now I need to install Ubuntu (Linux) on it. So how do I go about making the system dual boot? Which version of Ubuntu should I use?\nI am doing this for the first time, so a detailed explanation will be very much appreciated.\n\nA: If your computer comes with Windows 8.1 pre-installed, it will make use of the complete disk space.\nThe first thing you need to do, is create space for your Ubuntu installation. You can either use your Windows Disk Management (can be found in your computer management console) or you can use gparted. There are dedicated boot cd's you can download with gparted or you can launch it from a Linux LiveCD. Both ways give you an easy graphical interface in which you can resize (shrink) your Windows partition.\nYou download your preferred Linux Distro (Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 is a really nice option for beginners!). 64-bit versions are offered by defaut, but there are STILL some applications (e.g. skype) that really prefer 32-bit versions. So for absolute beginners, I still advise you to get the 32-bit version. You will read that a 32-bit can't use more than 4GB of RAM, but Ubuntu comes with PAE (Physical Address Extention) pre-installed, so it should see a lot more. Don't worry about this, your RAM will not go to waste. When you've got the ISO, is't always good to check the MD5sum of the file, to check for any errors before you start your installation. I can't remember when I had the last bad iso downloaded, but it's always a good habit to do so... Anyways, when you have the iso file, you can opt to write a DVD, or go over to http://pendrivelinux.net to download the Universal USB Installer and create your bootable USB key.  \nWhen all that is done, you're ready for your first dual-boot installation. Restart your computer, choose to boot from USB or CD, whichever you created, and follow easy install instructions. BE WARNED! Quite a few people here have complained that they lost their Windows after installing Ubuntu (or other Linux distros) because they didn't read or understand all the actions you go through before installing. Before you press the button Install Now, make sure you've chosen to install Ubuntu in the FREE SPACE, next to your Windows. So don't choose to use your whole disk ;) Should you not see this option, abort the installation and come back for help.\nAfter the installation, you should be left with a working Windows and Ubuntu. After booting, you will see the bootloader GRUB pop up, offering you the choice between Ubuntu and Windows. If you don't like the default OS, you can manually change that later.\nAfter all this, you should also consider running Ubuntu in a virtual machine. Especially when you have no experience with Ubuntu, it may be a bit easier to switch between an OS that you know and feel comfortable with and the OS you want to learn about. Windows 8.1 comes with Hyper-V, or you can opt to install VirtualBox or VMware Player for free. Personally, I prefer VirtualBox, but that's just me... Hyper-V works well too and doesn't require 3rd-party software, but it has few limitations that, at this point, you don't have to worry about. Most new computers these days are more than powerful enough for you to run at least 1 virtual machine. It saves you from doing risky things like resizing your partition and you'll be able to run both OS's at the same time. This also gives you the option to test or play around with network sharing, communication between your Windows and Linux, etc, which is pretty difficult to do in a dual-boot situation.\n", "Q: Apache not rendering Bugzilla cgi I've just tried to install Bugzilla on my machine for test purposes.

This is my /etc/fstab entry:\n# mount the fileserver\nhttps://fsrv.company/ /mnt/fileserver davfs user,auto 0 0\n\nManually mounting it with mount /mnt/fileserver works fine. However, because of an outdated certificate this issues a prompt which I always have to answer with yes:\n/sbin/mount.davfs: the server certificate does not match the server name\n/sbin/mount.davfs: the server certificate is not trusted\n[...]\nAccept certificate for this session? [y,N] y\n\nThis device should be mounted when starting Ubuntu (due to the auto option). However, the device is not mounted, probably because of the required input. The owner of the fileserver wont update its certificate. \nHow can I automate this process, such that the device is mounted at startup with the answer being always y\\n?\nEDIT: I did download and place the certificate in .davfs2/certs/ and edited the entry in .davfs2/davfs2.conf (as hinted below by @Oli), but the interactive input remains.\n\nA: In my case I used the code highlighted by Oli above and then used the trust_server_cert option in the dav2fs config.\n\nUsefull  when  the  server's certificate can't be verified or is\n                even invalid, but you know that you can trust this  certificate.\n\nSo edit /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf and add a line that looks like the following:\ntrust_server_cert        /etc/davfs2/certs/my.selfsigned.cert.pem\n\nThis allowed me to mount a self-signed OwnCloud webdav even when the certificate host didn't match.\n\nA: Wouldn't it just be easier to fix the trust issue and install the certificate?\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the certificate (thanks to elec3647 on SuperUser)\nopenssl s_client -connect HOSTNAME:443 -showcerts </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM > certificate.pem\n\n\n*Copy the certificate to /etc/davfs2/certs/\nsudo cp certificate.pem /etc/davfs2/certs/\n\nThat should deal with the problem directly.\n\nA: The proper way of solving this would be changing the CN (identity) of the server certificate to set it to your domain (in this case fsrv.company).\nHowever you can get around this by doing it the ghetto way, add a command to the boot (on Ubuntu that would be Startup Applications for example) with the following:\necho y | mount /mnt/fileserver\nThis will basically 'auto-accept' the error in the certificate for you.\n\nA: I encountered the same problem but I found a different solution. I simply installed the ca-certificates package, because my certificate was signed by an official CA : Terena.\n/sbin/mount.davfs: the server certificate is not trusted\n  issuer:      TERENA, Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, NL\n  subject:     Domain Control Validated\n  identity:    owncloud-mshe.univ-fcomte.fr\n  fingerprint: 0e:5f:b4:02:c2:a7:d7:7f:8b:ef:9c:06:25:0c:c0:1f:d4:38:83:1d\n\nThe solution is :\napt install ca-certificates\n\n", "Q: Execute commands with sudo as a root I would like to execute the command gedit file.txt as a root with sudo e.g.:\nsudo gedit file.txt\n\nshould ask me for a root password.\nCurrently, typing sudo gedit file.txt results in:\n[sudo] password for currently_logged_in_user:\n\nAfter typing the password, it results in:\ncurrently_logged_in_user is not in the sudoers file.\nThis incident will be reported.\n\nSo I have to use su root gedit file.txt instead which is inconvenient.\n\nA: sudo does not work the way you envision.\nYou can configure sudo to allow root access to commands, such as gedit, but not specify files. So if you give a user root access to gedit, the user can edit any system file. \nExample, for the user joe\njoe     ALL = /usr/bin/gedit\n\nwould grant root access to gedit , but the user could then access and edit any file.\nIn addition, by default, the root account of Ubuntu is locked and sudo uses the invoking users password rather then a root password. Sudo is however highly configurable so you do not have to access root, you can specify an alternate user with the -u flag. You may then configure sudo to use the target password, root or otherwise. You would have to set a root password.\nSee http://www.gratisoft.us/sudo/sudoers.man.html and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudofor details\nI think you will want to change ownership on the file in question so the file is owned by root:some_group, add the user to some_group and allow group edits. \nExample - How to avoid using sudo when working in /var/www?\nThus gedit does NOT run as root, and the user can edit the file with group permissions. \nIf you need finer grain control use acl.\nIf you really wish to confine a use use apparmor. \n\nA: it seems your user doesn't have administrative rights and therefore can't invoke sudo. However changing to root user does work. The solution would be to make your current account have administrator rights.\nYou can do this if you log in to your administrator account and then change it via user accounts.\n", "Q: Installation guide for multiple servers using Cockpit I found this project can handle multiple servers Cockpit Project but I do not know how to use it. Question is then, is there Cockpit documentation or is there an alternative for MULTIPLE server installations BESIDES landscape?\n\nA: Cockpit is in development, and it is a Red Hat sponsored tool - it is not clear today it will manage Ubuntu.\nCockpit's documentation is sparse at the moment as it is undergoing rapid development - you can read the source, but that's about it for now.\nOptions to manage multiple Ubuntu servers are tracked in this question Options for managing multiple Ubuntu installations together\nFinally, if you are after machine deployment instead of machine management, you should have a look at MAAS.\n\nA: It has been a while since this thread was created.

The problem is that I have tried \nrename 's/.run$/.clu/' *.run\n\nBut this does absolutely nothing to the file.\nNote: I'm not trying to convert the file, just to rename the extension.\n\nA: I don't know what your problem is. What you've posted works:\n$ mkdir test\n$ touch test/test{01..10}.run\n$ rename 's/\\.run$/.clu/' test/*.run -vn\ntest/test01.run renamed as test/test01.clu\ntest/test02.run renamed as test/test02.clu\ntest/test03.run renamed as test/test03.clu\ntest/test04.run renamed as test/test04.clu\ntest/test05.run renamed as test/test05.clu\ntest/test06.run renamed as test/test06.clu\ntest/test07.run renamed as test/test07.clu\ntest/test08.run renamed as test/test08.clu\ntest/test09.run renamed as test/test09.clu\ntest/test10.run renamed as test/test10.clu\n\nThe -vn is just telling us what it would do if run without it.\nI'm escaping the dot (otherwise it's a REGEX \"anything\") but it really makes no difference here. It works as well without it.\n\nIs it possible that you're actually running rename.ul? Check to make sure you're using the Perl rename (which takes the syntax we're using) with dpkg -S $(readlink -f $(which rename))\n\n\n*\n\n*perl: /usr/bin/prename is good.\n\n*util-linux: /usr/bin/rename.ul is bad. For some reason you're using a very limited version of rename. Something very squiffy has happened.\n\n\nFor the moment, see if prename exists (you could just use that for now) and if not, start asking why Perl isn't installed properly. It would suggest you don't have Ubuntu installed.\nOr if you're happy using rename.ul, the following should work:\nrename.ul .run .clu *.run\n\nBut that might munch a file like test.run.hooray.run into test.clu.hooray.clu which obviously isn't great.\n\nA: You don't need to use rename for this. You can do it using basename:\nfor f in *run; do mv \"$f\" \"$(basename \"$f\" .run)\".clu; done\n\nbasename will print a file's name (no path) and also removes an optional suffix. Therefore, \"$(basename \"$f\" .run)\".clu is the name of the file $f with the .run extension replaces with clu.\nYou can also just use bash's own string manipulation features:\nfor f in *run; do echo mv \"$f\" \"${f%%.run}\".clu; done\n\nThe construct ${var%%string} removes the string string from the end of the variable $var.\n\nA: My prefered in cases like this is mmv (it is not installed by default in Ubuntu, but you can install it using sudo apt-get install mmv command):\nmmv -n '*.run' '#1.clu'\n\nThe -n means that it's a test run and will not actually change any files. It will show you a list of files that would be renamed if you removed the -n. In the case above, it will convert all files in the current directory from a file extension of .run to .clu.\nmmv -v '*.run' '#1.clu'\n\nThe -v is optional, but it's a good idea to include it because it is the only record you will have of changes that were made by the rename command.\nSee man mmv for more info.\n\nA: You just use mv:\nmv oldname newname\n\nmv is used to move/ rename files. Refer to the man page of mv for more.\n", "Q: Google Chrome not starting I am running 14.04 with latest update 3.13.0-30-generic.

I have a relatively clean installation of Ubuntu which reads this under system details:\n\nI've read everywhere that 32-bit OSs don't support more than 4 GB of RAM (some sources say 3 GB), so what's going on in my system? Does it recognize but not use all the RAM I'm providing it (BTW, the System Monitor also shows 5,8 GiB) or what? Unless the system installed PAE automatically, I'm not using it. I've taken a look at the answers on Does Ubuntu Desktop 32Bit Support more than 4GB Memory with default installation?, but am still looking for an answer to my case.\n\nA: If it's showing that, you're probably using PAE. It's enabled by default.\nWhy is it 5.8GB instead of 6GB? Do you have onboard graphics? It's probably reserving a chunk.\n\nA: The sentence \"32-bit operating systems don't support more than 4 GB of RAM\" is false in general. The Physical Address Extension, which is CPU feature, allows the 32-bit operating system to address more than 4GB of RAM. It is true, however, that some editions of 32-bit Microsoft Windows system don't use Physical Address Extension due to marketing reasons and hence don't support more than 4GB of RAM. The myth of only 4GB of RAM in 32-bit systems have grown on popularity of such Windows editions.\n32-bit Ubuntu makes use of Physical Address Extension, so you can use more than 4GB of RAM in your 32-bit system.\n", "Q: Error when adding a source I am trying to install openFOAM, but the installation requires that I first run the lines:\nVERS=$(lsb_release -cs) \nsudo sh -c \"echo deb http://www.openfoam.org/download/ubuntu $VERS main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openfoam.list\"\n\nAnd then run:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nWhen I run this last line I however get the following errors:\nW: Failed to fetch http://www.openfoam.org/download/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://www.openfoam.org/download/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

Sometimes I wonder if there's a conspiracy to kill Gnome Flashback because it feels like it's been constantly beset with problems since the emergence of both Gnome 3's new look and Unity.\nAs in a previously question, after an update, I couldn't log in, and and it turned out to be the fault of malformed packages.\nNow, after another update, my windows don't have any decoration (no frame with the program title and the close, minimize and maximuze buttons). It's also made my iBus input switching no longer respond to my shortcut keys (which I'll address in a separate question if it persists).\nHow do I get my window decorations back?\nAnd is Gnome Flashback being supported anymore? It just seems like it's slowly breaking.\n\nA: It should probably be using gtk-window-decorator for decorations. If that isn't loading, perhaps Metacity (the wider window manager) hasn't loaded properly either.\nI'd start by running metacity --replace in a run box, terminal or whatever you can get your hands on. If you need to use a TTY, remember to set export DISPLAY=:0 first.\nIf that works, it's a case of getting that to load on start. I'm afraid I've no idea what the start-up sequence is like on Flashback but if you have a Start Up applications, sticking a record in there for Metacity might work.\n\nWhether or not it's maintained is a slightly more difficult question to answer. There certainly seem to be a number of people milling around it and there's a fair bit of detail on its wiki page. The mailing list also gets a fair amount of traffic. Yeah, I'd say it's alive.\nBut how fast they'll turn around any of these problems is anybody's bet. You might have more luck on an actual Gnome 2 fork rather than trying to emulate it with Gnome 3. MATE seems plenty active and it had a fairly solid base to grow off.\n", "Q: How to give a non sudoer access to a kernel module special device file?

It ate up almost all the RAM and eventually got closed (I think by the system itself).\nSo just out of curiosity, why/how does this happen?\n\nA: I (guess) this is because the first parameter you give to xterm is the shell to use - xterm bash (or xterm /bin/bash), xterm python etc.\nSo it runs xterm, tries to start xterm as a shell, which starts another xterm as that ones shell, then another, and another...\nYou can probably find a bit more on this by running man xterm\n\nA: Short version: xterm's argument is the shell to execute by xterm; shell is set in environment var, so further calls do a 10 PRINT \"xterm\" 20 GOTO 10 recursion.\nLong version:\n\n\n*\n\n*xterm xterm passes xterm to xterm call as xterm's shell by setting $SHELL variable to xterm (1st parameter of xterm is interpreted as shell to execute)\n\n*then, xterm executed by your xterm xterm command executes the $SHELL - in this case, creating another xterm instance (because $SHELL=xterm now)\n\n*$SHELL=xterm already, so the newly created xterm executes xterm\n\n*goto 3\n\n\nFurther reading: man xterm\n", "Q: PHP Startup Unable to load dynamic library I'm getting this error in my apache error log while trying to get cURL to work on PHP:\nPHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/lib/php5/20121212/curl.so' - /usr/lib/php5/20121212/curl.so: symbol curl_easy_pause, version CURL_OPENSSL_3 not defined in file libcurl.so.4 with link time reference in Unknown on line 0\n\nThe file it references is there in that location and I'm trying to figure out if I've missed any dependancies while installing curl for PHP.

Each increment has two file formats: .sai and .fastq\n004_001\n004_002\n004_003\n004_004\n\nThen \n005_001\n005_002\n005_003\n005_004\n\nI have tried:\nCode:\nfor i in {1..4}\ndo \n    $bwa samse $hg19 $csai $cfas > *.sam\ndone \n\nBut it only worked with the _001 file all four times.\nI have tried setting the end increment to i so instead of _001 it's _00$((i)) to go 1,2,3,4 but its stays at 1.\nExample of sam conversion:\nfor i in {1..4}\ndo \n./bwa samse  /hg19.fa  *_00$((i)).sai *_00$((i)).fastq  > *_00$((i)).sam\ndone\n\nI wrote it to run input files with that name and output data to the sam file.  \nIt works but it converts _001 four time instead of _001 to _004\nBasically I need to write a script that will automate multiple file conversions\n\n\n*\n\n*3 file inputs > output 1 file .sam\n\n*input .sam file > output .bam file\n\n*input .bam file > output .bcf file\n\n*input .bcf file > output .vcf file\n\n\nA: Well the syntax of the command can help you\nbwa samse [-n max_occ] [-f out.sam] [-r RG_line] <prefix> <in.sai> <in.fq>\n\nNow let's look at your bash:\nfor j in {004,005}; do\n    for i in {001..004}; do\n        bwa samse -f $j_$i.sam $hg19 $j_$i.sai $j_$i.fastq\n\n        # Do the other conversions from $j_$i.sam\n        samtools view -bS $j_$i.sam > $j_$i.bam\n        samtools mpileup -uf genome.fa $j_$i.bam | bcftools view -bvcg - > $j_$i.bcf \n    done\ndone\n\nI have no idea what $hg19 is.\nIt expects a \"prefix\" there so if you know what that means, substitute it in.\nAnyway, that should generate 8× .sam files. You can either change the loop above so that after generating the .sam with bwa, you perform your other conversions, like so:\nfor j in {004,005}; do\n    for i in {001..004}; do\n        bwa samse -f $j_$i.sam $hg19 $j_$i.sai $j_$i.fastq\n\n        # Do the other conversions from $j_$i.sam\n        samtools view -bS $j_$i.sam > $j_$i.bam\n        samtools mpileup -uf genome.fa $j_$i.bam | bcftools view -bvcg - > $j_$i.bcf\n        # ... whatever is needed to convert bcf to vcf  ...\n    done\ndone\n\nOr you can do a separate loop(s): for f in *.sam; do command $f ...; done.\n\nA: I wouldn't bother with the incrementing counter, you don't need it and it just complicates things. Try this instead:\nfor file in 0*.sai; do \n    bwa samse hg19.fa $file ${file%.sai}.fastq  > ${file%.sai}.sam\ndone\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*for file in 0*.sai; : iterate through all 0*.sai files in the current directory.\n\n*${file%.sai} : remove .sai from the end of $file. This means that if file=001_001.sai, ${file%.sai}.fastq will be 001_001.fastq.\n\n\nThis way, you will iterate through all files and run the conversion correctly without needing to fiddle with counters. I don't know what command you'd use to convert to the other formats since I've never worked with NGS data but you can add whatever is needed to the loop:\nfor file in 0*.sai; do \n    bwa samse hg19.fa $file ${file%.sai}.fastq  > ${file%.sai}.sam\n    command2 $file ${file%.sai}.fastq  > ${file%.sai}.bwa, \n    command2 $file ${file%.sai}.fastq  > ${file%.sai}.bcf \n    command2 $file ${file%.sai}.fastq  > ${file%.sai}.vcf \ndone\n\n\nA: thanks for all the help guys.

Also the buses home don’t start till 3pm and its only 11am so I am stuck for now.\nIdeas?\n\nA: Apparently (I don't want to test this) GRUB2 has an option allowing the masking of bad memory cells, on a byte-by-byte basis.  You will need to use the memtest boot options to determine the bad adresses, and list them in the grub configuration file as \nGRUB_BADRAM=\"0x01234567,0xfefefefe,0x89abcdef,0xefefefef\"\nusing your addresses, of course.

If not, you'll need to clarify what you're talking about.\nIn Qt Creator, select Tools > Options > Text Editor > Generic Highlighter.  Ensure the check box next to \"Use fallback location\" is checked.  Also, ensure that there is a path in the text box below this.  On my system, this path is /usr/share/qtcreator/generic-highlighter.\nWhile Qt Creator is excellent with QML and C++ files, I find it rather poor for HTML files.  I tend to use my text editor of choice to actually edit HTML files for my HTML5 project, and only open Qt Creator to run the project on an emulator.\n", "Q: AVR plugins not able to install in Eclipse.

That will completely wipe the disk of grub, though it really won't affect your ability to boot to the disk drive, try pressing f12 at boot when the bios screen comes up and select cd drive.

So, if your gateway on the VPN is say 172.20.1.1, the exit status of ping -c 1 -W 10 172.20.1.1 will tell you if you're connected.\nYou can also utilize third party software like VPNCheck. It helps you to feel safe if your VPN connection breaks, this is done by shutting down your main network connection or programs of your choice and showing a notification box. Basically it constantly looks for a change in your VPN network adapter.And you can connect to either PPTP or L2TP with it.\n", "Q: Changing python version without breaking software center I have been fiddling with my Python installation on Ubuntu 12.04 (I was having trouble installing a python library), and at one point my python command wasn't working. It turned out the symlink was missing (I must have removed it by accident lol), so I made a new one pointing to Python 3.2 (originally pointed to 2.7):\nsudo rm /usr/bin/python\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.2 /usr/bin/python\n\nProblem: the software center and update manager weren't working:\n~$ software-center\n  File \"/usr/bin/software-center\", line 152\n    print time.time()\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nI guessed this was because I had changed the default python version (2.7->3.2), so I changed it back to 2.7. Now they work fine, but I'd still like to change the 'default' python version (i.e. the one called with python in the terminal).\nIs it possible to do that in Ubuntu 12.04?\nThanks! \n\nA: You shouldn't change the symlink for python to point to Python 3 as you have already seen its consequences. And I would recommend you to get into the habit of calling Python 3 programs with python3 as that would involve the least amount of trouble later on.\nBut if you insist on calling Python 3 on your Terminal using python, you may create an alias for it. Remember, alias is different than symlink. Edit ~/.bash_aliases file (create it if it doesn't exist) to add the following in it:\nalias python='python3.2'\n\nThen restart your terminal and you would be able to execute Python 3 by calling python. This wouldn't break anything as changing the symlink does.\nYou may even add aliases like alias py3='python3.2' and then call py3 to run Python 3. This is even shorter and less confusing.\n\nA: Don't do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Python programs that come with Ubuntu depend on /usr/bin/python being the default Python2 version of your distro. They will likely break if it is something else.\n\n*PEP-0394 recommends that the python command calls Python2. Most Python programs will break if it calls Python3 instead.\n\n\nInstead use /usr/bin/python3 if you want to use Python3\n", "Q: When I try to add a new node to MAAS, does the node need a physical internet connection?

Because as you know when we try to add a node we have to define its main network that private network which is not connected to the internet!! So I get a cannot connect to the internet error at the last step of node enlisting! \n\nA: 1) Yes it needs Access to the Internet. It connectes to the ubuntu archives to download packages that are needed to perform a few tasks.\n2) MAAS has a squid-deb-proxy server. This means that nodes will try to access the squid-deb-proxy to download whatever packages it needs. However, you might be experiencing an issue where it is not trying to do that, instead, is trying to access the internet directly. What version of MAAS are you using?\n3) MAAS should probably be the default gateway and it should be configured to do NAT.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.04: Can I format a drive on one server and move it to a different server? I'm not very familiar with the intricacies of Linux filesystems, and have minimal experience with formatting and mounting drives, so please excuse this noob question...\nWe recently upgraded a secondary ext4 drive on a production server, and it took a good 90 minutes for the mke2fs step.  So I'm wondering if we could have done that step on a different server, to prepare the drive first, and then moved it to the final target server?  There was a guid assigned to the drive at some point, and I'm wondering if that was somehow tied to the O.S. where the command was executed, or if it's completely fine to do this drive preparation elsewhere.\n\nA: Formatting a drive does not have any relation or specific tie to the computer that formatted it. The UUID (or guid) is not tied to the computer, but if you want a different one, you can always assign a new one with the computer you put it into using gparted. Right click on the partition/drive and select \"new uuid\". I've even installed full linux installations and moved the drive from one computer to another and been able to use it without a hitch, boot and all. Think of a drive, especially a linux based one, as almost universally portable.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Nvidia Drivers Crash System!

If it fails to apply, make sure you have them installed, though. Look them up in the software center by searching for \"additional drivers\".

How can I do this?\nIf if can't be done, is there a way to recursively change all the files in  SuperSensitiveDirectory to 700 permissions? If I did that, I could then individually change the permissions for the log files.\n\nA: If you make your directory permission to 700 by \n$ chmod -R 700 foo\n\nand even if you do 777 to any other file inside it, then any other user cannot access the directory contents.

Hopefully this will make rsync tell you something about what's going on.\nSide note: If it were me, I wouldn't be backing up the whole of /. Even with the exclusions you've listed, you'll still be backing up a lot of (pretty large) files that don't need backing up, like /usr and /bin.

However I can't seem to find that option in the nVidia Settings on Ubuntu. Are there other ways to enable threaded optimization?\n\nA: You cannot enable it by default on all applications (yet), because of the following reason (according to NVIDIA):\n\nThese optimizations typically benefit CPU-intensive applications, but might cause a decrease of performance in applications that heavily rely on synchronous OpenGL calls [...]. Because of this, they are currently disabled by default.\n\nInstead, you're going to have to run your OpenGL application (games eg.) as follows:\nenv LD_PRELOAD=\"libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\" __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 yourcommand\n\nIf you don't do that, a lot of games will not perform as well as they could (Source games being the most notable).\n\nA: From what I know the Xorg driver that is included handles a lot of that stuff under the hood, with a lot of dynamic configuration for optimal performance. it's not really necessary to change those settings manually.\n", "Q: Removed a partition with GParted.

I have only 6 free Mb on \"boot volume\".\nHow can I find for not-used files to remove?\nOr is it possible to add memory to this unit?\n\nA: Your boot partition may contain older images of Linux kernals - they can be removed, and there is a procedure to do this outlined in What is the safest way to clean up /boot partition?\nUpdate 2014-06-28\nIt looks as though you will need to increase the size of your /boot partition.  This is not terribly fast, and of course if something goes wrong you will be glad you made a backup!\nIt may actually be / faster / easier / better all around / to reinstall Ubuntu.\nYou cannot resize partitions while you are using them, and Ubuntu is using them right now.  So, you will need to boot from a live USB, and choose 'try Ubuntu'.  When that is running, you open a terminal window and enter\nsudo apt-get gparted\nThis will load the partition manager onto the USB.  You can then run the partition manager to resize the partitions of you hard disk.\nYou want to make your /boot partition (/dev/sda1) larger - to do this you need to have some space available right next to it.  To do that, you will probably need to shrink another partition, and possibly move partitions on the disk as well.  It's the resize and move which take a long, long time.\nI'm attaching two links to relevant posts made in the past - good luck!\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/\nHow to resize partitions?\n\nA: One option that hasn't been mentioned, is to keep /boot on your / partition. If you regularly update your kernel and you keep your /boot on a separate 100-200MB partition, you will have a lot of clean up to do. Keeping it on a sufficiently sized / partition, you won't run into troubles so easily.\nOn most (desktop) systems these days, there's no real reason why you should keep a separate /boot. Of course, some people will disagree, but it's more of a legacy problem that's causing the habit of creating a separate ext2 partition for /boot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Unable to boot - No Bootable device I have computer that was configured to dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Windows 8.\nWhen the computer was rebooted afte shut down the computer fails with following errors\n\nChecking media = Failed\nNo Bootable device - Please restart\n\nBefore shuting down by mistake I wrote to (dd) /dev/sda thinking it was the SD card drive. \nIs there anything that I can do to recovery with out reinstalling everything all over again. \nThe data was backuped up a few weeks ago.  \nAny thoughts.\n\nA: just boot from the livecd and run grub-update on /dev/sda if that's all that's wrong, other wise there isn't much you can do.\n", "Q: Cant install Ubuntu 12.04, select CD-ROM Boot type I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu 12.04 from boot disk on a friends computer. when starting the computer with boot disk the message appears:\n\n1.\n2.\nSelect CD-ROM Boot Type:\n\nIf I enter 1 it goes to starting windows screen and boots 7 as normal\nIf I enter 2 it goes to a screen with a blinking dash in the top left corner for a minute or two then goes to the starting windows screen and loads 7 as normal\n\nA: it sounds like either the disk was not burned properly or the computer does not fully support booting from dvd in that way; you might try reburning or creating a usb based boot device.\n", "Q: Choosing a source for update How can I choose the address http://ir.archive.ubuntu.com/ for ubuntu update and package download?\n\nA: If you want to regenerate your sources.list you could use http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/\nSelect your country, your Ubuntu version and choose the repositories you want.\nRun in a terminal:\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak\ngksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nDelete all contents and then paste (Ctrl+A, Delete and Ctrl+V) the output from the above mentioned site.

But when I try to login as a guest user, it doesn't make the connection and tells me to contact the system administrator, which is funny in its own way... ;-)\nTried to connect with other devices and have the same problem. On a foot note, set up a NFS server earlier today and have no problems whatsoever connecting devices to the same 'shared' directory.\nReally struggling with this one, any help or point into the right direction is much appreciated.\n\nA: Finally found the answer to the problem. I made a big mistake with the server address on my clients. I was pointing to the directory /export/music, but should've been pointing to the share itself [music], which is mentioned in  /etc/samba/smb.conf \nProblem = smb://192.168.0.200/export/music\nSolution = smb://192.168.0.200/music\nAnyway, it's all working now :-)\n", "Q: can't cd to any directory inside home when using rbash I just set a user to use rbash (I wanted to user to be able to access it's home directory only). However when I try to change sub-directory it always gives me:\n\n-rbash: cd: restricted\n\nThe sub-directory owner is this logged in user, so I don't know why it is restricted. Any idea/help?\n\nA: From the rbash man page:\n\nA restricted shell is used to set up an environment more\n  controlled than the standard shell. It behaves identically\n  to bash with the exception that the following are disallowed\n  or not performed:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*changing directories with cd\n  \n\nrbash does not discriminate. It will not allow any cd, no matter where you're going. Even if it's a subdirectory of the user's home folder.\nIMHO in a real-life situation there really isn't a use for rbash. However, there are other things you can do to prevent users from seeing your stuff. For example, you could run:\nchmod -R o= $HOME\n\nThis changes the permissions of all the files in your home folder ($HOME) and subdirectories (-R = recursively), giving other users no permissions (that's what the o= part means) to access, modify, or even list files within.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Lock screen password misses first character in 14.04 I am running Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit). In my previous Ubuntu, which was 12.04, when the screen was locked and the monitor went blank, I just typed the password and hit enter. Even though everything looked blank, it worked in the background and unlocked the screen. However, in 14.04, when I directly type the password from the lock screen (with the monitor out), often times it misses the first character and obviously tells me that the password is wrong. So now I have to type the first character, wait a bit for the screen to come up and see if it was registered, and then type the rest of the password depending on that. Not that big of an issue, but for someone who locks the screen almost every time he leaves the PC, it's a little annoying.\nAny way to fix this?\n\nA: Are you using a wireless keyboard? I think this has something to do with the keyboard (and/or keyboard driver) \"sleeping\" if it is not used for few minutes. This only seems to occur on my first attempt at entering my password, or if I haven't hit any keys for awhile.\nI would think this is most likely an issue with my keyboard. It is a cheap wireless keyboard by Logitech. It probably has some built-in sleep mode to conserve battery. Higher-end keyboards may have built-in \"turn on and send first entry\" process. I don't know. Just what I have observed.\nMaybe try getting in the habit of waking your machine via keystroke?

It then takes up to thirty more seconds for it to respond to a single button press, and usually does not respond at all. Needless to say, this basically renders the keyboard useless and forces me to use a wired keyboard (which is inconvenient in my case).\nA possibly related issue is that every time the connection is re-established, I receive a message indicating that the keyboard has 0% battery power.

Suhosin upstream author has only recently updated suhosin to support PHP 5.4, but I am not going to prepare php5-suhosin package in my PPA since I don't think it's necessary with recent PHP releases.\nAnd since you clearly don't remember why you had php5-suhosin installed I think you'll be fine without it.\n", "Q: Windows incorrect, Ubuntu truthful (Megabytes/Mebibytes) (Seeing as this is ASKUBUNTU and not ramble ramble blogspot, the question comes at the end, I'm just laying down the foundation at the beginning, so just bear with me)\nWhen you get into IT, you gradually get obsessive compulsive disorder. Numbers must be correct and paintings must be straight.\nIn Windows, when I want 1G of partition space I will tell it to use 1024MB, which in-turn becomes 1000MB. In Ubuntu, you type 1000MB, and you'll get exactly 1000MB.\nThe thing is, I grew up with Windows, so I seriously believed that 1024 bytes equalled 1000 bytes because of the whole binary business. You know, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.\nIt only came to my attention that for all these years, SOMEONE working in Microsoft was constantly telling Windows to display the incorrect term.\nWhen you click on a hard drive in Windows, let's say it's 320 gigabytes, it'll show up in Windows as 305GB. And for years IT diploma people above me stated, \"Oh, that's just system overhead, that's why it looks smaller\"\nI only just figured out that this is, in fact, wrong.\nWindows, for god knows how long, (I went through XP, Vista, 7, and even 8.1) is actually using Mebibytes and Gibibytes, but displaying the incorrect terms, MB and GB, which should be MiB and GiB.\n320 gigabytes = 305.17578125 gibibytes <-- This is what Windows is showing.\nWhen I first used Ubuntu 14.04, I made a swap partition of 1024MB, later finding out that Ubuntu literally gave me 1024MB of swap space, and in my OCD ways I wanted 1GB.\nI redid the partitions, creating a 1GB swap space, and in return Ubuntu said that I have 953.67431640625 MiB of swap space, which is the correct size and term.\nMy question is, how many people using Ubuntu actually know of this?\nI've looked up articles over the years, one example is how to make a ramdisk using the ramfs and tmpfs commands.\nMost, if not ALL of the articles all over the internet, especially ones specializing in Linux distros, will use terms such as, \"mount -t tmpfs -o size=512m tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk\"\nDoes \"512m\" in that command actually equal 500MB, or has Windows ruined everything with years of being wrong, and everyone NOW has a habit of using the wrong term?\n\nA: From the results of running: man mount : The tmpfs mount options for sizing (size, nr_blocks, and nr_inodes) accept a suffix k, m or g for Ki, Mi, Gi (binary kilo, mega and giga) and can be changed on remount. Binary refers to the base-2 units, not base-10 units, e.g. 1 Ki = 1 KiB = 1,024 bytes.\nThis a more complete explanation of which file size units do which applications in Ubuntu use see this question: What file size units do applications on Ubuntu use? For more information about Ubuntu units policy see Ubuntu Units Policy wiki.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 install using Wubi on Windows 8.1 no preinstall I have Dell laptop on which I have installed Windows 8.1.

After you configure your virtual machine (memory, disk space, etc.), when you first start it you can choose to install from an ISO image or whatever source you have available.\n\nA: To install an Os in virtual box you need to have n ISO image file of the OS.\nAn ISO file looks like this:\n \nTo use the ISO you need to click on the folder icon beside the combobox.  \n \nAfter clicking the folder icon you need to select the ISO file of your windows 7 OS.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to wifi with Lenovo G510 wireless under Ubuntu My laptop model is Lenovo G510 which is not able to detect wireless. \nWhen I output of ifconfig -a I can not see any wireless such as wlan. My ubuntu version is 14.04.\nHow can I install the driver and resolve the problem?\n\nA: I have the same laptop :). If your card is a Broadcom 43412 or similar, you will need the broadcom-wl package.

The conversion took place but the fonts are not in tamil. Is it possible to convert pdf in Tamil language to convert to epub? or Is there any other software in ubuntu for this purpose?\n\nA: I had a similar problem and I solved it by including the fonts I needed in the epub version of the file. You can do this with Sigil, which is an epub editor. To see how to include custom fonts in your epub with Sigil see http://web.sigil.googlecode.com/git/files/OEBPS/Text/tutorial_embed_fonts.html.

How can I fix this?\nThank you.\n\nA: If you installed two keyboard layouts, you should see a white square in the top right corner of your login screen showing the one that is active right now.

I installed 4 Ubuntu virtual machines (in VirtualBox which itself is hosted by Ubuntu).\nI am allowed to used only one of them at once.

I want to automate the detection of the crash of a given VM in order to launch an other one automatically too.\n\nA: To show all running virtual machines we can issue the following command on the host:\nVBoxManage list runningvms\n\nIf we only want to display the state of a running machine (running vs paused) we can also read from a long output of this command, e.g. like follows\nVBoxManage list --long runningvms | grep State\n\nIn case your guest OS is freezing on the crash you encounter but still running this command will however still show the machine as alive. Only if the VM completeley aborts we will not get a result.\nAlternatively we may also try if we can ping the VM in case it is connected by network.\n", "Q: ubuntu throws me back to login screen When I try to login to my system I am automatically thrown back to the login screen.I tried \nctrl+alt+f1\n\nbut I got an error named 'signature error' Please help....\nI'm using Ubuntu ver 14.04\n\nA: Assuming a recent Ubuntu version and trouble with signature on the kernel or initramfs...\nBoot, press shift to display the grub boot menu where you should see\nAdvanced options for Ubuntu ...  use the arrow keys and select it, then press enter.\nA new menu appears, I hope you have several entries like\nUbuntu, with Linux ...\nNOTE: the ones having a '(recovery mode)' designation are for troubleshooting and requires some basic knowledge.\nTry them out one at a time... generally the second kernel variant may well work - as trouble have a tendency to be with the latest change (shown topmost ;-)\nAssuming you find one that works, you may remove the troublesome with:\n\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x.x-generic    # remove kernel version x.x.x.x\nsudo update-initramfs -u                          # remakes boot ramdisk\nsudo update-grub2                                 # re-creates boot menu\n\n... typed at the Terminal prompt $  (Hold CTRL+ALT and hit 'T' to open a Terminal) - the portions AFTER # are comments, not required to type.\nTo be able to fill in 'x.x.x.x-...' above you can type\n\nsudo apt-get purge linux-image-\n\n... and hit the Tab key (repeat pressing it) to list \"matching\" items.

I'm on my way to a windows-free office environment. I came over a relatively longlasting printer (8000 page cartriges!) Brother hl-5450DN. Does anybody use it with Ubuntu 14.1? (It should support linux according to the manufacturer.)\n\nA: We have a Brother 2250DN. Which works well enough through the Brother Linux Driver. Some people just use the generic drivers. These work but I couldn't get toner reporting to work. \nOne thing to note is the page alignment was off. This seems to be echoed across a number of models and while I've no idea what causes it, the issue is easy enough to fix:\nsudo lpadmin -p HL2250DN -o pdftops-renderer-default=pdftops\n\nYou just change the name of the printer there. That seems to have stuck through multiple reboots.\nThere is one lasting issue. I can't get the duplex setting to take from the client side. I have to log into the printer's webmin and set it there before printing. This might not affect you and even if it does, it's hardly a showstopper.\nAlso the \"compatible\" toners on Ebay (et al) are just as good and for half the price. You can even refill them yourself for even less. This is by far the cheapest printer to run I've ever owned.\n\nA: I have installed the HL-5450DN on 14.04.  \nI do have one problem though.  Sometimes when I print especially after a previous job I get pages of garbage which I have to cancel to save paper.  I keep this from happening by turning off/on the printer between jobs.  This is frustrating to me.\nUsing the prescribed procedures on the this model by the Manufacturer.\nManufacturer Drivers for this model\n", "Q: Frequent short freezes after upgrade to 14.04 A problem emerged when I upgraded Kubuntu to 14.04. In several minutes after booting up, Linux starts to freeze shortly (~1 second) and frequently (every ~5 seconds); not only graphics, but also sound and the general workflow. Usually it is starting after I load CPU or network. The same is in Mint 17 \"Qiana\" (that is based on the same Ubuntu version).\nCPU: AMD Athlon II X4 631\nMotherboard: ASRock A55iCafe\nVideo: AMD Radeon 6570 (tried both open source and proprietary drivers)\nNetwork: Ralink 802.11n Wireless\n\n\nA: The problem turned out to be with the kernel time processing: when I run cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i 'unstable' I see several error messages such as Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = -3474929768 ns).\nI solved it by turning on ACPI HPET table in BIOS. With another clocksource Linux kernel managed to handle the timers correctly.\n", "Q: Can I get the GNOME environment in Edubuntu 14.04? I am trying to get a new version of Edubuntu. I just want to check whether I can get the GNOME environment on Edubuntu.\n\nA: You can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\nIt should then install it and most of the other stuff it needs to work.\nMore instructions can be found here.\n\nA: As I know Gnome is coming with standard Edubuntu installation. Before the installation begins the installation wizard is asking to install Gnome and you can select it.\n", "Q: Unable to run shell script inside VI/VIM I am trying to run a shell-script say test from vim\n#!/bin/sh \necho good morning\n\nNow when I am using :!%\nI am getting a pop like \nshell returned 1\nPress ENTER or type command to continue\n\ninstead of good morning.\nSomeone please tell me what am I doing wrong. Do I have to change the path,if so how to do it. Running it from my home folder\n\nA: That will only work if the script file's permissions have the executable bit set. You can do this through Vim \n:! chmod +x %\n:! ./%\n\nOr you could just run it through its interpreter manually:\n:! bash %\n\n\nA: Try this instead:\n:!./%\n\nI use bash, so my error codes are different, but the path gets a bit of when you run % directly.\nAlso, you might need to run :!chmod u+x ./% before to make the script executable.\n", "Q: XAMPP (LAMPP) on Ubuntu Touch Can I install and run XAMPP (LAMPP) on Ubuntu Touch on a Nexus 10 in order to host a local website (that needs PHP and MySQL)?\n\nA: apt-get doesn't work anymore on Ubuntu Touch (OTA-22), write protection.\nIf you are careful with the space df -h you can (Warning: this could brick your phone!) remount the root / folder with:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /\n\nand then install the relevant packages, e.g. apache2, etc, using apt as:\nsudo apt install apache2\n\n", "Q: using `growisofs` to burn a blu-ray from an .ISO In using growisofs to burn a blank Blu-Ray disk from an .ISO file I encounter the following error.\n\n/dev/dvdrw: media is not recognized as recordable DVD\n\nHow do I resolve this problem?\nThe command I used was:\n\ngrowisofs -speed=2 -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvdrw=/home/user/image.iso\n\nThis command was taken from this page, in the Blu-Ray part of the documentation:\nubunutu help page\nNote that Nautilus shows the blank Blu-Ray just before I issue the growisofs command so I think I can assume Ubuntu is recognizing the device and disk medium.

Now, before I trash that, I´d like to try it with Ubuntu. But what Ubuntu I should try into?\nWhen I compare older Ubuntu with the newer ones (or the newest one), how with performance? Should I try to install there any older? Let´s say Ubuntu 8 or 10?\nI´ve found a few benchmarks comparing WinXP and Ubuntu 8.04, but it was test with unstandard operations and Ubuntu was there faster. But how with normal using for non-IT, not for me? Just conect to internet, read&write mails and work with MS Word (or Writer in LibreOffice)?\nThanks for advices.\nPS. I´m using Ubuntu 12.04 for last two years, so I have no option how to compare previous versions with older ones. But I suppose in currect (or newer) version whould be effects which could be too much for that old netbook.\n\nA: Have a look at Lubuntu. It uses the LXDE Desktop Environment. You can download it here: http://www.lubuntu.net\nLet us know if Lubuntu works with the netbook.\n\nA: If you don't wish to upgrade every 9 months, I would recommend you to opt for an LTS version of Ubuntu.\nYou should first try the latest LTS version (14.04) of Ubuntu. Since you have only 1 GB of RAM, I would suggest the 32-bit edition. Use an external DVD drive or a USB key to try Ubuntu without installing it first (it will be very very slow from a DVD, but that's completely normal). Check that everything (Wi-Fi, integrated soundcard, integrated wired network card, ...) is working properly. If that's the case, you can install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. You shouldn't have performance problems.\nUbuntu is generally faster in comparison to Windows on the same hardware. Moreover, according to the technical specification of your computer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Aspire_One), you have a SSD of 16 GB, so you really should opt for Ubuntu 14.04 which includes improvements for SSD handling (TRIM is enabled by default). \nHowever, if the UI effects are really slow after install, you may wish to install a lighter user interface like LXDE from Ubuntu Software Centre. You can also try gnome (fallback), xfce or MATE.\nOnce it is installed you can switch to that UI at logon, before entering your password. You just have to click on the Ubuntu logo next to your user name and choose LXDE instead of Ubuntu.\nI've run LXDE without any problem on Pentium III computers and even older with less than 512 MB of RAM.\nNotes :\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't forget to make a backup of your data before replacing Windows by Ubuntu on your Netbook ;\n\n*Don't try to install older versions of Ubuntu which have reached their end of life. Use one fully supported version of Ubuntu instead. If you really wish to try an older version of Ubuntu, use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS which is supported until April 2017.\n\n", "Q: Nvidia 410m - No backlight I've been running Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop, a Sony Vaio VCGEP33F, but a few days ago I began using Nvidia drivers (331.79) This laptop also has an Intel integrated GPU, but I have disabled it in the BIOS, and so long the OS has not noticed it. \nMy question is the following, since I started using Nvidia drivers, sometimes as I boot up the computer, after GRUB (I have windows 8 installed along Ubuntu) the screen will go black, with no backlight and so it will stay. May I flash a light at the screen I can see it'working, I can login, but cannot see crap.\nIf I reboot the computer several times (Itś random, and between 3 or 7) sometimes I see a nvidia logo and that is when the backlight will be on, else I will be stuck with no backlight at all. Then, if I connect a display to the VGA output during boot and disconnect it after logging in the laptop's screen will be on. \nI've been researching on the issue,but have not found anything like this, many people need to use bumblebee, me nope as I disabled the other GPU, many people have no brightness cntrol, which I have if the screen is on. \nAlthough annoying, I said it solves itself but I would like to know how to fix this! thanks in advance. \n\nA: I've been researching more into the issue, and I have provided myself with a poor solution, but I will share it here in case it helps others.\nIf after the login sound I type my password, and then press the (Fn)+F5 key (Brightness control hotkey) the screen will light up as normal. \nI still find it most annoying not seeing the beautiful lockscreen and/or having my computer usable from start. \nDoes anyone know a way to make a startup script that changes brightness before login?\n", "Q: Error in apt-get update I have been getting following error while running \nsudo apt-get update\nW: GPG error: https://download.01.org trusty InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A902DDA375E52366\nE: Encountered a section with no Package: header\nE: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/security.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_trusty-security_main_i18n_Translation-en\nE: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.\n\nWhat should I do to fix this problem?  \nAlso sometimes I get a red icon in the Task Bar pane.\n\nA: You need to import the GPG key for that repository\nRun the followings:\nsudo apt-key adv --recv-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com A902DDA375E52366\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: Touchpad nearly inactive in Ubuntu 14.04 I have a laptop ASUS X550LD.

It turns out it is not really distro specific and if you have an ASUS laptop then you have problems with that.\nSo most of the users say that if you have the asus-laptop module (or for newer machines asus_nb_wmi)loaded you are good to go. However for me it was this and kernel parameter acpi_osi=. Yes, exactly like that. Nothing after the equals sign, not even a space. \nSo to check if it's loaded by default do:\nlsmod | grep asus\n\nIf it isn't:\nmodprobe asus-laptop\n\nYou would probably need to load the module every time you boot like that, so please be sure to make it load automatically (search google for that)\nI'll also keep the link for reference on how to add the parameter permanently, and I'll paste it also here, in case it gets lost there:\nFirst:\nsudo sed 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=\"/' -i /etc/default/grub\n\nThen:\nsudo update-grub\n\nP.S.

I choose to use Fn+C and Fn+V.\nI also suggest the following script of mine, to do the actual adjustments of the brightness. The script does it in exponential increments rather than linear, so it requires many less key presses to reach the desired luminosity:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nUSAGE=\"Usage: `basename $0` +|-|max|<number>\"\n\nhwpath=\"/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight\"\n\nif [ \"$1\" == \"+\" ]; then\n    maxbright=`cat $hwpath/max_brightness`\n    bright=`cat $hwpath/brightness`\n    bright=`echo \"print(int(min($maxbright,$bright + max($bright * 0.5, 1))))\" | python`\nelse\n   if [ \"$1\" == \"-\" ]; then\n    bright=`cat $hwpath/brightness`\n    bright=`echo \"print(int(max(0,$bright - max($bright * 0.33, 1))))\" | python`\n   else\n    if [ \"$1\" == \"max\" ]; then\n        maxbright=`cat $hwpath/max_brightness`\n        bright=$maxbright\n    else\n        if ! [[ \"$1\" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] ; then\n            echo \"`basename $0` version 0.1\"\n            echo $USAGE >&2\n            echo \"+|-   brighter/darker\"\n            echo \"max   maximum luminosity\"\n            echo \"<int> set specific light intensity\"\n            exit 1\n        else\n            bright=$1\n        fi\n    fi\n   fi\nfi\n\n\necho $bright | tee $hwpath/brightness\"\n\nThe Bash script needs a Python. Put it somewhere in the path (I name it bright), and use it simply by bright -, bright +, bright 50 (very dim screen, good for night work) or bright max. \nIf you want to use the script as a non-root user, please change the permissions for the /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight; the best place to do it is via the upstart job, since upstart jobs are executed by the root.\nThis script is compatible with at least 3 ASUS models: ASUS N56VZ, ASUS G551JM and ASUS P53E. I guess it should be compatible with most of the other ASSUSes out there, and after a minor modification, with all other notebook brands that expose screen brightness somewhere in the /sys file system tree.\n\nA: I have Asus N551VW, and doing \n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=\"\n\nmakes FN+F5 move the brightness slider (without this, it did nothing), but brightness remains unchanged. Changing it through the menu works. All other FN combinations work.\nWill test other combos and post solution if I get one...\n(Side note, hibernate on closed lid doesn't work, no matter what.

Apparently increasing the size of the swap should make my computer able to handle more applications because it can \"push more data aside\" into the swap.\n...or will it make the computer hang more because it's putting everything in swap? So this means that it shouldn't be too big or too small?\nIn short; which is correct?;\n\n\n*\n\n*The bigger the swap the better.\n\n*Swap should be balanced according to \"something (?)\".\n\nA: Not really. The only thing (memorywise) that improves performance is more RAM.\nRemember that the slowest part of memory is your Hard-disk - swap just provides the ability to use more memory by swapping some pages out to the disk, which is slow compared to RAM operations.\nWhat you gain by providing more swap-space is the ability to run more/bigger programs, respectively programs with bigger memory requirements - at the cost of slowing the whole operation down.\nAs to the question of balancing: regard swap as last measure, used when everything else fails and the kernel would have to resort to killing a process because there no more memory available (OOM=Out of Memory). So keeping some swap is good.\nAn additional factor comes into play when you are using suspend to RAM (aka hibernating) - in that case you should provide the same amount that you have as RAM and maybe a little bit extra.\n\nA: Increasing swap size wouldn't increase performance unless you have already pushed your computer to the limit (full memory, full swap). The system doesn't decide when to use swap based on swap size, but based on the \"swappiness\" parameter (see How do I configure swappiness?)\n", "Q: how to get edubuntu with GNOME 3.2 environment at the time of installing edubuntu I have recently downloaded ISO file for Edubuntu but till now I have not installed it and I am using gnome now I just want to know that can I have GNOME environment in Edubuntu while installing it into my computer. \n\nA: You must run\n sudo apt-get install gnome-shell \n sudo apt-get install gnome-session\n\n\nA: Edubuntu comes with Unity v8 (same as the newest Ubuntu releases) as its default desktop environment.

Any ideas please?\n\nA: I have used xrdp extensively on earlier versions of Ubuntu and usually found that connection issues were quite simple in the end.  In my case it was always something minor that was the snag.  So when I bumped into the problem on two of my boxes upgraded to 14.04 I guess I knew instinctively that it would probably just be a need for some simple variation to earlier solutions.  Which is exactly what I discovered in my case.\nLiterature in the public domain was quick to point out that xrdp does not work on 14.04 with the 'out of the box' desktop/s.  The loss of the rollup window function had already steered me back to the xfce4 desktop, so I thought my earlier knowledge would fix the grey screen straight off.  As it turns out the adjustment is in the same place but just a little different.\nAs an aside you may first need to turn off the uncomplicated firewall (stop ufw) just to be sure that is not contributing to the problem.  The login script may stall if the firewall is filtering the exchange of data.  After you fix xrdp you can figure out if there is a need to make some adjustments there.\nTHE FIX:\nedit /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh\nmake the last two lines look like this;\n    #. /etc/X11/Xsession\n    . /usr/bin/startxfce4\n\n(In earlier versions I used the statement session=xfce4-session)\nSave the file and restart xrdp, and you should find you have a perfectly well behaved remote desktop session. \n\nA: *\n\n*Run the following command from your home user directory (e.g.: /home/myuser) in question:\necho xfce4-session > ~/.xsession\n\n\n*Restart xrdp service\nsudo service xrdp restart\n\n", "Q: How to uninstall programs (Comodo) So Comodo wont work properly so I want to uninstall it.

You prepend the command that you are using for editing with the word sudo, and the command runs with root permissions, assuming you know the password.\nsudo nano /etc/mediatomb\nwill open the file in an editable mode.  If you want to use a graphical editor, you should us gksu (or gksudo) instead of sudo.\n\nA: If you are running mediaTomb on a system with a flavor of xwindow installed (KDE, Unity, gnome, etc), you can edit the file with gedit. Adding sudo to the begining of the command will grant you the security privileges equivalent of that of a root user.\nsudo gedit /etc/mediatomb/config.xml\n\nIf you are running it on a server without interface, use nano or vi instead.

I'm evaluating (x)ubuntu client for my companies software developer. We must use full disk encryption because of software, which doesn't save their files in /home (like databases).\nThe company uses \"active directory\" as LDAP solution.\nAt system start I would want the LDAP user authentication to unlock the encryption. Is this easily possible with Linux tools?\nI know of LVM with Luks, but afaik that's one password and not connectable with ldap.\nA similar solution for Windows is \"DriveLock\".\n\nA: Solution 1: Using a crypttab script to query LDAP\nFull-disk encryption needs the key before the user authenticates. For that reason, you need to write/find a script that gets executed by crypttab when you use default Ubuntu full-disk encryption. A very simple example (without LDAP) can be found here. An example LDAP authentication python script can be found here. If you require multiple users to use the machine, you will have to get creative to see how the LDAP authentication will provide the same disk key all the time (e.g. multiple encrypted copies of the key locally, decrypt with user password?).\nSolution 2: mapping the files/direction to an encrypted home directory\nIf I understand you correctly, you need a solution which essentially extends an encrypted home directory with a couple of other locations that are accessed by software run by the user. You can then use standard LDAP authentication to do the initial user login.\nSolution 2a: using ln -s\nln -s create symbolic links. If you only plan on having a static setup where the same one user uses the machine all the time, this setup could work. Use ln -s to redirect the files/folders that the software is writing to (redirect to the encrypted home directory). Or simply try to find out if you can re-condigure (through re-compilation?) the output dir of the software.\nSolution 2b: using loopfs\nThe last solution is similar to encrypted home directories: use loop-back file systems stored in the home directory of the user, and encrypt the home directory. If you know exactly where your sofware stores the data, you can write a script to mount the loopback filesystems to those locations. I will sketch out a solution now, you can adapt it to your specific needs then.\nFor example, lets assume your software needs to store sensitive data at /opt/foo. I assume that /opt/foo is currently empty. I am not 100% sure about the current ubuntu way to do this, but essentially you need to:\ncreate an empty file of appropriate size with dd, lets call that one myLoopFS\nuse losetup /dev/loop0 yourfile or similar to connect your file to the loopback device (like /dev/loop0). You could even encrypt that file with losetup -e AES, but that is not needed as it will be stored in the encrypted home directory.\nThen format /dev/loop0 with ext4.\nThen mount it at /opt/foo when the user logs in. \nSoftware then writes to the /dev/loop0, which goes into your myLoopFS file.\nMake sure that /dev/loop0 is unmounted again when the user logs out. \nThat system should meed your requirements, unless your software is writing sensitive data all over the place.\nSummary\nI did not find a ready-made software to solve your problem, but is seems easy enough to solve with default linux tools like ln -s, losetup, or using crypttab scripts.\n", "Q: FTP/SFTP not allowing any writing I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 and vsftpd. In the past my account (not root) has had full access, more or less, to either FTP or SFTP to anything on my server and edit any file that my user account could edit. Now, recently, I cannot edit anything, only view. As a specific example, I cannot upload to /var/www even though my user is a member of the www-data group and that group owns the files (file/folder permissions are correct).\nI'm not terribly familiar with vsftpd and how it works. I mainly need to be able to FTP or SFTP to my /var/www directory to edit my website. What could be my problem?\nEDIT: The specific error message when using FTP is 553 Could not create file.\n\nA: You should be able to change the permissions (by terminal on the machine or over SSH) by running this so that users other than root can access it:\nsudo chmod -R 757 /var/www\n\nor this so that it is owned by your user (which should be defined by $USER):\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www\n\nYou need to do this as only the owner+group can read, write and execute in /var/www, but other users can only read and execute - including the user you are using to try and the folders. \nFor more info, look at man chmod and man chown\n", "Q: How to install mysql, mysql workbench on Ubuntu 14.04 I am having problems trying to install mysql workbench.

This last you can accomplish be commenting out whatever you have in /etc/fstab that is mounting your /tmp partition.\n\nA: It's possible there's a file on /tmp which can't be unlinked because there are processes which still have an open handle.  You can list these processes with:\nsudo lsof +D /tmp\n\nWhen these processes exit you should be able to reclaim the space in /tmp.  However unless you are working on an embedded system with ~512M of space or less you can probably afford to have /tmp be larger.\nIf you want /tmp mounted on the same drive as / it's sufficient to comment out (add a leading # to the beginning of the line) the line containing /tmp from /etc/fstab, you'll need to either remount the appropriate partitions or reboot and let the system remount everything for you for the changes to take effect.\nIn order to mount /tmp on its own partition you need to create the partition of the right size in advance.  Luckily the things in /tmp should not be precious, so it should be enough to make a new partition, update fstab and reboot.\n", "Q: Cannot Install/Run Ubuntu without acpi=off & nomodeset etc I've had this problem for a while. I reluctently just used windows. I no longer wish to be without linux on my laptop. Why is this happening:\nEither with CD or USB install the installer cannot get past bootup (it stops at the kubuntu splash). With nomodeset it sometimes manges to get to the run or install option, but freezes shortly after. I eventually managed to get it installed by adding noapic acpi=off and nomodeset together as a last ditch effort.\nHowever with these options on its just, terrible. It doesn't show battery options, the keyboard, even on a light and fast keypress, occasionally spams keys as if I had been holding them down for several seconds. As well as not being able to install AMD drivers without adding --force. Which I just tried and now it starts without a GUI. Attempting to load the GUI with the startx command also fails.\nMy laptop is a Clevo P570WM with Intel i7-3970X CPU and 2x AMD Radeon HD 7970M GPU's.\nThe Ubuntu distro is Kubuntu 14.04 x64.\nEdit: Forgot to say I also tried to fix the problem by updating the kernel to 3.14.1-generic, didn't help.\n\nA: The solution was to reinstall kubuntu 14.04 with the standard desktop live CD with extra boot options other than acpi=off, as that option was the 1 that caused the issues I described. \nTo get the installer working It needed to be booted with nolapic to prevent freezing and nomodeset for the GUI to show. These options carry over to the installation.\nAfter that installing the AMD fglrx drivers from apt-get allows you to disable nomodeset and boot with only nolapic. That is achieved by editing /etc/default/grub as root, removing nomodeset and then running update-grub as root.\n\nOther problems that occurred were:\nThe installer freezing at 93% when copying logs. To remedy that simply reboot. Its late enough in the install process to be inconsequential. Change to another tty, eg tty1 by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 if the \"Try Kubuntu\" option wasn't used. Then run the reboot command.\nGrub failing to find the UUID of the boot partition. To remedy, reorder the HDD's in your bios such that the boot drive where kubuntu is installed is 1st. \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on USB stick - \"error loading operating system\" I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 on USB stick, then install some drivers and programs on it and use it when I need.\nI have one USB stick with Ubuntu 14.04 that I have used to install the OS on other PCs. The second USB stick is USB 3.0. I have both of them plugged in my PC and boot from the first one. \nDuring the installation I have formatted the USB 3.0 drive to Ext4 and install the OS on it. It took a long time (about 4 hours). Unfortunately, after restarting the PC and trying to boot from the USB 3.0 I am getting the following error:\nerror loading operating system\n\nAlso, I have Windows 8, Ubuntu 14.05 and Ubuntu 13.10 on my PC. I have restarted again hoping that he Ubuntu installed on the USB 3.0 will be found, but it had not been.\nCould you tell what I am doing wrong?\nThe USB 3.0 is 8 GB.\n\nA: the very likely cause is that the computer has not been set to boot from the USB. Go into the bios (f2 on most computers) and go over to the \"boot\" section and move \"USB device\" or whatever it is called on your computer to the top by the method that the bios explains (sometimes \"f5 is down f6 is up\" or \"u/d\")\n\nA: Mount your USB 3.0 stick and take a look at the files, using\nls -l\n\nIf you see MANY permissions of \"?\", you likely have a corrupted filesystem.  This happened to me on a USB 3.0 8G stick on a Toshiba Satellite S855 (about a year ago).  I could successfully install to a 4G stick (no swap, and blow by the complaint of not enough space, there is enough).  I could not successfully copy the 4G to the 8G either (when in either USB3.0 or USB 2.0 ports, but on another (older) machine using two USB 2.0 ports, the copy to the 8G stick worked, and has run flawlessly for a year.  Never figured out where the problem was, since there were too many new things (USB 3.0, the stick, the PC).  \n\nA: Hello and sorry for eventually write mistakes. I've had some problems during installation of Ubuntu on a USB drive and roll like a hard drive.\nTo successfully install and boot to from USB I successfully use the steps as described below.\n\n*\n\n*I used for test a 16GB 2.0 USB stick and a 4GB USB stick with Ubuntu image on it.\n\n*Use UEFI boot from bios for a easy installation.\n\n*Start your PC and click on Install Ubuntu, after few seconds in menu select Something else option and you will enter the drive menu. Don't forget to tick the option to install encoders for music players, etc.\n\n*In this menu my USB was listed as sda/sdb. Create a 4500GB partition as primary and select in the menu ex4 and /boot. Create a new partition after that as secondary also ext4 but only / in the window option. After that you have under the sda/sdb, sda/sdb1 (listed with /boot) and sda/sdb2 (with no mentions).\n\n*Down the menu select BOOT LOCATION on sda/sdb1 (this is the /boot partition) is very important\nafter that click on sda/sdb2 then click the Continue when prompted. Enter your desired full name, host name, username, and password (enter your password twice), and if you prefer to login automatically or enter your password every time you log in. After clicking Next, stand back and relax as the installer will handle the rest.\n\n\nTip: I didn't use the internet connection during installation.\n\nThis worked for me, though I don't guarantee this work for every PC.\n", "Q: determine if you have a 64bit processor I would like to find out on the console if my processor is 64 bit capable.\nI can find out that I have installed the 32 bit version of Ubuntu with\nuname -a\n\nIf it doesn't contain 64 at all, then I know I have a 32 bit kernel.\nBut how can I find out if I could install the 64 bit version as well?\n\nA: You can either run \nlscpu\n\nor\ncat /proc/cpuinfo\n\nThe most definative way would probably be to run:\nlscpu | grep op-mode\n\nThat will give you a nice 1 line return.\n", "Q: Accessing OneDrive files on a ntfs partition from Ubuntu 14.04 I have dual boot on my computer, Win 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04.

How can I access OneDrive files?\n\nA: So I found the craziest solution. Booted back to windows and started inspecting the files. Accidentally I had network traffic monitor opened up and each time I opened a file there was some incoming traffic happening. \nSo yes, you've guessed it. These inode/symlinks were not links to a file in some other location, but were actual links to Onedrive's cloud. OneDrive acted as sort of overlay and it mimicked files as if they were there, so I was able to open those files in Windows, but not in Ubuntu.\nWhat you have to do in order to access them from other OS than Windows is: open each and every file so it is downloaded on demand.

I figure I must be doing something wrong, but do not know what I should be doing instead. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  \nUpdate: I tried an experiment and turned the splash screens off by removing quiet splash and the boot time when down to 1 minute 36 seconds. There definitely seems to be an interaction between plymouth and fsck. Could they be competing for memory space or something like that?\nThanks!\n\nA: I solved my problem. The problem was as I suspected in the update to the question. I am running on an Atom processor @ 1.66 GHZ with 1 GB of memory and with the new splash screen the fsck and new plymouth splash screen were competing for resources more than my previous splash screen. I updated the plymouth code and simplified it and removed all unnecessary features and code and my fsck times returned to about 5 minutes.\n", "Q: \"Manage external tools\" not popping up dialog I enabled the \"External Tools\" plugin for gedit.

You must shrink one of the existing partition to make room for swap partition, and then create new partition and format it as swap area.\nAfter that, you must add your new swap to the /etc/fstab file.

The trouble, however, is that every time I run the anti-virus programme ClamTk, it uninstalls the Wine applications and I have to install them all over again. The only way I can avoid this is to individually exempt the files related to the Wine applications from quarantine, which is obviously a bother. So my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I configure ClamTk in such a way that it will automatically exempt the above-mentioned files? And if this is not possible with ClamTk, is there any other ant-virus program with which it can be done?\n\n*If the Wine applications are thus exempted, will it make the system vulnerable to malwares and viruses? \n\nA: On ubuntu, av software is usually not all that necessary so long as you don't install programs all that often outside of the official repos and use a sandboxed browser such as chrome. If you desperately need to remove a virus, or want something on hand, really just use something like malwarebytes boot disk or something, otherwise it is mostly unnecessary to run it and will mainly just cause errors and system lag.\n", "Q: Mounting windows share error So from my ubuntu 14.04 system I run the followig command:\n sudo mount.cifs -o username=dana //192.168.1.4/Users /mnt/\n\nIt asks for sudo password an the the output:\nno talloc stackframe at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory\nPassword for dana@//192.168.1.4/Users: \nmount error(13): Permission denied\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)\n\nNow, the windows 7 pc is password protected but I provided the right password I am shore of that.\n\nA: I see 2 questions here: \n1) The no talloc stackframe at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864: You can solve this issue by sudo apt-get remove libpam-smbpass OR by running pam-auth-update and deselect \"SMB password synchronization\" option in the pam-auth-update UI.

I tried the Live version of Ubuntu 14.04. The WiFi wasn't working, but I went on Additional Driver and I selected \"Using Broadcom 802.11 Linux STA wireless driver source from bcwl-kernel-source (proprietary)\" and it worked correctly.\nThen I installed Ubuntu 14.04, without partitions, I hadn't even activated Windows 8, and the WiFi wasn't working. I went on Additional Driver (this time in the Italian version) and I selected the same driver as before. Ubuntu asked me the password and at the end of the \"applying changes\" it deselected the Broadcom driver and automatically re-selected \"Do not use the device\".\nThe Live version still works.\nMaybe are there any packages downloaded during the installation that do not work correctly with the Broadcom driver?\nCan you help me, please?\n\nA: I copy the answer here.

In Windows, you can't put a ? in a file or directory name, because they are reserved characters for PHP GET functions and wildcards. But in Ubuntu, I can. I can name a file lol?.txt and access it properly like any other file. How come you can do this safely in Ubuntu, when you can't in Windows?\n\nA: The reasoning behind the first statement is false. That is a restriction from the DOS era, well before PHP or even HTTP was born. See the Wikipedia entry:\n\nThe long filename system allows a maximum length of 255 UCS-2 characters 3 4 including spaces and non-alphanumeric characters (excluding the following characters, which have special meaning within the COMMAND.COM command interpreter or the operating system kernel: \\ / : * ? \" < > |).\n\nThus it is more of a DOS restriction than a Linux/Unix permissiveness.\n", "Q: Turn off/sleep after script completion I have a little script.

Netbook specs are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make/Model: Acer V5-123\n\n*CPU: AMD E1-2100 with Radeon HD 8210\n\n*RAM: (came with 4GB, but, I upgraded to 8GB because I put /tmp into tmpfs)\n\n\nThis netbook came with Windows 8.1, but, I removed that entire HDD and put the Transcend 64GB SSD in its place. Then, I installed Xubuntu 14.04 onto the SSD.\n\nFirmware info for the Transcend SSD is as follows:\n\n$ sudo hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep -i firmware\n    Firmware Revision: SVN263\n\nI checked online and couldn't find any (new/updated) firmware files for this drive.\n\nBased on various notes found all over the web, I have done the following ssd optimizations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Left about 4GB of unused + unallocated space on the drive at the time of creating partitions (i.e., at the time of installation)\n\n*Added noatime for / to the fstab\n\n*Added \"fstrim -V /\" to rc.local and yes, my rc.local is always executable because I have a bunch of other things i do in it\n\n*Removed the fstrim from cron weekly\n\n*Made sure that the ff cache is 0\n\n\nNow, the real issue is that the drive is DEAD SLOW. I mean, booting up takes over a minute. Starting firefox, terminal, gedit, etc, take a lot of time. (Before you jump onto me ... yes, I did install a lot of software, including my favorite editor gedit, onto this system).\n\nMy only point of comparison at this point is time is my other notebook (fujitsu, core i3, 8GB, 500 GB magnetic HDD) running Xubuntu 13.10. That notebook boots up in under a minute, possibly in half a minute! But, this SSD netbook running Xubuntu 14.04 neither boots up quickly nor does it start apps quickly. Clearly, my assumption that an SSD will speed up things was wrong!!??\n\nAdditional info: Xubuntu kernel is 3.13.0-30-generic (64 bit).\n\n\nUpdate # 1\nI did two tests mentioned in the Arch wiki SSD Benchmarking page, as suggested by @Tuknutx. Each test was done four times:\n\n\n*\n\n* \"sudo hdparam -Tt /dev/sda\" generated \"average cache reads at 1030.7125 MBps\" and \"average buffered reads at 362.2075 MBps\"\n\n* dd read test with empty buffer cache generated \"average reads at 383.5 MBps\"\n\n\n\n\nI put together the following script (based on the contents of Arch wiki SSD Benchmarking page) to do the \"dd read test\":\n\n# first create a file \ndd if=/dev/zero of=./tempfile bs=1M count=1024 conv=fdatasync,notrunc\n\nfor i in 1 2 3 4\ndo\n  echo \"Run number ${i} ...\"\n  # then clear the buffer cache\n  sudo bash -c \"echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\"\n  # now read the file\n  dd if=./tempfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1024\n  echo\ndone\n\nI have not performed other tests mentioned on that page.\n\nUpdate # 2\nI did one thing after completing those tests: I had put \"vm.vfs_cache_pressure=50\" into my /etc/sysctl.conf, but, now I removed it. After that change and a reboot, the system seems to be booting up (from \"Acer\" logo to auto-login\") in just under 30s. But, my assumption was that things should be even faster than that because my magnetic HDDs are giving me those sort of boot times!!\n\nUpdate # 3\n\nI still have to follow @Lekensteyn suggestion of moving the SSD onto the core i3 notebook. I will do that soon and report here.\n\nShouldn't SSDs be blazing fast?\n \nGiven all that info, what would you recommend I do to speed up the drive.\n\nI would appreciate if you give me specific directions (text + commands) to run to speed up the drive.\n\nUpdate # 4\n\nPeople! Thanks a lot for your helpful replies. But, this SSD was so PATHETIC that I threw it out of the window ... no kidding. Let me know how to close this question as there is no point in wasting our time on this pethetically low quality product produced by Transcend and sold by Flipkart in India.\n\n\nAdios! Peace!\n\n\nA: The product sheet lists the following performance data for capacities \"32GB~256GB\":\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Seq. Read/Write 520MB/s, 290MB/s\n  \n*Max. 4k random file read 69,000 IOPS\n  \n*Max. 4k random file write 68,000 IOPS.\n  \n\nThe truth is that performance of SSDs greatly depends on the number of storage dies and that the smallest versions of a product line usually are slower and don't achieve the performance of the top model.\nKnowing that, the following data from geizhals/skinflint look more accurate and somewhat disappointing:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Read: 364MB/s\n  \n*Write: 73MB/s\n  \n*IOPS 4k read/Write: 33.096k/17.674k\n  \n\nYes, SSDs have faster access times, but transfer speeds of low end models can actually be lower than HDDs. You should read tests (with real world data and scenarios) of up to date available consumer hardware before shopping (The last one I read was about the 840 EVO mSATA release earlier this year). If you are searching for bargains, read tests of last years hardware too and make comparisons to pick the right product that meets your expectations.\n\ndd if=/dev/zero of=./tempfile bs=1M count=1024 conv=fdatasync,notrunc\n\nTo be polite, this is the most unreliable way of testing HDD performance and for SSDs it's even worse. The controller on the SSD probably saw all the incoming zeros and stored the information that you wrote 1 GiB of nothing. Also real data is not made up of ideal continuous streams in one portion of your storage space, therefore use real data and real scenarios.\n\nA: You are running fstrim  at boot time, so add  that time to your normal boot.  Run it manually to see how long it takes:\nsudo  fstrim -v /\n\nYou might be better off putting  the weekly cron job back, or just running fstrim manually.\nAlso,  you don't want the \"discard\"  option in fstab, that will impact performance.\n\nA: For the most part sluggishness in a netbook (even with an SSD) comes down to one of the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*An older SATA controller (v1 or v2), since a SSD can usually flood this channel, you'll generally only get about 2x the i/o over an HDD.\n\n*A really slow or otherwise limited CPU, usually the memory controllers, on-chip cache and other features are reduced compared to full featured counterparts.\n\n*A bloated OS install\n\n*Limited RAM\n\n\nGiven that you're running a light OS (Xubuntu) and you do have a SATA 3 controller, and have plenty of RAM I would suggest testing the drive in another system to be certain.\nEdited in response to comments\n\nA: I have a lot of performance issues with SSDs too. I know about trim, partition alignment, firmware and so on.  I have really poor performance with sandforce based controllers especially. On drives that have are slow, one solution works universally: use the JFS filesystem.\nUnfortunately on Debian-based systems, the shutdown process most always results in an unclean shutdown. This occurs frequently with upstart and always using systemd. However, if you don't mind running the risk of a corrupted filesystem, JFS always fixes it. You will find that these SSDs always work great in Windows, too.  I just bought a Phison S10 based SSD after hearing good things about that controller. Well, same issue.  Reinstall using JFS, works great.

Is there any way I may undo the problems a installation of a non-working driver may bring (e.g. no GUI) (like switching back to xserver-xorg-video-ati from command line as the Driver Manager does)\n\nA: Today I switched from xserver-xorg-video-ati to fglrx (to get Minecraft shaders to work) and it worked! I can change the screen brightness.\nI think this is due to the latest updates, but I don't even remeber what updates I installed in the last few weeks...\n", "Q: How to switch from Ubuntu gnome to Xubuntu I am currently using ubuntu GNOME as desktop environment and my computer is dual-booting between Ubuntu and and windows. I want to switch from GNOME to Xubuntu without losing any of my data. Is there any way to do that?\n\nA: Just install package xubuntu-desktop:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\nreboot and choose Xubuntu session in the login screen. The Ubuntu Gnome related stuff is still installed, so you always can switch to Gnome back if you change your mind.\nHowever, if you want to wipe-out Ubuntu Gnome for good (believe me, there is no reason to do so), then I would recommend to make backup of your data and then clean install of Xubuntu.\n", "Q: Launchpad: CLI \"Copying packages\" I'm using Launchpad to upload a .dsc, a debian.tar.gz and a .orig.tar.xz. The orig archive contains both i386 and amd64 files, and I use debian/rules to build different architecture packages. But it only builds on Trusty series. I would like to use the feature Copy packages, but I want it to be automated.\nCurrently, I have to connect to Launchpad, click View Package Details, click Copy Packages, and use: \n> Destination PPA:\n> This PPA\n\n> Destination series:\n> Utopic\n\n> Copy existing binaries\n\nIs there a way to automate all this \"copy the existing binaries from the older series to the new series\", or to do it through CLI to use it in a script ?\nThank you\n\nLeads : \n\n\n*\n\n*Q: Maybe ubuntu-archive-tools can help me do that, it seem to have a copy-package python script ?\nA: It doesn't work with that: python copy-package -y -b --ppa-name=myname/myppa --to-ppa-name=myname/myppa -s trusty --to-suite=utopic -e versionofpackage\n\n*Q: Maybe if I change my changelog entry from trusty ; urgency=low to utopic trusty ; urgency=low ?\nA: It doesn't work : Unable to find distroseries: utopic trusty. Further error processing not possible because of a critical previous error.\n\n*Q: Build 1 orig.tar.xz and multiple .dsc & debian.tar.gz\nA: I currently build an incremented version-number (i.e. mypackage-1.1.0-0trusty0 and mypackage-1.1.0-0utopic0), but the solution could be better since I have to reupload the orig.tar.xz for each and that it takes twice the place in the PPA since the built .deb aren't considered as a copy of each other but 2 packages.\n\nA: copy-package is good for this, but the correct modern invocation would be:\n./copy-package --from=~myname/ubuntu/myppa --from-suite=trusty --to=~myname/ubuntu/myppa --to-suite=utopic -b -y packagename\n\n(As saiarcot895 correctly noted, you needed to separate --ppa and --ppa-name, but this was always very confusing which was among the reasons we added the unified --from and --to options for specifying archives.  Also, you neglected to include the package name, which was probably why you got no output; more recent versions of copy-package check for this.)\n", "Q: Installing single OS Ubuntu 14.04 in EFI mode I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a Tohiba laptop from a iso image written to USB. The original OS was Windows 8, but when I was installing the Ubuntu, it said that no OS is detected. I did not care, as I wanted to completely remove the Windows and install single OS, Ubuntu.\nInstallation was smooth as usual, but there was a problem in creating the EFI boot. Now the system does not boot to Ubuntu. I tried Boot-Repair, but no success.\nHow can I freshly install ubuntu with a correct boot?\n\nA: If you haven't already done so, disable Secure Boot on your computer. Then try preparing a CD-R or USB flash drive with my rEFInd boot manager. (Image files for both are available on its downloads page.) Boot to the rEFInd medium. You should see at least one option for a Linux kernel (with a name beginning with vmlinuz) in its menu. Try it. If it boots, install the Debian-package version of rEFInd (either downloaded and installed manually via dpkg or via the PPA described at the bottom of the rEFInd downloads page).\n", "Q: Plugged in, battery not charging, not running down This morning, after being plugged in all night, my Asus N550J, Xubuntu Saucy, showed 28% battery. \nWhen it is plugged in, it shows the Charging icon, yet the percent charge never goes up.\nWhen it is unplugged, the charge goes down -- now it is at 15%. \nI tried restarting. I tried another AC adaptor. No difference.\nWhat is the problem here? Is the  battery in fact charging correctly, but the indicator is failing to ever go up when it is charging? \nOr is there a real  problem with battery charging? (But if so, why does  the  computer last indefinitely on AC power, and why does the indicator show \"Charging\"?)\n(As a maybe-related issue: 3 days ago the fan got really loud, intermittently. The laptop was not noticeably hotter than usual when this occured. But that loudness stopped.)\nEDIT: Answer below.\n\nA: Just hold down the button 7 seconds until it shuts down, then another 10/20 seconds. The orange battery light may go from blinking to steady orange. That fixes it.\n", "Q: How to understand configuration files syntax?

It exports video to mini-dvd. Well I recently found the camera and its discs. However, I have lost its batteries and its adaptor, so I cannot turn it on. Unfortunately, many of the discs I had used are un-finalized and my computer does read them as blank dvd-s. As I cannot use the camera to finalize them, I used testdisk - photorec but the result was approximately 600 small .mpg videos and some .png photos (hahaha Obviously I didn't rec so many files! :p ). \nAn idea is to use wine to install cdroller or something.. but generally I don't want to use windows software anymore, at least in my ubuntu!   \nAny ideas how to finalize the unfinalized dvds? \n\nA: I have used ISObuster in my windows days to accomplish that.  It will allow you to do data recovery of your video files that are on your DVD's.  You can try that under Wine, or look at AcetoneISO.\n", "Q: Voice Recorder for 14.04 For few days I've been trying to find a voice recorder, but I'm frustrated.  \nSkype working fine and alsamixer\n\nI'm using pulseaudio.\nWhen I open the below softwares, my microphone stops working, even skype doesn't work. I only hear noise. If I uninstall the softwares and reset pulseaudio it becomes normal again.  \nTried Audacity -- I hear noise only.\nTried audio-recorder -- Recording but lots of noise.\nI need a good working software to record voice.\nNeed help.\n\nA: Try Audio Recorder.\nAudio Recorder is a recording program, that allows user to record audio from various sources, and allows you to save recording in various formats.\nTo install, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:osmoma/audio-recorder\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install audio-recorder\n\nFor Ubuntu versions higher than 15.10 there is a new ppa which can be found at https://launchpad.net/~audio-recorder/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:audio-recorder/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install audio-recorder\n\nMake sure your microphone is connected to your computer and well configured. Run this command: alsamixer to check your microphone level.\nAlso you can use sox to record your voice, it can be installed from the Ubuntu Software Center, r install it from the terminal with this command:\nsudo apt-get install sox\n\nEdit\nYou can also look at Ardour.\nArdour is a powerful digital audio workstation that gives you everything you need to record, edit, mix, and arrange professional audio.Ardour\nTo download, and more info, check out their website\nOther programs to look at are MHWaveEdit, and KWave\n\nA: If you are looking for only voice recording I'd suggest QARecord. It's a very simple application built with QT. \n\nA: Make sure that your microphone sound level is not muted and that you have your microphone selected and turned up in Audacity.\n\nA: You can very simply record audio through terminal using the pre-installed tool arecord.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)\n\n*Run the command\narecord filename.wav\n\n\n*Your audio recording has started, press Ctrl+C to stop the recording.\n\n*Your voice recording has been saved as filename.wav in your home directory.    \nEDIT:\nIf you have multiple inputs you can find them using\narecord -l\n\nwhich will list hardware devices that can then be selected using the -D flag.

It is simple and just records input from the mic.\nIt is packaged 16.04 in the universe repo (named gnome-sound-recorder).\n\nA: Yet another program to record voice is fmedia.  You can start recording with a single command:\nfmedia --record --out=rec.flac\n\nand stop recording by pressing Ctrl+C.\nfmedia uses ALSA, so it works even if PulseAudio is not installed on your system.\n\nA: I know this is a hack, but it's the solution I opted for after trying quite a few of the solutions here and it worked perfectly.\nI used the default voice recorder on my Android phone. There was no background noise (which I had with other software) and the interface was relatively friendly.\nTo transfer the files to my computer over wifi I used ES File Explorer (see section 16 here).\nTo convert the files from 3gp to mp3:\nsudo apt-get install libav-tools\navconv -i YourInputFileName.3gp -c:a libmp3lame YourOutputFileName.mp3\n\nOr to mass convert all:\ncd /path/to/your/folder/\nfor x in `ls *.3gp`; do avconv -i $x -c:a libmp3lame $x.mp3; done\n# If I wasn't too lazy I'd remove the .mp3 extension too.\n\nAnd to concatenate to one recorded file I used mp3wrap (install also with apt-get)\n\nA: ffmpeg + module-echo-cancel\nI have managed to achieve good sound quality with low background noise by:\n\n*\n\n*install and enable module-echo-cancel as shown at: https://askubuntu.com/a/765024/52975\n\n\n*record with ffmpeg:\nsudo apt install ffmpeg\nffmpeg -f alsa -i default -t 30 out.wav\n\nI'm not sure why, but some recording methods don't seem to pick up the noise cancelling, on my tests so far:\n\n*\n\n*arecord: no\n\n*recordmydesktop: no\n\n*kazam: yes\n\nbut it might be a question of passing the right command line option to the ones that didn't.\nAnother possible advantage of ffmpeg arecord is that it might support more output formats/effects and save that directly to the output file. I'm not sure if this is a good idea (delays due to encoding/effects processing?), but it seems to work, e.g. save to mp3 and add a tremolo effect:\nffmpeg -f alsa -i default -af tremolo=d=0.8 -t 30 out.wav\n\nMaybe if you know how filters work it is possible to do something from ffmpeg itself, e.g. with highpass/lowpass: https://superuser.com/questions/733061/reduce-background-noise-and-optimize-the-speech-from-an-audio-clip-using-ffmpeg\nTested in Ubuntu 20.04.\n", "Q: Upstart does not satisfy resources usage requirements set by \"limit\" stanza I am experiencing problems with Upstart.\nI am trying to start the transmission-daemon (a BitTorrent client) with a limit on the maximum resident set size (rss).\nThis is the /etc/init/transmission-daemon.conf file:\nstart on (filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=lo)\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\n# give time to send info to trackers\nkill timeout 30\n\nlimit rss 1024 2048\n\nsetuid debian-transmission\nsetgid debian-transmission\n\nrespawn\n\npre-start script\n\n  # stop job from continuing if no config file found for daemon\n  [ ! -f /etc/default/transmission-daemon ] && { stop; exit 0; }\n\n  # source the config file\n  . /etc/default/transmission-daemon\n\n  # stop job from continuing if admin has not enabled service in\n  # config file.\n  [ \"$ENABLE_DAEMON\" != 0 ] || { stop; exit 0; }\n\nend script\n\nscript\n  . /etc/default/transmission-daemon\n\n  exec /usr/bin/transmission-daemon -f $OPTIONS\nend script\n\nAs you can see, I have added the limit (rss should be expressed in KiBs if I am not wrong) just atop the script.\nWhen I run the service with sudo service transmission-daemon start, I can see with top that the single transmission-daemon process uses much more resident memory than the limit I have set above, and saturates all the available memory.\nPlease note that this does not work even if I use dumb limits such as limit rss 1 2.\nUPDATE: It seems that the correct unit is Bytes and not KiB or KBs.

Thanks.\n\nA: Before you consider anything else, ask yourself \"What's wrong with SSH?\" a hundred times. It's secure, supports better authentication (omgwhy are you still using passwords?!) and doesn't result in a server-side language running in a capacity that can su up to a privileged account. \nThat said, there are a number of options for providing web-access to a terminal console. shellinabox or webmin seem to be the most viable options. \nI wouldn't trust any of them.

If there's a way to install an older version of Wine on Ubuntu 14.04 it would suit me fine, as I remember WinBUGS running with Wine 1.4, & I don't use Wine for running anything else.\n(I already use the alternative MCMC software, JAGS, but I'll be needing WinBUGS for a course.)\n\nA: I followed @saiarcot895's instructions to make a 32-bit Wine set-up, but got the same error. I then noticed the instructions here: \"If installing on a 64-bit machine, you should download a zipped version of the whole file structure and unzip it into Program Files or wherever you want it.\"—rather than using the installer. So I extracted the file to .wine/drive_c/Program Files, & now WinBUGS works. Not sure if both those steps were necessary or just the latter.\n", "Q: No smooth scrolling on Chrome for Ubuntu I did enable the #enable-smooth-scrolling flag in Chrome and rebooted both Chrome and the machine numerous times, but scrolling in Chrome is still just as jumpy. I know it's not hardware issue, as my machine can handle smooth scrolling of huge .pdf documents just fine, but Chrome stutters even on simplest webpage. Is there an additional flag I should enable or perhaps a some touchpad configuration I should make to see Chrome on Ubuntu scrolling just as smooth as on Windows?\n\nA: While on the flags page, there are two features that you need to enable. An easy way to do this is by searching for Smooth Scrolling. The first is Threshold Composing, enable that, then enable the Smooth Scrolling feature.\n", "Q: How to leave prompt when accidentally enter Grave accent character?

This is because at least one of the packages it depends on (libopus0) hasn't been marked as being co-installable with another architecture of the package. (See here for the specifications of this). Because this hasn't been set, apt will refuse to install the i386 version and the amd64 version.\nI would file a bug on the package here, and link to that section of the spec.

Or, what's xcb and qt and how do they solve the riddles of my life? tl;dr is at the bottom for those not wanting reasons, just questions.\nI have the latest TeamSpeak client downloaded from the site of the authors of said program. I've managed, after a load of fiddling then some searching, that a .run file is stupidly packaged and needs modifying to be an executable instead, so I did that and ran the bleeding thing. It gave me a folder full of useless twiddle and files that were named as if they were thought up by a hyper-active, Star Trek addicted seven year old doped up on a recent 10 season marathon and various amphetamines. \nI got a bit frustrated at the lack of working files and then went online where I noticed people were just telling others to run a file called \"ts3client_linux_x86\". That's swell, and all, but that file just flashes a terminal on my screen for less than a second. So I set about trying to capture it on a print-screen to as to actually read what it's saying.\nAfter about 5 or 6 minutes of trying, I finally managed to immortalise Bigfoot's purple and white box of a brother, only to find out that kid's back at it again, and this time he's got his phasers set to acronym.

Every single thread I found. Nothing helped and no one seemed to be getting the idea that what they were on about is useless to the people asking them questions. When a kid asks you what life means, you tell them something simple like \"having fun\" or \"making your mark on the world\"; you don't tell them it's an existential crisis that mankind has faced for eons as the answer is entirely subjective, then leave them wondering what \"exissensul cry sis\" means - the rest of your drivel long forgotten.\n\ntl;dr, what body part of this OS do I need to suck to get something working?

(These links probably won't tell you much :P) You should have XCB already installed. Qt may be not installed, but TeamSpeak should either install it or bring his own copy with itself.\nWhen googling, I found few possible solutions, but you would need some Linux knowledge to try them out. I recommend that you start a thread at their forum and ask for help. Either you broke your system (not likely) or TeamSpeak is faulty (likely).

I am new here and even dont have expertise in Linux, but very much willing and excited to learn Linux. I need to install Tor anyhow on my laptop (Ubuntu). Please any help and support from anyone shall be highly appreciated.\n\nA: No need to install. Download the tar.gz file from Tor website; extract and run the file start-tor-browser.\nYou may also want to make a .desktop file for it to easily start it from Dash or lock to Launcher. To do this, make a new text file and paste the following lines:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=2.0\nName=Tor Bundle\nComment=Tor browser proxy\nExec=/path/to/file/start-tor-browser\nIcon=tor-browser\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Network;\nX-Unity-IconBackgroundColor=#855e9d\n\nSave the file as tor.desktop and move it to ~/.local/share/applications (make one if it doesn't exist). Then go to file Properties and under Permissions tab, check Allow executing file as program.\nAlso you want an icon for it. You can save the following picture as tor-browser to the folder ~/.icons – note the name is the same as what inserted for Icon= in the .desktop file.\n\nTo know more about .desktop files, see the documentations.\n\nA: To complement the comment linking to How to install Tor?: just installing Tor is not enough to use it. You must also set your apps to use Tor or otherwise they will use normal Internet. The easiest option is to download Tor Browser Bundle (if you just want to circumvent some restrictions) or Whonix (if you need 99% privacy, for example if your life may be in danger if someone finds out what do you do online).\nAnd just using these doesn't make you invisible.

I'm building a virtual test network in VirtualBox where I have a Ubuntu server installed. However, VirtualBox doesn't have an option to tell other computers to use a specific VM IP as the DHCP server.\n\nA: The default VirtualBox network mode, NAT, will not allow this. It creates a virtual network between the host and the guest, it doesn't connect the guest directly to the real network.\nYou are probably looking for Bridged networking. It will connect the virtual machine to the same network as the host, allowing it to use the same DHCP server and have an IP addresses in the same range.\nYou should set this in Virtual Box preferences, network tab:\n\nYou can also use NAT Network, a new experimental mode where all the Virutal Machines share a (virtual too) network. By default NAT Network offers it's own DHCP server, you can disable it from the command line:\nVBoxManage natnetwork modify -t nat-int-network -h off\n\nWhere nat-int-network is your internal network name (this is just the default value)\n", "Q: how can I install ubuntu on dell inspirion 15z I am trying to install ubuntu 14 on a dell inspirion 15z with intel chip.

I was able to prevent it from starting automatically by removing skypeforlinux.desktop from ~/.config/autostart/. I'm using lubuntu; the location of your autostart folder may vary. You can find by using: \n$ locate skypeforlinux.desktop\n\nYou'll really only want to delete the copy in the directory called autostart, otherwise you won't be able to start the app from the icon.\nI'm assuming that the next time you actually, intentionally run Skype (I hope, for the sake of your sanity, that this day is far in the future) that it will try to put that file back.

Detailed instructions below.\nOpen up terminal and start alsamixer:\nalsamixer  \n\nYou should see a handful of tall columns with labels underneath, something like: Master, Headphone, Speaker, PCM, Mic, Mic Boost, S/PDIF, S/PDIF Default PC, Beep, Auto-Mute Mode, Internal Mic Boost\nIf you don't see these categories (specifically, if you don't see an \"Auto-Mute Mode\"), then try selecting a different sound card with F6. In my case I had to select HDA Intel PCH. \nNotice \"Enabled\" above Auto-Mute Mode. Navigate to that item with the left/right arrow keys, and set it to Disabled with the up/down arrow keys.

I'm at a loss now after losing my project data.\nI had 3 NTFS partitions other than the Win 7 and Win 8 partitions.\nCan I recover my data? If possible how?\nThanks\n\nA: Data recovery is very unlikely if you are using Ubuntu for some time. There are chances that your data is overwritten and hence available to recover in laboratory conditions, but definitely not in the home environment.\nAnyway you can try to rebuild partition table to get access to previous partitions. But I assume, that if you didn't backed up your project files, then you didn't have backup of partition table as well. You can try to set up new partition table that is exactly the same as before, but it still don't guarantee any success.\nAnother option is the help of some data recovery company, but such services are extremely expensive, so if your project is not a life and death matter, I would not recommend it.\nWell, to sum up, the best advice:\nMake a backup of your important files. Always.\n\nA: There is a very long post about recovering lost partitions, which I believe can be applied to your situation.

I only bought it and fitted it in the last week. However, it has been causing a lot of issues. Before I bought this PCI card, I researched online to see if it was compatible with Ubuntu. I saw a lot of reports of it causing older versions (with older kernels) to freeze after a few minutes of operation, but I also saw a lot of those reports which also said this problem was fixed in a version of Ubuntu much older than 14.04 (around 12.04 if I recall). I also saw reports that this card works perfectly in 12.10. So I thought it would be fine, considering the amount of people reporting it works perfectly.\nAt first, I thought it had worked, it connected straight away with no problems, but after a while it began to disconnect itself after a few minutes of usage, and once it had disconnected itself you could not re-connect because the amount of networks available in the menu had drastically dropped from around 5 or 6, to just 2. Unfortunately, my router was not one of those 2. And from then on, the majority of the time it was only those 2 that would show up. And sometimes it was just 1. Sometimes, though, my router would show up, and it would connect just fine. However, after a few minutes of usage we end up back to square one.\nI've looked around a lot, tried various solutions to do with the this card and similar and none of them seem to have worked. Before I go and buy a different card, I want to see if a bespoke question might get some answers. This is actually the second card I have tried now too.\nHere are some generic points of interest related to the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*The operating system is Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit.\n\n*The card is a TP-LINK TL-WN751ND.\n\n*The chipset is a AR9227.\n\n*The card is near-on brand new, and is the second card I have tried with Ubuntu.\n\n\nAlso, on a side note, does anybody know of any PCI (not PCI-E, or USB) wifi cards that are known to work without a hitch on Ubuntu?\nRegards\n\nA: We are changing the country code first, do:\nsudo sed -i 's/^REG.*=$/&UK/' /etc/default/crda\n\nThen do:\necho \"options ath9k nohwcrypt=1\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf\nsudo modprobe -rfv ath9k\nsudo modprobe -v ath9k\n\nIn the router set your encryption to WPA2 not mixed mode.\nChange the channel to 1 or 11 they usually work best.\nSave the router configuration, then reboot router and computer and unplug wired connection.\nSet your wireless settings in network manager to match the screenshots. Then reboot.\n", "Q: Boot Clonezilla ISO from GRUB2 Menu I want to use the most current Clonezilla iso file to backup the partition that contains the Ubuntu operating system that is stored on partition one of my computer's hard drive and I want to be able to boot the iso file from the Grub2 menu.\nHow would I set this up?\n\nA: *\n\n*Put Clonezilla ISO file in root / directory.\n\n*Open the terminal and run:\nsudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\n\n*Insert the following text at the end of the file:\nmenuentry \"Clonezilla Live\" {\n set isofile=\"/clonezilla-live-2.2.3-10-amd64.iso\"\nloopback loop (hd0,1)$isofile\nlinux (loop)/live/vmlinuz boot=live live-config nolocales edd=on nomodeset\nocs_live_run=\\\"ocs-live-general\\\" ocs_live_extra_param=\\\"\\\"   ocs_live_keymap=\\\"\\\" ocs_live_batch=\\\"no\\\" ocs_lang=\\\"\\\" vga=788   ip=frommedia nosplash toram=filesystem.squashfs findiso=$isofile\ninitrd (loop)/live/initrd.img\n}\n\n\n*Save file, exit and open GRUB's config file:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nComment out the line GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 so it looks like:\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\nMake sure that the line GRUB_TIMEOUT=[some number] has a number >0, for example, 10\n\n\n*Save file and exit and run\nsudo update-grub2\n\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES:\n⠀- /clonezilla-live-2.2.3.10-amd64.iso -- change the name of iso file to match the one you have.\n⠀- (hd0,1) may be different for you depending on how you installed Ubuntu. \n\n(hdX,Y)  X = hard drive #, Y = partition.\n\n⠀You can also see my YouTube video for the above procedure: Boot Clonezilla ISO from Grub2 Menu.\n\nA: I tried the solution provided by JJ Avila but modification in /etc/grub.d/40_custom didn't worked for me. \nThis what i've done.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy clonezilla iso to / (root) directory\nsudo cp /path/to/your_clonezilla_iso /\n\n*Run sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nEDIT:\nmenuentry \"Clonezilla live\" {\nset isofile=\"/clonezilla-live-20160503-xenial-i386.iso\"\nloopback loop $isofile\nlinux (loop)/live/vmlinuz boot=live union=overlay username=user config components quiet noswap nolocales edd=on nomodeset nodmraid ocs_live_run=\\\"ocs-live-general\\\" ocs_live_extra_param=\\\"\\\" keyboard-layouts= ocs_live_batch=\\\"no\\\" locales= vga=788 ip=frommedia nosplash toram=filesystem.squashfs findiso=$isofile\ninitrd (loop)/live/initrd.img\n} \n\nsave & exit.\n\n\n*Run sudo update-grub2\nNOTE: iso in root directory that's why \nset isofile=\"/clonezilla-live-20160503-xenial-i386.iso\" \n\n(Here change name of your iso)\nREFERENCE: Clonezilla Live on Hard Drive\n", "Q: 3.13.0-30 kernel issue will not log in / sign in I did a recent update with the new kernel 3.13.0-30 seemed fine to start with booted to the desktop but after sign in just hung with only mouse inputs seeming to work and nothing else no menu our header bar.\nI can boot ok with 3.13.0-29 and use the laptop but other than I'm pretty stuffed with the recent kernel any ideas? \nspecs:  \n\n\n*\n\n*laptop: satellite C660D  \n\n*Processor: AMD E-450 APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics × 2  \n\n*graphics: VESA: WRESTLER\n\n\nA: There's a pretty old post about having just the background and mouse, and supposedly some fixes for it.

Ubuntu Unity has some issues that I'm not sure if they should be reported as bugs or is just my fad. \n\n\n*\n\n*Run a command (Global Shortcut Alt + F2) cannot find anything for Files, Calculator, Text editor, Screenshot etc. You have to type nautilus, gedit ... instead, but when you write fire, firefox pops as a result. Is this panel a search or a run command?  Because panel looks almost the same as the Search your computer ...  (Global shortcut Super key). Fells weird to lookup the same program with different keywords in a similar function panel. \nI know that in this examples Files is a fancy label and nautilus is the actual program but the inconsistency is not appealing.  \n\n*Any opened context menu blocks any global shortcuts. Open a context menu with right click and than press volume down hotkey, you have to discard first the context menu. \n\n*\"Files/nautilus\" search is striped down just to the name and the file type, what about content, date, size etc? \n\n*Add an online account from settings, each time Search your computer ... is opened you're asked to enter the password to unlock the keyring. Thats OK, but the fact that you cannot proceed with the initial task unless you enter the password is very annoying. Pressing cancel doesn't help either, it will pop out again and again for each account. The dialog also blocks any interaction with other programs opened, only the mouse pointer works. \nI would like to know if you experience the same issues and if you do, do you find them annoying as well? \nSome info about my installation : \n$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 13.10\nRelease:        13.10\nCodename:       saucy\n$ unity --version\nunity 7.1.2\n\n\nA: 1.Run a command, it means run a command and a program name is not a command most of the time.\n2.I would guess this may be a gnome or gtk issue/feature. I can use shorcuts while using context menu in Firefox and LibreOffice.\n3.You can select the column view to show files details and in Nautilus preferences you can set which details to show. It is true Nautilus has been striped of many of it's features but you can also try Nemo, a Nautilus fork that keeps many of it's features.\n4.Sounds like you have automatic login enabled, just disable automatic login and you should have no issues.\n\nA: IMO Unity is a bug from the outset...:P. Those are not really bugs, simply a lack of added features that have become the norm on other systems. I don't think they have the same keywords/tags or at least the universal desktop search only recognizes the actual names instead of how the desk search in the menu uses a more complete system of scanning. This allows people to both be frustrated and unity to not lock up constantly.\n", "Q: How much hard drive space should I allocate to Ubuntu? I am setting up VirtualBox and I am allocating 4 GB RAM (on my 16 GB Windows machine) to Ubuntu. However, I also need to choose a hard drive size. \nI'm not sure what to choose. I want to experiment with LAMP servers, do some coding/scripting, etc, but I don't know a reasonable amount to allocate. 8 GB seems to be too limiting, but is 25 GB too much? \nI have ~250 GB hard drive space left on my hard drive, also.\n\nA: Just set the disk to dynamic and choose about 100GB, then the drive will grow as you need it to but not larger then 100GB and it will stay small and only expand as you add more applications.\nFor example if your install size is 10GB then that will be the actual size of the disk but it will be able to grow as needed up to 100GB or whatever you set the limit at.\nDynamic hard drive space is explained in the last image.\n \n\nA: I think the default value is set at 20GB. But if you are only going to set up a LAMP stack and do some coding you don't really need that much space. I would go for 10-15GB. Which is alot more then you probably need. \n", "Q: compatibility of 14.04 and thinkpad carbon x1 2014 I am not sure what Generation are those X1 laptops, so here are the specs: shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/#techspecs\nAnyone with 14.04 would like to share his/her experience?\nI would like to buy one but couldn't find a lot of information about 14.04.\nAny issues and workarounds? Pablo mentioned 14.04 with 2nd Gen, but I am not sure what Generation are the recent X1.\nThanks!\n\nA: feel free to install any type of ubuntu, that computer can run it no problem. Anything with over 2gb of ram is blazing fast on kubuntu IMO, lubuntu goes down to 512mb without much stuttering\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Galaxy note 3 ? I have Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I wanna install Ubuntu on my phone.\nIs that possible ? My phone has 64G SD Card.\nThanks.\n\nA: Just to be clear, the note 3 is not a galaxy nexus, even if it is by the same manufacturer. It would not be a full installation unless you have a way to dock it, in which case you would just use \"ubuntu for android\" which does not depend on model or manufacturer. If you are talking about ubuntu touch, you have to check for support, which is something that I do not see. A better place to check for a custom support version would be xda-developers.com\n", "Q: Dual boot 14.04 and windows 7 but windows not booting I installed 14.04 along side windows 7.

I partitioned my HD with 300 GB for XP and 1 TB for Ubuntu.  I installed v.14.04 successfully.  When booting I get a menu choice defaulting to Ubuntu and then XP.  Selecting XP only brings me back to the boot menu.  Can the XP boot be repaired.  As it is I can only get to my XP data through Ubuntu.  I would like to have a choice that works.  I could not install Ubuntu along side XP because the only given choice was another HD not the partition.\n\nUpdate\nI ran boot-repair and TestDisk trying to repair bootup.

I also ran chkdsk /R. None of this helped; I got the same result.\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\nA: You should be able to restore XP by performing a \"Chkdsk -f\" from a Windows command prompt. Now of coarse since you are unable to open XP itself, you will need to get to the cp using a Windows installation disk, or a boot disk like Active@ Boot Disk by lsoft. Unfortunately you cannot perform a Chkdsk from Linux.\n\nA: Probably something wrong with GRUB.\nTry re-installing your bootloader (GRUB).\nRun the following in your terminal on Ubuntu:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: Unable to login into any account How it happened\nMy computer was becoming very unresponsive and I could not close any applications to free memory so I held the power button until the computer turned off.

It created a spotify folder in /opt/. My faenza icon theme seems to work for almost all supported apps except for spotify. I tried changing the icons manually in the /opt/spotify/icons folder and that didn't work either. \nThe spotify executable's icon inside /usr/share/applications changed but whenever the app's icon appears in the launcher, it's still the original spotify logo. I even went to the root folder and tried searching for any other instances of the original logo, but couldn't find any. \nHere is a screenshot of the issue:\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: The issue lies with the naming of the spotify icon. Faenza and other iconsets name their Spotify icons spotify while the Spotify launcher expects an icon named spotify-client.\nThere are two ways to solve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /opt/spotify/spotify-client/spotify.desktop and replace Icon=spotify-client with Icon=spotify.\nThe problem with this method is that your changes will be reverted next time Spotify is updated.\n\n*Modify your icon theme to include a spotify-client icon by creating a new symlink to spotify.svg:\n sudo ln -s '/usr/share/icons/Faenza/apps/scalable/spotify.svg' '/usr/share/icons/Faenza/apps/scalable/spotify-client.svg'\n\nAgain, if you happen to update your Faenza theme you might lose these changes. \nTo preserve the changes to your icon theme you could copy /usr/share/icons/Faenza to $HOME/.local/share/icons.\n", "Q: Can't use Seagate Backup Plus external hard drive on this laptop So somebody is letting me use their laptop with Ubuntu 13.10 on it, as my own laptop is currently needing repairs. I'm very new to Linux in general, so it's like I'm learning computers all over again.\nAt the moment, I would like to use my 3 TB Seagate External Hard drive, but it doesn't seem to be working on here. For a while, I got no reaction from plugging it in aside from the Hard Drive turning on; the laptop didn't seem to acknowledge its existence. Just briefly today, however, it noticed it when I plugged it in. It then disappeared, and I received this \nAs I mentioned before, I'm very new to Linux as a whole, so I can't derive a whole lot of information from this. Another problem is that the person letting me use this laptop doesn't know their password, so I'm restricted from using a lot of commands. If at all possible, I'd like a method that doesn't require the password, or if you happen to know how, a way to reset the password.\nIf you need me to provide any more information, I'll do as much as I can. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I had the same issue recently. When I googled I found out that I need to boot up with Windows and run ckdsk /f or probably the same thing from GUI, via properties menu of a disk. I could believe that Ubuntu can not fix it itself...But it really does the trick.\nNTFS is a closed source Microsoft file system, and you'll need Windows to repair it, by running chkdsk /f, as suggested. So, Ubuntu is not going to make as assumption what caused the changes on NTFS that it looks strange, and moreover not going to fix it relying on assumptions.\nGive it a try.\n\nA: Either run chkdsk from Windows or\nsudo umount /dev/<partition>\nsudo fsck.ntfs /dev/<partition>\n\nfrom linux.\n\nA: Recently did this exactly thing with WD Passport 4Tb.\nIt appears that you removed the external HD before Ubuntu said you could. You have to eject it and wait for the message that says its safe to remove .. not to be confused with message that says it is writing to it.\nThe \"chkdsk /f\" on Windows will make the drive usable again, but lots of stuff can be missing when it's over.  I lost 2.5Tb of data.  Make sure you run \"chkdsk /f E:\" on your drive at least twice.\n\nA: I fixed mine by entering the BIOS and made sure my devices were categorized properly.  The Seagate Backup was not categorized at all.  I selected it to be a HDD, a Hard Disk Drive.  Saved the change and exited.  Its been working fine ever since.

When the\n  file is outside the specified directory-tree, PHP will refuse to\n  access it.\n\nIn order to allow your script to access /tmp and other path you need, modify your /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf and add:\n  php_admin_value open_basedir /usr/share/phpmyadmin/:/etc/phpmyadmin/:/var/lib/phpmyadmin/:/usr/share/php/php-gettext/:/usr/share/javascript/:/usr/share/php:/tmp/ \n\nAlways according to the php documentation include_path:\n\nSpecifies a list of directories where the require, include, fopen(),\n  file(), readfile() and file_get_contents() functions look for files.\n  The format is like the system's PATH environment variable: a list of\n  directories separated with a colon in Unix or semicolon in Windows.\n\nUsing apache configuration file is possible to set the variable using the directive php_value:\n    php_value name value \n\nIn your case, add:\n   php_value include_path .:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear\n\nAt the end, restart your apache.\n", "Q: basic outgoing mail function I've looked for tutorials and guides about this topic but seems really complicated to make it work.\nI'm working with php, I would like to send mails in some scenarios such as password recovery and email confirmation...

Making this modem get detected by Ubuntu needs an extra step since Ubuntu 12.04. I have to type in at the terminal: sudo modprobe usbserial vendor=0x1c9e product=0x9e00 and after waiting a bit the modem shows up in the Network Manager list, from where I use Edit Connections to type in the username and password.\nThe modem does connect to the internet but this time I noticed that the speed is limited to 123 kBps instead of the 300 kBps that I get when using Windows 7 or Windows 8.\nThis problem was not there, as far as I am aware, in previous versions of Ubuntu. This speed limitation of 123 kBps also exists in Linux Mint 17 (both Cinnamon and Mate).\nHow do I go about diagnosing what is actually causing this 3G modem to limit its speed to 123 kBps when used in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: I tried this method for my BSNL EVDO (PRITHIVI UE100):\nFirst connect the device to your laptop/PC.\nRun the command\nls /dev/tty*\n\nThere should be a device ls /dev/ttyACM0 (or a name similar to that)\nTo verify, remove the device and run ls /dev/tty* again to check that device has vanished :)\nNow you need a nifty program called 'wvdial'\ninstall it using\nsudo apt-get install wvdial\n\nAfter wvdial has been installed we need to provide a configuration file for wvdial. Create one using\nsudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf\n\nEnter the following data into the file\n[Dialer Defaults]\nInit1 = ATZ\nInit2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0\nModem Type = Analog Modem\nBaud = 460800\nModem = /dev/ttyACM0\nISDN = 0\nPhone = #777\nPassword = xxxxxxxxxx\nUsername = xxxxxxxxxx\nStupid Mode = 1\n\nIf your username and password are the mobile numbers (then replace xxxxxxxxxx with your device mobile number with prefix-91 for example 91xxxxxxxxxx)\nIf you don't  know username and password, or the above do not work then you can use this ...

Open browser and see if pages load. If it does, and I believe it will, then it's good to go.\nNow if you are a geek you can just enter sudo wvdial every time to connect, but for people you prefer the comfort of mouse clicks you have some more jobs left to do.\nsudo gedit /usr/bin/bsnl\n\nenter this data into that file\ngksudo wvdial\n\nNow we need to set execution permissions to the file\nsudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/bsnl\n\nNow we will create a desktop shortcut.\ngedit ~/Desktop/BSNL.desktop\n\nand enter this data into the file\n [Desktop Entry]\nName=BSNL EVDO Connection\nExec=bsnl\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=false\nIcon=package_network\n\nand make it executable\nchmod 777 ~/Desktop/BSNL.desktop\n\nNow everytime you plug in the device, wait for 1-2 minutes, then double click the brand new icon on your desktop, and woot!! you are online :)\ncheers\n", "Q: Where should I place the .htpasswd file (phpMyAdmin)? I am following this tutorial setting up phpMyAdmin:\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu-12-04\nI edit the .htaccess file at /usr/share/phpmyadmin/.htaccess\nBut I need to point it to a .htpasswd file of my choice.\nCan I put it in /usr/share/phpmyadmin so it's next to .htaccess? Or can I put it in /var/www ?\n\nA: Well, in theory you should be ok with putting your .htpasswd file anywhere in the apache document root since apache default configuration for any file beginning with \".ht\" should be this:\n<FilesMatch \"^\\.ht\">\nOrder allow,deny\nDeny from all\nSatisfy All\n</FilesMatch>\n\nHowever, I tend to avoid that, and usually put my .htpasswd files somwhere in the apache folder, for example:\n/etc/apache2/htpass/.htpasswd\n\nor\n/etc/apache2/.htpasswd\n\nI don't think there are any official best practices for this, correct me if I am wrong...\n\nA: It is NOT a good idea to place your .htpasswd file in /var/www.\nYou can place the .htpasswd pretty much anywhere other than your web folder. I would place it in /etc/phpmyadmin.\n", "Q: How can I repair video when I cannot see the screen? Background:\nI have an old 1.6 Ghz pc 2GB RAM with an NVIDIA GeForce FX 5500 graphics card and a Broadcom 4318 WiFi. One drive is Pata and one is Sata. One contains XP and one had an NTFS partition for XP and a partition for Ubuntu 12.04 and many earlier versions.  I used GParted to shrink the 12.04 partition to make room for 14.04. After install I did not see it appear in the GRUB menu until 12.04 upgraded from -64 to -65.  \nThen three choices appeared for 14.04:  \nUbuntu' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os 'gnulinux-simple-UUID ->\nUbuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-24-generic' --class gnu-linux --class gnu ----class os 'gnulinux-3.13.0-24-ge->\nUbuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-24-generic (recovery mode)'  --class ubuntu --class gnu --class os 'gnuli->\n\nThe lines are incomplete because they were off my screen but all referred to 1.13.0-24. Both hard drives have the boot flag set and I think sdb is the second drive with only XP on it. I think sda2 has 12.04 and sda5, 14.04.  \nAfter they showed up I activated the Wi-Fi with:  \nsudo b43-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware broadcom-wl-5.100.138/linux/wl_apsta.o\n\nBecause 14.04 was exceedingly slow, I found:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/first\nwhich described how to disable 3D graphics among other things which it said to do in the order given. Step 2 recommended replacing the graphics driver and I had already done that in 12.04 to NVIDIA-173.14.39 so that step seemed perfectly reasonable. After the reboot in step 1.5e the screen stayed blank.  \nBy booting into 12.04 I can see that the 4 lines were added in:\n/etc/sysctl.conf regarding vm.swappiness and vm.vfs_cache_pressure.\nSo that is how I got here.  I can read/write all the 14.04 files from 12.04 and can get to the root terminal by booting in the recovery mode.  \nI tried:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\nsudo apt-get nvidia-uninstall \n\nin hopes that I could revert to nouveau.  Slow is better than blind.\nI can reallocate the partition with 14.04 and start over but am hoping for another approach.\n\nA: Metacity does now work with Nouveau after again installing and purging Nvidia \n[Oh yes, and copying /etc/X11/xorg.conf from 12.04 to 14.04 - which may have had nothing at all to do with the final success.

I can live with this.\nI want to encrypt the Win7 stuff (SSD + half the 1TB) with Bitlocker. I also want to encrypt the Ubuntu partitions with whatever is appropriate.\nNever having done this before, my concern is that using two schemes on the same drive will hose the whole arrangement.\nCan this be safely done?\n\nA: \nCan this be safely done?\n\nYes.\nA little background. Both operating systems require one unencrypted partition for booting.\nWindows bitlocker has already created these partitions on your SSD:\n\n\n*\n\n*System reserved partition (unencrypted)\n\n*Main partition (C:\\) (encrypted)\n\n\nAn MBR partition table can contain either four primary partitions or three primary partitions and an extended partition. Accessing one partition does not affect the others (for your purposes).\nSo for your HDD, you should have:\n\n\n*\n\n*your current NTFS partition\n\n*unencrypted Ubuntu boot partition\n\n*LUKS encrypted Ubuntu root partition\n\n\nThese can all be primary partitions. If you create a swap, I recommend putting it on an extended partition, in case you need more partitions in the future.

But after saving my changes and exiting BIOS, my laptop now boots straight into Windows 8.1 without showing the grub menu.\nI know I can get the grub menu back if I go on and re-install Ubuntu again, but I really don't want to go down that path.\nMy boot mode is set to UEFI, and changing it to legacy mode did not bring the grub menu back. My windows bootloader and grub are installed on seperate partitions, if that helps.\nSo, what am I missing here? Please help me out. \n\nA: Your problem is similar to many others that have been reported here.

The golden rule is never write to a data lost partition until it is recovered. So boot into a live CD, mount the partition in RO, recover to another storage like a pen drive. If you don't have a external storage and have 1.5+ GB of RAM recover data to RAM. Ubuntu uses RAM for /tmp. If you are not sure mount some portition of the RAM at /mnt using sudo mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt -o size=600M\n\nA: You have unfortunately drastically reduced your chances of recovering the file in full by writing to the same partition that the file you are trying to recover is on. Read @totti update and musher comment. The very first thing you should do when attempting data recovery is to cease using the drive that the data is on. I would follow that by making a forensic copy of the drive on another drive or an image, In this way you can work on the copy and insure that you still have the original in an undisrupted condition.\n", "Q: How do I set up SFTP file access logging for OpenSSH?

So the place to look for log data from sshd is in \n/var/log/auth.log\nThese defaults can be overridden using the SyslogFacility and LogLevel directives. Below is a typical server startup entry in the authorization log.\nIn most cases the default level of logging is fine.\nThe following should give you only ssh related log lines\ngrep 'sshd' /var/log/auth.log\n\nTo be on the safe side, get the last few hundred lines and then search (because if the log file is too large, grep on the whole file would consume more system resources, not to mention will take longer to run)\ntail -500 /var/log/auth.log | grep 'sshd'\n\nEDIT:\nFrom man sshd_config\n LogLevel\n         Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from\n         sshd(8).  The possible values are: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO,\n         VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3.  The default is INFO.\n         DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify\n         higher levels of debugging output.  Logging with a DEBUG level\n         violates the privacy of users and is not recommended.\n\nso you can change this parameter in sshd_config. But seems it doesn't track files.\nYou can investigate a bit though:\n1) To find all files NOT owned by your logged on user in your home folder, type:\nfind ~ -type f ! -user $USER\n\n1.1) To find all files that do not belong to any legitimate user (they should not exist), type:\nfind ~ -type f -nouser\n\n2) As files on the system have three timestamps called mtime (file modification time), ctime (inode change time and permissions), and atime (file access time), these can be queried to find out how files have been modified. It is often debated which of these are the best to use, but probably the best way to find out when files were accessed or modified is to use the find command to search atime and mtime, with which you specify days ago, and the additional find options amin and mmin, with which you specify minutes ago. \nFor each of these commands, the same command switches are used: for example,-atime 1 will match those files that were accessed exactly 1 day ago; to specify more or less than, append a + or a - respectively. The examples below may clarify all this (specify -type d for directories):\nfind ~ -type f -atime 1 \nfind ~ -type f -amin -23\nfind ~ -type f -mtime 2    \nfind ~ -type f -mmin -45\n\nTo combine my approaches so far, you could enter the following commands from your home folder; the first searches for files accessed by a person who is NOT your user, and the second for any files modified by persons other than by your user less than two days ago. \nfind ~ -type f -atime -2 ! -user $USER\nfind ~ -type f -mtime -2 ! -user $USER\n\n\nA: In your sshd_config (mostly /etc/ssh/sshd_config), Try something like\nSubsystem   sftp    internal-sftp -f AUTH -l INFO\n\nor \nSubsystem   sftp    internal-sftp -l INFO\n\nI think these are the logging levels:\nQUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3\n\nIf you need more details on log, increase the logging level\n\nA: You can use a wrapper around you sftp-server executable as such :\n`    \n#!/bin/sh\n# sftpd wrapper script for executing pre/post session actions\n\n# pre session actions and logging here\nSOURCE_IP=${SSH_CLIENT%% *}\nMSG_SESSION_START=\"user $LOGNAME session start from $SOURCE_IP\"\nlogger -p local5.notice -t sftpd-wrapper -i \"$MSG_SESSION_START\"\n\n# start actual SFTP session\n/usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server\n\n# add post session actions here\n`\n\n... And then, adjust your syslogd.conf configuration to direct the local5.notice to a proper logfile, as such:\nlocal5.*                                                /var/log/sftpd.log\n\nAnd lastly, to see which files are being transferred, you can adjust globally in sshd_config; or per-user by adjusting the above script, simply by adding the following setting to make the sftp subprocess log the files being transfered:\n/usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server -f local5 -l info\n\nhope this helps ! :p\n", "Q: How to automatically copy pictures with resizing to some directory? I'd like to share some pictures with someone using Dropbox.

Moreover, during the suspended state the fan is constantly working on considerably higher rpm than during normal usage, even though laptop's LED indicates sleep.

I have tested this 5 times now.\nI also have the password required from suspend option set. \nI also have the same Fail statement in my pm-suspend.log. I have the fail statement whether or not I have a successful resume. For that reason, I don't think it is reflective of what is going on.\n\nA: I tried many things.

I have a Huawei E3531 3G dongle (which works fine on Ubuntu 14.04, right out of the box). However, it registers as an USB-Ethernet adapter and I can't view any signal strength or other connection information except by visiting the dongle's internal webpage at 192.168.8.1. Can this dongle also be used as a ttyUSBx modem device so it works properly with network-manager?\nThanks!\nFlorian\n\nA: TL;DR: In order for the E3531 to work as a serial over USB modem, you need to modify the mode switching rule to the one you have posted (12d1:1001) and to switch off autodialing in the internal configuration page, otherwise there is a conflict and the computer can't use the modem.\nI needed to set up this modem to work with an OpenWrt router, so I spent quite a few hours testing on my Fedora box and the router itself. It does work in CDC Ethernet mode, but there is no way to set up things like port forwarding. In /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/12d1:1f01 I had:\n# Huawei E353 (3.se)\n\nTargetVendor=  0x12d1\nTargetProduct= 0x14db\n\nMessageContent=\"55534243123456780000000000000a11062000000000000100000000000000\"\nNoDriverLoading=1\n\nand similarly in OpenWrt's /etc/usb-mode.json (the values inside brackets are in decimal):\n    \"12d1:1f01\": {\n        \"*\": {\n            \"t_vendor\": 4817,\n            \"t_product\": [ 5339, 5340 ],\n            \"mode\": \"HuaweiNew\",\n            \"no_driver\": true,\n            \"msg\": [  ]\n        }\n    }\n\nIt seems that the NoDriverLoading=1 (\"no_driver\": true) option does not allow the device to switch to serial-over-USB mode. I can't remember if the same is true for \"mode\": \"HuaweiNew\", as I've shipped the router to the client.\nSo, to recap, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable autodialing in the configuration page\n\n*Modify the mode switching rule to target product id 0x1001 (decimal: 4097) and message \"55534243123456780000000000000011062000000100000000000000000000\"\n\n*Remove the NoDriverLoading=1 option\n\n*Save the rule, unplug and plug back in\n\n\nA: I can actually answer my own question now: it is possible to switch the stick into a \"modem mode\" where it presents 3 serial devices. Connecting via those modem devices doesn't currently work, however.

I installed it as root and it didn't work but then the installation process seems to have changed permissions of something.  Now, I cannot run Perl as a normal user.\nAs a normal user, \"perl -v\" works.

So, something has switched to root and I don't know what has.\nHas anyone seen this before and know what I should be looking for?

Not sure if that is related...\nAny help would be appreciated!\nRay\n\nA: From some googling (see here) I understand that if one of the directories in the @INC path is inaccessible, the search for Config.pm (or any module) is abandoned. So check whether any of the directories is not readable by \"all\".Strangely enough, a non-existent directory name in the @INC path is no problem.\n\nA: You can try install local::lib.

Hope works for you too! Otherwise, that means your CPAN installation is broken. In this case, use command sudo dpkg --list | grep libcpan to list all cpan's packages, try to upgrade packages at first. \nIf still doesn't work try to remove and reinstall all of them! After that, install local::lib again repeating the steps above.\n", "Q: How to remove duplicate imported photos in Shotwell I've noticed that Shotwell has imported many images twice (e.g. from my camera SD card). Apparently the duplicate detection is buggy once a photo is imported, tagged and then re-imported.\nI have \"write meta data tags\" enabled in the settings. If I import a photo test-images.jpg and add tags to it the photo will not be picked up by the duplicate detection upon another import of the same file.\nThe second time the file is imported it will be named test-images-1.jpg and placed in the library folder as per the active rules (not necessarily into the same folder).\ntest-images.jpg and test-images-1.jpg will have the same image data but due to the added tag/metadata the files are not the same anymore and won't be picked up by searching for duplicates (e.g. md5 hash).\nMy usage scenario that caused multiple duplicate is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*I take pictures with my phone\n\n*I import the photos from my phone, add tags but leave the images on the phone as I want to keep them for sharing etc.\n\n*I add further tags to the imported photos\n\n*After some weeks I repeat the import step from the phone and old photos that I have already imported will be imported again (with '-1.jpg' or '-2.jpg' added)\n\n\nHow to clean up the duplicates?\nUsing a file name based search would be possible but I can't exclude that I have not imported a file ending with -1 to which was not imported as a duplicate.\nHow can I clean up my photo library? I tried to use the search function in Shotwell but with more than 1000 photos there must be a better, more reliable, less error prone an simpler way.\nI'm not to worried about tags getting lost, typically the second import (the duplicate) has no tags applied.\n\nA: Sort of spamish, but I found myself with the same problem a few monts ago, and I wrote a small utility that does just that:\nhttps://github.com/jesjimher/imgdupes\nIt's a python script that scans a directory tree looking for duplicates. Its syntax is intentionally similar to fdupes, with the difference that imgdupes ignores all metadata and analyzes only the image data chunk of a JPEG file. This means that two different versions of the same image, with different tags, rotation flags, dates, etc., will be reported as duplicates even if physical files are different (and thus not detected as duplicates by fdupes/shotwell).\nIt was recently renamed to jpegdupes, and is now on Pypi repos, so scanning a tree for duplicated images might be done like this:\nsudo pip install jpegdupes\njpegdupes -d ~/Photos/ (or whatever your path is)\nIt would look for JPEGs which are actually the same picture (differing only in metadata), and would interactively show differences and ask for which version to keep.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem a few weeks ago. The solution I found to resolve this issue is basic but works : inside Shotwell, make a new saved search that displays all pictures not tagged AND with filenames ending with \"_1.jpg\".\nYou can then erase all files listed by Shotwell for this search but be careful, make a backup before ;-)\nIn my case I deleted 2000+ pictures ! \n\nA: You could just copy the tagged files back to your phone, so they aren't different any more? I think Shotwell ought to cope with it's own tagging though, and this does look like a bug to me.\nI have a similar problem, but with Shotwell re-developing camera raw files every time it's run.\n\nA: I ran into same problem and solved by exporting all images from Shotwell into another folder. Even if you have dups, Shotwell shows them only once. For instance I had 64K in the folder but Shotwell showed only 32K. So I selected all and exported preserving size, name, metadata etc. \nThe only downside is: if you had complicated folder structure and you want to keep it - this solution may not work for you. I have everything in one folder now. BTW looks like this bug is fixed now.   \n", "Q: I got a error,when i start my computer i am getting this type of problem,when i open my computer(continue to wait or press s to skip mounting or m for manual recovery)\nplease help me regarding this\n\nA: From observing your short question, I'm led to believe one of your UUID's are incorrect in /etc/fstab\nWhat you could do as Step 1, is to type:\n    sudo blkid\n\nthen for Step 2 type:\n    sudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nand compare the UUID's of all listed devices between the blkid output and your fstab file.\nIf any information does not match, edit fstab as root and correct the discrepancies.\n", "Q: Setting up a Samba share with guest access I am trying to setup guest access to a samba share but am getting nowhere.

Your user, \"matt\", may not have access to write to those directories. Are you able to navigate to another folder you can write to from your root share? (Note: sharing the root of your filesystem is not the best idea in the world.) If so, then it almost certainly is file-system permissions, and if you do need to have write-access to a folder, your best bet will be chmod commands.

Then release the shift key, and press the wireless button one time.  When it changes from red to blue, proceed with the remainder of the boot process.\nOn my HP, the wireless button is very slow to act while Ubuntu is running.\nThere's an old post (2005) which indicates that a user solved a similar problem on an HP notebook be reseting all the BIOS values to default, and then resetting them to what specific individual settings they had before.\n\nA: Make sure that WiFi is Enabbled in BIOS and also that LAN/WiFi switching is Disabled, also BIOS option.\nOn my Elitebooks (8440p, 8470p, 2740p) when WiFi is working - button blinks in orange/white.

Is there any way someone could interact with any part of phpMyAdmin without first authenticating themselves via that .htaccess username/password? \n\nA: Securing phpMyAdmin with .htaccess is considered sufficient if you're just using Ubuntu in order to learn and get experience with LAMP servers.\nHowever, if you were working in a corporate environment, I would suggest setting up SSL Certifications with phpMyAdmin for that extra level of security.\n\nA: If people are accessing phpmyadmin over the Internet, you should use SSL encryption for the web traffic.\nIf not, add a couple lines to your htaccess file that only allows connection from the LAN.\nSomething like the following\nOrder Deny,Allow\n    Deny from All\n    Allow from 10.253.0.1/24\n\n", "Q: Can I install gnome 3.12 on ubuntu 12.04?

When I try to open \"Trash\" through Nautilus, I get a dialog box displaying the following:\n'Sorry, could not display all the contents of “trash:///”: Operation not supported'\nI need a file (several thousand, actually) that I accidentally deleted this morning. \nGoogle has very little to say on this particular error. Most of the forum posts I've found are 5+ years old, or have gone unresolved. So I'm pretty hopeless. Are there any alternatives to using the Trash utility to restore files?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: The trash directory is located at  /home/username/.local/share/Trash . \nUnderneath that directory, \"files\" should contain any files you have deleted.\nYou can try opening nautilus, going to your home directory, and pressing Ctrl + H (The key combination for showing hidden files) and browsing to that path, or you can do it from a terminal. \nTake your choice.\nI hope that helps.\nEDIT1:\nYou can install trash-cli using \"sudo apt-get install trash-cli\" for a command line interface to manage your trash. It has a command restore-trash which should do what you are wanting.\nEDIT2: Have you tried running \"gksudo nautilus\", and then going to trash via places, or pressing Ctrl + L and typing trash:/// ?\nEDIT3:\nI have modified the python script that comes with trash-cli for the restore-trash utility to enable multiple restores.

I followed these instructions on the Ubuntu help wiki. But I get an error on client machine:\nCould not find kernel image: vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic\n\nAnd now, question. This image should be in pxelinux.cfg folder, am I right?\n\nA: The kernel image (and initrd) must be located relative to the root folder. If you follow that how-to, then you have configured the following parameters:\n\n\n*\n\n*DHCP server is configured to use /tftpboot/\n\n*The boot image is /pxelinux.0 (relative to the TFTP root directory, so the actual path is /tftpboot/pxelinux.0)\n\n*PXELinux (part of syslinux) looks for its configuration in the /pxelinux.cfg/ directory. If it does not find a file matching the client MAC address or GUID, then it will fallback to a file named default (/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default) in your case.\n\n*That file should contain something like:\nLABEL linux\n  KERNEL vmlinuz\n  INITRD initrd\n  APPEND root=...\n\nThe vmlinuz and initrd files are then looked up relative to the TFTP root directory, so ensure that the file /tftpboot/vmlinuz and /tftpboot/initrd exist. You can find these files in /boot/.\nI would also suggest not to use /tftpboot/ as root directory for TFTP files, but /srv/tftpboot/. That is a more suitable location for site-specific data.\nFor debugging, be sure to have a look at your syslog. I have used the dnsmasq DHCP server which sends its logs to syslog (/var/log/syslog). ISC's DHCP sever should do something similar.\n\nA: I know this thread is older than dirt but I wanted to add in that my problem was SELinux / Apparmour related.  Note that TFTP PXE booting won't say \"permission denied.\"  Instead it will say \"couldn't find\" which can be confusing.

So, I was hoping to get some clarification on a couple points that I have heard conflicting or incomplete information about in the past, before I make any rash decisions.\nFirst, I understand that Windows and Ubuntu both support NTFS. Is it, then, logical to shrink the Windows partition by a fair margin and  make a relatively small root partition for Ubuntu, and then fill the rest of the space (excluding swap, etc.) with /home to share between both OSs, or would this cause problems or require additional steps that I am currently unaware of? Would it be better to have a small /home partition solely for Ubuntu and another large  NTFS one to share? And if so, how would I go about permanently mounting that to both operating systems so that they can be read and written to from either side, or is it somewhat automatic?\nSecond, I have heard from some that in order to avoid Windows overwriting GRUB, it should be installed on the Ubuntu partition. I have also heard that is is highly likely to cause problems and might not work at all. Is it easier to install the boot loader on the Windows partition and just keep the Live CD handy in case of disaster?\n\nA: You should avoid making /home a NTFS partition, it does not support file permissions which may cause some headaches later. Besides that, if you plan on using hibernation, it may also lead to file loss and data corruption when you boot into Ubuntu while Windows is hibernated (and vice versa).\nIf you really have a need to share files, create another partition. So your disk layout will be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows hidden boot partition.\n\n*C: Windows OS & programs\n\n*D: NTFS shared files\n\n*Ubuntu root and /home partition (or separate them if you like to)\n\n*swap partition (optional)\n\n\nSince you have a Windows 8 installation, I guess that you have an EFI system where you need to install the GRUB image on a small \"EFI system partition\". I am not too familiar with this, so have a look at some related questions.\n", "Q: How to adjust brightness on Lubuntu? I can't adjust my screen brightness.

I have a windows 7 laptop with 2 drives on HDD both in NTFS, C drive, where windows is installed, and D drive where I store all my files (everything except windows system files and softwares). I want to have a dual boot laptop where I build/port AOSP (Android Open Source Project) on my ubuntu OS and use windows 7 as my other OS. So since I have a lot of space on my D drive I was wondering if I made D drive my '/home' would it be a bad idea? And can I do that and still see all the data on my D drive? I haven't installed my Ubuntu yet, but that's no big deal! ;P. I'm thinking of dedication 8 GB for my swap and 10 GB for root and the rest can be shared in '/home' and drive D, if possible. \n\nA: /home MUST be mounted on a filesystem that supports permissions so that rules out anything microsoft has (ntfs, fat). The directories in /home/$USER/ you can put on an external disc or another partition and can be NTFS.\nI would opt for a seperate partition that you format as NTFS and store your documents there. Leave /home empty of private files and you can keep that at 25 Gb. \n\nA: You probably cannot do this on an install.  You'll probably have to establish the mount manually.\nHowever, I'd be a little concerned as the line terminators between linux and windows are different.

Do I need to re-add my key from authorized_keys or will it automatically happen next time I login with ssh -i me@wherever?\nI'm afraid to logout and then be locked out of the system. \nI tried typing ssh-add /home/me/.ssh/authorized_keys but then it asks for a passphrase and I don't know what passphrase it's talking about.\n\nA: ssh-add is the client part of ssh-agent, it has nothing to do with granting access to hosts (which is done by adding the public key (.pub) to ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts on the server side). ssh-agent is a program which you use on the client side, the server side only needs sshd.\nBy invoking ssh-add -d, you have cleared a cached key from ssh-agent such that you have to re-enter your SSH keyfile passphrase next time you ssh to a system. You won't lock yourself out by clearing this cache. Simply run ssh-add (or ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa for a specific keyfile) to remember the keyfile passphrase again for this session.\nThe -i option of ssh is only necessary if your private key is located on a non-standard location. ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@host is nearly equivalent to ssh user@host since ~/.ssh/id_rsa is one of the standard places where SSH looks for a keyfile.\nThe reason why ssh-add ~/.ssh/authorized_keys prompts for a password is because it did not recognize an unprotected key, and thus assumed a password-protected key. In fact, the file has an invalid format so no password will work here.\nSee also the manual page ssh-add(1).\n\nA: You can either copy the contents of .ssh/id_rsa.pub (which is your public key) and add it to the end of .ssh/authorized_keys or use ssh-copy-id localhost to let SSH do the copying.\nNote that your key doesn't need to be in .ssh/authorized_keys unless you plan on SSH'ing into that computer using that key.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Direct X issue Im trying to play a game called Conquer Online.

I can see my \"website\" locally but how do I get it to show up online? Does it need a domain name per se or can't I just get DNS somehow to pick up my IP address and put it online or something, I don't know. I've got a domain name registered, if that helps.\n\nA: Access your website from outside your computer\nIf I understand correctly, you have a virtual machine containing an Apache server hosting the default \"It works!\" page. In order for this to be accessible from the Internet, it must first be accessible from outside the host machine (the host machine is the one running the Virtualbox software).\nTo do this, open the virtual machine's Settings dialogue, and from the Network tab choose \"Bridged adapter\".\n\nThis will give the virtual server an I.P. address on your network which you can discover by running ifconfig from the server - look for the address following inet addr:, it will probably be something similar to e.g. 192.168.1.10. Then, type that I.P. address into the host machine's web browser and you should again see the \"It work!\" page. \nAccess your website from the Internet\nAt this point, all that's necessary to access it from the Internet is to change settings on your home Internet connection's router so that, rather than blocking incoming web traffic, it directs it to your new server. This is called 'port forwarding' and is standard fayre on most routers, just log in to your router's web interface and you will find it. (You may need to keep that I.P. address handy.)\nHowever\nIt appears from your question your knowledge is really quite basic, and rather than playing with putting it on the Internet, I would advise you to keep things local (just on your home network). One slight misconfiguration on an Internet-facing server can be catastrophic. \n\nA: When you say that \"I can see my \"website\" locally\" I understand it as - you have a computer that you are using for development purposes at home - \"put it online or something, I don't know.\" which I understand as you are trying to get the same thing on your computer as in publish your website. If this is the case then yes you do need all that stuff hosting and a domain name. If you are configuring a server then I would suggest you re-word this question to make it clearer.\n", "Q: How do I correctly enable PHP 5.5's OPCache in Ubuntu 14.04? I'm setting up a local server to test configurations; it's a clean 14.04 LAMP server, as selected during OS install.\nIf I understand correctly, OPCache comes with PHP 5.5 (php -v confirms this) but in a disabled state.

Thank you for your help.\n\nA: Can I associate a file type with NetBeans to be able to open files of that type from File Explorer?\nhttp://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqCliOpen\nYes, you can. Just pass the name of the file to be opened as the only argument in your command line interface. \nFor example:\nnetbeans MyFile.java\n\nThe same command can be used to create an association for files of specific types in the file manager (below)\nYou can also use the explicit --open option for clarity, and pass more than one file; for example, on Unix:\nfind src -name \\*.java -print0 | xargs -0 netbeans --open\nIf there is an instance of the IDE already running, the file will simply open in this instance and the command will exit. You may need to pass the --userdir option to match the user directory of the running IDE.\nIn addition, you can specify the line at which the file should open (line numbers start at 1):\nnetbeans Something.java:55\n", "Q: Node.js server silently fails with Upstart I can manually run my Node.js server with ./server.js, but when I try to daemonize it with Upstart, it silently fails.

Many things happen between your hit on Enter and the command outputting :\n\n\n*\n\n*Your shell interprets the command and executes /bin/date.\n\n*The kernel creates a process, gives it a PID, sets its parent, gives some address space, registers the process, and so on...\n\n*The /bin/date program executes. It probably requires some memory to be allocated.

Here, the OS gets the current time from the hardware clocks.\n\n*[a few milliseconds pass, see above]\n\n*You get the output.\n\n\nThose intermediate times may vary according to several things, they're barely measurable. As an example, if your CPUs have many processes to handle, then your date process will have to sleep longer between each of its execution phases.\nOne could go even further by adding :\n\n\n*\n\n*You get the output.\n\n*Your eyes blink (100-400 milliseconds says Wikpedia).\n\n*You actually see the output.\n\n*Your brain interprets and understands it.\n\n\nAdding a few more milliseconds to the count.\n\nA: Of course it isn't. Everything you do takes a measurable amount of time. From hitting enter, to the keyboard reacting to it, passing it on to the shell, which will run date, to displaying the output on your terminal and your reading it. To get a better idea, have a look at this very nice Q&A on what exactly happens when you hit a key on your keyboard.\nIf we reuse the diagrams from that post:\nInput\n      +-------------------+               +-------------+\n----->| terminal emulator |-------------->| application |\n      +-------------------+               +-------------+\nkeypress                    character or\n                           escape sequence\n\nOutput\n+-------------+               +-------------------+\n| application |-------------->| terminal emulator |\n+-------------+               +-------------------+\n               character or\n               escape sequence\n\nEach of the arrows and each of the boxes shown above represent processes that take a measurable amount of time. In the case of the date program, the time you see is the time it got when it queried the system for the current time. The process would be something like\nYou hit enter --> `date` is executed -> queries current time\n\nAgain, each of the above steps (and other, smaller ones, run strace date to get an idea) take time so no, the returned time will not be the exact moment you hit Enter.\nBy the time the result is printed on your terminal, the time (at the nanosecond accuracy) will have changed again. What you see is the that was returned by the system when date asked. \nHowever, you can actually rest assured that it is accurate enough for anything you might want to do on your computer. If you require accuracy at the nanosecond level, you're probably going to need custom-built hardware.\n", "Q: How to mount a 20 TB file system I have recently created a file server with 6x4tb hard drives. One hard drive is used as the file system and is formatted with ext4. While I have created an LVM with the other five drives. This LVM system has a 20tb capacity and is formatted with XFS (I have tried with ext4 and got the same error as I am about to describe). Whenever I try to mount the drive, I get an error saying mount:file too large. The command I type in is sudo mount /dev/DRIVE /FOLDER. I have tried adding the filesystem parameter but it makes no difference. I am under a huge time constraint so any help would be appreciated thank you. \n\nA: I believe I found the answer to your question here:\nTwo points:\n\n\n*\n\n*You must be using a 64-bit kernel to use a filesystem > 16TB due to page cache limitation.\n\n*Version 1.41 and lower of e2fsprogs (used when formatting ext2/ext3/ext4 drives) will fail on volumes > 16TB due to software limitation.  Using a newer version of e2fsprogs will help.\nIn your case I think it's more likely to be the 32-bit kernel limitation.\nAnother option for you is simply to limit your volumes to 16 TB, for example if you don't want to run a 64-bit kernel.\n", "Q: How do I set a static IP address (or just get to a terminal) on Mythbuntu? Mythbuntu 14.04 LTS; how do I get to a terminal screen or a normal Linux menu? Need to set static IP address. Question was not asked during install. All I see is large character pages with media related questions, no networking. Current LAN is standard wired Ethernet. Covers some 22+ Ethernet connected devices over 3 residences. All devices set up static and working correctly.\nWhy is there not a simple question, DHCP/Static, during install. Seems this would solve a lot of problems.\n\nA: Further to what @boon commented above - if you quit out of the Mythbuntu menu (multiple escapes and then 'y' to exit the menu) you should be dropped back to the desktop.\nFrom there you'll see the main menu for the OS and a terminal is under Applications -> Accessories.\nWhat I do is have a terminal auto start so I can ALT-TAB to it if need be.  To do this, go to Applications -> Settings -> Session and Startup.  A dialog will popup - switch to the Application Autostart tab and add a Terminal (the command for the terminal is /usr/bin/xfce4-terminal).\n", "Q: Suspend from the command line and show Unity's lock screen in 14.04? How can I suspend my computer from the command line and, once it wakes up, display Unity's lock screen? I want to replicate exactly what happens when I click on the system cog icon at the top right of the Unity panel and go to Suspend in Ubuntu 14.04 (not an earlier version!). \nI've found many answers that do not work, such as those found here and here. All of them are for older versions of Ubuntu or invoke either gnome-screensaver or xscreensaver's lock screen.\nThis command, for instance, suspends the computer, but does not lock the screen:\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend, despite Require my password when waking from suspend being checked in the Brightness & Lock system settings. \nActually, I don't even know how to invoke Unity's lock screen at all in 14.04: the closest I can come to is dm-tools lock, but this is not quite the same, as it allows you to sign in as a different user and shows more indicators.\n\nA: Since I figured out how to get the 14.04 lock screen, I just chained the dbus lock command with the suspend one:\nsh -c \"dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver /org/gnome/ScreenSaver org.gnome.ScreenSaver.Lock && dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\"\n\n", "Q: How to run 'primusrun' command with Steam for Wndows games on Wine I'm new on Ubuntu 14.04, and I was trying to find out how to run primusrun command (Bumblebee) on Steam for Windows games simulated with Wine 1.6.2. I have searched many forums and could not find the answer.

What you write in /media/bigdata is written to the external drive mounted there. However, if you want to use this drive as your /home partition, that's another thing. Quoting from this page :\n\nIf you don’t create a separate home partition while installing Ubuntu, you don’t have to reinstall Ubuntu from scratch. To migrate to a separate home partition after installation, you’ll have to create a new partition (which may require resizing your existing partitions), copy the files from your existing home directory to that partition, and tell Ubuntu to mount the new partition at /home.\n\nAs you're using the whole drive, you probably don't need to partition it much more. Copying/moving is handled by my above commands. As far as auto-mounting is concerned, you might want to have a look at the fstab file. GNOME also offers device auto-mounting GUIs that mount your drive to /media/bigdata after login. Basically, most USB storage devices are auto-mounted anyway.\nIn you're not really at ease with disk management and system partitionning, just move your files to the drive, and leave your /home partition where it is. You might just need to configure your system to mount the external drive at /media/bigdata.\n", "Q: Why does aptitude insist on installing packages? Why does aptitude want to install so many packages when I simply run the following?\nsudo aptitude install\n\nI'd rather not provide specific packages it wants to install because this has happened plenty of times in the past (though I'm not entirely sure how I've fixed it in the past).\nAny ideas?\n\nA: From the aptitude man page :\n\nAs a special case, “install” with no arguments will act on any stored/pending actions.\n\nIn other words, you tried to install those packages earlier (or they were brought as dependencies), yet something went wrong (or the process was interrupted) and it couldn't finish. aptitude is just trying to finish what it started. The operations may also concern updates, package removals or any kind of internal, pending operation.\nAnother interesting man page excerpt you might want to know about :\n\nOnce you enter Y at the final confirmation prompt, the “install” command will modify aptitude's stored information about what actions to perform. Therefore, if you issue (e.g.) the command “aptitude install foo bar” and then abort the installation once aptitude has started downloading and installing packages, you will need to run “aptitude remove foo bar” to cancel that order.\n\nIn other words, if those packages are of no interest to you, calling remove for them might purge the pending operations queue (the aptitude's stored information).\n", "Q: How do I get full permission to my files? I have run into this problem too many times. Sometimes when I'm trying to run a command on the terminal it will say \"Permission Denied.\" How can I get that permission??\n\nA: @Avinash Raj \nis useful but , \nI think what user meant \nwithout realizing it\nis how to run a script ./script\nyou need to change the mode and\nget the permission you can \nachieve that with \nchmod +x script_name.extension\n\nwhich makes the script executable and let you run it !\nor you can right click the file go to properties and then\npermissions and check the executable checkbox\nand then back to terminal to actually run it .\nafter if you double click it you get options to open in text editor or run in terminal etc..\n\nA: The permission denied error (code 13) warns you that your request cannot be carried out by the system, since your user/group IDs do not give you the required privileges. For instance, consider this file in my home directory :\n$ ls -l test.txt\n-rw-r----- 1 me mygroup 0 Jul  1 03:54 test.txt\n\nThe rw-r----- part states that the owner (me) can perform read/write operations on the file, while members of the mygroup group can read it. Others can't do anything.\nIn order to read this file, you'll type :\n$ cat test.txt\n\nYet, if you're not me, and don't belong to the mygroup group, you'll get a beautiful Permission denied (13) error.\nIf you want to know more about the UNIX permissions system, have a look here, here or here. Note that this system applies to all programs (commands) on your system. Any program trying to read test.txt must be running as me, or someone in the mygroup group in order to succeed (otherwise, the same error will occur).\nWhen performing administration tasks such as package management or system configuration, it is usually necessary to have root privileges. These tasks require access to files owned by root, or the execution of kernel-tasks that can only be carried out with super-user privileges. On Ubuntu, you can run a command as root using sudo :\n$ sudo mycommand\n\nHowever, this requires you to be registered as a sudoer, which will probably be the case if you're the first or only user on that machine.

Hi I am not new to Ubuntu but totally new to Ubuntu server and have spent the last couple of days getting more and more confused. If my question has been asked a million times please accept my apologies, I can't find it but a link to it would greatly appreciated. \nI have an old PC (fairly good specs) that I have decided to turn into a media server using Ubuntu 12.04 lts server iso.\nThe only requirment I need my Ubuntu server to do is to perform as a cloud for all of my personal media that can only be connected internally within range of my home WiFi.

How to disable it?\n\nA: In 14.04 there is an automativ weekly trim. You can disable it with:\nsudo rm /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim\nBut I wouldn't recommend totally disabling TRIM, this will slow your drive down with time.\n\nA: To check the status of TRIM timer\nsudo systemctl status fstrim.timer\n\nYou would get something like this:\n● fstrim.timer - Discard unused blocks once a week\n     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/fstrim.timer; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n     Active: active (waiting) since Mon 2022-01-10 06:36:56 CET; 31min left\n    Trigger: Mon 2022-01-17 00:00:00 CET; 6 days left\n   Triggers: ● fstrim.service\n       Docs: man:fstrim\n\n\nTo disable the periodic TRIM (TRIM timer)\nsudo systemctl disable fstrim.timer\n\nTo manually invoke TRIM (on all mounted FS)\nsudo fstrim --all\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n*\n\n*fstrim man page #1\n\n*fstrim man page #2\n\n*Does SSD Trim actually increase the lifespan? (Quora)\n\nA: Disabling trim is very important for legacy servers that pre-date SATA.\nSSD's can be fitted for power, reliability as well as some speed increase by means of an IDE to SATA bridge or converter. Or a DOM package plugged directly into the MB.\nSome of these hang on TRIM. Random writes to the SSD are 3-4 times faster than UDMA so TRIM does not matter, it has time to write twice.\nMy approach is to comment out /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim (c. Utopic or Trusty LTS)\n#!/bin/sh\n# trim all mounted file systems which support it\n# /sbin/fstrim --all || true\n\nOf course this will also affect SATA SSD's on a PCI expansion card, but that's something else. \n", "Q: Automatically dim brightness if battery is low In Ubuntu 14.04 there is no option in the energy settings what to do when the battery is low.

If you don't want to go for IDEs, you can try ctags and vim or emacs.

Although the author intended to say to change in /etc/i8kmon file, They mistakenly wrote /etc/i8mon instead in the code section. Since, OP was following the code, the configurations didn't work.\nOP saved the configs in ~/.i8kmon and that worked because user's config stored in ~/ is preferred than the ones in /etc and that way it was overriding the default configs. So, OP's assumption is wrong. Both /etc/i8kmon and ~/.i8kmon would work.

I attempted to install a windows application (DaemonLite) via Wine. Halfway through, a message came up that because of some \"serious problem\" it was not possible to install the program. Yet the program showed up in the Wine uninstaller. When I tried to unistall the program from the Wine uninstaller, I got the message that it was not possible to uninstall the program! I then uninstalled Wine altogether and re-installed it. Even then the defective program (together with the others that are working fine) showed up and refused to uninstall. So I am now stuck with a faulty program that neither works nor  uninstalls. Can anyone suggest a way out of the mess? \n\nA: The easiest way to do this will be to open nautilus, (the program where you view your files), go to your home directory, and press Ctrl + H. This will show hidden files, and you can double-click on .wine to open it. Under .wine, there should be a folder called something similar to drive_c. If you click on that you will see program files, and program files should contain the folder you are looking for. You can then delete it. \nI hope that helps.\nTo do this in the terminal, you would press Ctrl + Alt + T, and then enter the following:\nls -a \"/home/<enter your username here>/.wine/drive_c/Program Files\"\n\nThat will show you the list of directories in your program files. Choose the one you want to delete, and then type\nsudo rm \"/home/<enter your username here>/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/<enter name of folder to delete here>\"\n\nAll commands in the terminal are case-sensitive, unless you specify otherwise.\n\nA: Wine has a 'C drive' of sorts in the directory ~/.wine (a hidden file in your home directory), where it installs the Windows programs, and keeps its current configuration. So, you could reset wine by running this (it will remove all of wine's current configuration):\nrm -r ~/.wine\n\nInstead, you may just want to back it up so you can restore later if needed, by moving it:\nmv ~/.wine ~/.winebackup\n\nAnother method would be search in ~/.wine for the installed program and remove it - this is better if you have other stuff installed in wine you want to keep.\nYou run these commands in terminal - like this: \n\n", "Q: ~/.inputrc is missed in ubuntu 14.04 => Cannot create a key binding I want to add this key binding in the suitable conf file :\nControl-t: \"top -Ss \\C-m\"\n\nWhich means : Bind Ctrl+T keys to top -Ss command line .\n\ni enter on terminal sudo ls ~/.inputrc to check existence of this conf file . i get this error: \n No such file or directory\n\nWhere can i put this  binding.

I want to make backups of these VM's using the snapshot mechanism.\nThe purpose of these snapshots is to have a backup on an external device. I am currently trying to simply create the backup in /var/tmp.\nWhen I type  \nsudo virsh snapshot-create-as test-vm --memspec /var/tmp/test-vm-snapshot\n\nI get the message\n\nerror: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'transaction': Could not open '/var/lib/libvirt/images/test-vm.img': Permission denied\n\nI tried to solve this by temporarily giving read/write permissions (chmod og+rw) but then I get the same message.\nI read that this is due to AppArmor, and this seems to be confirmed by the syslog. However, if I temporarily stop AppArmor, I still get the same error message, and the same entries in the syslog.\nHow can I create an internal backup of a VM to a specific file?\n\nA: To get AppArmor (temporarily) out of the picture, I used aa-complain, which tells AppArmor to not enforce it's policy on some processes, but still make an entry in the log. This required sudo apt-get install apparmor-utils.\nFirst, I used sudo aa-status to see which processes were in \"enforced\" mode. These relevant processes were libvirtd and the VM.\nThen I set these to \"complain\" mode and made the snapshot:\nsudo aa-complain /usr/sbin/libvirtd\nsudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/libvirt/libvirt-20683be9-691f-42f2-9fd7-7f44ab423c1e\nsudo virsh snapshot-create-as test-vm --memspec /var/tmp/test-vm-snapshot\n\nIn this way, a file \"test-vm-snapshot\" was created in /var/tmp.  \nAfterwards, I used sudo aa-enforce to put these processes back in \"enforce\" mode.\nBut why /etc/init.d/apparmor stop didn't help, while the much more subtle aa-complain did, is still beyond me...\n", "Q: saving multiple files with cURL I have this list of URLs in a .txt file -which i'm suppose to get content of them.

The discussion there seems to come closest to addressing my problem.  (I'm beginning a new question because I don't have enough Reputation points to continue the earlier discussion with a \"Comment\") \nPROBLEM: Although my situation is a little different, I would like to ask if you can help. \nRather than a wired or a wireless network going down, I am using a USB modem (ZTE - MBlaze) in India. \nEach time it disconnects, the ONLY way that I can get it to reconnect (at least 80% of the time) is a complete RESTART.  \nSOLUTIONS TRIED: I tried both the suggestions in this strand, and in the link which you provided. \n \"sudo service network-manager restart\"  as well as \"sudo ifdown -a\" / \"sudo ifup -a\" \nNEITHER WORKED - Only a complete restart will allow use of the modem\nOTHER POSSIBILITIES: I can try a \"reboot without actually shutting down\" and/or \"kexec\" but it seems that for both of these I would have to close all applications.  They will only reduce the time, but not eliminate the inconvenience of a reboot. \nQUESTION: Can you suggest other Terminal commands that could help? \nThank you! \nBryan \nBTW -  System: Toshiba NB200 Intel Atom CPU N280 @ 1.66GHz x 2 \n   Graphics - Unknown, OS 32-bit, Disk 16.8 GB \n Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\nA: With some perseverance, the solutions suggested by Jorge in his earlier post How to successfully restart a network without reboot? solved my problem.  Using 'sudo service network-manager restart' followed by 'sudo ifdown -a' and then 'sudo ifup -a' works on my Ubuntu 12.04 netbook.  It always takes time. Once the network has restarted, it may take several minutes to \"rediscover\" my USB modem.   Sometimes I have to repeat the process.   Still, reconnect this way is FAR better than closing all programs and restarting Ubuntu every time the internet link drops.\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working in ubuntu 14.04 LTS Since when I got rid of windows 8 and installed ubuntu, my bluetooth never really worked. Ubuntu detects the bluetooth hardware (it shows the bluetooth icon in the status bar), and I can turn it on or off and set the visibility and such. However, it is never able to find any bluetooth device, and when I try to connect to my laptop from an other device, it usully doesn't find my computer. If it does find my computer, it will show it using the name it had in windows (I don't know if it's supposed to do that or not), and connecting to he laptop gives a communication error.\nI don't know exactely what's causing the problem, but I know that the bluetooth settings on windows 8 were quite glitched, which caused bluetooth to be always on untill you interrupted a device search, after which it was off untill the next reboot. Because of this, I think that maybe the glitched windows drivers messed something up that ubuntu doesn't repair. \nI did try ubuntu in a virtual machine in windows a few times before fully installing ubuntu, and bluetooth worked fine then.\nThis laptop has been fully tested in the factory yesterday after an overheating gpu was fixed, and they claim that all hardware behaved as it should. So I don't think it's a hardware issue.\nDoes anyone know what could be causing the problem, and how to fix it?\n\nA: Use rfkill to ensure there isn't any hard/soft block on your bluetooth device.

You don't necessarily need a keyboard layout. You can simply modify your existing xkb keyboard layout.\nThe xkb keyboard layout files are kept in directory /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/. From there just select your language with the code, for instance fr for french, es for spanish, or us for US english.\nIn that file, all the characters are mapped to keys. Each line in the keyboard is denoted with a code. The line where you have all the numbers is denoted with AE and the keys on it with numbers. Thus the number \"1\" key is 2nd key on the AE line, thus its code is AE01. On the line, the first symbol you get with pressing the key without any modifiers. The second symbol you get with Shift+key, the 3rd you get with AltGr+key, and the fourth one AltGr+Shift+key.\nkey <AE01> { [  1,               exclam,           NoSymbol,              exclamdown            ] };\nHere you can assign & modify your keyboard the way you find suitable to your needs.\nI have couple of modifications, and find them very useful :)\nFor more info: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Howto%3A%20Custom%20keyboard%20layout%20definitions\n", "Q: Trouble dual loading 14.04 and Windows 7 64 bit I am trying to dual boot 14.04 on my Lenovo laptop with Windows 7 64 bit.

Is there a good way to manage / keep track of the installed software on Ubuntu machine?\nThrough the years, we keep improving our system, install all kinds of useful tools to make ourselves more \"at home\" in our own system. Then comes the day, when one has to get a new laptop, install new version of Ubuntu, copy all files and set up the new system. And then spend days, weeks or even months installing again all the applications that were formely installed.\nIn this process, it would be very helpful to get all the former applications carried over.\nWhat are the best ways to accomplish this? Surely apt maintains db of all installed packages, but how does one get all these packages easily re-installed in the newly installed system?\n\nA: dpkg --get-selections > YourFile.txt will put all of your current packages' names into a text file for you.\nThen, on the new machine put the YourFile.txt somewhere (I'll use the desktop for example's sake) and do:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\ndpkg --set-selections < ~/Desktop/YourFile.txt\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\nsudo aptitude install $(cat ~/Desktop/YourFile.txt | awk '{print $1}')\n\nEDIT with a note: This will reinstall ALL of your installed packages. So if you're using (for example) xubuntu 12.04 now, but your new machine will be kubuntu 14.04 you'll run into a number of problems with your desktop managers, and in this case you'll probably want to edit the YourFile.txt to get rid of some of those things\n\nA: on the old system, run \nsudo apt-get install dpkg-repack fakeroot && mkdir ~/dpkg-repack; cd ~/dpkg-repack && sudo fakeroot -u dpkg-repack `dpkg --get-selections | grep install | cut -f1`\n\nto put every installed application into a folder as deb packages that can be installed on the target machine with \nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nthe best part is, it installs them all at once so you don't have to worry about dependencies.\n\nA: One thing both answers above fail to mention are those applications which come from non-standard PPA's - I had run across a backup / reinstall script which is \nbackup:\ndpkg --get-selections > ~/Package.list\nsudo cp -R /etc/apt/sources.list* ~/\nsudo apt-key exportall > ~/Repo.keys\n\nRestore\nsudo apt-key add ~/Repo.keys\nsudo cp -R ~/sources.list* /etc/apt/\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install dselect\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < ~/Package.list\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade -y\n\nI can't claim any credit for this, and yes it does have the same version problems as mentioned in the comments above, but if what you are looking for is a clean backup / reinstall this might be of help.\nOriginal posting for this script\nAlso note that I have changed the rsync script slightly for my own use\n", "Q: What all do I need with my Apache Server I was wondering what all extra I have to install on top of apache2.

Apache can serve files, and that is all that is necessary for javascript, css and jquery. All that technology works on the client side, i.e. in the browser. Cgi-bin is server-side technology, but that will work out-of-the-box as well.\n\nA: Apache alone is a webserver. The definition itself will explain that it can serve web requests to its clients as how the server is configured (HTTP via 80 / HTTPS via 443). If you're serving pages such as HTML, CSS.. etc, Apache alone should be able to handle without depending on other packages/services.\nBut remember, if you're serving PHP, database, JSP... etc. Well, you may need to consider on installing necessary packages such as PHP, MySQL, Tomcat... etc depending on your requirement.\nSearching for more gave me What's the easiest way to set up a LAMP stack? which is a simplified answer along with a link to its official documentation.\nHope this helps you! :)\n\nA: Apache has everything you need to run your web site. \nJavascript runs on the client side.

I have a laptop that I use on my home LAN, my work LAN and my work VPN via my home LAN through OpenConnect. In addition, I also sometimes use TorGuard, which is a OpenVPN connection. All of these are configured via NetworkManager in nm-applet. \nIf on my work LAN or work VPN, I must have the private DNS server and search domain because there are a number of servers that only resolve to hostnames within my network and have a standardized DNS suffix. This is set in the nm-applet settings for my work VPN and I have a separate ethernet connection profile for the work LAN. \nI am in a situation where regardless of what network I am currently on, I find that at seemingly random but often times I am unable to resolve hostnames and lose my search domain suffix if on my work VPN/LAN.\nTo fix the problem, and this fix works every time, I have to manually perform a sudo service dnsmasq restart. This resets my DNS servers and search domain to what they are supposed to be and everything works correctly again, for a few minutes. \nI keep having to restart the dnsmasq service to fix the domain resolution problem. \nUsing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in a Dell Latitude E6540. The ethernet controller is Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I217-LM (rev 04) and the wifi card Intel® Centrino® Advanced-N 6235.\nI've been asked to provide my network devices. I highly doubt hardware is the problem here, but I will humor you. There is one network card and one wifi card. Both work perfectly with the exception of having to restart the dnsmasq service repeatedly to get DNS resolution working. \nI sometimes use the wifi, the bluetooth does work but I don't use it for networking. I usually am using ethernet.\n\nA: You can check your Dnsmasq configuration here:\n$ sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf\n\nI think your best answer you can find here: Special Cases & UFW\nMaybe most best is it:\n$ sudo ufw allow bootps\n\nAlso read above very important part about Local DNS Cache.\n\nA: What you can try doing is open /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and comment out line dns=dnsmasq. Save and sudo service network-manager restart or reboot. \n\nThis basically is a line that tells Network Manager to use dnsmasq plug-in; commenting-out prevents Network Manager from using it.  Referring to this post from  Unix Stackexchange and this one from askubuntu, you'll get a hint that dnsmasq doesn't always do a good job. \nNow will things be resolved without that line ? Sure. I have it commented out, and use OpenDNS , as set in configuration for my home network, and Google's public dns at school.\nYou can also refer to my post here for some more info that may be useful\n", "Q: Hosting 12.04 guest on 14.04 server with KVM & libvirt I've been pulling my hair out trying to get Ubuntu 12.04LTS server (64bit) working under a standard KVM/libvirt setup on Ubuntu 14.04.\nI can create a new virtual machine using virt-manager and run through the installation process from an ISO image. However, when I reboot on completion the new virtual machine hangs after fsck.

I found that setting the guest machine's display driver to VGA using virt-manager cleared up the issue and after this it ran fine.\n\nA: I got a very similar problem.

Environment presentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Host Machine:  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\n*Guest Machine: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  Inside this VM, a my_program.py exists. \n\n*Virtualization system: VirtualBox 4.3\nQuestion:\nIs there any way to launch my_program.py from the host machine ?\n\nA: You can use Vboxmanage to do this.  The form of the command is \nVBoxManage guestcontrol <uuid|vmname> exec[ute]\n            --image <path to program> --username <name>\n            [--passwordfile <file> | --password <password>]\n            [--environment \"<NAME>=<VALUE> [<NAME>=<VALUE>]\"]\n            [--verbose] [--timeout <msec>]\n            [--wait-exit] [--wait-stdout] [--wait-stderr]\n            [--dos2unix] [--unix2dos]\n            -- [[<argument1>] ...

VBoxManage guestcontrol\n\nA: The easiest way to launch an app in guest is to send a keyboard key press to guest from host. In the guest the app is setuped to launch on a key press (Using settings -> keyboard shortcuts  or ccsm or any other ways). From a terminal or from a script we send the key press to guest, on listening that guest OS launch the program/app.  \nTo send a key press use the VBoxManage's option keyboardputscancode\nFor example\nVBoxManage controlvm [name] keyboardputscancode 1d 38 e0 53 will send \nCtrl + Alt + Delete  and \nVBoxManage controlvm [name] keyboardputscancode 38  24  will send Alt + J.  \nThe advantage of this method is you don't need to install any software, even guest additions. You don't need to setup any network, ssh, passwords etc..\nScan codes for a key can be found here.   \n", "Q: Problem with access to mounted drive I can not make my newly mounted hdd work properly.

After that, need to install VirtualBox, set up Win7 and install CorelDRAW.\nIs that possible? Important thing is that VirtualBox + Windows + CorelDRAW must be on /home, because theres only 20GB on /root.\n\nA: As an aside, I'd recommend putting your swap on your HDD rather than your SSD - this is for two main reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*4 GB of a 24 GB drive is a large percentage. SSDs run best when you're using below a certain percentage of their storage (I think the number is around 80%)\n\n*Lots of writes from the swap, which will likely lead to degradation of the hard drive faster\n\n\nAs for the rest of it, you should be good to go. Virtualbox lets you put the windows 7 virtual hard drive wherever you please.\n\nA: If what you are asking is \"Is it possible to put /home on a different disk than /root?\" then yes, that is possible.\nI'm not very familiar with VirtualBox, but according to this article, it should work just fine.\nOne such way to install /home and /root on separate partitions can be found here: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/installseparatehome\nFrom what I can tell it answers your question. \nIt appears to be a little out-dated, but it looks like it will still work.\n", "Q: Problem to use µTorrent I'm with problem to install µTorrent I used this command in this link\nAnd appear this message\n \nI want to make download files in thepiratebay.se but the most files it can't be make using bit torrent in Magnet Links.\nThere other way to install Magnet Links? \nOr how can I fix this problem with my µTorrent? \n\nA: µtorrent is working properly, there is nothing you should worry about this message.

The system also has to be set up in a way where the mod_rewrite ignores internal file names and directories, as they are proxied to the external site (for security purposes) through the script.\nI had this script running on an IIS7 server for a while, and it worked perfectly fine. Also, I have followed the whole a2enmod mod_rewrite, which outputted success.

These numbers are completely different from each other, yet it's the same version. Can anyone explain which number means what and why when installing drivers it says install on x.org 6.9 or later but after installing it says I have 1.15?\n\nA: My guess is you are confusing Xorg numbering and the numbering of the modules.\n\nXorg version numbering has changed since xorg 7.0. Nowadays, Xorg is released with a version number (like 7.4). This release is composed of various modules which have their own version number (each module started at version \"1.0\" when Xorg 7.0 development cycle started). For instance, Xorg 7.3 was shipped with Xserver version v1.4, xf86-input-evdev v1.1.5, xf86-video-intel v2.1.1\n\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/Xorg\nand\nhttp://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/10/x11r75-released-but-what-is-it.html\nIf that does not clarify your version numbers, update your question with version of Ubuntu and the specific packages you are asking about.\n", "Q: APT.

If you are having trouble with network, as that seems to many times be the problem anyway, see if it is a broadcom adapter, in which case you need to reinstall the bcmwl-kernel-source driver or whatever driver you are using, even if you came from a broadcom card before\n\nA: \nI can't afford losing my current ubuntu installation\n\nWhat does that mean in practice?  \nJust moving the SSD over is probably prone to generate loads of issues - depending on the hardware differences between the machines. \n\nI generally make sure that /home is saved - maybe keep /etc/* too - to have it as something to pick cherries from. I would not consider it be possible use a copy straight out of the box for a new computer. Some things in /home may well fall into the same category too.\nMoving Windows is definitely not easy in this way, none of the software harddisk / partition copying has this as a viable option AFAIK. I haven't even tried moving between something else than partitions and harddisks on the same computer.\n\nThe best - as in \"least error prone\" - is to move data by hand, then reinstall all software and work from there - moving data back into place, considering differences between software used and possibly also keeping an eye on versions.\n", "Q: Ubuntu dependency problems My ubuntu 12.4 box has been off for 10 days.

I came to this question because of the mentioning of openssh-server, which in my case was stuck. \n\nopenssh-server : Depends: openssh-client (= 1:5.9p1-5ubuntu1.2)\n\nIt was stuck because openssh-client was already updated (somehow) to 1.4.\nI managed to solve this by force the configuration of the openssh-server by using\n\n$> dpkg --force-depends-version --configure openssh-server\n\nwhich installed the openssh-server, which then allowed me to update the openssh-server to a newer version corresponding with the installed openssh-client version.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 14.04 with Cups LPD/LPR support I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 with Lamp, Samba and Cups installed by server media installation.

I admin a batch of Ubuntu 14.04 desktop machines in a public library (they are diskless and boot via DRBL). Sometime users (I'm guessing kids) remove icons from the launcher. I want to either prevent that or have a simple means of restoring the launcher's state (eg via an autostart script).  How can I do that?  I found this (old) thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2023390, but there are no specific details and I can't seem to figure out how to use dconf.  \n\nA: The current configuration of most areas of the desktop can be viewed using Dconf Editor, or using the command line utility gsettings:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\nExample output:\n['application://nautilus.desktop', 'application://firefox.desktop', 'application://libreoffice-writer.desktop', 'application://unity-control-center.desktop', 'unity://running-apps', 'application://gnome-terminal.desktop', 'unity://expo-icon', 'unity://devices']\n\nYou can then use to restore it to that state (try removing things from the launcher, you can see any changes), using the set option (note the quotes \") with the output from the get command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \"['application://nautilus.desktop', 'application://firefox.desktop', 'application://libreoffice-writer.desktop', 'application://unity-control-center.desktop', 'unity://running-apps', 'application://gnome-terminal.desktop', 'unity://expo-icon', 'unity://devices']\"\n\nSo if you get the launcher in the state you want, and use the get to get it, you can then set it back later with the set command.

This you can do by:\nsudo apt-get install mercurial\n\nThen I used the latest version of FreeFem++ which you can get by:\nhg clone http://www.freefem.org/ff++/ff++\n\nUse the command:\ncd ff++\n\nto go into the directory where the “hg” downloaded the files. Here you start:\nautoreconf -i\n\nTo have all necessary packages for FreeFem++ use apt-get install routine with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install bison curl flex patch rsync wget g++ gfortran libx11-dev libice-dev libsm-dev libxau-dev libxdmcp-dev libxrender-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev libxpm-dev libxt-dev m4 make mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mpi-default-bin mpi-default-dev libvtk5-dev libopenblas-dev libfftw3-dev libsuitesparse-dev cmake bzip2\n\nTo get the graphic interface write:\nsudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev\n\nNow we have all stuff to compile the files with:\n./configure\n\nor use:\n./configure –enable-download\n\nfor more software packages, like solvers and other additional stuff. At the end you get a message since some packages are still missing, if yes use the apt-get install routine again. Afterwards you can use:\ndownload/getall\n\nto get still more additional solvers and fftw packages. Now for compiling use:\nmake\n\nThis took nearly 20 minutes on my HP Elitebook 8440p. The compiling can be tested by:\nmake check\n\nTo install FreeFem++ use:\nsudo make install\n\nNow FreeFem++ works on your Linux Distribution.\n\nA: freefem++ only \"Provides the binaries of the FreeFem++ FE suite\". Original package is freefem which is \"PDE oriented language using Finite Element Method\". See Packages.Ubuntu.com.\nSo you need to install freefem package as suggested by @Braiam.\nsudo apt-get install freefem\n\n\nA: just run this way\nFreeFem++ yourfile.edp\n\n\nA: There are some problems with packaging and naming with that package.\nThe one biting you is: You need to write the name in its obscure way.\nThe name of the main program is not called like we \nwould expect from the package name, with lowercase letters freefem++, but FreeFem++. Even with an intermittent uppercase letter.\nSo you should be able to run in like this from a shell:\n$ FreeFem++ ... ...\n\nNote it's uppercase, but different ellsewhere too. So a good shell kan not just offer the uppercase variant of what you search: femfem++ can not be replaced by Femfem++.\nActually, femfem is referred to by three different names - there is also ffas a prefix.\n(I would call this mixub a bug,, but it's hard to sort that out late in the game)\n\nTake a look, the package FemFem++ contains other binaries:\n$ apt-file list --fixed-string freefem++\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/FreeFem++\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/FreeFem++-mpi\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/FreeFem++-nw\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/cvmsh2\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/ff-c++\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/ff-get-dep\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/ff-mpirun\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/ff-pkg-download\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/ffbamg\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/ffglut\nfreefem++: /usr/bin/ffmedit\n[ ... docs follow ...]\n\n", "Q: After updating ubuntu 14.04 to ubuntu-proposed using software updater on jun 27th built-in notebook display keeps showing boot screen after updating ubuntu 14.04 using software updater to ubuntu-proposed automatic displays configuration stopped working correctly. My built-in notebook display keeps showing ubuntu boot screen(the one with ubuntu logo and 5dots as \"progressbar\"). Other display(s) are correctly switched to ubuntu login screen as expected. Same problem remains after login. I need to switch off built-in display and turn it back on using \"Displays\" settings to solve the problem.

This looks like one of those regressions. You shouldn't be using package from this section (unless you're knowingly pulling in a package for testing).\nYour best chance is to boot from a live CD, remove the trusty-proposed lines from /etc/apt/sources.list, and downgrade the packages to the standard repos, starting with the Linux kernel packages.\n", "Q: nfs configured - clients cannot connect I'm trying to get NFS working on my Ubuntu server 14.04 again. It was originally working until last weekend,  but when I tried to configure samba everything went fubar. Now none of my devices can connect with the NFS share.\nThis is what I added this to my /etc/exports:\n/export/storage 192.168.0.1/24(rw,async,insecure,no_subtree_check)\n\nAnd I added this to my /etc/fstab:\n/storage /export/storage none bind 0 0\n\nMy file permissions for both /storage & /export/storage are set to 775.

Does anyone have an idea what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: Have fixed the problem. Apparently my firewall was acting like a shredder. The solution was:\nsudo iptables --flush\nsudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT\nsudo iptables-save\n\nResult: established a ssh connection with my server through on of the devices and successfully mounted the nfs share.\nA colleague advised me to also slightly change the /etc/exports for safety reasons:\n/export/storage 192.168.0.0/24(rw,sync,insecure,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)\n\nAnd later on installed iptables-persistent so the changes to my firewall settings remain after reboots.

When I installed Linux I chose to encrypt my hard drive, including the home folder. If I delete a file in the normal fashion (not securely deleting it with overwrites) will it not be recoverable by virtue of being on an encrypted drive?\n\nA: If you can recover a drive from a filesystem of an unencrypted drive you should also be able to recover the file under the same circumstances from an encrypted drive, given that you can still mount the filesystem on the encrypted drive. Simply speaking, there should be no difference. The key here is that the filesystem on top still works as designed, no matter how the underlying storage blocks are organized and encrypted or not.\nIf you use filesystem encryption like ecryptfs instead of whole drive encryption, you have encrypted files on a filesystem of an unencrypted disk, so this would be exactly the same as without encryption, just the content of the file and its size is different.\nIf you use SSDs remember that there exists things like TRIM.\n", "Q: Many files in /var/lib/dpkg/info/ corrupted; how to recover When I run sudo apt-get (anything), I invariably get this error:\ndpkg: unrecoverable fatal error, aborting:\n files list file for package 'thunderbird-gnome-support' is missing final newline\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)\n\nAfter some Googling, I learn that this is because /var/lib/dpkg/info/thunderbird-gnome-support.list is corrupt. I cat that file, and it most certainly is corrupt - it should be a plain text file containing a list of absolute file paths, but instead is a binary file.\nNow I inspect the other files in the same directory, and it appears that many of them are corrupt in the same way. This indicates that something went severely wrong in my file system, that caused many files to get corrupted. Unfortunately, it happened to affect system files.\nHow do I recover from this?\n\nMore details:\nJust prior to this, I installed a routine update when Ubuntu prompted me. It was a new Linux kernel, and some system file headers.\nAfter restarting, these were my specs:\nOS specs:\n$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 13.10\nRelease:    13.10\nCodename:   saucy\n$ uname -a\nLinux brendang-linux 3.11.0-24-generic #41-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jun 9 20:36:00 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nImmediately after restarting for the first time, the entire file system appeared to be mounted as read only (which has not been the case previously). Subsequently I have had to reboot several times before the system worked. I have done touch /forcefsck in between them to ensure that fsck runs, and am not sure what else needs to be done.\n\nA: In my case i got a lot of *.list files corrupted. If you do \nfile /var/lib/dpkg/info/<package_name>.list\n\nyou should usually get:\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/<package_name>.list: ASCII text\n\nbut if your list files are corrupted you will get:\n/var/lib/dpkg/info/<package_name>.list: data\n\nI made two scripts to fix this problem.\nThe first script check for this and rename each corrupted .list file into *.list.broken\nmove_broken_list_files.sh\nThe second script cycle for each *.list.broken file and force reinstallation of the package.\ninstall_missing_list.sh\nsometimes the install fails because of problems with triggers: \nfgets gave an empty string from '/var/lib/dpkg/info/libnih1:amd64.triggers'\n\nin that case you have to move/rename that file like: \nmv /var/lib/dpkg/info/libnih1:amd64.triggers /var/lib/dpkg/info/libnih1:amd64.triggers.broken\n\nHope this helps someone facing the same mess.\n\nA: I solved this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete the offending file (in the OP case /var/lib/dpkg/info/thunderbird-gnome-support.list\n\n*reinstall the offending package using apt-get install --reinstall thunderbird-gnome-support\nThis recreated the deleted file list for me as well.\nOf course, this can be cumbersome if a lot of files are corrupt, but in my case it was only a single file and the solution was quite easy in this case.\n\nA: Backup your damaged list (you can move all .list files)\nmkdir /tmp/damaged && mv /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list /tmp/damaged\n\nThen, you can install your new package\napt install thunderbird-gnome-support\n\n", "Q: RDP to amazon EC2 Ubuntu instance I've set up an Amazon EC2 instance.

When the indicator does an update (several times per hour), the icon is recreated (as an SVG file) and so the icon changes over time.\nRecently, the icon is not showing any change unless I mouse click the icon (or label).  I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit and my indicator uses Python 3 and Appindicator3. \nThe code below is representative of the issue and shows an icon which should change every three seconds (I made the interval three seconds to see the issue quickly - in reality the icon changes hourly at most).  The icon itself is an SVG file and shows a numerical count, starting from zero and increments every three seconds.\nI have tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and Xubuntu 12.04 (via VirtualBox) and the icon DOES change on each three second update.\nTesting on Ubuntu 14.04, the icon does NOT change UNLESS I click on it.  If I change the label text on each update, the icon WILL also change, but only if I don't repeat the SAME text for the label.\nIs anyone able to confirm this please?

This is optimum, no?!).\nWell, libappindicator was designed for static icons loaded from files. ( lp bug#812067: API needed: pixbuf icon setting support ). You want to make a workaround on that by changing icon file contents. In your case its ok, but not for general use where it needs shorter update delay (ex: 120ms) ie, too much file io requests (open,write,close).\n\n\n*\n\n*Either, you change theme path this is kind of trick:\nself.indicator.set_icon_theme_path( os.getenv( \"HOME\" )+\"./\"*(self.count % 2) )\nself.indicator.set_icon_full( IndicatorTestIcon.SVG_ICON, str( self.count ) )\n\n\n*Or change name (you can use same previous method, alternating between 2 names):\nSVG_ICON = \".\" + NAME+ \"_{0}\"\n...\nself.indicator.set_icon_full( IndicatorTestIcon.SVG_ICON.format(self.count % 2) , str( self.count ) )\n...\nwith open( IndicatorTestIcon.SVG_FILE.format(self.count % 2), \"w\" ) as f:\n\nBTW, it better to use set_icon_full, set_icon is deprecated.

I need to take a screenshot of a whole web page.\nI have seen How can I take a full page screenshot of a webpage from the command line? where many ways to take a screenshot are proposed but I need to use firefox for a better effect.\n\nA: To make screenshots of web pages showing the whole scrollable area of the page in firefox, I propose two separate ways.  \nBoth save an image of the page that shows all parts or the web page that you could reach by scrolling down (and right/left) - think all view positions stitched together;\nFor long pages, the image can easily be several thousand pixel high.\n\nThe \"professional\" way - using a web browser GUI-level testing and automation tool:\nThe automation tool Selenium - usually used for UI testing - can do full page screen shots;\nIt seems to be some overhead to set it up just for that task, though.\nFor example:\nCommand: open; Target: http://www.google.com\nCommand: captureEntirePageScreenshotAndWait; Target: \\\\Screenshots\\\\test.png\n\nSee so.SE: Screenshots using Selenium IDE Firefox plugin\nTo install the firefox part of Selenium, get the firefox add-on - but not from the official add-ons page - it's on the download page of Selenium as an xpi file. This is the current version.\n(There are lots of add-ons for extending selenium itself (but in the technical for of a firefox add-on),  all called \"Selenium ...\" or even \"Selenium IDE ...\" on the Add-ons website - very confusing.)\n\nThe \"hackish\" way - using internal firefox commands by keyboard automation:\nThere is an internal command prompt in firefox, kind of a development tool, which, as @Fireflight pointed out, has a command to make screenshots. But, as far as I know, that can not controlled from the command shell line normally. But what we can do, is to simulate key presses to make use of it. \nWe need to choose a browser window, open the prompt, enter the firefox internal command (using a file name based on current date and time), run the command, and close the prompt again:\nFF=$(xdotool selectwindow)\nxdotool key --window $FF Shift+F2 sleep 1\nxdotool type --window $FF --delay 50 \"screenshot page-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).png --fullpage \"\nxdotool key --window $FF Return sleep 0.5 key --window $FF Shift+F2\n\nThe command line utility xdotool can interact with X windows on the level of X11 events. We use it to choose the firefox window that shows the page, and to send the right key strokes to make the screenshot.\n(This is a somewhat brittle approach: it's depending on keyboard timing, it will not work if the prompt is already opened, or contains text (To open or close it, press Shift-F2) - but if it works, it's really nice.)\n\nAs an example how this kind of screenshot looks, here's an example of man xdotool on manpages.ubuntu.com, scaled down to 20% (original 1336x15653), done with the xdotool solution:\n\n\nA: In Firefox you can hit Shift-F2, then in the command line that appears, just type: \nscreenshot filename.png --fullpage\n\nThere are several more commands and options available as well. \n\nA: You can take a video from your firefox. Use a command like:\nmkdir ~/my_video\ncd ~/my_video\navconv  -an  -f x11grab -r 30 -s 1024x768 -i :0.0+10,20  -vcodec libx264  -preset ultrafast -threads 0 video.mkv\n\nYou will likely need to modify the size (1024x768) and position ( :0.0+10,20 ) to suit your needs.\nOnce you have the video you can convert it to a bunch of .png files with mplayer: \nmplayer video.mkv -vo png\n\nThen select the best image for your needs.\n", "Q: Why no Space on my HardDrive?

What will Ubuntu's reaction be to the new hardware added, will it detect and probe the device and install the necessary driver(s)? Or should I rather reinstall Ubuntu with the new hardware attached? Thank you.\n\nA: Colour card? My answer is fairly generic but I'll assume graphics card.\nGenerally speaking, Ubuntu has drivers for most hardware built in. Even graphics cards that offer proprietary drivers have free counterparts that will be used if you haven't already installed the proprietary driver.\nThis means that in most cases, you can just throw the new hardware at Ubuntu and it'll cope. If there are alternative options, the Ubuntu Drivers dialogue should offer you them when you boot up.\nThere are, of course, exceptions to this but there's no set rule for how you work around it.

But how can I check that before?\nBest regards\nFredrik\n\nA: Yes you can just burn the Ubuntu image and boot into the live system to test out 14.04 before you install it.\nYou can check with lsblk if your home directory is on a different partition/disk.\n\nA: Definitely it is possible. You can download the Ubuntu 14.04 liveCD from Here : http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop. And then boot up your computer using the liveCD. Choose the option try ubuntu without installing. That would boot from the DVD, and will not make any changes to your PS. After you are happy with all of your tests, you can go ahead and install.\nUbuntu usually works better on older hardware, as the drivers are more likely to be available.\n\nA: You have a display problem. Updating to 14.04 might solve that problem, and it might not work out. Trying the live cd will show you if 14.04 works with your system. So in that case a clean install will work. \nDo you have a complex setup (like for development) or a pretty standard ubuntu (all programs installed via the software center - no complex configuration)? In the former case, you could make an image of you current harddrive, to go back to it. After making that image, make sure you try if it works, otherwise it's a waste of time and effort. Better - if you have a spare disk: use the image to try the upgrade, and keep the original drive as it is. \n", "Q: What to learn Ubuntu application development in python, where to start?

Synaptic is an excellent package management tool that used to be included in older versions of ubuntu.\nTo install it:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nclick on fix broken packages.\n\nA: This should fix your problem without re-installing the package.\nsudo dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq --remove <package_name here>\n\nFollowed by: sudo apt-get update\n", "Q: SMART tests show rapidly oscillating Hardware ECC Recovered value I have been subjected to an unholy amount of pain from my desktop tonight, including the near-loss of data due to corruption (in the /tmp directory !?) on one disk and erratic behavior from the other disk.\nOne disk is used for file storage, and the other is used solely for swap space.

To define what I mean by \"custom path identifier\", I mean a short set of character(s) that represent a whole path, and example of this would be the ~, if you type cd ~ in your Terminal Emulator it will go to your home folder.  But I'd like to make a custom one for a different path.  I looked in the .bashrc folder for hints on how to do this, but I could find anything unfortunately.\n\nThe \"custom path identifier\" I'm trying to make is ~~ to /home/myuser/Applications/Custom/Java/.  Since I'm going to be using that path a lot ( and daily) I don't want to keep retyping the whole path, and just typing ~~ would be nice.  I tried using the alias command: \nalias ~~=\"/home/myuser/Applications/Custom/Java/\"\n\nBut, unfortunately this did not work.\n\nOn the side note, I apologize if I used the wrong terminology for anything, I'm fairly new to all this Linux stuff and I know very little.  So thanks for any extra information I get.\n\nA: The tilde (~) has a special meaning in bash, is an expansion of bash and takes the value of $HOME environment variable. Read Tilde Expansion section from GNU Bash Reference Manual to understant how it wors. So, I think that what you want to accomplish is something similar to:\nmyuser@ubuntu:~$ pushd -n \"/home/myuser/Applications/Custom/Java\"\n~ ~/Applications/Custom/Java\nmyuser@ubuntu:~$ cd ~1\nmyuser@ubuntu:~/Applications/Custom/Java$\nRead man pushd for more info.\nNext, to go directly inside of /home/myuser/Applications/Custom/Java everytime when you will run cd ~1 command in your terminal just add the following line to the  end of your ~/.bashrc file:\npushd -n \"/home/myuser/Applications/Custom/Java\" >/dev/null\n\nReload your ~/.bashrc file with source ~/.bashrc and then use cd ~1 everytime when you want to change the current working directory to /home/myuser/Applications/Custom/Java.\n\nA: In zsh this is dead easy, because you don't need to write cd explicitly, you can simply create an alias like this:\nalias x=/some/path\n\nAdd this to your .zshrc (or whatever file you will source on the zsh startup) and you're ready to go. Now you can jump to this directory by calling the alias, namely x in this example.\n\nA: You could use the shell option \"cdable_vars\"\nshopt -s cdable_vars\n\nAlso, take a look at CDPATH,\nand the shell option \"autocd\"\nFor the description of how CDPATH works, see the cd section in the man page of bash\nman bash | less -p 'cd \\['\nThe solutions work for both bash and zsh.\n\nIf you use zsh, you can use global aliases to replace an identifier everywhere in the command line, not just as command.\n\nA: You can also customize your alias just like I do\nalias work = \"cd ~ && cd /home/anish/workspace\" \n\nIt's also the better approch suppose you are in some directory and you have to navigate to different this might be easy\n", "Q: How to fix apparmor=\"DENIED\" for telepathy-mission-control-5 under Ubuntu 14.04?

The second error message (in Polish) is exacly the same error, but it appears after logging in and in correct language.\nIt seems like \"before logging in\" the system does not know which language I use, so it defaults to english.\n\n\n\nA: First of all some introductory words as to what mission-control is:\n\nMission  Control  implements [...] the  Telepathy  D-Bus  specification,  allowing\nclients  like empathy to store account details, connect to accounts,\nrequest communication channels, and have channels dispatched to them.\n\nSource\nTo disable the mission-control profile for apparmor, first use aa-status.

There are various options to start a program minimised, or to start a program maximised and they work well, but I'm always looking for new challenges.\nIf I start a program minimised using the Devil's Pie method, and then click on it in the launcher, it restores to its regular size. Instead, I would like it to restore to a maximised state.\nIn other words, I want it to act as though it had started maximised, and then been minimised.\n\nA: You can achieve a minimized maximized window using Python:\nimport wnck\nimport gtk\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\nchrome = subprocess.Popen([\"google-chrome\"])\n\nb = True\nwhile b:\n    screen = wnck.screen_get_default()\n    while gtk.events_pending():\n        gtk.main_iteration()\n    windows = screen.get_windows()\n    for w in windows:\n        if w.get_pid() == chrome.pid:\n            w.maximize()\n            w.minimize()\n            b = False\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n\nchrome.wait()\n\ngoogle-chrome in this case will maximize then minimize. After this you just create a .desktop that can launch the script like the example shown below:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Application Name\nComment=Application Comment\nExec=python /exact/path/to/python/script.py\nIcon=icon\nCategories=valid categories;\n\nMake sure to set the desktop as a executable file or it will not function.\nThe script should be edited on line 6 where google-chrome should be replaced with whatever command you wish to execute. If the program have parameters they can be passed as following: \"google-chrome\", \"para1\", \"para2\".\nCred to this question for the python script (changed to chrome in my testing).\n", "Q: Is there a hindi to hindi dictionary?

When installing Ubuntu I can create a user with an encrypted folder, what I always do.\nNow after the installation the login password for this user is also the sudo password. Is that how it should be? I actually would like to have a different user login and sudo password, does is make sense? Should I do that, how?\n\nA: Yes, that is how it should be. Ubuntu is designed this way.\nBenefits of using sudo (from the Community Help Wiki):\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu installer has fewer questions to ask.\n\n*Users don't have to remember an extra password (i.e. the root password), which they are likely to forget (or write down so anyone can crack into their account easily).\n\n*It avoids the \"I can do anything\" interactive login by default (e.g. the tendency by users to login as an \"Administrator\" user in Microsoft Windows systems), you will be prompted for a password before major changes can happen, which should make you think about the consequences of what you are doing.\n\n*sudo adds a log entry of the command(s) run (in /var/log/auth.log). If you mess up, you can always go back and see what commands were run. It is also nice for auditing.\n\n*Every cracker trying to brute-force their way into your box will know it has an account named Root and will try that first. What they don't know is what the usernames of your other users are. Since the Root account password is locked, this attack becomes essentially meaningless, since there is no password to crack or guess in the first place.\n\n*Allows easy transfer for admin rights, in a short term or long term period, by adding and removing users from groups, while not compromising the Root account.\n\n*sudo can be setup with a much more fine-grained security policy.\n\n*The Root account password does not need to be shared with everybody who needs to perform some type of administrative task(s) on the system (see the previous bullet).\n\n*The authentication automatically expires after a short time (which can be set to as little as desired or 0); so if you walk away from the terminal after running commands as Root using sudo, you will not be leaving a Root terminal open indefinitely. \n\n\nOther Linux distributions use a separate root user with a different password. If you wish to use Ubuntu like that, you can set a password for root:\nsudo passwd\n\nThen you can log in as root from TTY or run su - from a terminal and enter the root password.\nOnce you can log in as root, you can remove yourself from the sudo group:\ngpasswd -d <user> sudo\n\n", "Q: How to compile and install ia32-libs in Ubuntu 14.04?

I'm new to Linux and am still getting to grips with the basics, but am beginning to get a feel for things.\nI have Postfix 2.11 installed as an MTA.  We receive mail from a Smarthost to our router, redirect all incoming port 25 traffic to Postfix where amavis and spamassassin do their work, then send it on to our Exchange box.  This all works perfectly.\nHowever, I notice in the mail.log file that the vast majority of SPAM does not come from the smarthost, it's received directly by Postfix from the internet.  The smarthost always uses the same IP address.  Is there a way I can tell Postfix to only accept incoming mail from this single IP address and reject everything else, or are there risks involved in this that I'm not seeing?\n\nA: Well, turns out this was indeed very easy.\nIn main.cf include the IP address of the SmartHost:\n\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n\nand add this line to the end of the main.cf file:\n\nsmtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject\n\nReload postfix:\n\nsudo postfix reload\n\nNow any connections from IP addresses not included in mynetworks will be rejected.\n\nA: The easiest manner in which to accomplish this would be to go back to your router, and modify the rule redirecting port 25 traffic to your Ubuntu machine.  Allow it to only redirect traffic from your smarthost, and dump the rest.\n", "Q: HP ProBook 4740s - Win8 OEM + Ubuntu 14.04 Is it even possible to install Ubuntu 14.04 alongside Win8 OEM on this laptop?\nWhen I set UEFI hybrid and disable SafeBoot I'am able to boot from DVD with Ubuntu, and install, but I haven't found a way to boot to grub (grub2).

There's a possibility that a firmware update is available that will fix the problem, so go looking for that first. (HP will probably call it a \"BIOS update,\" although it's not really a BIOS.) If that fails, you've got to use an ugly hack to get Linux to boot: Move the Microsoft boot loader from EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi to some other name and move GRUB, rEFInd, or some other Linux-aware boot manager to that name. Depending on the boot manager you choose, you may need to explicitly reconfigure it to chainload to the Windows boot loader if you want to dual-boot. See here for a more thorough description of this issue with respect to rEFInd; the same principles apply to GRUB. The Boot Repair utility can do this automatically for GRUB, but you'll probably have to check an option on the Advanced tab.\nIf the computer is new, I recommend another approach: Return it to the store for a refund. Only when manufacturers start seeing returns for their defective firmware will they put effort into fixing them.\n", "Q: Add/edit line text in file without open editor (linux command) I know how to add new text to a file, but how can I edit it?\nExample: adding hello_world = 1 to test.txt using the following command:\necho \"hello_world = 1\" >> test.txt\n\nBut how can I change 1 to 0 or something else?\n\nA: Through awk,\nawk '{sub(/1/,\"0\")}1' infile > outfile\n\nExample:\n$ echo 'hello_world = 1' | awk '{sub(/1/,\"0\")}1'\nhello_world = 0\n\n\nA: Using sed:\nsed -i 's/1/0/g' test.txt\n\nIn general:\nsed -i 's/oldstring/newstring/g' filename\n\nSee man sed for more info.\n", "Q: What kernel does Ubuntu Studio 14.04 use?

This automatically partitioned the hard drive, one partition for each os.  I have since deleted the zorin install, and want to get back the space it took on the hard drive for the ubuntu install.  Can I do this by reinstalling ubuntu?\n\nA: No reinstall needed you can use Gparted and extend your ubuntu partition. Create a live Ubuntu usb boot from it and use Gparted to extend your Ubuntu partition. (you cannot resize with Gparted while running Ubuntu so use Ubuntu live usb/cd).\ni forgot to mention you should use \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" as @user68186 said \n\nA: Yes, you can do this by reinstalling ubuntu. However, there are easier ways. If you do not want to reinstall ubuntu, I would recommend using Gparted partition editor. To do this, you will have to create an ubuntu live usb disk or cd. If you don't already have a .iso of ubuntu, you can download it from ubuntu.com. Once you have downloaded the iso, you can either open startup disk creator from your dashboard and create a usb disk, or burn it to a cd and boot from that. After you have booted from the cd or usb disk (by choosing try ubuntu without installing), open Gparted and you should be able to move the start of your ubuntu os partition to the beginning of the disk, after deleting the zorin os8 partition.\nNote: be very careful when doing this, as you will lose your install if you accidentally delete the wrong partition.\nP.S. Gparted may require you to unmount the volumes you are working on before editing them. To do this from Gparted, just right click and select \"unmount\". Also remember that nothing is actually done until you hit the apply button.\nMake sure you do not move your /boot partition, (if you have one) and if your computer will not boot afterwards, you may need to reinstall GRUB. The easiest way to do this is by following the method here: http://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/\n", "Q: \"Connection is Untrusted \" error in Firefox I have downloaded Ubuntu 14.04 and I have tried it (without installing it).\nI connected to the internet via DSL and I tried to surf.\nWhen I tried to go to an https:// site, it showed me the error message \"This Connection is Untrusted\" with the following Technical Details (for example):\n\nmail.google.com uses an invalid security certificate.

When I close my terminal which molden does not give me any response. What should I do? Please help me.\n\nA: First of all, modifying your $PATH in that way is a temporary change for your current terminal session.  Other concurrent or later terminal sessions will not see that change reflected.  Add that command to your ~/.profile file if you want it to persist.\nSecondly the which command is designed to search the directories in your $PATH.  If the link to \"molden\" is not in your $PATH or (in your case) your $PATH gets reverted, it will not find it.  See the which man page for more details.\n\nA: If you're using Ubuntu Desktop (GUI), and you modify ~/.profile, you still won't see the changes reflected in a new graphical/Gnome Terminal because it starts the Terminal as a non-login shell, so it doesn't load ~/.profile. You will have to log out and log back in for it to take effect.\nAn alternative is to set the path in ~/.bashrc, which is loaded for non-login shells.

I have this windows PC, and I want to install this Ubuntu physically without VMware. Last time I installed this, I lost up-to 160GB, and it was all of my hard drive. I have 4 drives C:, D:, F: and E:. (on my new HDD with 320GB) where as I had like this on my 160GB too. But it was totally wasted because all the movies, videos, images and data was removed and the whole hard-drive was formatted and was partitioned into one drive.

Last time I did physical install was on 160GB HDD, and I lost all my data. I don't want to lose data on this new one. The OS was 13, now it's Ubuntu 14.04.\nAlso, will I be able to hear sounds after installing Ubuntu physically without even installing sound card (Audio Decoder installed)?\n\nA: You should install Ubuntu on a separate partition so that you won't lose any data. The most important thing is you should create a separate partition for Ubuntu manually, and you should select it while installing Ubuntu.\nFirst create a separate partition for Ubuntu while running Windows (like a partition with more than 10 GB). Also create a small partition for the swap partition (size is equal to your RAM size).\n\n\n*\n\n*You should know the partition sizes you created so that you can identify them easily while installing Ubuntu.\n\n\nSee the below images - I picked them by googling so they won't be same as yours (like partition sizes and number of partitions).\nThe second important thing is while installing Ubuntu select \"Something else\".\n\nIt will allow you to select your manually created partition to install Ubuntu onto it.\nNow select and edit the partition you created for Ubuntu. Be careful in selecting. Check twice that you selected the correct partition, not some other partition as you may lose data like before.\n\nSelect the format partition, use as mount point as shown in the image. The size is up to you.\nAfter that, select the swap partition, and edit it as shown in the image (size is your choice).\n\nAfter that select the \"Device for boot loader installation\" at the bottom and select the one with /dev/sda at the beginning.\n\nNow you can select \"install now\" at the right bottom.\nIt seems lengthy, but it's really easy once you know this installation.\nI hope that helps.\n\nA: The official installation guide provides this information. Under the heading\nInstallation type\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\nMost motherboards have integrated sound.

You can have name1 -> IP1 and name2 -> IP1. At the web server level, any default configuration should let you display the same web pages using both name in the URL.\n\n*At DNS level, once again, you can point the MX records of your second domain to the same mail server. But this time, you have to do some configuration in your mail server to accept mail sent to this second domain as a valid internal domain (in /etc/postfix/main.cf :\n\n\n\nmydestination = myserve.com, myserve2.com, $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost\n\nDepending on how you define your users, you may have to do some more tweaking. But if you are using locally defined user (the mail users are defined as Linux users), user1 should receive mail sent to user1@myserve.com and user1@myserve2.com.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you configure a single Postfix instance to handle both domains, you can use the same IP. Of course if you split your Postfix installation between two hosts, you will need two IP.\n\n*See above, it will depend on how you have created the users. If you use the Virtual Users and Domains and/or if you have an LDAP backend, it will be different.\nI hardly suggest that if you encounter problem with the configuration of Postfix or the web server, you open new question with as many details about your config as possible.\n\nA: Thank you very much it is quite clear ,I am just going to try it and I will let you know, just one question: See above, it will depend on how you have created the users. If you use the Virtual Users and Domains and/or if you have an LDAP backend, it will be different.\nI didn't get the meaning of this sentence above, in my configuration I use virtuals users on the domain myserve.com\nI saw that on postfix you can create multiple domain and add users, the question is that do I have to import users that are on myserve.com on myserve1.com?\nif I just use the same IP (single instance of postfix) all users in both domains will receive the mails sent to their addresses without any routing? just modifying the /etc/postfix/main.cf ?\nThank you again\n", "Q: How to get the package versions corresponding to Unity 7 launcher applications?

Has it been replaced by another utility in 14.04?\nPlacing a kiosk.sh.desktop in ~/kiosk/.config/autostart works, but the gnome-desktop is shown before firefox starts in fullscreen mode making it possible for the users to interact with the desktop.\nWhat is to correct/best way to start firefox in fullscreen after user autologin?\nThanks\nThomas\n\nA: I'd personally side-step all the lightdm and Xsession stuff and just launch my own instance of X that just started Firefox. Sounds nightmarish but it's really  simple with a little Upstart script\nstart on (filesystem and stopped udevtrigger)\nstop on runlevel [06]\n\nconsole output\nemits starting-x\n\nrespawn\n\nexec sudo -u thomas startx /etc/X11/Xsession /path/to/kiosk.sh --\n\nObviously change the username to whatever user you want to run this as, but that's pretty much it. Save that as /etc/init/x.conf and then you should be able to sudo start x and you're away (it'll  load at boot). If Firefox crashes, it'll reload X with a new instance.\nIf you've got a full-blown Ubuntu install sitting there, you might have to disable LightDM first with:\nsudo stop lightdm\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/lightdm.override\n\nAnd your Firefox profile is completely up to you. You might even want to script in some profile-restoration so that if somebody does break your profile, you just need to restart your x service and it'll be using the clean copy again. Just an idea.\nI've since written a blog post on creating a Kiosk from scratch with 14.04 and Chrome.\n\nFor your wireless configuration problem, I'd suggest keeping as much of this away from casual users. You could set up a connection using a TTY fairly simply:\nsudo nmcli dev wifi con <SSID> password <password>\n\nThat should add the connection to the system and connect (and auto-connect in the future) but I haven't tested it. It might not even need the sudo but that all depends on what privileges your main user has.\nThe simple benefit over loading something else in the background here is that there's no chance some passer-by is going to have access to a graphical network settings dialogue. It does require the operator to be able to follow instructions. \nIf they can't handle that, you could fairly easily modify your kiosk.sh to look for existing connections and ask some zenity-questions that feed into the previous nmcli command:\nif [[ $(nmcli con | wc -l) == 1 ]]; then\n    SSID=$(zenity ...)\n    PASS=$(zenity ...)\n    nmcli dev wifi con $SSID password $PASS\nfi\n\nThat's just a rough idea. You'll need to work on that. There may be a better standalone graphical network-manager configuration application.\n", "Q: How can I install Chinese fonts on Kubuntu 14.04 I'd like to see Chinese characters, such as this one.\n\nA: You can download font files from this website for example.

Choose OpenGL in General category and change Texture Filter from Good/Best to Fast. Go back and choose Ubuntu Unity Plugin in Desktop category and change Dash Blur from Active Blur  to No Blur\n\nA: Here are some ways to optimize ubuntu for performance:\n1. Optimize disk access with noatime:\nEach file and folder on your linux system has a file-creation timestamp and a modification timestamp. Apart from that, linux tries to keep track of “access time” for each of these files. Now keeping track of the access time has its performance-cost, and if you want to remove this performance cost, you need to specify “noatime” attribute in the disk partition entries in your /etc/fstab file. Edit this file in your text-editor and add the noatime option for your disk partition:\nUUID=97102801-14e3-9752-7412-d9c57e30981w / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0,noatime 1\n\n2. Optimize Swappiness:\nSwappiness is the tendency of the linux kernel to prefer disk-swapping vis-a-vis physical memory. The default swappiness value of 60 was kept considering server installations. If you are a desktop user having a machine with good RAM, you would normally prefer disk-swapping to be minimal. You can safely reduce this value to 10. To do so edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf and add the following:\nvm.swappiness=10\n\n(Just change the entry if it already exists, don’t make a duplicate!)\n3. Install preload:\nIf you typically use the same programs regularly, preload will help you by loading into memory, the programs that you use most frequently and thus speed them up. To install:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\n4. Place your mission critical apps in /dev/shm:\nFew weeks back, I was having performance issues with running Eclipse on ubuntu. After tweaking and optimizing various JVM settings in vain, the thing that really made the difference was placing the entire JDK folder on ramdisk. The /dev/shm folder is like a virtual ramdisk (on ubuntu and derivatives) where you can place your temporal, high-priority stuff to run them in “best performance” mode. Assuming you have to place your JDK folder on the virtual ramdisk, the command is:\ncp -r jdk1.7.0_05/ /dev/shm/\n\n5. Remove unwanted programs from startup:\nUbuntu comes loaded with a ton of baggage, and if you are someone like me, you might feel obliged to reduce some burden off your system by disabling unwanted software from startup. You can do this by going to “Startup Applications” in the System menu, but ubuntu hides the pre-installed apps by default. To overcome this limitation, open your terminal and issue the below command:\nsudo sed -i 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\n\n\nNow you can go through the startup programs list and can disable the unwanted ones. Common sense will tell you that if you don’t use bluetooth on your machine, you can get rid of the \"Bluetooth Manager\". Similar is the case with “Backup Monitor” in case you don’t need to sync your backups in real-time. Here is the list of services that I’ve safely disabled without causing any issues:\nBackup Monitor\nBluetooth Manager\nChat\nDesktop sharing\nGwibber\nOcra screen reader\nPersonal file sharing\nScreen saver\nUbuntu one\nupdate notifier\n\n6. Uninstall software that you don’t use:\nThe next step is to remove those software that you don’t use at all. Again, some common sense but with some caution is needed here. There are some programs (like empathy) that form the core part of ubuntu, so it won’t allow you to apt-get remove.. them without removing unity itself. In such cases, we will disable such programs from starting up as services (next step). Some of the programs that you may safely remove are:\napt-get remove samba-common\napt-get remove cups\napt-get remove avahi-daemon avahi-autoipd\n\nI typically uninstall all three after a new installation. The first one is needed for file-sharing in the local network if you have one. Second is the print daemon, and third is used to broadcast common network services across the local network and finding local hosts by using friendly names like “local.workstation”.\n7. Disable unwanted daemons:\nIn case you don’t want to remove the cups program as you might need printing in future, you can disable it for the time being. To do so, issue the below command:\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/cups.override\n\nYou can disable any daemon in this manner by doing a manual override, just replace the “cups.override” with the daemon name that you want removed such as:\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/bluetooth.override\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/ufw.override\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/mysql.override\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/tty2.override\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/tty3.override\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/tty4.override\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/tty5.override\necho manual | sudo tee /etc/init/tty6.override\n\nLater, if you want to enable that daemon, all you to do is delete the .override file.\n8. Optimize Nautilus to behave in a speedy manner:\nThis is totally optional. Nautilus, by default, tries to show thumbnails of each and every file in a directory. If the directory contains a lot of files, this causes a noticeable delay. Now if you are in the habit of regularly previewing thumbnails of your images, don’t do this optimization. Otherwise, if previewing thumbnails don’t matter to you and all you are interested in is speed (like me), you can go to Edit->Preferences->Preview-tab and set the preview settings to Never.\n9. Disable translation downloads in aptitude:\nThis setting is for speeding up the downloads from apt repositories rather than your machine. By default, ubuntu adds additional translation repos when you issue “apt-get update” command to update your repository settings. If you only need English, you can disable translation downloads by editing /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00aptitude and adding this line to it:\nAcquire::Languages \"none\";\n\nSource: My blog post\n\nA: I believe what you are looking for is ubuntu's 2d mode, but it was removed in 12.10.  I found an article that mentions a way to disables some of the additional eye candy.\nI'm not sure if this is still available in 14.04, but you can try it by adding 'export UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE=1' to the '.xprofile' in your 'home' folder.  If you want you can just run the following in the terminal \n\necho \"export UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE=1\" >> ~/.xprofile\n\n\nA: Overall unity is hard to configure performance wise, though on those specs it should run reasonably well. If you have a chance to upgrade the ram, I recommend it highly, though it should run just fine on that for normal use (just don't expect to be doing video editing/custom rom compiles/basically any modern games)\n", "Q: arecord flac format I am playing with scripts that use the google speech-to-text api.

Verify you downloaded the image properly and it burned right and then check that the hard drive is connected and that smart data is good. Also, in my experience I've found it is always easier to just burn a dvd and use that as the installation medium, it's cheap and permanent.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 hangs after login I am using ubuntu 14.04 on Dell inspiron with intel graphics card.

The only way to connect internet is to set manually the DNS (8.8.8.8) in Network Manager.\nWhy?\nWith Ubuntu 12.04 I've never set DNS on DHCP and it worked fine...\nThank you.\n\nA: From the fact that your system connects at work via wired and wireless shows that your system works, and that the system at work is configured correctly. The failure of home wireless and \"tethering hotspot\" means that your home wireless router (and whatever you connect to with your phone) are not configured to share DNS information when you connect. You can fix this problem by accessing your home router configuration, and finding DHCP settings. You could use wireshark on Linux to monitor packets both as you connect at work, and fail to connect at home. \n\nA: Connect to the troubled network and post output from nm-tool it should give you DNS server assigned by DHCP. See if that's correct, try to ping the DNS server(s)\n", "Q: Problems with Desktop screen after login I am running Ubuntu 14.04-64bit. I have a HP Pavilion dv7 laptop with a nVidia GEForce GT 650M video card.  I am not using the nVidia drivers that are in \"synaptic\".  This morning when I booted up, after I logged in, the desktop screen came up, but there was no \"task bar\" (I think that is what you call the bar at the top of the screen) & any program that was launched via the \"Startup Applications\" has no bar with the \"exit,minimize, whole scree\" buttons on it.  I am able to kill any program using a terminal.  The graphics is as it should be, no distortion.  Now I rebooted, and this time, after the login screen, I just get a \"black\" screen.  I was unable to get anything to respond, so I had to hit the power button in order to exit and try another reboot.  Eventually, it all worked as it was suppose to, and I am now able to open any program and send this question to ya'll.  I am not sure where to begin to figure out what has happened, and I have not tried another reboot to see if the problem is still there or gone.  If I need to give you more info, please let me know what (an maybe how to get it) and I will respond ASAP.  Thanks for your time looking at this, and I welcome any help you may be able to give.\n\nA: Well, a little advice, a little help:\nUnresponsive system - here's a set of what you can try before resorting to the power button.  One of the 'hidden' gems in here is holding the PrntScr and slowly typing \"reisub\"\nI have a dv7 also, and the heat generated by the machine is terrible.  I've had to reflow the graphics chip down onto the motherboard twice, and when 14.04 came out, Ubunti could not recognize the graphics chip.  I never did get the proprietary drivers to work with that machine.\nFor me on my Pavilion, the graphics solution is a launchapd PPA by Oibaf - these are open source drivers, a bit more advanced(?) than those packaged by canonical, and perhaps less stable, but they work in my HP.\n", "Q: Run the script file after 5 or 10 min after restarting the system I have created a ruby script file that checks the connection present or not.

I presume simply downloading Ubuntu and burning an ISO disk will take care of the former. \nHowever, GIMP directs me to https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/saucy/gimp/, and the emailed download link from there takes me back to https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/saucy/gimp/: I cannot find anything on that page that would permit me to download GIMP for Ubuntu.  \nWalton\n\nA: In a terminal, enter\napt-get download gimp\nThis will download the gimp package in your current directory\nIt may be difficult since you are limiting yourself to Windows 7 as a download media for your Ubuntu machine.  You could explore gimp.org, but I suspect that you will have problems which exceed the ability to easily allow you to run Ubuntu - during the install process Ubuntu would like to be able to connect to the internet to download updates to the core of the operating system, and to all of the peripheral programs.\nOne way to do this would be to create a virtual machine in your windows 7 computer, load and install the required elements, and then create an installation USB based upon your virtual machine.  I have not run through the process of creating a boot image myself, but it is documented on Ubuntu.com\n\nA: What I generally do for such situations is maintain an offline repository. If you have an existing ubuntu installation, install aptoncd first:\nsudo apt-get install aptoncd\nRun this app to create a compressed ISO image from your apt cache. Thus you now have an offline \"backup\" repo from which you can install any software that you want, not just repo. To use this backup repo, just extract this ISO to any folder you like and add this line in your /etc/apt/sources.list:\ndeb file:///path/to/iso/extract ./\nThis will create a working repo from which you may do any offline install.\nBut do remember that with this method, you are tied to a particular version of the distro. If you created the backup from precise, the backup repo will only work from precise.\n", "Q: Unable to print to Brother printer by wifi I have 2 computers running Kubuntu 14.04 64 bit and this Brother printer: MFC-J6910DW\nThe printer has wifi capabilities.

Any ideas on how I would use the headphones' built-in mic?\n\nA: It sounds like your headphones have a single jack that includes both the headphone and mic connections. This is called a \"4-position\" or \"4-pin\" connector. As you have discovered, unless your computer has a plug designed to use one of those connectors, only one or the other will work.\nThe 4-pin jacks are more common on smaller devices that benefit more from combining the two audio jacks into one. To find out if your computer has one of these 4-pin jacks, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look at the marking on the jack to see if it has both headphone and mic icons, or an icon of a headset that shows both.\n\n*Look up your computer/motherboard module, or info from sudo lshw -c sound, to see if the specs or discussions mention anything about this hardware having a 4-pin jack\n\n\nIf your computer doesn't have a 4-pin jack, a workaround would be an adapter that will plug into your headset, and then provide separate headphone and mic plugs for your computer. This will be something like a 3.5mm combo jack splitter, headset to PC.\n", "Q: What is causing my my screen to go black?

Then I kept sitting there for a few minutes and after maybe 5 or 10 minutes. The screen went black again! What is going on here...? Is there some sort of corruption I can resolve? Why would the screen go black again after it has already been initialized with xrandr?\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention... when I reboot, it shows the BIOS on the monitor. It's only after Ubuntu starts up that it goes black. This is what makes me thing it is a software or configuration problem.\n\nA: Hmm... This is not looks like a software problem. First (if u are able ofcourse) plug an external monitor and boot ur netbook to see if u got signal. This way we can exclude the possibility of a damaged gpu. If u boot normal with signal in the external monitor then it means that 1) Your inverter is burned (or is about to burn and stops to work when it get warm) and or 2) Is the backlight of ur screen that means u need a new screen but the 2nd is a lil bit rare damage. Many times screen is nearly black and hardly u can see signal under some light, so boot and watch the screen carefully. Also when you boot w8 some mins and see if the hard disk read and if u can listen the ubuntu's entrance sound. To be sure that is only a screen or inverter problem and not something worst.

Example:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options stretched\n\nBut, although I can find and edit the installed extensions under org.gnome.shell.extensions using dconf-editor I can't access them using gsettings since they don't seem to have an assigned schema:\nNo such schema 'org.gnome.shell.extensions.extname'\n\nThe only extensions accessible with gsettings seem to be the ones that came pre-installed.\nSo, the question is, how can I configure the installed extensions from the command line? Is there any way to assign to gsettings the compiled schemas in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ ? Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction.\nEnvironment: Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 (Gnome Shell 3.10.4)\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: In CentOS 7 - and I would think in Ubuntu also -  I've identified what I think is a slight improvement on the accepted answer by introducing the --schemadir switch as follows:\n# gsettings --schemadir ${schemaDir} set ${schema} ${key} \"${value}\"\n\nIn the above command gsettings directly sets ${key} to ${value} in ${schema} where ${schema} does not reside in the default /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas directory. (and there is no requirement to move the schema to the default directory)\nSome examples:\ngsettings --schemadir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/putWindow@clemens.lab21.org/schemas/ list-recursively org.gnome.shell.extensions.org-lab21-putwindow\ngsettings --schemadir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/unitylike-hotkey@webgyerek.net/schemas/  list-recursively org.gnome.shell.extensions.app-keys\ngsettings --schemadir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/emoji-selector@maestroschan.fr/schemas/  list-recursively org.gnome.shell.extensions.emoji-selector\n\n\nA: Found the answer by myself in the end.\nsudo cp ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/extname/schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.extname.gschema.xml \\\n    /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/ &&\nsudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/\n\nCopy and compile the schemas in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions and gsettings will be able to work with them.\n\nA: I've written this script: Bash script to enable/disable gnome-shell-extensions and more.\nJust cp it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin and make it executable:\nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/gnome-shell-extension-cl\n\nCheck the help. \nEnable extension:\ngnome-shell-extension-cl -e extension-name\n\nDisable extension: \ngnome-shell-extension-cl -d extension-name\n\n", "Q: how much space does a given package, and dependencies, cost? given a package name, I want  to find how much space would be freed up if the package, and its dependencies, were deleted.\nAs dependencies might be shared between packages, maybe the right way to put it is: How much space does a package take, including all dependencies that are only beeing used by this package\nI would prefer CLI solutions, because I would use them in scripts\n\nA: *\n\n*Simply try following command ( to get disk space freed by purge):\necho -n | sudo apt-get purge <package> | grep \"disk space will be freed\"\n\nor\necho -n | sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove <package> | grep \"disk space will be freed\"\n\nwhere replace <package> with your package-name ( example: gimp)\nThis will not purge package with dependencies but only gives how much disk space will be freed with help of grep!\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Using dpkg --print-avail or apt-cache show:\napt-cache show <package> | grep \"Installed-Size\"\n\nor\ndpkg --print-avail <package> | grep \"Installed-Size\"\n\nThis will display installed size of <package>.\nExample:\n$ apt-cache show gimp | grep \"Installed-Size\"\nInstalled-Size: 15024\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Sort list of installed packages by size\ndpkg-query -W -f='${Installed-Size;8}  ${Package}\\n' | sort -n\n\nYou can use more for page-wise:\ndpkg-query -W -f='${Installed-Size;8}  ${Package}\\n' | sort -n | more\n\nAbove list packages according to size acceding, you can use tail to list packages consuming top size as follows:\ndpkg-query -W -f='${Installed-Size;8}  ${Package}\\n' | sort -n | tail\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Using dpigs (from man dpigs):\n\ndpigs - Show which installed packages occupy the most space\n\n dpigs sorts the installed packages by size and outputs the largest ones.

There was a lot of discussion about the init system for 14.04 before it was released, but I cannot find any site that explains the outcome finally.\nSo is Ubuntu 14.04 using systemd now?\n\nA: If you are running Ubuntu vivid (15.04) upstart is still default, but, you can easily switch between upstart and systemd at will, since both packages are installed at present:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers\nIn ubuntu 15.10 systemd is the default, but you still can choose upstart each boottime in the grub menu\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 uses Upstart as the init system, the plan to switch to systemd is planned for 14.10+. There are parts of \"systemd\" that have been used in Ubuntu for a long time, but for most intents and purposes when people say \"systemd\" they mean systemd-as-init. \nHere's some background info:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-1403/meeting/22156/core-1403-systemd-transition/\n\n*http://summit.ubuntu.com/uos-1406/meeting/22277/ubuntu-server-plans-around-systemd/\n\nA: To show what init process is enabled:\n# readlink /sbin/init\n\nBy default on 14.04 and 14.10 it's \"upstart\"\nChanging this would involve alot more configuration than just changing this symlink so don't do that. This file is nearly always a simlink. In this case the link path does not start with / so this is a path relative to the symlink file to /sbin/upstart. \nTo confuse matters systemd is installed for other things but not used as init. It is in /bin not /sbin. But systemd has installed itself as init in man / help, so:\n# man init\n\nBrings up docs on systemd (as of Dec 22, 2014) This is very confusing ! You want:\n# man upstart \n\nThis will give you the docs for init as they should be. \nGood luck getting started.

To check whether it does, open a console and type\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 mode master\n\nReplace wlan0 with whatever Ubuntu calls your wireless device.\nIf you get an error, your device does not support master mode and this solution unfortunately does not work.

It is very straight forward, works with WPA and Access Point Mode (so it works on smartphones), and do not need complex set up. Once it's set up, you can just use the graphical interface to toogle the access point. \nOne line solution, without additional program\nJust run\nnmcli device wifi hotspot con-name my-hotspot ssid my-hotspot band bg password jesuisunmotdepasse\n\nand it should create the access point and connect to it. If it does not work, you should try the 3 line solution here :\nThree lines solution, without additional program\nJust run the following lines to create and enable the access point :\n# Create a connection\nnmcli connection add type wifi ifname '*' con-name my-hotspot autoconnect no ssid my-local-hotspot\n# Put it in Access Point\nnmcli connection modify my-hotspot 802-11-wireless.mode ap 802-11-wireless.band bg ipv4.method shared\n# Set a WPA password (you should change it)\nnmcli connection modify my-hotspot 802-11-wireless-security.key-mgmt wpa-psk 802-11-wireless-security.psk myhardpassword\n# Enable it (run this command each time you want to enable the access point)\nnmcli connection up my-hotspot\n\nNow connect on your Smartphone... When you do not need it anymore, disable it with :\nnmcli connection down my-hotspot\n\nTo enable it again, you will just need to use the last command of the 4 lines command. You can note that since the connection also appears in the available connections, you can enable/disable it from graphical interface.\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04+ LTS\nthe easiest way that I've seen is to simply use the built in Hotspot feature in Ubuntu. You just need to make sure that you are connected via ethernet to the internet since turning it on will disconnect to from the wi-fi. \n( It might be different if you have an extra dongle attached to your laptop or computer allowing 2 connections at the same time ) \n1. Open settings an click on network\n\n2. Click on Wirelss and make sure that you have it enabled!\n\n Click on \"Use as Hotspot...\"  remember to make sure you are connected to the internet via ethernet.\n3. \"Click Turn On\"\n\n This is what pops up for me since I am still connecting to the wifi, but it still works regardless.  Once you do that, you'll be greeted by the connection Name, and the autogenerated password key. Simply join that connection and type in the key and you're good to go! \n\nA: To make your ubuntu machine act as a wifi hot-spot for any device, install and configure the hostapd package. It is designed for this very purpose. I'm sharing my mobile broadband connection (Tata Photon) with my android phone using this very method on ubuntu 12.04!\nHere are the per-requisites you will need to use hostapd in this manner:\nPre-requsites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability of your wireless card to support infrastructure mode. To find out:\ni. Find your kernel driver module in use by issuing the below command:\nlspci -k | grep -A 3 -i “network”\n(In my case, the driver in use was ath9k)\nii. Now, use the below command to find out your wifi capabilities (replace ath9k by your kernel driver):\nmodinfo ath9k | grep ‘depend’\n(iii) If the above output includes “mac80211” then it means your wifi card will support the AP mode.\n\n*Hostapd software: Hostapd is the standard linux daemon that will be used to create your access-point.\n\n*Dhcp software: Even after hostapd creates the AP and your device detects it, you will still need a  dhcp server to assign a dynamic ip-address to your AP client. (unless you are assigning static address to each device)\nRefer my article for further details on how to set up and configure the hostapd package.\nUpdate on 08-Jul-2014\nTo solve this problem, I've written Hotspotd, a small linux daemon to create a wifi hotspot on top of hostapd. It uses dnsmasq for IP-address provisioning to and iptables to generate the routing table.\nTo install:\nwget https://github.com/prahladyeri/hotspotd/raw/master/dist/hotspotd-0.1.tar.gz\ntar xvf hotspotd-0.1.tar.gz\ncd hotspotd-0.1/\nsudo python setup.py install\n\nWorkaround for 14.04 broken hostapd bug is included.\n\nA: You can create hotspot with single command using create_ap.\nsudo create_ap wlo1 wlo1 'My superfast hotspot' superSecretpassword\n\nTo install it\n# install hostapd using apt\nsudo apt install hostapd\n\n# install create_ap from source\ngit clone https://github.com/oblique/create_ap\ncd create_ap\nsudo make install\n\nYou can checkout readme page on the project for more examples on how to use it.\n\nA: This worked for me. It sets up the hotspot connection using the Kde network-manager connection editor. I'm on Ubuntu 14.04(.2) 64 bit. Follow the link or follow me:\nFirst install it from the link above. (I think the package is plasma-nm, if I'm right run this to install: sudo apt-get install plasma-nm).\nPress Alt+F2 and type kde-nm-connection-editor to run it.\nIn the window that comes out click Add button and choose “Wireless (shared)” from the drop-down list.\nType in a name, ssid, and select Access Point mode. If you want, set up a password under Wireless Security tab. Finally, click OK.\nClick Network Manager applet on Unity panel and then choose “Connect to Hidden Wi-Fi network”, choose the connection you created.

Tesseract now creates an .hocr file rather than an .html file for ocr output, but this is not exactly what is at issue here.

Most of the text doesn't even appear in the resulting pdf, and what small amount of text does appear is unreadable and unselectable.\nI'm using a script that goes through each .tif file in the directory and does the ocr on each one.

I already know what to choose in terms of hardware, and my initial idea is installing Ubuntu as the native OS and Qemu (or KVM). But I also would like to play emulated games on that computer - nothing extremely demanding, mainly titles from the early 2000s.\nI know there are a dozen of good game emulators for Linux, which I can install directly on top of the native Ubuntu, but Windows still seems to be better served with those. Hence my question: if I emulate, say, Windows 7 on Qemu/KVM and then install a game emulator for Windows (like MAME) on that (emulated!) Windows 7, how much frustration may I get from that experience in a scale of 0% to 100%? Why? [Share your experiences]\nAlso, would you have any suggestions for the native Linux OS + emulation platform combo?\nPS: dual-booting two native OSes is not an option\n\nA: Virtual machines are a good way to run another OS side-by-side on an Ubuntu desktop to share data but they all come at a high cost of performance drop on graphics demanding applications such as games are.\nHow good any game will perform in a virtual machine depends much on your host hardware, VM settings, the game's and your own demands of course. A scale from 0 to 100 is highly subjective, as you may be happy with the performance while others (eventually on other hardware) are not. It is something you have to try out for yourself, but be prepared for much frustration from slow graphics.\nIf dual-boot is not an option then I'd recommend to install the OS as host where you spend most of your time in, or where your hardware or performance demands are better supported.\nThe arcade emulator MAME is natively supported from Ubuntu but for release 14.04 you may have to install it from an unofficial ppa. This alone should therefore not be a reason to run Windows in a VM.\nMany Windows games will also run with Wine. It is very likely that games not supported by Wine are the same that will also not perform well in a virtual machine.\n\nA: If you have 2 graphic cards, you can pass one of them through KVM and have a virtual machine control it directly http://www.overclock.net/t/1205216/guide-create-a-gaming-virtual-machine/600\n", "Q: Subfolder share permission on create over vbox (ubuntu host and ubuntu guest) first time using ask ubuntu but kind of experienced user over here.\nI have an Ubuntu 14.04 guest and Kubuntu 14.04 host using VirtualBox for some important testing, and am trying to use a shared folder from my host to my guest.

I use VirtualBox for Ubuntu on my Windows 7 computer. I set up SSH and got in through Putty just fine. However I wanted to know how to see who was connected. So I Googled a bit and found \"who\" and tried it.\nmyname@ubuntuComputer:~$ who\nmyname :0           2014-07-02 17:55 (:0)\nmyname pts/0        2014-07-02 17:58 (:0)\nmyname pts/4        2014-07-02 19:49 (nameOfHomeComputer.home)\n\nCan anyone explain to me what these figures all mean? Why are there three? What are the 0's and pts/0 pts/4 thing?\n\nA: The who command, as you've already figured out, outputs user information. If I type in who in my Terminal right now I get the following:\nviktor   :0           2014-07-02 15:41 (:0)\nviktor   pts/0        2014-07-03 02:07 (:0)\n\nNow, in both these cases I'm logged in as viktor. The first one is my default desktop, Ubuntu itself, the current logged in user in the system. I started my computer 15.41 yesterday. The second row belong to the Terminal I launched to execute the who command. The terminal will login as your user once more since the Terminal really is a desktop environment, or shell, as well (Bash).\nAs for the 0's and the second column I'd like to refer to another question where the answer is very well explaining.\nAs for your own example the following is your result:\nYou have one user logged in as the system started that is running all the time, your first row. The second is the terminal you used to execute the command, I guess?

Should I be deleting any of these?\n\nA: There's three entries there because you need one entry for each user@host combination.\nExamine host for each of the root user entries.  The host column defines where that user can connect from and have the connection accepted.  In this case, for the root user, the host entries are localhost, 127.0.0.1, and ::1.  The last two are IPv4 and IPv6 entries for the local machine loopback interface (lo in ifconfig) respectively.  The localhost entry is the hostname representation of both of those IP entries.\nIt's fine to leave all three there.  It just makes sure that you can still access the root user from the local system in the event that your /etc/hosts file goes weird and localhost no longer resolves to your own box.\nThe only thing you really need to be concerned about is if a root user on MySQL has an entry for any host entry OTHER than localhost, 127.0.0.1, and ::1.  That could indicate a security risk.\nAnd the debian-sys-maint account is used for log rotating and things, and just like the root account can only be used via localhost in a default setup, so you don't need to really worry about that one either.\n", "Q: Eigen installation seemed to work, but I still can't make eigen work I am trying to install eigen, but I don't seem to get it to work.\nI did:\nsudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev\n\nand everything seems fine, after\ndpkg -p libeigen3-dev\n\nI get:\nPackage: libeigen3-dev\nPriority: extra\nSection: libdevel\nInstalled-Size: 3718\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Developers <ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com>\nArchitecture: all\nSource: eigen3\nVersion: 3.2.0-4\nDepends: pkg-config\nSuggests: libeigen3-doc\nSize: 698062\nDescription: lightweight C++ template library for linear algebra\n Eigen 3 is a lightweight C++ template library for vector and matrix math,\n a.k.a. linear algebra.\n .\n Unlike most other linear algebra libraries, Eigen 3 focuses on the simple\n mathematical needs of applications: games and other OpenGL apps, spreadsheets\n and other office apps, etc. Eigen 3 is dedicated to providing optimal speed\n with GCC.

But very often the dev includes are named with a version.\nIf you have a \"Eigen3\" folder in your /usr/include directory, you should change your code to:\n#include <Eigen3/Dense>\n\n", "Q: No indicators showing up on 14.04 I can't seem to get any indicators on my new installation of Ubuntu, I'm on a laptop so seeing the battery is pretty important, along with it just being a nuisance.\nI've tried installing the indicator applet and using dconf, but they're still not showing up.\nIn case this matters, I had quite a few problems installing this distro, one being the 'low graphics' error, so I had to switch from lightdm then use proprietary drivers after that.

I've done it countless times before.\nThough this time, when the live usb booted up I got a \"playlist update failed\" error.\nSo I closed everything and did some research. After all that, I booted the usb, pressed any key at the \"Keyboard and Man\" page and I accessed the boot options. I then activated the \"nomodereset\" option and selected the \"Install Ubuntu\"option. Then everything went smoothly. Everything installed well and all that. Yay.\nThe installation completed and I ended up in the login screen, I entered my password and waited a minute or so from the delay and everything loaded quite fine. So far so good.\nThen I started doing the usual stuff.

It can't be intel cause I never had problem with it so it must be Nvidia (also it seems to be very notorious among ubuntu users)\nMost of the forums/questions/answers/tutorials I've seen pinpoint the drivers being used as the problem since Ubuntu forces me to use the open source Nouveau drivers which basically doesn't work well for Nvidia.

What?  I just did that on the command line.  How can there be stuff that need updating?\n\nA: Two possible reasons that could both apply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your upgrade-update are in the wrong order for starters. You need to update first because it's this that updates your local available-packages list which upgrade reads.\n\n*upgrade won't install upgrades if that involves adding or removing packages (which many of the kernel updates involve). You need dist-upgrade. \"Mark all upgrades\" in Synaptic is equivalent to dist-upgrade.\nSo if you ran:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nYou should find that Synaptic doesn't have anything to do.\n\nA: You took the steps in the wrong order (or mistyped them).\nThe correct procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get update so the database fetches the last available information and versions\n\n*apt-get upgrade now you are downloading and installing packages\n\n*apt-get check if you want, I often feel comfortable just with steps 1 and 2\n\n\nWhat seems to be happening is that you upgrade your system with old information, so maybe nothing gets really upgraded, then you update your database and when you ask Synaptic, it just tells it found new packages (due to the apt-get update you just ran).\nPS: Keep in mind to use sudo if you are not root.\n\nA: Because you run first sudo apt-get upgrade that will update all outdated packages on your computer, then next you run sudo apt-get update which downloads the latest repository list. So there were already new packages in the list, packages detected by synaptic when you run it.\nYou should update first your repository before you upgrade so that apt will know the up-to-date packages from the net.

Is it possible to reorder the default items in the Nautilus context menu?\ne.g. when I right-click on an archive, the top item is \"Open with Archive Manager\" but way down the bottom is \"Extract Here\".\nI would like to move the \"Extract Here\" item next to the \"Open with Archive Manager\" item as they are both actions that deal with the archive itself.\n\nA: It is unfortunately not possible to do this, because of the changes to Nautilus and the removal of /usr/share/nautilus/ui/nautilus-directory-view-ui.xml. It has been asked  (June 2012) in the gnome nautilus mailing lists, and it is clear from the developers' responses that one would now have to download the source code, patch it, and then recompile it to re-order menus.\nSource: Is it possible to hide the \"Copy To\" and \"Move To\" context menus?\n", "Q: Terminal commands to hard shutdown and hard restart I want to do hard restart and hard shutdown(immediate shutdown and restart) through terminal.\nIs this possible through terminal commands?\nAnd note that no answers in this How do I shut down or reboot from a terminal? question does immediate shutdown or restart. So it's not a dupe.\n\nA: It would be safer to do a Alt+SysRq+(R,E,I,S,U,B or O) than force a hard reboot.\n\n\n*\n\n*R Switch the keyboard from raw mode to XLATE mode\n\n*E SIGTERM everything except init \n\n*I SIGKILL everything except init \n\n*S Syncs the mounted filesystems\n\n*U Remounts the mounted filesystems in read-only mode\n\n*B Reboot the system, or O Turn off the system\n\n\nYou could just Alt+SysRq+B/O to reboot/halt if you really wanted to but you put your filesystems at risk by doing so. Doing all of the above is relatively safe and should work even when the rest of the system has broken down.\nThis is essentially the same method you're talking about in your commands but I'm not sure you could script the E and I (as they'll nuke your terminal access). But you could definitely handle the disk access and reboot or shutdown.\nfor i in s u b; do echo $i | sudo tee /proc/sysrq-trigger; sleep 5; done  # reboot\nfor i in s u o; do echo $i | sudo tee /proc/sysrq-trigger; sleep 5; done  # halt\n\nYou could still lose data from running applications but it shoudn't knacker your filesystem.

Bit of a mouthful:\nsed -Ei ':a;N;$!ba;s/^(#ServerRoot[^\\n]*)\\n\\n/\\1\\nServerName localhost\\n\\n/' apache2.conf\n\nAnd an awk that does the same (longer but easier to understand IMO). The logic and sponge are explained in the last section.\nawk '{print}/^#ServerRoot/{getline; if($0==\"\") print \"ServerName localhost\"; print}' apache2.conf | sponge apache2.conf\n\n\nEdit: The sed isn't as hard as I originally thought it was. You just want to match and append (the a command); you don't need to replace. I've tested the following as working:\nsed -i '/^#ServerRoot/a ServerName localhost' apache2.conf\n\nYou can be more specific with your match if you wish and I'll leave the awk below for posterity's sake.\n\nThe editing is fairly trivial with awk but in order to write back into the same file we either need a temporary intermediary file or sponge (from the moreutils package). I'll show both methods.\nawk '{print}/^#ServerRoot/{print \"ServerName localhost\"}' apache2.conf > tmp\nmv tmp apache2.conf\n\nOr\nawk '{print}/^#ServerRoot/{print \"ServerName localhost\"}' apache2.conf | sponge apache2.conf\n\nThe awk is just printing every line it finds but in the case of a match for ^#ServerName is then writes your ServerName line. I find this sort of processing a lot easier to read than arbitrary \"swapping\" with sed.\n\nA: Another way (thanks muru) but a little out of context because not using sed :\nFor Ubuntu 14.04:\nCreate a file  fqdn.conf dans /etc/apache2/conf-available/ containing\nServerName localhost\n\nCreate a symbolic link in /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/\nsudo ln -s /etc/apache2/conf-available/fqdn.conf /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/fqdn.conf\n\n", "Q: Theme gnome panel handles in flashback session I'm using the the gnome flashback session (metacity) in Ubuntu 14.04.\nThe default theme is the ambient theme.

Both those approaches are covered here — just ignore the password setting bit.\nBy this point you should be logged in as root.\nAnyway fixing this isn't too hard because most of the files are straight 755 and there are only a handful of exceptions. So we'll start by setting everything in there to 755 and correct the exceptions.

This is covered at debian-administration.org and in AskUbuntu\n\nA: I ran into this bug this morning. Could not fix the problem after it uninstalled knotes, rekonq and other programs. Then I noticed the same crazy update was suggested on another Kubuntu 14.04 system (with the KDE 4.13.2 update). Did not install it this time ! I just updated the sources, and it looks like it is fixed now (have not tried it yet). See a discussion at https://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?65831-what-s-up-with-today-s-upgrade .\n\nA: With the huge number of packages in this update, all the packages simply have not quite made it out to all the servers out there yet. Give it a little time, update the package lists (sudo apt-get update) again and see if it works properly once all the full set is available on your server.\n", "Q: Epson XP-212 does not print I've been trying to get an Epson Expression Home XP-212 printer/scanner working on Ubuntu 12.04.

That means that the first match for temp1 is the one you care about and since grep -m 1 will print only the first match, that's what you will get. \nPersonally, since you're using awk already, I'd do the whole thing in awk:\nsensors | awk '/temp1/{k=int($2)}END{print k}\n\nThe idea here is that each time a line matches temp1, k is set to int($2). However, k is only printed in the END{} block which is executed after the rest of the file has been processed so only the last value found will be printed.\n\nA: The easiest answer is to install mrtgutils-sensors, which includes the mrtg-sensors package that automatically parses the output of sensors. \nmrtg-sensors radeon-pci-0100 temp1 \n\nwill give you the correct answer.\n", "Q: \"General Error.

I am new to Ubuntu and Linux.\nI have Windows 7 on my PC. I plan on doing a dual boot with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. According to what I have read so far, by simply following the instructions on the Ubuntu prompts, the system will do the dual boot for me if I click the \"install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" option. Is this true? Does this option properly partition my hard drive to where Windows 7 AND Ubuntu will run properly? \nAlso, should I place the flash drive with Ubuntu installed on it in my PC BEFORE I shut my computer off and then reboot, or shut the computer off and THEN place the flash drive in the system? \nThanks for your time and answers.

I tried everything, but I can't get the internal speakers to work, the headphone outputs are working perfectly. Everything shows up nicely, but also changig the profile as well as trying every output didn't help. As far as I can tell, the model of my sound chip is the ALC3661 (that's what it's called on Dell's drivers page). I use kubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nPlease help me.\n\nA: I have made some headway with this, but it's not perfect. I've made a lot of progress with this. It's a lot closer to perfect now, so I've decided to largely rewrite this post/answer. The chipset is not fully supported. As you've no doubt noticed, the stock drivers and many other tools misidentify this as the ALC668 chipset. lshw -c sound shows \"8 Series/C220 Series Chipset\". Not very helpful :(\nAnyway, you'll need the alsa-tools package, specifically the HDA Jack Retasking tool, and the official drivers from Realtek. The HDA retasking tool requires gksudo, so you will want to create a \"shim\" that runs kdesudo; I ran (as root) update-alternatives /usr/bin/gksudo gui-sudo /usr/bin/kdesudo. You may just opt to create the symlink directly.\n\n\n*\n\n*After compiling and installing the realtek drivers, reboot, login, and run \"killall pulseaudio\" (doesn't have to be root - pulseaudio runs as a user daemon) and run the HDA jack retasking tool.\n\n*Select \"Show unconnected pins\" and \"Advanced override\".\n\n*Override all speakers and headphones (the mics can be left alone - I haven't done much testing with them) and set them to \"Not connected\". Click \"Apply Now\".\n\n*In a terminal run pulseaudio --start --daemonize=0 --log-target=stderr; you should get an error (because you have no output).\n\n\nWhat follows may involve a lot of playing around with it if you don't have the exact same setup I do. I'll outline the process I went through, then my specific pin configuration.\nFirst we'll map out what jacks are actually available for speakers. Some labeled \"not connected\" are available, some aren't.\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll see that by default certain channel groups are already assigned. Pick an unassigned channel group (or the one already assigned to some speaker jacks); I'll assume \"1\".\n\n*Override the Internal Speaker, set it to \"internal\" connectivity, channel group \"1\", and \"Front\" for the \"channel (in group)\".\n\n*Override the headphone slots, set the connectivity to \"not connected\" (we'll come back to those).\n\n*Override all remaining output slots (speakers, headphones, whatever) and set to \"not connected\". You should have only one output slot, labeled \"speaker\", connected via \"internal\", to channel group \"1\", on the \"front\" channel-in-group.\n\n*Click \"Apply now\". You might have to re-run the pulseaudio command, but your multimedia system settings might take care of that for you.\n\n*You will have to run the audio settings every time though. Open System Settings -> Multimedia -> Audio and Video settings -> Audio hardware setup -> Sound Card: Built in audio. You should only have \"stereo\" available, but both speakers should work (and sound should come out the correct speaker).\n\n*\n\n*If they don't, go back to the retasking tool and use a different slot for your \"1\"-\"front\" speakers, making sure all other outputs are \"not connected\".\n\n\n*After testing the speakers, go back to the retasking tool and set one of the other slots labeled \"speaker\" or \"not connected\" to:\n\n*\n\n*Connectivity: Internal\n\n*Location: Internal*\n\n*Device: Speaker\n\n*Jack: ATAPI*\n\n*Color: Unknown*\n\n*Jack Detection: Not Present\n\n*Channel group: 1\n\n*Channel (in group): Back\n\n\n*Rerun the multimedia settings and check that you have 4.0 surround sound available. Whether the speakers actually work is irrelevant, we just want to make sure that the pins can be detected when assigned. Make a note of whether the slot works or not. Reset the connectivity to \"not connected\" and make sure you have only stereo available again. Then test the next slot.\n\n\nOne of the things that makes it so tedious is that some of the pins seem to be actually disconnected. Some of the settings in the HDA jack retasking tool (which I've marked with an asterisk) seem to be purely informational. I'm not entirely sure what effect the \"channel (in group)\" has, because (by the audio settings tool) it's impossible to have a \"center\" speaker without front and back stereo speakers. And if you have too many pins assigned to the same channel, the driver freaks out and gives up until you reassign some pins. Sometimes it freaks out permanently and you have to reboot. Also, sometimes the jack retasking tool cannot read some of the options after reboot, so be sure to take notes on what you set if it almost works good.\nAnyway, now that you have the pins mapped out, we get to assigning them. One by one, set and test them, assigning them to all the same as above except the \"channel (in group)\" should be (progressively) \"back\", \"center/lfe\", \"side\", and maybe \"channel X & Y\" if you have more connectable pins. Each time you add one, go back to the multimedia panel and test your speakers in all available configurations.\nOnce you have all the pins connected, you might try playing around with which ones are assigned to which \"channel (in group)\", or disconnecting some. Due to the way the internal data streams are laid out, you might end up with 7.1 surround sound, where all the speaker buttons make sound except the \"back\" ones, even though the 5.1 configuration sounds the best. You might also (like me) end up with an extra set of bogus pins connected to \"channel 8 & 9\" (or whatever) - if I disconnect them, I lose some of my working speakers; if I mark them as \"back\", they shift around in weird ways (the \"front\" buttons don't work, the \"center\" button sounds out the left speaker, the \"subwoofer\" button sounds out the right... this might have been me messing up the tedium and getting sloppy with my notes...).\nWhen you have all the speakers working satisfactorily, click \"Install boot override\" in the HDA retasking tool and (after making sure you have all your notes) reboot. Test your speakers.\nFinally you can add back your headphones - set the connectivity to \"jack\" and the channel to the same as your speakers (\"1\"). Be sure to set \"jack detection\" to \"present\", and the \"device\" to \"headphones\". This should make it so that when you plug in the headphones, the speakers cut off. It's probably best to just leave the speakers on the \"front\" channel-in-group. One odd thing, I did notice the sound was a bit higher pitched until I assigned some headphone pins, I don't know why.\nAlso, refer back to your notes. You'll want to re-set any speaker jacks that got \"lost\" after reboot.\nMy pin configuration is as follows. I kept my notes in LibreOffice Calc. I also don't use one of my headphone jacks, but I filled in all the info just in case I want to change my mind.\nGood Luck!\n\nPin   - \"Name / Label\", (details on next lines)\n\n0x12  - \"Internal Mic, ATAPI\", (not overriden)\n0x19  - \"Black Mic, Left Side\", (not overridden)\n0x1b  - \"Not Connected\", (not overridden)\n0x1d  - \"Not Connected\", (not overridden)\n0x1f  - \"Not Connected\", (not overridden)\n\n0x14  - \"Internal Speaker\", Connectivity \"internal\"\n        Device \"speaker\", Channel [in group] \"1 [front]\"\n        Location \"internal\", Jack \"atapi\", Color \"unknown\", Jack Det. \"not present\"\n\n0x15  - \"Black Headphone, Left Side\", Connectivity \"not connected\",\n        Device \"headphone\", Channel [in group] \"1 [front]\"\n        Location \"left\", Jack \"combination\", Color \"black\", Jack Det. \"present\"\n\n0x16  - \"Black Headphone, Left Side\", Connectivity \"jack\",\n        Device \"headphone\", Channel [in group] \"1 [front]\"\n        Location \"left\", Jack \"3.5 mm\", Color \"black\", Jack Det. \"present\"\n\n0x18  - \"Not Connected\", Connectivity \"internal\",\n        Device \"speaker\", Channel [in group] \"1 [8 & 9]\"\n        Location \"internal\", Jack \"atapi\", Color \"unknown\", Jack Det. \"not present\"\n\n0x1a  - \"Not connected\", Connectivity \"internal\",\n        Device \"speaker\", Channel [in group] \"1 [center/LFE]\"\n        Location \"internal\", Jack \"atapi\", Color \"unknown\", Jack Det. \"not present\"\n\n0x1e  - \"Not Connected\", Connectivity \"internal\",\n        Device \"speaker\", Channel [in group] \"1 [side]\"\n        Location \"internal\", Jack \"atapi\", Color \"unknown\", Jack Det. \"not present\"\n\n\n\nA: I've been able to get the latest alsa dev working (2016-04-02) by following the instructions here (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa), installing the \"alsa daily development build\" and rebooting.

The BIOS is recognizing it fine, and windows is running well (that's what I'm typing from now)\n\nA: Despite what you say in your edit, I have to suspect you have bad RAM. Sometimes bad RAM creates more problems in one OS than in another, just because of the way each OS uses RAM. I therefore recommend that you run a memory-test program. On an EFI-based computer, the commercial (but free) memtest86 can do the job; there's a version that will run in the EFI, before any OS has loaded.\nYou could also try pulling the RAM and re-inserting it. Sometimes RAM is OK but will be flaky because it wasn't properly seated.\n\nA: The issue, unbeknownst to me, was that I ran apt-get upgrade and forgot that I did. It had a kernel fix, and this version was unable to find /boot/efi, I suppose.\n", "Q: List installed packages that are no longer installable via repository?

Almost easily, it got to the state where the driver was installed and present.\nBut it took much longer for me to get connected to my wireless router (with wpa2 security).  So, I added wpa_gui, which seemed to get things rolling. But, still push button WPA didn't work, many manual attempts failed, mostly with password rejection.  In the end, I needed \"linssid\" which reported that my modem expected WPA2 and TKIP -- so in wpa_gui, I used these parameters to add the \"network\" (SSID, etc).  It connected immediately.  (Before trying this, I had expected that the required connection parameters would be discovered automatically)\nActually, I just noticed that there is a status tab in wpa_gui, and you can scan for networks there. Also, the network notification applet in the task bar, seems to be unaware that I do have a wi-fi connection.  You also have to run wpa_gui with \"sudo\" in a terminal window (even though it shows up as a menu item).  On my Lubuntu system, if you use the network notification interface on the task bar, you will continously get asked for the password.

Then you have to use N piped grep commands?\ngrep word1 /path | grep word2 | grep word3 | grep word4 | grep word5 | ... | grep wordN\n\nHere is using only one grep and matching line if contains multiple words:\ngrep -E 'word1.*word2.*word3.*word4.*' /path\n\nAbove command simulates AND using grep's -E option. This command will work if your words in line are in the same order and will fails if you had a line like below:\nword4 and word3 and word2 and word1\n\nSo what is the new idea to working/finding the matches in any order?\nThe idea is using grep with -P (Perl-Compatibility) option and lookahead regex (?=(regex)):\ngrep -P '(?=.*?word1)(?=.*?word2)(?=.*?word4)(?=.*?word3)' /path\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The .*? means matching every characters . that repeated zero or more times * while they are optional.

Then if you only have one public IP you have to assign private IPs to other hosts and do NAT/masquerade. You can do it on your PC or run a cable to WAN port of the router and let the router take care of it, but then i don't really see the point of PC to \"filter\" connections.

What's wrong with my HDD? Help me correct it.\n\nA: Generally that symbol just means there was a problem accessing the data within the partition, either because of an unsupported filesystem or some other issue. Try right clicking on the partition and then clicking on \"Information\"\n\nA: An exclamation mark beside a partition means that GParted encountered a problem when reading the partition.  With NTFS the most common problem is that Windows was not shut down properly and that the NTFS file system is in an inconsistent state.  An inconsistent NTFS file system can be fixed often by just booting into Windows (Windows should automatically run \"chkdsk\" on the partition) and then using the menu option Start -> Shutdown.  If that doesn't work, you can also run \"chkdsk /f /r\"  on the drive letter for the partition from a Windows command prompt and then reboot into Windows twice.\n\nA: What you are seeing is just an indication that this partition does not yet contain a filesystem.

After you login run the following commands:\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nThis will output your partitions to see which one contains your Ubuntu OS. Mine is on /dev/sda6 so I will use that as an example, however, yours may be /dev/sda1 or something else.\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /\nsudo chroot /\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nIf this does not work, you may need to install grub again before you update grub. If this is the case, boot a live disk and run the following commands:\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nThis will tell you the partition you need to use in the following commands, again, I will use /dev/sda6 as an example, however, yours may be /dev/sda1 or something else.\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda\n\nNotice the last command uses /dev/sda with no number, this installs grub to the MBR.

I have installed a ubuntu 14.04 in my company, and I want to block websites in my browser Firefox/Chorme, but how can I do this? \nThanks!   \n\nA: Mozilla Firefox\nUsing Firefox you can use Block Site add-on to block any websites (blacklist) or allow only certain websites (whitelist). Here’s a screenshot from its preferences (sorry for my small display):\n\nGoogle Chrome\nAnd in Chrome/Chromium it seems there is an extension from the same developers. \nOpera\nSome time ago I was using Opera for its bits and whistles. There’s a built-in functionality to block contents there, under Preferences > Advanced > Content > Blocked Content.\n\nI personally prefer the way @sparkmood mentioned here. It’s browser-independent.

There is no \nReadme file or any other info contained in the .tar.gz file, just freeverb.so\nCan you advise me how to get the freeverb.so installed into the correct folder for Audacity to pick it up?\n\nA: According to ubuntu manual:\n\nldconfig  creates,  updates,  and removes the necessary links and\ncache (for use by the run-time linker,  ld.so)  to  the  most  recent\nshared libraries  found  in  the directories specified on the command\nline, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories\n(/usr/lib  and /lib).\n\nSo, assuming that freeverb.so is located in /home/yourUser/Download directory (folder), create folder in your home:\nmkdir /home/yourUser/myLibrary\n\nand copy freeVerb.so library:\ncp /home/yourUser/Download/freeverb.so /home/yourUser/myLibrary\n\ncreate a simple file freeverb.conf like this:\necho \"/home/yourUser/myLibrary\" > freeverb.conf\n\nAdd you configuration file freeverb.conf in /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory (in this directory you can find files as example)\nsudo cp freeverb.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d\n\nRun ldconfig in order to configure dynamic linker run-time bindings.\nsudo ldconfig\n\nIf /etc/ld.so.conf.d doesn't exists, you can add your path at the end of /etc/ld.so.conf file.\nAt the end, if all went well, you can remove unnecessary file:\nrm freeverb.conf\nrm /home/yourUser/Download/freeverb.so\n\n\nA: The simple approach is to put the file in /usr/local/lib, chown the file to root:root, and chmod it to 755.\nHowever, managing system files manually is not something I would personally recommend, so if possible I would search for a prebuilt .deb file for your particular version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can install the package containing the library in a clean system (such as reference docker container with the same system) and then copy the missing shared library (as reported during failed run attempts) from the installed location (such as /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/) to exactly the same location in the target system or container.\nBe warned that multiple additional packages may need to be installed to extract all the necessary dependencies (a common problem with so-called \"distroless\" containers). It is therefore best to list all dependencies using ldd to avoid an iterative process.\n", "Q: Delete the whole line starting with a special character except for the first word I have very recently started using linux and I am almost completely oblivious on sed commands. I need to edit a file that contains a bunch of long lines starting with the common character \">\" and delete the rest of this line only keeping the first word but not touch any lines that do not start with \">\" using sed command.\nIn other words, i need to turn this (only a part of the first entry for demonstration purposes): \n>YAL001C TFC3 SGDID:S000000001, Chr I from 151006-147594,151166-151097, Genome Release 64-1-1, reverse complement, Verified ORF, \"Largest of six subunits of the RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor complex (TFIIIC); part of the TauB domain of TFIIIC that binds DNA at the BoxB promoter sites of tRNA and similar genes; cooperates with Tfc6p in DNA binding\"\nMVLTIYPDELVQIVSDKIASNKGKITLNQLWDISGKYFDLSDKKVKQFVLSCVILKKDIE\nVYCDGAIP*\n\ninto this:\n>YAL001C\nMVLTIYPDELVQIVSDKIASNKGKITLNQLWDISGKYFDLSDKKVKQFVLSCVILKKDIE\nVYCDGAIP*\n\n\nA: I present here four solutions, two using sed, one using awk, and one using perl.  To start:\n$ sed -r 's/^(>[^ ]+) .*/\\1/' inputfile\n\nOn your sample input, this produces the output:\n>YAL001C\nLTIYPDELVQIVSDKIASNKGKITLNQLWDISGKYFDLSDKKVKQFVLSCVILKKDIE\nVYCDGAIP*\n\nThe code uses sed's substitute command s.  The substitute command is in the form s/old/new/.  In this case, the \"old\" part consists of these pieces:\n\n\n*\n\n*^\nThis is sed-speak for the start of a line.\n\n*(>[^ ]+)\nThis refers to a group of characters consisting of an angle bracket followed by one or more non-blank characters.  Because this is in parenthesis, we will be able to refer to it later as \\1.\n\n*.*\nThis refers to a blank followed by any number of any characters.\nWhen the substitute command is done, the whole of any such line is replaced by just the > and the non-blank characters which immediately follow it.\nAny lines not starting with that combination are sent to the output unchanged.\nAlternate solution\nIn the comments, steeldriver suggests an alternate approach:\nsed '/^>/ s/\\s.*//'\n\nIn this solution, the substitute command is preceded by the modifier /^>/ which restricts the substitute command to operate only on lines that start with >.  Knowing that the line starts with an angle bracket, then it is only necessary to remove the first blank and everything which follows the first blank.  This is what the command s/\\s.*// does.\nAll other lines are passed through unchanged.\nAlternate solution using awk\nawk '/^>/ {print $1;next} 1' inputfile\n\nThis awk script consists to two expressions:\n\n\n*\n\n*/^>/ {print $1;next}\nawk supports the same style of modifiers as sed.  The initial expression, thus, restricts this command to operate only on lines that start with >.  For those lines, the first field is printed.  next tells awk to skip to the next line and start over.\n\n*1\n1 is awk's cryptic short-hand for print the whole line.  This is executed only on lines for which the next command in the preceding expression is not executed, meaning that awk reaches this command only if the line does not start with >.\nAlternate solution using perl\nsteeldriver also suggests:\nperl -anle 'print $F[0] if /^>/ || $_'\n\nThe four options have the following meaning:\n\n\n*\n\n*-n tells perl to implicitly loop over input lines\n\n*-a tells perl to turn on autosplitting, creating the @F array \n\n*-l enables automatic line-ending processing\n\n*-e tells it to run the command which follows, eliminating the need for a perl script file.\nThe perl command itself is fairly readable:\nprint $F[0] if /^>/ || $_\n\nThis command prints the first field if the line starts with >.  Otherwise, it prints the whole line.\n", "Q: MS Office 2003/wine/ Ubuntu 12.04.2, wine installed as administrator (not root), MS Office 2003 installed as administrator (not root).\nWord, Excel, etc. work fine under administrator account but can't get either to run under a user account.\nFrom user account found path to WINWORD.EXE (/home/administrator/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Microsoft Office/OFFICE11)\nFrom terminal, execute: wine WINWORD.EXE\nError: IOPL not enabled\nwinecfg: configured library - gdiplus (native, builtin) then (native, windows)\nSame error.\nShould I reinstall MS Office under user account?\nWhat am I missing?\n\nA: As far I understand, you can run Word as user Administrator, but when trying to run it from another different account (user300246 for instance) you get errors.\nIn fact seems absolutely normal, let me explain. You installed it as \"Administrator\" user, so the files has the correct (read/write) permissions for that user. When you try to run it from other user (user300246, for instance), perhaps Winword.exe is trying to read/write from/to a file which is owned by Administrator, which throws the error.\nTry to install Winword with a different user and run from the same user.\nHope this helps. \n\nA: Why use MSOffice 2003? \nThe current Libreoffice has a everything and more functionality, is free, runs native in linux, is easy to install, works very well with DOC files.\nif you still insist you need it, check the AppDB entry for MSOffice2003 in www.winehq.org for troubleshooting.\nhttps://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=2735\n", "Q: How to get gvfs to automount removable devices when not using Unity or Gnome Shell Back in 13.04 I switched from using Unity to using a Gnome session with i3.

If I plugged in a removable drive (eg: a USB thumb drive) it'd mount at /media/$USER/$VOLUME_LABEL.\nUnder 14.04 this still works if I use Unity, but it no longer works in my preferred Gnome+i3 session.\nIf I start up nautilus (in a Gnome+i3 session) after plugging in a drive I can see the not-mounted drive in the left pane, but it has no eject button. It also does not show up in the output of df. If I then click on the drive, an eject button appears, and it will also appear in the output of df. So it seems that nautilus mounts volumes \"on demand\".\nI've also found that I can run gvfs-mount -oi to see gvfs events as they happen, and when a drive is attached it generates a pair of events like this:\nDrive connected:    'Lexar USB Flash Drive'\n  Drive(0): Lexar USB Flash Drive\n    Type: GProxyDrive (GProxyVolumeMonitorUDisks2)\n    ids:\n     unix-device: '/dev/sdg'\n...\n\nVolume added:       'ALLMYDATAZ'\n  Volume(0): ALLMYDATAZ\n    Type: GProxyVolume (GProxyVolumeMonitorUDisks2)\n    ids:\n     class: 'device'\n     unix-device: '/dev/sdg1'\n     uuid: 'BE64-1766'\n     label: 'ALLMYDATAZ'\n    themed icons:  ...\n    symbolic themed icons:  ...\n    can_mount=1\n    can_eject=1\n    should_automount=1\n    sort_key=gvfs.time_detected_usec.1404417627659873\n\n(Note the should_automount=1 bit, yet it still does not automount.)\nI can then manually mount the drive with gvfs-mount -d /dev/sdg1.\nSo... is there some pre-existing tool that ties these together, mounting the unix-device of all \"Volume added\" events that have should_automount=1? That is, mounting removable volumes as they are added to the system?\nNote that I am not looking for a way to have things mount at login or at system startup. I want them to mount when plugged in.\n\nA: Since this question didn't get any answers I went ahead and wrote gvfs-automount.\nWhen running it will listen for \"volume-added\" events, and if the added volume has \"should_automount\" set, mounts it. It also generates a desktop notification when a volume is mounted.\n", "Q: Need help with network configuration Without much knowledge I decided to install Ubuntu 14.04 but I'm having trouble setting up the network.

I have tried all of the screen settings including the 'NEVER' turn off and changed the power management to 'Don't suspend' but it still does it.  Any ideas?\n\nA: the dimming is due to the currently open software waiting for some operation and not responding in the interim. this may be due to extensive reading activity on the USB disk. try copying the data you work on onto the faster HDD.\ngoing for a faster USB drive (USB3.0 and faster/newer system) will help somewhat. but in my experience, does not prevent it from totally not happening.\n", "Q: Grub not working after Windows 8.1 update on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I do understand that this is a common problem, and I have read few of the threads.

But the system is presumably managing to boot the kernel from it, so it isn't fatally damaged.\nCommands like these might tell you more about the state of the partition:\nsudo file -s /dev/sda1           # basic \"file type\" detection\nsudo fsck -n /dev/sda1           # read-only filesystem check\nsudo mount -o ro /dev/sda1 /boot # read-only mount test\ndmesg | tail                     # should tell you what went wrong with the mount\n\nIf there is any sign of an error, you might find you can fix it by running fsck /dev/sda1 and allowing it to fix any errors.\n", "Q: Wine and ip camera tool I installed an IP camera tool using wine in ubuntu 14.04 LTS, in order to configure IP cameras. The IP camera tool's icon is on my desktop, but when I double click on it, the application does not open. What could it be wrong?\n\nA: this may be related to having to run the application in legacy mode.\nHowever, I don't think you need this software in the first place. check the manual, the ipcamera may have a web interface. use a browser to go to that address. and do the setup there. which ipcamera brand/model are you trying to configure?\n", "Q: Low Level Issue- Battery issue I have installed Xubunto instead of Machintosh on my MacBook Pro machine, when i close the screen the apple lamp on the back of my laptop doesn't goes off, and the laptop runs out of power. how can i control this back lamp to be on or off ??, is there away to disable it from my Linux ?\n\nA: By default on my Xubuntu installation on Mac OS X closing the lid does not do anything.  What you need to do is open the Whisker menu (mouse icon) and click the settings button in top right.  Then go to Power Manager and set what you want Xubuntu to do when the laptop lid is closed on battery and on AC (you probably want it to suspend to save battery). This is assuming you are running Xubuntu 14.04, if not the Power Manager may be in a different location.\nJust as a side note: On my MacBook Pro 9,2 it cannot resume from suspend after it was closed and the display won't turn on.  I heard it was a bug in Xubuntu 14.04, so until the bug is resolved make sure to manually hit suspend from the power button in the whisker menu before closing the lid.  Then when you open it hit a key and it will resume normally hopefully like on my Mac.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu either detect the size of hosting OS window or not?

The Canon printers under Linux have been constant sources of pain. The issue of not being able to print using a Canon printer has been discussed a number of times. \n(Actually, the issue of Canon printer pops up in this forum now and then and they are too  many to enumerate).\nAnyway, so far as my experience goes in the last two years, there has never been a definite diagnostic process chalked out. See also this question.\nYesterday, I had an strange experience which though may seem far fetched, I feel it necessary to report here since it may be useful to others. Moreover, I want to understand what really happened here.\nLast night, in the late hours, my  Canon LBP6000 suddenly stopped printing. None of the empirical practices undertaken worked. \nThen I started thinking about the recent changes made so far in my machine. The only one I could find is installing a cups pdf printer. Out of desperation, I removed this printer (apt-get purge), rebooted my machine, and the Canon printer started working again.\nNow, the question is, do you really think there is a connection between the pdf printer and the Canon printer where the former may make the latter stop printing? Any technical details which can be included in the answer may become helpful to the frustrated community of Canon printer owners under Linux.\nUPDATE\nI have tested by re-adding the cups-pdf printer, and the results look inconclusive.\n\nA: Chances are that the cups pdf printer installed a file that doesn't work well with your cups and/or the Canon drivers.\nInstall package cups-pdf again and start moving files to a different directory and restarting cups until printing starts working again. I would start with these 2 files:\n/etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf\n/usr/lib/cups/backend/cups-pdf\n\nTo list all files in package cups-pdf use dpkg -L cups-pdf.\nChances are that it is not Canon to blame this time (for a change), the bug looks like to be in package cups-pdf.

Instead, I'd like to take all of /dev/sb1 (or at a minimum the free space of it) and add it to /dev/sdb5.  Is that possible to do without problems, and if so what is the best way to go about it?\n\nA: I'm guessing the /dev/sda1 is where your windows installation is - you might be able to shrink that partition some, but that operation should be done while windows is running, using the windows disk manager.  Make a backup first!\nThen, using a live CD or live USB, you will need to add gparted to the usb while in the 'Try Ubuntu mode'\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nThen, you can run gparted against the disk, and move or resize the remaining partitions.\n\nA: It's possible to delete or resize your /dev/sda1 and then adjust the size of /dev/sda4 and /dev/sda5 to cover the freed space; however, that will involve moving the start point of your root (/) filesystem, which is always a bit risky. You'll also need to do this from GParted on a Linux emergency disk.\nIMHO, a better solution, if you're willing to completely wipe everything on /dev/sda1, is to repurpose that space as a Linux /home partition. This process is described in Move home folder to second drive (see especially Takkat's response), and I'm sure in other questions/answers on this site. This procedure poses less risk to your root (/) filesystem. In your case it will leave root (/) a bit on the large side, but not ridiculously so. Given the amount of disk space you seem to be using, it looks like you'll have plenty of space for storing your personal files.\n\nA: You can use a live .iso version of gparted, and pass along the space from one partition to its adjacent counterpart. See the instructions in the first post here, and dismiss the dogma of the posters saying you should re-install:\nhttp://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=115288\n", "Q: Desktop gray-out and back to normal I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit desktop (Running on laptop core i7-2670QM CPU with 16GB of Ram, 500 GB (less than 25% in use)).

I have been teaching myself bash scripting and have run into an issue. I have written a script to take input from the user, using the 'read' command, and make that input a variable to use later in the script. The script works, but....\nI would like to be able to get it setup using 'dialog'. I found out that\n'dialog --inputbox' will direct the output to 'stderr' and in order to get that input as a variable you have to direct it to a file and then retrieve it. The code I found to explain this is:\n#!/bin/bash\ndialog --inputbox \\\n\n\"What is your username?\" 0 0 2> /tmp/inputbox.tmp.$$\n\nretval=$?\n\ninput=`cat /tmp/inputbox.tmp.$$`\n\nrm -f /tmp/inputbox.tmp.$$\n\ncase $retval in\n0)\n\necho \"Your username is '$input'\";;\n1)\n\necho \"Cancel pressed.\";;\n\nesac\n\nI see that it is sending the sdterr to the /tmp/inputbox.tmp.$$ with 2>, but the output file looks like 'inputbox.tmp.21661'. When I try and cat the file it gives me an error. So I am still unable to get the user input from the --inputbox as a variable. \nExample Script: \necho \"  What app would you like to remove? \"\n\nread dead_app\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge $dead_app\n\nSo as you can see it is a basic script. Is it even possible to get the variable as a word from dialog --inputbox?\n\nA: This works for me:\n#!/bin/bash\ninput=$(dialog --stdout --inputbox \"What is your username?\" 0 0)\nretval=$?\n\ncase $retval in\n${DIALOG_OK-0}) echo \"Your username is '$input'.\";;\n${DIALOG_CANCEL-1}) echo \"Cancel pressed.\";;\n${DIALOG_ESC-255}) echo \"Esc pressed.\";;\n${DIALOG_ERROR-255}) echo \"Dialog error\";;\n*) echo \"Unknown error $retval\"\nesac\n\nThe manual page of dialog tells about --stdout:\n\nDirect output to the standard output.  This option is provided for compatibility with Xdialog, however using it  in  portable scripts is not recommended, since curses normally writes its screen updates to the standard output.  If you use this option, dialog attempts to reopen the terminal so it can write to the display.  Depending on the platform and your environment, that may fail.\n\nCan anyone tell in which platform or environment it does not work?\nDoes redirecting dialog output to 2>&1 >/dev/tty instead work better then?\n\nA: In case somebody else too landed here from Google, and although this question asks specifically for bash, here is another alternative:\nYou can use zenity. Zenity is a graphical utility that can be used inside bash scripts. But of course this would require an X server as user877329 rightfully pointed out.\nsudo apt-get install zenity\n\nThen in your script:\nRETVAL=`zenity --entry --title=\"Hi\" --text=\"What is your username\"`\n\nUseful link.\n\nA: The answer provided by Sneetsher is somewhat more elegant, but I can explain what's wrong: The value of $$ is different inside the backticks (because it starts a new shell, and $$ is the PID of the current shell).  You'll want to put the file name in a variable, then refer to that variable throughout instead.\n#!/bin/bash\nt=$(mktemp -t inputbox.XXXXXXXXX) || exit\ntrap 'rm -f \"$t\"' EXIT         # remove temp file when done\ntrap 'exit 127' HUP STOP TERM  # remove if interrupted, too\ndialog --inputbox \\\n    \"What is your username?\" 0 0 2>\"$t\"\nretval=$?\ninput=$(cat \"$t\")  # Prefer $(...) over `...`\ncase $retval in\n  0)    echo \"Your username is '$input'\";;\n  1)    echo \"Cancel pressed.\";;\nesac\n\nIn this case, avoiding the temporary file would be a better solution, but there will be many situations where you cannot avoid a temp file.\n\nA: \n:D I can't explain it!!!

I/O Redirection, write a new answer and I will give you 50rep:\nexec 3>&1;\nresult=$(dialog --inputbox test 0 0 2>&1 1>&3);\nexitcode=$?;\nexec 3>&-;\necho $result $exitcode;\n\nReference: Dialog in bash is not grabbing variables correctly\n\n^ answer from @Sneetsher (Jul 4, 2014)\nAs requested, I will try to explain what this snippet is doing line by line.\nNote that I will simplify it by omitting all the ; semicolons at the line ends, because they're not necessary if we write one command per line.\nI/O - Streams:\nFirst, you need to understand the communication streams. There are 10 streams, numbered from 0 to 9:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stream 0 (\"STDIN\"):\n\"Standard input\", the default input stream to read data from the keyboard.\n\n*Stream 1 (\"STDOUT\"):\n\"Standard output\", the default output stream used to show normal text in the terminal.\n\n*Stream 2 (\"STDERR\"): \n\"Standard error\", the default output stream used to display errors or other text for special purposes in the terminal.\n\n*Streams 3-9:\nAdditional, freely usable streams. They're not used by default and do not exist until something attempts to use them.\nNote that all \"streams\" are internally represented by file descriptors in /dev/fd (which is a symbolic link to /proc/self/fd which contains another symbolic link for every stream... it's a bit complicated and not important for their behaviour, so I stop here.). The standard streams also have /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr (which are symbolic links again, etc...).\nThe script:\n\n\n*\n\n*exec 3>&1\n\nThe Bash built-in exec can be used to apply a stream redirection to the shell, that means it affects all following commands. For more info, run help exec in your terminal.  \nIn this special case, the stream 3 gets redirected to stream 1 (STDOUT), that means everything we send to stream 3 later will appear in our terminal as if it was normally printed to STDOUT.\n\n*result=$(dialog --inputbox test 0 0 2>&1 1>&3)\n\nThis line consists of many parts and syntactical structures:\n\n\n*\n\n*result=$(...)\nThis structure executes the command in the brackets and assigns the output (STDOUT) to the bash variable result. It's readable through $result. All this is described somehow in the veeeery looong man bash.\n\n*dialog --inputbox TEXT HEIGHT WIDTH\nThis command shows a TUI box with the given TEXT, a text input field and two buttons OK and CANCEL. If OK gets selected, the command exits with status 0 and prints the entered text to STDERR, if CANCEL gets selected, it will exit with code 1 and print nothing. For more info, read man dialog.\n\n*2>&1 1>&3\nThese are two redirection commands. They will be interpreted from right to left:\n1>&3 redirects the command's stream 1 (STDOUT) to the custom stream 3.\n2>&1 redirects afterwards the command's stream 2 (STDERR) to stream 1 (STDOUT).\nThat means that everything the command prints to STDOUT now appears in stream 3, while everything that was intended to show up on STDERR now gets redirected to STDOUT.\nSo the entire line displays a text prompt (on STDOUT, which got redirected to stream 3, which the shell again redirects back to STDOUT in the end - see the exec 3>&1 command) and assigns the entered data (returned through STDERR, then redirected to STDOUT) to the Bash variable result. \n\n*exitcode=$?\n\nThis code retrieves the previously executed command's exit code (here from dialog) through the reserved Bash variable $? (always holds the last exit code) and simply stores it in our own Bash variable exitcode. It can be read through $exitcode again. You can search for more info on this in man bash, but that might take a while...\n\n*exec 3>&-\n\nThe Bash built-in exec can be used to apply a stream redirection to the shell, that means it affects all following commands. For more info, run help exec in your terminal.  \nIn this special case, the stream 3 gets redirected to \"stream -\", which just means it should be closed. Data sent to stream 3 will not get redirected anywhere any more from now on.\n\n*echo $result $exitcode\n\nThis simple echo command (more info on man echo) just prints the content of the two Bash variables result and exitcode to the STDOUT. As we have no explicit or implicit stream redirections here any more, they will really appear on STDOUT and therefore simply get displayed in the terminal. What a miracle! ;-)\nSummary:\nFirst, we set the shell up to redirect everything we send to the custom stream 3 back to STDOUT, so that it shows up in our terminal.  \nThen we run the dialog command, redirect its original STDOUT to our custom stream 3, because it needs to get displayed in the end, but we temporarily need to use the STDOUT stream for something else.\nWe redirect the original STDERR of the command, where the dialogue window's user input gets returned, to STDOUT afterwards.\nNow we can capture the STDOUT (which holds the redirected data from STDERR) and store it in our variable $result. It contains the wanted user input now!\nWe also want the dialog command's exit code, which shows us whether OK or CANCEL was clicked. This value is presented in the reserved Bash variable $? and we just copy it to our own variable $exitcode.\nAfter that we close stream 3 again, as we don't need it any more, to stop further redirections of it.\nFinally, we normally output the contents of both variables $result (the user input of the dialogue window) and $exitcode (0 for OK, 1 for CANCEL) to the terminal.\n\nA: Using dialog's own tools: --output-fd flag\nIf you read man page for dialog, there is option --output-fd, which allows you to explicitly set where the output goes (STDOUT 1 , STDERR 2), instead of by default going to STDERR.\nBellow you can see me running sample dialog command , with explicitly stating that output must go to file descriptor 1, which allows me to save it into MYVAR.\nMYVAR=$(dialog --inputbox \"THIS OUTPUT GOES TO FD 1\" 25 25  --output-fd 1)\n\nUsing named pipes\nAlternative approach which has a lot of hidden potential, is to use something known as named pipe.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmkfifo /tmp/namedPipe1 # this creates named pipe, aka fifo\n\n# to make sure the shell doesn't hang, we run redirection \n# in background, because fifo waits for output to come out    \ndialog --inputbox \"This is an input box  with named pipe\" 40 40 2> /tmp/namedPipe1 & \n\n# release contents of pipe\nOUTPUT=\"$( cat /tmp/namedPipe1  )\" \n\n\necho  \"This is the output \" $OUTPUT\n# clean up\nrm /tmp/namedPipe1 \n\n\nA more in-depth overview of user.dz's answer with alternate approach\nThe original answer by user.dz and ByteCommander's explanation of that both provide a good solution and overview of what it does. However, I believe a deeper analysis could be beneficial to explain why it works. \nFirst of all, it is important to understand two things: what is the problem we're trying to solve and what are the underlying workings of shell mechanisms with which we're dealing. The task is to capture output of a command via command substitution. Under simplistic overview that everyone knows, command substitutions capture the stdout of a command and let it be reused by something else. In this case, the result=$(...) part should save the output of whatever command is designated by ... into a variable called result. \nUnderneath the hood, command substitution is actually implemented as pipe, where there is a child process (the actual command that runs) and reading process (which saves output to variable). This is evident with a simple trace of system calls. Notice that file descriptor 3 is the read end of the pipe, while 4 is the write end. For the child process of echo, which writes to its stdout - the file descriptor 1, that file descriptor is actually copy of file descriptor 4, which is the write-end of the pipe. \nNotice that stderr isn't playing a role here, simply because it's a pipe connecting stdout only.\n$ strace -f -e pipe,dup2,write,read bash -c 'v=$(echo \"X\")'\n...\npipe([3, 4])                            = 0\nstrace: Process 6200 attached\n[pid  6199] read(3,  <unfinished ...>\n[pid  6200] dup2(4, 1)                  = 1\n[pid  6200] write(1, \"X\\n\", 2 <unfinished ...>\n[pid  6199] <... read resumed> \"X\\n\", 128) = 2\n[pid  6200] <... write resumed> )       = 2\n[pid  6199] read(3, \"\", 128)            = 0\n[pid  6200] +++ exited with 0 +++\n--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=6200, si_uid=1000, si_status=0, si_utime=0, si_stime=0} ---\n+++ exited with 0 +++\n\nLet's go back to the original answer for a second. Since now we know that dialog writes the TUI box to stdout, answer to stderr, and within command substitution  stdout gets piped somewhere else, we already have part of the solution - we need to rewire file descriptors in such way that stderr will be piped to the reader process. This is the 2>&1 part of the answer. However, what do we do with TUI box ? \nThat's where file descriptor 3 comes in. The dup2() syscall allows us to duplicate file descriptors, making them effectively refer to the same place, yet we can manipulate them separately. File descriptors of processes that have controlling terminal attached actually point to specific terminal device. This is evident if you do\n$ ls -l /proc/self/fd\ntotal 0\nlrwx------ 1 user1 user1 64 Aug 20 10:30 0 -> /dev/pts/5\nlrwx------ 1 user1 user1 64 Aug 20 10:30 1 -> /dev/pts/5\nlrwx------ 1 user1 user1 64 Aug 20 10:30 2 -> /dev/pts/5\nlr-x------ 1 user1 user1 64 Aug 20 10:30 3 -> /proc/6424/fd\n\nwhere /dev/pts/5 is my current pseudo-terminal device. Thus, if we can somehow save this destination, we can still write the TUI box onto terminal screen. That's what exec 3>&1 does. When you call a command with redirection command > /dev/null for example, the shell passes it's stdout file descriptor and then uses dup2() to write that file descriptor to /dev/null. The exec command performs something similar to dup2() file descriptors for the whole shell session, thus making any command inherit already redirected file descriptor. Same with exec 3>&1. The file descriptor 3 will now refer to/point to the controlling terminal, and any command that runs in that shell session will know about it. \nSo when result=$(dialog --inputbox test 0 0 2>&1 1>&3); occurs, the shell creates a pipe for dialog to write, but also 2>&1 will first make the command's file descriptor 2 be duplicated onto the write file descriptor of that pipe (thus making output go to read end of the pipe and into the variable), while file descriptor 1 will be duplicated onto 3. This will make file descriptor 1 still refer to the controlling terminal, and the TUI dialog will show up on the screen.\nNow, there's actually a short-hand for the current controlling terminal of the process, which is /dev/tty. Thus, the solution can be simplified without use of file descriptors, simply into:\nresult=$(dialog --inputbox test 0 0 2>&1 1>/dev/tty);\necho \"$result\"\n\nKey things to remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*file descriptors are inherited from shell by each command\n\n*command substitution is implemented as pipe\n\n*duplicated file descriptors will refer to same place as original one, but we can manipulate each file descriptor separately\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*When would you use additional file descriptor ?\n\n*Significance of arrows symbols in duplicating/closing file descriptors under bash\n\nA: :D I can't explain it!!!

I'd like xscreensaver to lock my session using the standard GNOME lockscreen, instead of using the horrible 1990's xscreensaver lockscreen prompt (sorry guys but it needs a facelift).  I know this is possible because I have this configuration working on a different machine, but I don't believe anything special was performed to make it happen.\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 64bit installed on my laptop, and have removed gnome-screensaver using \"sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver\".  I've added an entry to the startup applications to run \"xscreensaver -no-splash\".  If I wait 5 minutes, the screensaver starts up as expected, however when I move the mouse I find it returns me to an unlocked session.  In case you're wondering, yes I'm waiting until after short timeout where it would otherwise allow me to wake up the session without needing to type your password.\nI've tried playing around with various configurations under System Settings / Brightness & Lock.  The options I've tried setting are ensuring that \"Lock\" is enabled, and setting \"lock screen after\" to 5 minutes.  However this seems to have no effect.  I was actually wondering if this was due to the removal of gnome-screensaver.\nI've tried following the steps under the apps man page, however it requests me to modify /usr/share/applications/gnome-screensaver-preferences.desktop which doesn't exist (I believe because gnome-screensaver-preferences is no longer shipped with gnome-screensaver, and is uninstalled in any case).\nI then found a slightly different version of the man page here:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xscreensaver.1.html\nUnder the GNOME heading it asks you to modify the same file as before, that also doesn't exist.\nI'm at a bit of a loss really.  I would have thought that if xscreensaver was configured to not lock the screen, but have Ubuntu configured to lock the screen, then the 2 should work together.  So I'm wondering if they're conflicting somehow?\nAppreciate any and all help.\nThanks.\n\nA: Ok I've resolved this issue now, and am posting the solution for anyone else that wants to do the same as I have.\n\n\n*\n\n*xscreensaver needs to be launched at startup via \"Startup Applications\" (hit Super and type \"Startup\").  Add a new entry to launch the xscreensaver daemon on startup as xscreensaver -no-splash.\n\n*You need to bring up the xscreensaver config app.  Hit Super and type screensaver.  Set the \"Blank after x minutes\" to your desired amount (e.g. 5 minutes).  Remember this value for later.  Ensure \"Lock screen after\" is UNCHECKED.\n\n*Finally, go to System Settings / Brightness & Lock.  Set \"Turn screen off when inactive for x minutes\" to the same value as you set xscreensavers \"Blank after x minutes\" setting (e.g. 5 minutes).  Then still under Brightness & Lock, set \"Lock screen after:\" to \"Screen turns off\".\nAnd you're done!  If your system is idle for the set amount of time, the screensaver will kick in, and in the background your session will also lock.  When you wake your system, you will find it locked and asking for your password.  No ugly 90's login prompts... awesome.  The one caveat is that your screensaver will apparently not kick in if your session is already at a login prompt, the screen will simply turn off.\n", "Q: Error when installing apache 2 on ubuntu 14.04 When I install the apache2 in my Ubuntu there is an error like this:\nReading package lists...

I have the same dongle and I experienced the same problem from times to times, specially when doing some network intensive tasks (like downloading torrents or updating the system).\nTo solve this, you'll need to lower the transmission power (TX-Power in iwconfig).  For instance, iwconfig wlan0 txpower 12 will lower the transmission power of wlan0 from 20dB to 12dB.\nThis is not permanent, though.  You'll have to configure your system to run this command on every boot or every time a connection is made (I'm using another distro right now, so I don't know exactly how to do this on Ubuntu, sorry).\n", "Q: How to write a script to run different application I am very new to linux platform.\nLooking for a script file to call different application start up file located in different location and needs to be run in different terminals. \nFor example :\ni have two .sh file like a.sh and b.sh in different locations.\nNow need a script file to run these .sh file. when i run that script it should be open two terminals . In the first terminal a.sh should be  called and b.sh file should be run on second terminal . \nThanks in advance for help.\nRegards,\nRaghu\n\nA: That is quite simple. Write a script something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nxterm -e /bin/bash /path/to/script_1.sh &\nxterm -e /bin/bash /path/to/script_2.sh &\n\nThe -e option means \"execute\". The argument after it is the command to execute (here it is /bin/bash) and the next option is the argument for the command (here the name of the script-file). & means that the xterm-commands are running in background. If you remove the first &, it will run the first script completely and afterwards it will start the next command, but as I understood your question you want to run them simultaneously, so leave the & there.\nYou can also use the standard terminal instead of xterm, but this depends on the distribution and desktop you use. For example in gnome it would be gnome-terminal -x, but it should not make any difference when using xterm.\nHope this helps.\nGreatings, Darth Ravage \n", "Q: how to make canon LBP 6000 printer work on ubuntu 14.04? how can i make my printer (canon LBP 6000) work on ubuntu 14.04 ?\nshould i seek help from a programmer?\n\nA: Install the Cannon LBP printer driver printer-driver-cjet:\nsudo apt-get install printer-driver-cjet\n\nthen use the printer with the application Printers\n", "Q: Need help downloading steam!

The rescue prompt is presented so the user can provide the path to the grub folder, load the necessary modules, and provide the proper boot commands.\nA common reason for the grub rescue> prompt is an incorrect path to the grub folder. Reasons for the prompt also include a failure to update GRUB 2 after certain system or partition operations, improper designation of the grub folder location, missing linux or initrd.img symlinks in /, or a failed installation.\nTo successfully boot from the grub rescue> prompt:\n\n*\n\n*The grub folder must exist and contain the necessary GRUB 2 files and modules.\n\n*The proper paths must be set via the set prefix command. Many GRUB 2 commands will not work until the correct path is set. If the path to the grub folder (normally /boot/grub) is not correct, an \"unknown command\" or \"file not found\" message is likely.\n\n*The necessary modules must be loaded. The kernel cannot be loaded until the 'linux' module is loaded.\n\n*A Linux kernel and initrd.img must be located and loaded.\n\nIn your case the grub folder and grub.cfg is seems to be available but inaccessible because your OS's partition can't be mounted, as the corresponding module is not loaded or it was corrupted during resizing. For the module to load, your grub should be completely loaded or the prefix should be set.\nFor that, do the following:\n\n*\n\n*set prefix=(hdX,Y)/boot/grub\nUse the values determined earlier.\nExample: If the Ubuntu system is on sda5, enter:\nset prefix=(hd0,5)/boot/grub\nIn your case it most probabily is (hd0,3).\n\n*set root=(hdX,Y)\nConfirm the correct X,Y values and press enter.\nExample: If the Ubuntu system is on sda5, enter: set root=(hd0,5)\n\n*insmod normal: Load the normal module.\nIf the module loads there will be no message.\nIf the module fails to load, try the full path: insmod (hdX,Y)/boot/grub/normal.mod\n\n*normal: Transition to the normal GRUB 2 mode with increased functionality.\nIf the module loads there will be no message.\nIf the module loads, HELP, Tab completion and command recall using the UP/DN keys should be available.\n\n*set\n(Optional) Review the current settings.\n\n*insmod linux: Load the linux module.

The only thing to consider here are the new configuration directives\nLimitUIDRange\n\nand\nLimitGIDRange\n\nThese directives define, which UIDs and GIDs mpm-itk can use (via setuid/setguid). As you obviously want it to be able to become root, your lower range must be ID 0. The following configuration will work here:\n<IfModule mpm_itk_module>\n    LimitUIDRange 0 6000\n    LimitGIDRange 0 6000\n</IfModule>\n\nBe aware, the the upper border should include all user UID/GID combinations that you want to use within your configuration via AssignUserID.\nNote that you can configure this for each virtual host you have. Note too, that you need a Linux kernel 3.5.0 or higher for this.\n\nA: Your sudoers configuration is right, in fact when you exec:\n  sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/php test.php\n\nit work as expected.\nIn normal operation, your apache runs as root and use mpm-itk module. Here is the problem.\nAccording to mpm-itk documentation:\n\nSince mpm-itk has to be able to setuid(), it runs as root (although\n  restricted with POSIX capabilities and seccomp v2 where possible)\n  until the request is parsed and the vhost determined.\n\nand:\n\nmpm-itk is based on the traditional prefork MPM, which means it's\n  non-threaded; .... You will also take\n  an additional performance hit over prefork, since there's an extra\n  fork per request.\n\nThis means that mpm-itk fork apache process and use setuid() in order to assign desired user to each virtual host.\nAccording to setuid manual:\n\nThe setuid() function checks the effective user ID of the caller and\n  if it is the superuser, all  process-related  user  ID's are  set  to \n  uid.   After  this has occurred, it is impossible for the program to\n  regain root privileges.\n\nThis could explain already, but not convinced, I downloaded the source of mpm-itk and I notice that it change capability permit and restrict the uid range from 1 to UINT_MAX.\n\nIf  a  thread  drops a capability from its permitted set, it can never\n  reacquire that capability\n\nMy conclusion is that by using mpm-itk your php scripts can't gain root permission.\nIf you have the chance, you can check if running apache as www-data and disabling mpm-itk module your test.php works.\n", "Q: Is this Cinnamon Panel item also available in Xfce?

I want to know how is this possible and what should be the mount points for all of them as HDD space is unallocated.\n\nA: Different people use different schemes for partitioning their hard drives depending on their preference, so the answers here will probably vary. For sure you need a \"/\" partition, and I would recommend a \"swap\" partition as opposed to a swap file. Also, it is not a bad idea to have a separate \"/home\" partition. Some users have a separate \"/boot\" partition, I never bother.So for me, I have the following partitions:\n/\n\n/home\n\nswap\n\nDuring the installation process you will be prompted to format your hard drive. It is at this stage that you generate the different partitions on the different drives. I guess your 160Gb will be /dev/sda and your 1TB will be /dev/sdb. You could put \"/\" and \"swap\" partitions on /dev/sda and \"/home\" on /dev/sdb, or you could put \"/\" on /dev/sda and \"/home\" and \"swap\" on /dev/sdb, its totally up to you. I guess there are performance gains to be had by having your swap partition on the 1TB, but it's up to you.\nWhen prompted, select /dev/sda, create a new partition, select a size, format it as ext4 and mount it as \"/\". (I think it is labeled \"use as\" not \"mount as\"). Leave enough space for your swap partition, lets say twice as much as your memory. (So if you have 4G RAM, reserve 8G for swap).\nDo the same for swap. Select /dev/sda, create the partition, mount it as \"swap\".\nDo the same for \"/home\". Select /dev/sdb, create a partition, format it as ext4, mount it as \"/home\".\nYou should be good to go from here on in.\n", "Q: System frequently hangs and lagging response I am using Ubuntu 14.04.

I have a Xubuntu Server 14.04 x64.\nHow do I list all DNS servers that are in use without NetworkManager which is not even installed?\n\nA: They are defined in /etc/resolv.conf.\n\nA: The DNS setting can be specified in /etc/network/interfaces and resolve.conf could be blank. Because the DNS entry can be in multiple locations, I think it is best to do an actual DNS query with the verbose mode switch. The output lines that start with the word \"Received\" will show the DNS server used by your host. In this example, I use www.news.com\nhost -v www.news.com | grep Received\n\nA: To extend answer from @fkraiem:\nYou can list DNS servers currently in use by executing the following command from the terminal:\nmore /etc/resolv.conf\n\n\nDNS servers are configured during DHCP negotiation or specified statically in /etc/network/interfaces.

I am trying to create a fillable PDF form for work in LibreOffice Writer. It works just fine in Writer when I test it out, however when I export it as a PDF and open in Adobe Reader it no longer functions the same way. \nFor instance, I have date fields with drop-down calendars; these are replaced by simple text input boxes in the PDF version of the file. Another example, I have numerical fields; these also become text boxes in the PDF. \nWhat is causing this? How do I fix it? I want the PDF file to look and work like the .odt file. Any insight is appreciated!\nThanks,\nLaya\n\nA: It might be worthwhile to look at what PDF forms are and do. PDF forms do primarily not make a difference between text, number, date etc. It is all text fields, and if you want to be specific, you have to provide the means to do so.\nHowever, the conversion of drop downs selectors should be better, because there is the combobox field type which is a drop down.\nIf you want to allow only numerical entries in a text field, you have to set its Format properties accordingly.\nIn any case, what LibreOffice creates as PDF form is a base, and you will have to finish the form (particularly if you want/need logic) in Acrobat (Pro). Again, this is because the object models of .odt and PDF are too far apart that a conversion is possible.\nLibreOffice/OpenOffice is a good low-cost way to create PDF forms, but you still need Acrobat to finish the PDF form.\n", "Q: “Errors were found while checking the disk for /” , no /tmp mounting error I've been recently experiencing following error during every time I boot into ubuntu:  \n\nErrors were found while checking the disk drive for /.\n\nHowever everything seems to work file once I choose to ignore the message, by pressing It .

I honestly can't say how effective it will be.\nAnyway download the deb drivers from here (you need both cupswrapper and LPR files):\nhttp://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#MFC-7360\n  Save those somewhere, then in a terminal, cd into that directory and run:\nsudo dpkg -i --force-all mfc*.deb\nsudo dpkg -i --force-all cupswrapper*.deb\nFollowing that, no matter what, still couldnt get it to run.\n  So referring to: http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/instruction_prn1a.html\n  I noted that it specified you needed to check that Ubuntu's printer settings had the right USB address.\nAnd mine wasn't.\nPrinters > (MFC-7360N) > Properties > Device URI:\nI noted that mine was different... so connected printer via USB, hit change in Device URI, selected the printer line there (being usb://Brother/MFC-7360N wotever).\nApply\nAnd tadahh... all my queued up \"Printer is not available' printjobs came spewing out.\nWorks.\nSo in the end it was all down to the Ubuntu Printer settings, not a base level Brother driver issue after all.\nHope this can help any other frustrated Brother owners.\"\n\nsource\n", "Q: how to resolve \"TypeError: Cannot call method 'push' of null\" I'm a new qml programmer and I found my self in this problem that when I want to call a new page when clicked on a button it says:\nTypeError: Cannot call method 'push' of null\n\nI've tried everything I know to resolve this but still nothing.\nHere is my code: \nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\nimport \"components\"\n\nMainView {\n\n    objectName: \"mainView\"\n\n    applicationName: \"com.ubuntu.developer..EcoLover3\"\n\n    automaticOrientation: true\n\n    width: units.gu(48)\n       height: units.gu(60)\n    PageStack {\n        id: pagestack\n       Component.onCompleted: push(page0)\n        Page {\n            id: page0\n            title: i18n.tr(\"Bem Vindo à aplicação do EcoLover\" )\n            visible: false\n            Text {\n                id: entrada\n                text: qsTr(\"Caro Cliente, <br>aqui poderá contrloar os seus gastos de energia</br>\")\n            }\n        Column {\n            anchors.margins: units.gu(3)\n                            spacing: units.gu(3)\n                            anchors.fill: parent\n\n           Image{\n               anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter\n           source: \"/home/diogo/ecoLover_teste2/components/Ecolover_com_stroke.png\"\n           }\n\n           Button {\n               anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter\n               text: i18n.tr(\"Page one\")\n               onClicked: pageStack.push(page1, {color: UbuntuColors.orange})\n           }\n           Button {\n                             anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter\n                             text: i18n.tr(\"Entrar no  EcoLover\")\n                             onClicked: pageStack.push(Qt.resolvedUrl(\"Pagina_inicial.qml\"))\n                         }\n            }\n        }\n\n        Page {\n                   title: \"Rectangle\"\n                   id: page1\n                   visible: false\n                   property alias color: rectangle.color\n                   Rectangle {\n                       id: rectangle\n                       anchors {\n                           fill: parent\n                           margins: units.gu(5)\n                       }\n       }\n     }}}\n\n\nA: You made a small mistake in naming your Pagestack component:\nPageStack {\n    id: pagestack\n\nLater you're calling it with pageStack.push.

(especially the file name extension), that is used in your Java program match the path and file name of the file you are looking to access exactly.  And remember, Linux file paths are case-sensitive, unlike the Windows file system.\nFINALLY, if you have confirmed that your file path is not the problem, post the Java code that is being executed when the exception is thrown, and I will be happy to check further into it.\nOR, refer to the following:\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/\nfor all the gritty details of working with Java IO components.\n", "Q: Can I share a private IP address on Wi-Fi and Ethernet? I have a laptop which is usually on Ethernet and has a static IP. Sometimes I need to take it away from my desk and use the wifi. How can I make the Ethernet and Wi-Fi use the same private IP address?\n\nA: You could configure both interfaces with the same IP, but only one can be active at a time.  To switch from the ethernet connection to the wifi, you could use the following commands.  Someone else may have a much more elegant solution than this.\nsudo ifdown eth0\nsudo ifup wlan0\n\nreversing this of course to get back to your ethernet:\nsudo ifdown wlan0\nsudo ifup eth0\n\n\nA: You could spoof the MAC address of the ethernet device onto the WiFi one. Sounds hard but there's a MAC address box in the Network Manager configuration that makes this a doddle. You can get your current ethernet MAC from the same screens or through ifconfig -a.\nThis should mean that when you connect, dhclient will send the same host and MAC to the DHCP server and you should get the same IP.\nThis could be catastrophic if you connect both at once though. Don't do that.\n", "Q: Learning material for boot configuration I really need a comprehensive, yet clearly explained reference regarding how all the boot configuration, structure and execution comes together in Linux and how it is compared to Windows and all the nuts and bolts of the multiple boot mode in terms of boot loader installation, re-installation and configuration. I'm just sick of loosing gigs of data because of lack of essential knowledge so any links/references will be appreciated! \nbest regards,\nMike\n\nA: UEFI boot: how does that actually work, then? is still a good read for understanding UEFI. Even if you don't have a UEFI capable machine, start with this article.\nAfter that you can read through and compare the articles on EFI and BIOS as well as Windows NT startup process and Linux startup process. The UEFI article on the Arch Wiki is a good cheat sheet to look up how to do certain things, but remember that some of these are Arch specific, but as Arch intents to teach users how configuration is done, this isn't bad, just lenghty. \nI completely agree with Rinzwind's comment: make and verify backups!\n", "Q: Use different desktop theme for Ubuntu Software Center I'm using the Evolve theme for Ubuntu and I'm happy with it.\nAll applications work well with this theme except one, Ubuntu Software Center. The text is not readable with this theme (white text on light grey background).\nEvery time I need to use USC I have to change the theme and then change it back.\nIs it possible to tell Ubuntu to use the Ambiance theme for USC only?\nI tried adding env GTK_THEME=\"Ambiance\" to the exec line in the .desktop file but it didn't have any effect whatsoever.\n\nA: Why not change the background-color of Ubuntu Software Center to a darker one, (which I did as well - works perfectly fine). To do so, simply edit/modify itemview-background.png, see full path below and make sure to backup the untempered image-file:\n/usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/art/itemview-background.png\n\nOr change the color-value for [text+shadow argument] of the visible drawn text in USC to a darker one, see path below: (didn't looked deeper into it, but it is somewhere in softwarecenter.css and/or softwarecenter.highcontrastinverse.css)\n/usr/share/software-center/ui/gtk3/css\n\n\nA: The theme is set by a setting in dconf - you can get the current setting with:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme\n\nSo you could create a simple script to workaround your problem and change the theme, then open software center, and change the theme back when software center has closed:\n#!/bin/bash\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 'Ambiance'\nsoftware-center $1\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 'Evolve'\nexit\n\nYou can save this in your home directory in a file called 'open-software-center', then make it executable by setting it in the file's properties, or by running this in terminal:\nchmod +x ./open-software-center\n\nYou can then run ./open-software-center in terminal, or the command thing that opens when you press Alt+F2\nI don't of a way that would change the theme for just one window... but it would be interesting if someone had an answer for that.\n", "Q: Problem with ubuntu Installtion I have tried twice to install Ubuntu 14.04 using a live DVD on my laptop HP Pavilion zv600. Twice after taking too much time for  installation it reaches a point where I get the following msg:\n ... source error ID 134107 was not found when attempting to remove it ...\n\nI am stuck. Any insights would be appreciated.\n\nA: The DVDs are slow and old type of media you should use USB flash stick to install ubuntu, in your case the error is because of some broken files in DVD due to some burning problmes . All you have to do is to burn ubuntu.iso image into your empty usb stick and that's it you can try ubuntu without installing and can also install ubuntu into your system 4 times faster than DVD drives. To Burn iso file in usb you will need a software named pendrivelinux , you can get more details here or here\n\nA: The issue here is not whether to boot from DVD or USB. Its about making sure that your installation media is not corrupted. Always check whether your bootable media free of errors. To do so, after you boot your Live media (DVD or USB), make sure to 'Check drive For errors' before proceeding with installation. The tests ensure that you don't actually have a corrupt bootable media via which you are trying to install your Ubuntu.\n", "Q: RTL8723AE not connecting to Netgear WGT624 on Ubuntu 14.04 I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit on my computer and have been unable to connect to my wireless network on Netgear WGT624 with WPA2-PSK [AES] encryption.

They way my network is setup right now is that I got a modem which is hooked up to my router which goes to all the computers in the house. But here's the problem, I don't want my server to have the same Public IP as my other computers in my house.\nI've achived this before by using another old router i got and hooking it into the modem which got 10 ports, and this gave me a different Public IP. This would work perfectly for me if it wasn't that the router is pretty bad so it slows down the speed of the internet with a great amount.\nSo my guesses are to do something like to put my Server directly into the modem and not use any router at all and use some sort of program on the Server, or use some kind of setting on my router (asus RT-AC66U).\nThose are my guesses but I really don't know how to do it, so any help would be really nice! But if there isn't any way of doing this I could get another router, but I don't feel like spending extra money on a router good enough to handle 100/100 mb/s.\nIf there are any more info that I forgot needed please point it out in the comments! Thanks!\n\nA: If you want both your server and your router (with the rest of your computers behind the router) to be \"directly\" plugged into the modem, then you don't need another router, but an ethernet switch (also called \"hub\" although technically a switch and a hub are different). This will be cheaper than a full-blown router, and also faster. To the modem, it will seem like both the server and the router are connected directly.\nJust be sure that your modem is OK with having two devices connected; some providers allow only one device to be connected to the modem, if a second device is plugged in, it won't get an IP address.\n+-------+        +------+        +------------+                 \n|       |        |      |        |            |                 \n|       |        |      +--------+server      |                 \n|       |        |      |        +--- --------+                 \n|modem  +--------+switch|                               +------+\n|       |        |      +---+    +-----------+          |      |\n|       |        |      |   |    |           |    +-----+PC    |\n+-------+        +------+   |    |           +----+     |      |\n                            +----+           |          +------+\n                                 | router    |                  \n                                 |           +----+     +------+\n                                 +----++-----+    |     |      |\n                                      ++          +-----+      |\n                                                        | PC   |\n                                                        +------+\n\n\nA: The modem already has a switch in it (since it has 10 ports). So you can plug the server directly into it and (if your ISP is giving out public IPs like that) it should get and IP just like your router would. The only reason to have a router is for the extra layer of security that it offers.\n", "Q: Is there any Java decompiler GUI I am using Eclipse, and just lost some important .java files from Ubuntu 14.04.

They may be in ~/.darkcoin or ~/.config/darkcoin (or similarly-named folders).\nTo remove the build dependencies, run sudo apt-get purge qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libssl-dev libdb++-dev libminiupnpc-dev followed by sudo apt-get autoremove. If you know you use any of the build dependencies listed in other software, remove it from this list.\n", "Q: Laptop Overheats Running Ubuntu 14.04 I recently installed 14.04 on my Toshiba Satellite 305D. \nIt has an AMD Athlon X2 Duel-core and 2GB of ram with Radeon 3100. I know she's not much, but I'm a Peace Corps Volunteer living in West Africa and she's all I got.\nIt's been overheating super quickly and shutting itself down. I've had this trouble with Ubuntu before but it's a bit worse this time round. I duel-boot Windows 7 and never have this trouble with it. I imagine it may be something wrong with recognizing my graphics, but I can't find any good advice about what exactly to do about that.\nAdmittedly, I'm an Ubuntu noob. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I'm also using a Toshiba Satellite model and had laptop heating issues recently. I suspected it was due to CPU running at very high speeds. I installed the indicator-cpufreq that allows you to set your CPU profile and almost always kept it in powersave mode (It gives you an indicator in the top ubuntu panel):\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nSince then, not only was my heating problem solved, but the fan noise also disappeared as a bonus!\n\nA: In addition to using ìndicator-cpufreq to switch to a lower performance CPU profile, you can try your luck with thermald, which is a daemon that prevents machines from overheating and was introduced in 14.04. Install by:\nsudo apt-get install thermald\n\nAfter install you either have to start the daemon manually or just reboot. You can find more information on thermald for instance here or there.\nI'm using thermald successfully on an i5 Core ThinkPad, which apparently did not use all available fans by default, and was randomly shutting down without thermald due to overheating.\n\nA: You can also use tlp, but it is little advanced\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw\n\nThinkPads require an additional:\nsudo apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms acpi-call-dkms\n\nwhat you can do with tlp ?\nProcessor and Frequency Scaling(you can set whether your laptop runs\n    in powersaver or performance or ondemand mode. also you can allow\n    whether your processor uses turbo boost or not)and much more, visit the official page (link above)\n\nA: you need to clean it up \nhere\nor you can limit your CPU usage this is how\nlimit cpu usage\nI suggest the cleaning it's the best solution\n\nA: Uninstall Adobe Flash Player or make its plugins'(shockwaveflash) in browsers \"ask to activate\" . \nThis will solve restart / shutdown while viewing videos in Youtube.com. Youtube will use HTML5 Player instead.\nNote : Random shutdown of Ubuntu happened for me daily on youtube videos and flash player games (chesscube.com).\nI tried CPU frequency powersave mode, thermald, tlp, etc., in Ubuntu 16.04 and always kept Ubuntu updated. Cleaned fan vents. None stopped random shutdown.\nIn past few weeks had no random shutdown or restarts in Ubuntu 16.04 after making Adobe Flash Player inactive. Also not had any shutdown while using Adobe Flash Player in Firefox through WINE for long hours\nI am using Intel® Pentium(R) CPU B960 @ 2.20GHz × 2 Processor and Intel® Sandybridge Mobile Graphics.\nI read that Adobe releases updates for Flash Player for Linux only in respect of security updates and has stopped Flash Player development for Linux years ago. See below link\nAdobe will stop releasing new versions of Flash - what will happen to flash support in Ubuntu?\n", "Q: Remove previous ID from Skype I am very new to Ubuntu.\nWhen I installed Skype I used an old Id but I have a newer one that is exactly the same as my hotmail email. Every time I open Skype it is opened with the older ID but I would like to change this.\nI can open another instance by using skype --secondary but I would like to remove the first one because I want to Lock to Launcher with the newer ID.\nI read some forums telling about deleting the  ./Skype folder but I don't know which folder that is.\n\nA: It's .Skype, a hidden folder in the home directory. \nHit ctrl+h to reveal hidden folders, or run rm -r .Skype in a terminal window to remove it.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 20.04:\nrm -r ~/.config/skypeforlinux/Local\\ Storage\n\n", "Q: nvidia driver problems with EDID I have EDID problems with proprietary NVIDIA drivers in Ubuntu 14.04.

The preinstalled programs work fine, but anything that I download from Ubuntu Software Center such as Pidgin or Chromium or from online runs (I can hear the sounds of Pidgin) but don't display when opened.\nWhen I do an alt+tab, I can see a thumbnail of the GUI but can't do anything\nWhen I run them from the terminal, I get the following messages:\nChromium - ATTENTION: default value of option force_s3tc_enable overridden by environment.\nPidgin - Exiting because another libpurple client is already running.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem after upgrading. I went to System Settings\\Screen Display and found that the upgrade process had dug up some old dual monitor config from ages ago and enabled a monitor that was no longer connected. Once I disabled that the apps appeared on my actual monitor. \n", "Q: CIFS VFS: Error messages I'm running two Ubuntu systems, (12.04 on 64-bit AMD desktop system and 14.04 on a 64-bit Intel laptop), and have configured two CIFS drives to be mounted at system start-up following the instructions at \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountWindowsSharesPermanently\nI've configured these drives using the following entries in /etc/fstab:\n//gbsfp1/kgallant /home/kgallant/nethome cifs credentials=/etc/samba/credentials,rw,iocharset=utf8,_netdev,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\n//gbsfp1/share /home/kgallant/netshare cifs credentials=/etc/samba/credentials,rw,iocharset=utf8,_netdev,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0\n\nBoth drives are always successfully mounted by the time I log in on either machine yet a series of error messages are always reported during system boot that say:\nJul  4 10:52:07 gbsdt1 kernel: [   20.976113] CIFS VFS: Error connecting to socket. Aborting operation\nJul  4 10:52:07 gbsdt1 kernel: [   20.976509] CIFS VFS: cifs_mount failed w/return code = -101\n\nThese messages are repeated five to ten times in syslog and, in the case of the 14.04 machine, on the screen during system boot.  It appears that both systems are attempting to mount the drives before network services are initialized which I believe is the root cause of the problem.  Documentation suggests that the _netdev option would prevent this, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on either the 12.04 or 14.04 systems.\nThe network drives are provided by a Samba server running on a Fedora 14 machine.\nIs there any way to delay mounting these file systems until after network services are available, (if, as I suspect, that is the cause of the problem)?  Or any other suggestions would be appreciated.\nThanks in advance!\n\nOutput of ls /etc/rc*.d/\n/etc/rc0.d:\n\nK01nxserver\nK09apache2\nK10unattended-upgrades\nK20osspd\nK20speech-dispatcher\nK20xrdp\nK21postgresql\nREADME\nS20sendsigs\nS30urandom\nS31umountnfs.sh\nS35networking\nS40umountfs\nS60umountroot\nS90halt\n\n/etc/rc1.d:\nK01nxserver\nK09apache2\nK20acpi-support\nK20kerneloops\nK20osspd\nK20saned\nK20speech-dispatcher\nK20xrdp\nK21postgresql\nREADME\nS30killprocs\nS70dns-clean\nS70pppd-dns\nS90single\n\n/etc/rc2.d:\nREADME\nS19postgresql\nS20kerneloops\nS20osspd\nS20speech-dispatcher\nS20xrdp\nS50rsync\nS50saned\nS70dns-clean\nS70pppd-dns\nS75sudo\nS91apache2\nS99acpi-support\nS99grub-common\nS99nxserver\nS99ondemand\nS99rc.local\n\n/etc/rc3.d:\nREADME\nS19postgresql\nS20kerneloops\nS20osspd\nS20speech-dispatcher\nS20xrdp\nS50rsync\nS50saned\nS70dns-clean\nS70pppd-dns\nS75sudo\nS91apache2\nS99acpi-support\nS99grub-common\nS99nxserver\nS99ondemand\nS99rc.local\n\n/etc/rc4.d:\nREADME\nS19postgresql\nS20kerneloops\nS20osspd\nS20speech-dispatcher\nS20xrdp\nS50rsync\nS50saned\nS70dns-clean\nS70pppd-dns\nS75sudo\nS91apache2\nS99acpi-support\nS99grub-common\nS99nxserver\nS99ondemand\nS99rc.local\n\n/etc/rc5.d:\nREADME\nS19postgresql\nS20kerneloops\nS20osspd\nS20speech-dispatcher\nS20xrdp\nS50rsync\nS50saned\nS70dns-clean\nS70pppd-dns\nS75sudo\nS91apache2\nS99acpi-support\nS99grub-common\nS99nxserver\nS99ondemand\nS99rc.local\n\n/etc/rc6.d:\nK01nxserver\nK09apache2\nK10unattended-upgrades\nK20osspd\nK20speech-dispatcher\nK20xrdp\nK21postgresql\nREADME\nS20sendsigs\nS30urandom\nS31umountnfs.sh\nS35networking\nS40umountfs\nS60umountroot\nS90reboot\n\n/etc/rcS.d:\nREADME\nS25brltty\nS37apparmor\nS55urandom\nS70x11-common\n\n\nA: On the solution:\nIn fstab, it'll never work to your satisfaction as you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*No errors in dmesg\n\n*The shares to be mounted before log-in.\n\n\nI see two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Autofs instead of fstab as Autofs allows you to automatically mount directories on an as-needed basis thus allowing you to manage changes more easily afterwards then the next solution.\n\n*Create a custom upstart script and put it in init.d/rc6.d\nThis is the real solution, used for servers that mount nfs volumes, but it'll require you to get your hands dirty, understanding the Linux init process (\"boot process\" in non-*nix speak)\n\n\nLet me know which path you want to take, or just accept this as an answer if the above is already enough to point you in the right direction.\n", "Q: Remap menu key to delta (Δ)? I'm using Xubuntu 14.04. My keyboard is a Belgian AZERTY. I never use my menu key, and I use the delta sign a lot. I'm not willing to switch keyboard layouts to Greek, as the delta is the only thing I use. I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xmodmap, but that didn't work as it isn't compatible anymore, someone told me.\n\n*A combination of Xbindkeys and Xte\n\n\nI've put this in my .xbindkeysrc file:\n\"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'keydown Shift_L' 'key u' 'key agrave' 'key quotedbl' 'key ccedilla' 'key apostrophe' 'keyup Control_L' 'keyup Shift_L'\"\nMenu\n\nThis didn't do anything, even after restarting, except that I can't use the menu key anymore (I intended to do that, but it had to type a delta too.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding the Xte command above as a keyboard shortcut. Didn't work, again, except stopping the menu key from doing its normal job. Note: the command does type a delta for me if I enter it in the terminal, it's just not working as a keyboard shortcut.\nAny other ways to do this, or things I am do wrong? And how can I do this with Xkb, because I have no clue and it seems to be Xmodmap's replacement?\n\nA: Well, I saw the Belgian AZERTY keyboard. It has four full levels, so I tried to find a way to define DELTA on the menu key. It’s easy. Let’s do this in steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the layout file for editing. To do this you can open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and enter the command:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/be\n\n*Define DELTA for the MENU key. Just insert the following line somewhere in the block \"basic\", for example in line 42 just before include \"level3(ralt_switch)\":\nkey <MENU>  { [Greek_DELTA ] };\n\nThen, save and close the file.\n\n*Return to the terminal and run the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data.\n\n*Just log out, or if you have more than one layout just change the layout once.\nNow you can insert “Δ” with MENU.\n", "Q: Burg bootloader Ubuntu 14.04 Hello I'm a relatively new ubuntu user and I'm having some trouble with the burg bootloader.

Since doing so, I cannot get my Sierra Wireless Air Card 313u to connect. Since this unit worked fine in the previous LTS version, I believe the issue is either with 14.04 or with my upgrade.\nPreviously, I would use this usb air card as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prior to plugging in the aircard, in the past version, there would be no \"Enable Mobile Broadband\" option in the networking drop down menu.\n\n*When the air card is plugged in, after it boots and there is a blinking green light on the dongle indicating that it is communicating with the network, the \"Enable Mobile Broadband\" menu item would appear and I would check it. Afer several seconds, a notification would appear on the laptop screen indicating that I am now \"registered on the GSM Network.\"\n\n*I would then select the \"AT&T LaptopConnect (Data Cards) selection on the drop down menu, and I would receive a notice that I was connected to the network through that connection.\nSince upgrading to 14.04:\n\n\n*\n\n*I plug in the air card as before. There is an \"Enable Mobile Broadband\" option on the drop down menu as before. Note that my \"AT&T LaptopConnect\" connection is also present, and not grayed out as it used to be under the previous version.\n\n*If I check \"Enable Mobile Broadband,\" after several seconds I get the notification \"Mobile Broadband enabled - you are now registered on the home network.\"\n\n*If I then click on \"AT&T Laptop Connect\" the network icon will indicate activity, but then I receive the notice \"Modem disconnected\"\n\n*At this point, there is no longer an entry in the drop down menu for the \"AT&T Laptop Connect\" connection, and the \"Mobile Broadband\" entry is unchecked again.\nI have tried bypassing the step of checking \"Enable Mobile Broadband\" and going straight to the step of selecting the \"AT&T LaptopConnect\" connection, and the results are the same.\nI have tried building a new connection for the AT&T modem, with the same results when I use it.\nI have confirmed that there is an entry for what I believe to be the modem when I query lsusb in a terminal.\nI have confirmed that the connection, with a uuid, is present by using the nmcli connection command.\nI do not recall having to use any proprietary drivers for this modem, but I'm wondering if perhaps there was a driver that got wiped out during the recent upgrade to 14.04?\nFrom research on this and other forums, there appears to be considerable comment concerning mobile broadband and 14.04. Is there an issue here? \nIf not, what can I do to be able to use the modem again?\n\nA: After two weeks of frustrating searching, research and reading, I have managed to repair the problem. The issue appears to be the new version of modem-manager installed on upgrading to Trusty. \nSince I knew the modem had worked under previous releases of Ubuntu, I figured if I could downgrade just the one package (modem-manager) I might stand a chance of getting a working Sierra Wireless 313u again. Sure enough, this worked. Here are the steps I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Synaptic, since it allows forced downgrades and locking versions\n\n*add the repository for Precise Pangolin back into Synaptic sources, since this LTS release of Ubuntu is still supported the the repositories would be easily accessible (also, the modem had worked under Precise).\n\n*Use Synaptic to force installation of Modem-manager 0.5.2.0-0Ubuntu2, which is the Precise version of the package.\n\n*Use Synaptic to lock this version in place, and prevent an upgrade to the newer, non-working version of Modem-manager (the new version, in Trusty, is 1.0.0-2Ubuntu1)\n\n\nAs quickly as this was done, the normal functioning and use of the Sierra 313u broadband modem was restored. \n", "Q: Ownership on USB drive correct but read/write permisisons denied I am really at a loss with this problem.

However I find this error to be quite annoying.\nI hope this post helps someone.\n\nA: Your file doesn't start with #!/bin/bash, it starts with the three-byte sequence 357 273 277 (where each byte is typed out in octal; that's ef bb bf in the more usual hexadecimal) is the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE. Do note the distinction between character endoding (a correspondence between characters or sequence of characters and sequences of bytes, such as UTF-8) and character set (a correspondence between characters and their representation, such as Unicode), because it's important here.\nThe character U+FEFF is also called byte-order mark (BOM). This character is used at the beginning of text files encoded in UTF-16. UTF-16 uses a representation based on units of two bytes, and the bytes inside each unit can be in either order: big-endian or little-endian (it just has to be consistent inside one text file). The BOM character is used to indicate the endianness of a file encoded in UTF-16 (the symmetric character U+FFFE is purposefully unassigned, so the first two bytes can only be valid in one of the two possible endiannesses).\nThe BOM interpretation of U+FEFF only makes sense in encodings that have a byte order, such as UTF-16. The UTF-8 encoding has no concept of byte order, since characters are encoded in a (variable-size) byte sequence with a well-defined order. Therefore in UTF-8 the byte sequence ef bb bf is just the character U+FEFF which is just another non-ASCII Unicode character.\nBash, like many other programs, treats all non-ASCII characters as ordinary characters that can appear in strings. For bash, strings include bare words. This has the advantage that bash can work with input in any encoding as long as that encoding is a superset of ASCII, i.e. characters in the ASCII set are encoded as one byte with their ASCII encoding value. UTF-8 is such an encoding. U+FEFF is a zero-width space, and is thus invisible to humans, but it's visible to programs. Programs that interpret their input in Unicode might treat it as a whitespace character, but programs that interpret their input as ASCII plus meaningless non-ASCII characters don't.\nIn your file, bash sees an initial sequence of 14 bytes which it parses as ordinary characters: ef bb bf 23 21 2f 62 69 6e 2f 62  61 73 68. The first three encode a U+FEFF in the UTF-8 encoding; bash's parser doesn't care about the encoding and treats them as three ordinary characters. The fourth character # is not a comment-start character because it is not at the beginning of a word. The resulting 14-character word is interpreted as a command name, and there is no command by that name.\nShell scripts, like most other program text, must be written in an encoding that's compatible with ASCII. Make sure that your editor doesn't add spurious characters such as carriage returns before newlines (the Windows encoding of line endings, but Unix programs treat the carriage return as an ordinary character) or U+FEFF at the beginning. U+FEFF is a byte-order mark only at the beginning of a file encoded in UTF-16 anyway; when it's used at the beginning of a file encoded in UTF-8, it's just a useless space at the beginning. If an editor adds U+FEFF at the beginning of a file in UTF-8, that's a bug.\n\nIn addition to all of this, a shebang line is not useful at the top of .bashrc. While it doesn't cause any harm (the harm here was because you didn't actually have a valid shebang line), it's spurious and potentially confusing. That file is never executed as a standalone script.\n\nA: Solved the problem by making a backup for .bashrc:\nmv .bashrc ..bashrc\n# recreating .bashrc:\ntouch .bashrc\n$ bash # returns no errors !!!\n\nAfter editing the .bashrc file with vim, this is its contents:\nhead -n2 .bashrc | od -c\n0000000   #   !   /   b   i   n   /   e   c   h   o       \"   T   e   s\n0000020   t   \"  \\n\n\nThe culprit seem to have been the three invisible characters at the beginning of my .bashrc: \"357 273 277\". At first I thought these characters belong in my .bashrc file, so I left them there. It will take a while to find which one of my editors corrupts files in this way.\nI hope this post helps someone.\n", "Q: Edimax EW-7622UMn wireless installation Ubuntu 14.04 Hello good people of the Ubuntu universe I'm stuck installing drivers for a Edimax EW-7622UMn I have extracted the tar-tgz file but have no idea what I need to type in to Terminal.

In brief, the problem I seem to be having is that apt-get \"ignores\" whatever PPA I add. I assume that this is because the respective PPA's limit their debs to i386 and AMD64 builds. (I'm using armhf.) This causes a problem though. I'd like to use \"apt-get source -b\" to build the respective debs. However, even when enabling the PPA's deb-src repository, apt-cache policy still doesn't \"find\" the respective packages. I'm forced to download the packages, configure/make/checkinstall. \nAm I correct in thinking I should be able to compile these packages on arm via \"apt-get source -b\"?  If so, how do I force ubuntu to load these repositories? That is, how do I stop apt-get from \"IGN\"oring these PPAs?\n\nA: Okay, I've tried this method and it works. :-) For the next person who stumbles on this: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:(name of PPA)\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture amd64\nsudo apt-get update\napt-cache policy (package name) #Just to make sure it's there \nsudo apt-get source -b (package name) \nsudo dpkg --remove-architecture amd64 #Do this whether the package compiles correctly or not\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAt this point, if the package didn't compile due to missing dependencies, it's safe to install them (that is, there's no chance they will be drawn from the wrong architecture/repository). They shouldn't anyway, but this is insurance.\nsudo apt-get source -b (package name) #if necessary\n\nOnce you've successfully compiled, look for the armhf deb file in your current directory (the folder you've been working in) and: sudo dpkg -i (package name).deb.\nSo... there may be a more elegant way to accomplish this, but I leave that to more knowledgeable users.\nNote: Packages installed this way will not update automatically.

One of my daughters wants to join the legions of people streaming to Twitch. However, we all have Ubuntu laptops. I've done some research and there seems to be a lot of discussion about it with possible soltuions. Since it doesn't seem to be a unique situation, have any of you made it work? Is it possible? Would I be better off having her run minecraft in virtualbox and doing it that way? Or maybe just do youtube? I'm open to suggestions.\n\nA: If you are using Minecraft, it is far better to stream using the built-in Twitch streamer. You can find settings for this by going into the Streaming settings by entering the Pause menu and selecting the Options menu. In this, you will see a Streaming Settings button. Click that.\nAlso note that you need to link your Mojang account to your Twitch account by going to their web site.\nAlso, most importantly, don't steal my subs!\n\nA: OBS-studio is slowly getting usable on Linux, but only if you have Nvidia graphics.

It requires some finagling in Pulseaudio to have both game audio and voice on the stream, but it can be fairly well automated with a shell script.\nLaptops are also going to be hard-pressed to stream, whether in Linux or Windows.

I'm on a slow broadband connection and I do not want to download all the packages again that I installed on the debian installation. Is there any way around so that the new Ubuntu installation installs/clones the previous package files of the debian installation?\n\nA: On the old installation run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install dpkg-repack fakeroot\n&& sudo mkdir ~/dpkg-repack; cd ~/dpkg-repack && sudo fakeroot -u dpkg-repack dpkg --get-selections | grep install | cut -f1\nthat will put all packages into a folder in your home folder called \"dpkg-repack\". Copy that to the home folder on your new installation and run \nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nto install every one that is compatible, then just update the packages normally to resolve incompatibilities. Very few applications are actually recoded for the new releases, @syfluqs, so the two or three out of over 300 are just maybe a couple of drivers or one or two core applications that are installed anyway during normal installation, and are thus not downgraded to the old version\n\nA: Copy .deb packages from cache to ubuntu's cache (/var/cache/apt/archives). Use dpkg-repack to make .deb from installed data. Either copy it to cache or make a package cd using aptoncd and add that to software sources.\n", "Q: Apport error reporting privacy issues As apport is enabled by default since 12.04 I thought it would be important to get some much needed clarifications on certain privacy questions that have been bugging me.\n\n\n*\n\n*How paranoid is apport about potentially sending sensitive information to a remote server? If I'm not mistaken it used to be pretty paranoid because it insisted on asking the user's confirmation for sending things like logs which might contain the usually harmless host name, but I went over the files in /var/crash/ and found loads and loads of data containing not only the host name but even core dumps (the \"CoreDump\" name which precedes a blob of data in one of those files) which could potentially reveal - if I'm not mistaken - any password that has ever been used on a computer (depending on circumstances, of course).\n\n*Can I assume that all logs found in /var/crash/ have been sent to Canonical \"as is\" - that is, as found in that directory, including the core dumps?\n\n*Oftentimes I experienced some crashes which resulted in a window asking me whether I want to send a report to Canonical, a window that had a button titled \"Report problem...\" but with no checkbox for allowing the user to inspect the information being sent. When pressing the button I expected to be presented with a follow-up dialog showing what is being sent (because of the \"...\" present in the caption of the button). However, no such follow up dialog appeared which leads me to my final question: what happened when I pressed that button? What is actually being sent to Canonical, if anything?\n\nA: Regardless the error reporting system, Apport or other, there are privacy concerns. This does not mean that sensitive information will always exist in an error report.\nWhy (long answer): the goal of error reporting is to gather information about the user failure-inducing execution in order to help developers to find its causes. Depending on the mechanism used, such information can come in many forms: memory dumps, log entries, etc. But anyway the goal is to transform such information into steps to reproduce the user execution that ended in failure. Therefore, if the application you were using deals with sensitive information, e.g. you were using your text editor to edit a confidential document, a mail client to exchange private messages, or some other application that involves credentials or credit card info, then such sensitive information may end up in memory dumps or in log entries.\nWhy (short answer): If you insert your data (sensitive or not) in the application and it fails, then the steps-to-reproduce your failure-inducing execution is your data -> likely to end up in the error report.\nTherefore, my advice is not to authorize the transmission when your data is somehow sensitive. It should be fine otherwise and we should help developers to fix the problem by transmitting it.\n", "Q: IcedTea plugin for OpenJDK 8 I updated from OpenJDK 7 to 8.

It showed a message that no partition found. I am pretty sure it was not grub partition. I also do not know grub commands . please help. I somehow reinstalled Ubuntu.  \n\nA: If you deleted the partition that the only OS was on, then it would give you that error, or if you deleted the \"boot\" partition and did not run update-grub on the main disk. You need to reinstall ubuntu at this point and set the main disk itself as the device for bootloader installation, keeping the /boot partition on the same disk as the system, or create boot on a separate partition and don't touch it unless you are specifically adding files, or are wiping the OS off. It seems, from your post, that you have deleted the main partition the OS was on. If you can get a grub-rescue disk burned and are able to locate and boot into your Ubuntu installation, then simply run \"sudo update-grub /dev/sda\" and reboot, that is if it was simply an old installation that you deleted, causing grub on the mbr to throw that error.

So far the installation is going fine, but now I need to set partitions for different sections of Ubuntu, which are Swap, /, /home and /boot.\nI have reserved 70 GB of free space on the external HDD to install Ubuntu. It's just to experiment with, I will not be installing loads of files on it. Now I am wondering what sizes each partition will have to be. Using Windows and Mac OS X, you just press format and you can chuck the OS in the partition. This is a bit more advanced and I want to make sure I don't mess up. I am told for Swap it is recommended to do 1.5 to 2 times the size of your RAM.\nI have 8 GB of RAM in my laptop, so how should I distribute the 70 GB over these four partitions?\nThanks folks.\n\nA: For swap, with that amount of ram, just use 8gb for hibernation as the swap partition, you don't need more. For /, use ~30gb, and the rest as home, but you could also just partition 62 as / and not have a separate /home partition, and just not have to deal with it. That you need 2 times your ram for swap is a relic from the day that computers routinely had less than 2gb or ram, for 2-4gb it should be ~1.5 times the ram, but anything over 4 it can be the same if not less if you do not plan on going into hibernation\n", "Q: Fontconfig error: cannot load default config file Having issues when I start most graphical programs.

This hard codes the paths where it looks for various files.  The fontconfig your program is linked to is not configured correctly.  Fontconfig should be configured like this:\n./configure --enable-static --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var\n\nThis will make fontconfig look for fonts.conf in /etc/fonts instead of /data/jenkins/pms-deps-universal/BUILD_TAG/linux-ubuntu-i686/output/pms-depends-linux-ubuntu-i686-release-8400c3b/etc/fonts.\n\nA: You need to set the $FONTCONFIG_PATH properly.

Should I 'merge' this into a single call to debmirror (i.e. append all of the 'release' options into a single comma separated list)?\nWhat I am doing reflects how I have done this sort of thing for CentOS, but Ubuntu seems different, in that there are not actually separate trees of package files for different releases and different parts of the release (eg base OS, updates, contrib, extra, etc.) -- it is all 'munged' together, with the repository metadata being used to sort things out.\nAny useful advice?\n\nA: I think you should use apt-mirror for this. It features a much simpler configuration (similar to  /etc/apt/sources.list). Then, at the end of the each mirror, where you put the main,multiverse, etc., mention only those sections you want. I think main, universe, etc. are the Debian-derivative parallels of base, contrib, etc. apt-mirror also installs a cron entry, so you only have to uncomment it for the mirror to be updated regularly. You can also choose to add or ignore the -updates, -backports, and -proposed sections.\n", "Q: apt-get loop for ppa's I recently wanted to install e17 on ubuntu 12.04. I first tried to use the ppa ~ hannes-janetzek / enlightenment-svn and it did not work for me, because it did not all packages (econnman), I kept searching and found efl /trunk if it contains all packages. By switching the ppa, I uninstall e17 and tried, after, reinstalling, but while install the new package they conflicted with some packages that were not deleted, particularly libefl libefl-bin, but now does not allow me to delete them until repair the last package. \nIn other words, I can't repare the new package, because I need to delete the old packages, and I can't remove the old packages, because I need repair the new package\nI need to delete \"libefl\" and \"libefl-bin\" without apply apt-get -f install, and after this, use apt-get -f install\nHelp me please\n\nA: You should use the ppa-purge program to remove PPAs. I think you'll have to first add the PPAs back, do an apt-get update. Reinstall any packages you removed from the PPA. Use dpkg if necessary. See if packages are still in conflict. If not, install ppa-purge and use it to remove the PPA:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge <ppa-name>\n\nwhere the PPA name is the same as that which you gave to add-apt-repository. This will downgrade all affected packages to versions available without the PPA. You can do so manually, but it's too much of a pain.\n\nA: In order to remove \"libefl\" and \"libefl-bin\" without using apt-get I used:\nsudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq libefl-bin\nafter remove one by one with this command, I can use:\napt-get -f install\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on Samsung Can i install Ubuntu on a samsung GT-M3710, it doesn't have android, it has SHP.\nThank you very much.\n\nA: Samsung GT-M3710 is not officially supported and looking at the hardware of your phone its seems reasonably difficult pursuit to install Ubuntu touch.

Till today I was using ubuntu 13.04 in my windows7/ubuntu dual boot. Just now I have upgraded to ubuntu 14.04. My software updater showed an updates available message. I proceeded with  Install Now . Soon I got the following window.\n\nThen I tried sudo apt-get clean as recommended. Nothing happened! Not even a window opened. Teach me deleting the temporary packages. \nDeleting temporary files may not be highly helpful in case of further updates and installs for I don't have too much space left in my /. I wanna extend my / partition with the help of the unallocated space in my HD. The following is my Gparted window.   \n\nI got an answer here. But it wasn't useful for me. I had two choices. But the answer wasn't working for both my chioces.\nChoice 1: I may use the 4.25 GiB unallocated space to extend my /dev/sda10. To do so, I must need to move my linux-swap partition. But my Resize/Move option is disabled for the linux-swap partition. Choice 1 failed! \nChoice 2: I may use the 14.35 GiB unallocated space instead. In this case I must move more than one partition. /dev/sda4  partition is the first on the list. Even that partition has the same problem. Resize/Move option is disabled. Choice 2 failed!\nI am out of choices now.\nWhat shall I do? Help me to extend my / with Gparted.     \n\nA: You can't modify the systems's partitions (and parent extended partitons, like /dev/sda4) when the system is using them - so you need to modify the partitions from outside the system - the Ubuntu install disk should do for that. So first you need to boot from the disk, and open GParted.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the partitions have a key next to them, they are in use - you need to right click on them and select unmount.\n\n*For the actual re-sizing, there are two fairly easy things you should be able to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Extend the extended partition /dev/sda4 to end of the disk, move the swap partition to the right, then expand the /dev/sda10 partition.\n\n*Reduce the size of the /dev/sda9 /home partition, and  , then expand the /dev/sda10 partition.\nThough moving all the partitions in /dev/sda4 to left, then moving the swap and expanding the partition, should work as well.\nThough it is possible to have a running system with 5~GB of space in the / partition, it is likely to work better with at least 7-10GB of space.\nAs you should always do, you should backup your data before doing anything. Also, ss you are only using 4GB on the installed Ubuntu system, you could back this up elsewhere and do a fresh install, which means the packages from the old system won't be using space.\n\nA: You actually can use the 4.25 GiB at the end without any reboot, because Linux supports on-line partition resizing since kernel 2.6 (meaning you can resize partitions while they're mounted, even the root partition, without any reboot).\nI'll show you how to remove the swap partition and extend the root partition with all the free space at the end. Then I'll use the unallocated space in the beginning (14.35 GiB) for a new swap partition. Of course 14.35 GiB is a bit much so you can also choose to use some to extend your NTFS partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open GParted\n\n\n*Right click on /dev/sda11 and select Swapoff\n\n\n*Right click on /dev/sda11 and select Delete\n\n\n*Click on Apply All Operations\n\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n\n*Extend the root partition:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda10\n\n\n\n*Go back to GParted\n\n\n*Open the GParted menu and click on Refresh Devices\n\n\n*Right click on the unallocated space and select New\n\n\n*Select linux-swap as file system\n\n\n*Click on Add\n\n\n*Click on Apply All Operations\n\nInitially I wrote this using the command line only, but then I decided to try to use GParted as much as possible as this may be easier for you to see what's going on. You may even extend the root partition using GParted. But you need to unmount your root partition before you work on it. I mean you should work offline (using a liveUSB). In some cases your grub may get damaged. So do reinstall your grub before you leave out from your offline working.\nI believe GParted will automatically enable the new swap partition but I'm not sure. You can always check by right clicking on it and then selecting Swapon. If this option is not available the swap partitions is probably already enabled.\nAlso the Refresh Devices step is probably unnecessary, but you should follow it just to be sure.\nWe cannot resize the extended partition (sda4, in this case) as it has a mounted logical partition within it. So we need to boot into the live mode of an Ubuntu USB/CD drive. From there, start GParted, turn off swap if necessary, right click on the extended partition and resize it to suit your needs. Then, follow the steps mentioned as needed to resize root and add back swap. In the event that your root partition UUID gets changed, you can update Grub by executing these steps in the live mode:\nsudo mount /dev/sda10 /mnt \nsudo mount -o bind /dev/ /mnt/dev \nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda \nsudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash \n# Now within the chroot\nsudo update-grub\nexit\n# Now outside chroot\n\nThe first couple of commands mount the root partition (sda10, in this case) and set up /dev/ for use within a chroot environment. (Other partitions that can be similarly mounted for a more functional chroot are /proc, /sys and /dev/pts.) Then we reinstall grub (not really necessary). Then, we enter the chroot and update grub. This causes grub to use the new UUIDs where necessary. After exiting the chroot, reboot and we should get the grub menu back.\n\nA: Resorting to the GUI and using gparted I resized and more specifically shrinked a comparatively large partition on the drive, then I was left with unallocated space left from this process.\n\n*\n\n*Afterwards i've tried to expand the root partition by right clicking on it and select resize and expand,but the new unallocated space wasn't visible or available to be appended to the selected partition.\n\n*After a bit of a hassle, I figured out that I need to get the root partition and the unallocated left space to be adjacent in the gparted list of partitions (which presumably coordinates to their actual position relative to each other on the physical drive).\n\n*So as for this specific case where I had a partition separating the root partition and the unallocated space, I right-clicked on that separating partition then moved it by click and dragging its space on the vertical bar, and got the unallocated space which was behind it to be right before it ; so that I can get the three partition in the new following ascending order : the root partition (/) - newfound unallocated space - separating partition.\n\n*After applying the changes and reordering the partitions, I was able to expand the root partition by appending the unallocated space.\n\n", "Q: Two partition tables are unrecognized While trying to installing Ubuntu 14.04 as my sole operating system, I've been encountering a number of issues (Described in more depth at Ubuntu 14.04 installation crashes with \"???\" message after selecting drive), all of which seem to be related to GPT and RAID, both of which I know little about.\nWhen I open GParted, I get an error message. Upon Xing out the error message and checking /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, I see that they are unrecognized.\nMy laptop is an Asus Zenbook UX51Vz-XH71, which comes with two SSDs (2x128GB or 2x256GB) in an Intel Rapid Storage (aka Intel Matrix) RAID 0 configuration and uses UEFI and GPT. Here is what the Arch wiki says:\n\nThe UX51Vz comes in a variety of configurations, most of those sold in western Europe come with two SSDs (2x128GB or 2x256GB) in an Intel Rapid Storage (aka Intel Matrix) RAID 0 configuration. To install Arch Linux on the UX51Vz, you can follow the official Installation guide. Since the UX51Vz uses UEFI and GPT, make sure to also read the UEFI, GPT and UEFI_Bootloaders pages. It is recommended to use rEFInd as a bootloader and mount the EFI partition on /boot. To prepare a UEFI USB device, read UEFI#Create_UEFI_bootable_USB_from_ISO. The only way to preserve the pre-installed Windows instance is to install Arch with RAID without breaking up the RAID 0 array. See RAID with the only difference that you should not create arrays, only assemble.\n  Note: As of BIOS version 207 on UX51VZH there is no option to reconfigure the Intel RST setup through BIOS. Once you break your array, you cannot set it up again. For Linux-only users, mdadm software raid should be a better option.\n\nI have deleted all partition tables using GParted.\n\nA: As you say that you \"wish to scrap what there is earlier\" (if I understand you correctly) you seem to have the option to either set up a raid (as it appears to have been as you got it) or use the SSD disks as separate storage devices.\nThe latter should be the easier option.\nIn that case I'd suggest you click on \"Unallocated space\" as shown in the image above, then select Device > Create Partition table (from menus), which leaves you with one pending operation (View > Pending operations shows the list).\nTo execute the pending operations click on the 'tick' or select Edit > Apply all operations\n... Then it should be possible to partition that disk.\nRepeat for /dev/sdb and the error message should disappear.\nI believe it appears due to gparted not being able to recognize the data on these two disks.\n", "Q: Can I open two or more files in vim at once?

Thank you in advance.\n\nA: Linux has a multitude of ways to do each of these steps; this is just one way. Of course, it goes almost without saying that most of this is dangerous if done heedlessly. Use at your own risk as they say.\nStep #1: Format Disk\nThis prepares the disk to be partitioned. This is only needed if you want to format an entire drive. Otherwise, skip to step 2 and just write a new partition over the old one.\nStep #1a: Find the Recognized Disks and their Partitions\nTo list all drives use:\nsudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb\n\nWhich only works when the drive is NOT mounted. To list the drives at any time use the longer:\nsudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL\n\nA device name refers to the entire hard disk. Nowadays, nearly everything uses SCSI or Linux has an emulated serial interface driver for it. Meaning that they'll all be named sda, sdb, sdc, etc.. Each drive is given a letter designation in the order that they appear in the BIOS; this means that if you rearrange the drives in your BIOS they get moved and your mount points will likely all break.\nThe only common exception are RAM drives which use sr0, sr1, sr2, etc... These are enumerated more like partitions than drives. Being that they all exist on the same device they really are more like partitions. Drive tools like the ones you are using may list them as drives though; they are a special case though and you don't need to worry about it now.\nIf you are using an older Linux distribution (or just one which is very specific to a certain piece of hardware) you may also see hda, hdb, hdc, etc... These are the old non serial IDE drivers and for these purposes will work exactly the same a SCSI drivers.\nStep #1B: Format the Disk:\nThis step will also erase ALL PARTITIONS on the disk so make sure that this is what you want to do before you do step 1b.\nNow that you've found the disk you want to format, it is time to do it. Use this to format the disk:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sdb\n\nThe basic fdisk commands you need are:\n\n\n*\n\n*m - print help\n\n*p - print the partition table\n\n*n - create a new partition\n\n*d - delete a partition\n\n*q - quit without saving changes\n\n*w - write the new partition table and exit\n\n\nStep#2 : Partition the disk using mkfs.ext3 command\nAs long as your disk is formatted, all you'll need to do is work with your partitions. Partitions are logical divisions on your disk. In case you're wondering, this will destroy everything on the partition.\nTo format Linux partitions using ext2fs on the new disk:\nsudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb1\n\nNotice that when we work with specific partitions they have names ending with a number (eg /dev/sda1 instead of just /dev/sda). Each partition is given a sequential number based on which sector it begins at.\nStep#3 : Mount the new disk using mount command\nMounting a disk allows the OS to use the disk (beyond simple partition and format operations). A mount point is a point on the system directory tree which you'd like to put the drive. This can be any folder but by convention it is usually a folder in the /mnt in Ubuntu (some distros will use /mount instead). Ubuntu has a directory called /media which confusses people a lot. /media is where the system will automount drives such as DVD or USB drives. Most people avoid mounting their own drives in this folder\nFirst create a mount point /mnt/disk1 and use mount command to mount /dev/sdb1, enter:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/disk1\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/disk1\ndf -H\n\nStep#4 : Update the File System Table:\nIf we want the disk to automatically be mounted when we boot we need to tell the OS as much. This is done in the fstab file. To open the /etc/fstab file, enter:\nsudo vi /etc/fstab\n\nUse whatever text editor you want for this (vi is just an example). Append to this file the mount information a line similar to the following:\n/dev/sdb1               /mnt/disk1           ext3    defaults        1 2\n\nWhere /dev/sdb1 is the partition to mount, /mnt/disk1 is the folder to mount to, ext3 is the file system type, defaults are the mount options (see man mount), 1 is weather to back the drive up  using the system dump command and 2 is the order this drive should be scanned when the system does a file system error scan. Save and close the file.\nAs a note, the fstab file has a sister file called mtab. The mtab file contains a listing of all of the currently mounted file systems. You can look at it to see how everything currently mounted was mounted. Do not edit mtab directly though as it is used by the umount command to unmount these file systems later and editing this may break your ability to unmount a drive properly.\n\nOptional Task: Label the partition\nYou can label the partition using e2label. For example, if you want to label the new partition /backup, enter:\nsudo e2label /dev/sdb1 /backup\n\nYou can use label name instead of partition name to mount disk using /etc/fstab:\nLABEL=/backup /disk1 ext3 defaults 1 2\n\n", "Q: Can I run bash commands from an Ubuntu HTML5 App?

Any suggetions would be apprecieated.\nI have tried various solutions including getting rid of various drivers, creating a xorg.conf; all to no avail.  I think my system is now fairly vanilla (having gotten rid of the various changes I have tried).  \nIn comparing the old 10.04LTS Xorg.0.log files, the striking difference is that the old one had a large number of RADEON lines.  To me at least it looks like the radeon module is not being connected to, and this is confirmed by a view of lsmod.\nAnyway, here is the information which I think might be helpful in solving the problem.\n~> inxi -G\nGraphics:  Card: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD/ATI] RS690M [Radeon Xpress 1200/1250/1270] \n        X.Org: 1.15.1 drivers: fbdev,ati,radeon (unloaded: vesa) Resolution: 1024x768@76.0hz \n        GLX Renderer: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.4, 128 bits) GLX Version: 2.1 Mesa 10.1.3\n\nNo /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\nIt looks to me like the radeon module is loaded by the kernel, but nothing is connected to it.

Is this normal in Ubuntu? Do I really have every day to see this and restart my computer? I don't want to miss the updates recommended for Ubuntu, but too often seems to be useless.\nIs there a way to configure for updater to automatically install the most important packages? Or only search for the real important ones? I am basically a Java developer who will use Eclipse, MySql and Tomcat with some frameworks.\n\nA: You can change how often the system looks for updates in System Settings → Software & Updates → Updates tab.\nIn general, you can set it to check for updates no more than every two weeks if you want. You can also set the interval for security updates separately to make it more frequent.\n\nA: Yeah that's normal. You can disable it or reduce the frequency.\nTo disable it, go to Startup Applications (you can search for it in the dash) and unchecking Update Notifier. These applications can be hidden sometimes and you need to show them. See this question: How do I add/remove the \"hidden\" startup applications?\n\nThen make sure you periodically run these commands in terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nTo reduce the frequency, see the answer above by @chakes.\n\nA: This is common, most often these are security updates. You may not notice an impact but they are definitely recommended.\n\nA: A note on the \"is this normal\" part of the question:\nIn general, open source software is released much more frequently than commercial software. Also, a system like Ubuntu is a large constellation of \"small\" software packages that work together to provide you a seamless user experience. Many of these packages are specialised code libraries that you may never know about, but end up doing something that is useful for some end user application. This is one of the defining characters of open source software: instead of large monolithic applications you have a extended web of dependencies. \nIn the system where I am writing this I have over 4 000 packages installed, so it is easy to have at least one update per day.\n", "Q: Question about compiling from ruby source and upgrade I have three questions about compiling ruby (and other softwares) from source. Ruby is avaliable to install using apt-get, but I want to learn more about Linux and I want to compile from source.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I first downloaded ruby source from ruby site and extracted in my home: /home/rgiaviti/ruby-2.1.2. Then, I opened terminal and typed:\nrgiaviti@ubuntupc:~$ cd /home/ruby-2.1.2\nrgiaviti@ubuntupc:~/ruby-2.1.2$ ./configure\nrgiaviti@ubuntupc:~/ruby-2.1.2$ make\nrgiaviti@ubuntupc:~/ruby-2.1.2$ sudo make install\n\nAfter a lot of output, everything worked fine. Absolutely fine. I tested ruby interpreter this way:\nruby --version\n\nOutput:\nruby 2.1.2p95 (2014-05-08 revision 45877) [x86_64-linux]\n\nSuccess, right? Now, my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*When a new ruby interpreter is released, how do I upgrade my installed version? Just do the same thing I do when installing?\n\n*Can I delete the folder that I extracted the source (/home/rgiaviti/ruby-2.1.2)?\n\n*Is there a way to uninstall the interpreter, like a apt-get remove, but for compiling from source?\n\n\nI think, that's all. Thanks.\n\nA: \nWhen a new ruby interpreter is released, how do I upgrade my installed version? Just do the same thing I do when installing?\n\nProbably, presuming that new versions don't change paths. This is fairly unlikely to break updated installs, but might leave detritus littered around your system.\n\nCan I delete the folder that I extracted the source (/home/rgiaviti/ruby-2.1.2)?\n\nYes. After install, this is no longer needed.\n\nIs there a way to uninstall the interpreter, like a apt-get remove, but for compiling from source?\n\nNo! Personally, I would never directly install from source. As I mention above, this often results in files littered through your system. In the future, I would recommend using CheckInstall, which rolls your install into a package for easy management.\n", "Q: Install GoPanda2 on Ubuntu I am trying to install GoPanda2 into Ubuntu.

You are going to be best off using ufw to configure iptables.\nIf you wish to use iptables directly, you can the use iptable-persistent, but you must save your rules first.\nI believe this command will help:\nsudo bash -c \"iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules\"\n\nYou can do this without installing iptables-persistent :\nOther examples: \n\n\n*\n\n*http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/iptables#Saving_your_configuration \n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo#Configuration_on_startup\n\nA: You are correct that the iptables-persistent package does not automatically save your rules for you on shutdown. This can help prevent being locked out of a remote system.\n/usr/share/doc/iptables-persistent/README:\nThe Debian Package iptables-persistent\n----------------------------\n\nThis is a very simple script that restores the file /etc/iptables/rules.v4 as\nthe active ruleset at system boot.\n\nIf it exists, IPv6 rules are also restored from /etc/iptables/rules.v6\n\nLoading of rules is guaranteed to happen before network interfaces are\nbrought up.\n\nTo save the current ruleset, use \"iptables-save >/etc/iptables/rules.v4\"\nor \"ip6tables-save >/etc/iptables/rules.v6\", or\n\"invoke-rc.d iptables-persistent save\"\n\n -- Simon Richter <sjr@debian.org>  Wed, 01 Jul 2009 13:43:43 +0200\n -- Jonathan Wiltshire <jmw@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000\n\nWhen the iptables-persistent package is first installed, it asks you if you want to save your current configuration. I believe you can also trigger this with sudo dpkg-reconfigure iptables-persistent.\n\nA: Recent versions of iptables-persistent save the state of rules once at configuration time, rather than repeatedly at every reboot.  It appears that this used to work differently... \n", "Q: Installing CP400 printer gives 'client-error-not-possible' error After upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04 and knowing that gutenprint 5.2.10 now supports Canon SELPHY printers, I've tried installing my CP400 through Settings > Printers.\nIt finds the printer fine and lists the URI as:\ngutenprint52usb://Canon/SELPHYCP400?serial=NONE_UNKNOWN&backend=canonselphy\n\n...and then appears to find the drivers.  But when I hit the apply button, I get:\nCUPS Server Error: There was an error during the CUPS operation: 'client-error-not-possible'.\n\nIf I go to localhost:631/Admin and view the error log, the error appears as:\nReturning IPP client-error-not-possible for CUPS-Add-Modify-Printer (ipp://localhost/printers/Canon-CP400) from localhost\n\nNote that the path in the error is different than the path as entered.  Also, it seems that \"gutenprint52usb\" should have a plus sign in it - gutenprint52+usb - since that would then match the actual file name.  I did try changing \"gutenprint52usb\" to \"ipp\", per some answers I found in my search. That added the printer just fine, but of course, it didn't work (as in nothing got to the printer).\nI've tried reinstalling both CUPS and gutenprint through Synaptic.  Rebooted.  Plugged/unplugged the printer numerous times.  Etc.\nIf instead I attempt to add the printer through the localhost CUPS utility, it asks for a username and password.  I only have one password on this machine and it works every time I log on or need to use sudo, so seems like it should work here but, alas, no.  Nor does using my username or root and the same password.\nMerle\n\nA: I was running into the same issue with a different printer.  Your comment about the plus sign provided me a clue. When I tried adding the plus sign to 'gutenprint52usb://' in the 'add printer' menu it looked like it didn't accept it.  So since I couldn't add a + in the menu, I subtracted it from the library name by making a copy of gutenprint52+usb without the plus sign\n# cd /usr/lib/cups/backend\n# cp gutenprint52+usb gutenprint52usb\n\nAfter that, I just added the printer like normal (select device, find driver, save) and was able to print successfully.\n\nA: For me, it was the other way around with a Canon Selphy ES30.\nThe filename had the \"+\", but the \"add printer\" menu showed it without a plus.\nAfter using these commands it added fine:\ncd /usr/lib/cups/backend\ncp gutenprint52usb gutenprint52+usb\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.

You can use evtest to find out which device is your keyboard and joystick. On the next reboot the devices will be back in their old order.\nAnother slightly less brute force method is via the environment variable:\nSDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE=\"/dev/input/js1\"\nexport SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE\n\nThis forces SDL based games to use js1 instead of js0. I don't think this will work with modern SDL2 based games and it will only work for a single joystick/gamepad, so it's of limited use.\nSDL2 does provide an option to configure a joystick and remap buttons, but I don't think it has a facility to reorder devices at the moment.\nAnd finally there is also the \"clean\" method by writing an udev rule, this will essentially do the same as the rm/mv hack, but permanently.

I checked, and it turns out that the tool is called PhotoRec. As I said, it scans a partition looking for patterns that resemble certain file types, then copies these to a different location.\nIt turns out that PhotoRec is actually available from Ubuntu's APT repository, so if you currently have Ubuntu installed and running, or you currently have it running live, then you can install PhotoRec and run it in Ubuntu. This might be more convenient.\nAlso, I found that PhotoRec has a relative that might be more useful in this situation: TestDisk. TestDisk can perform other operations including but not limited to restoring partition tables. If you haven't made any major changes to the disk since deleting the partition, this might allow you to restore the partition and most of the files on it so that you can access most of your old files by going to My Computer. Note that you probably won't be able to boot the partition after restoring it, and you will probably lose all of your new partitions.\nBoth tools can be found here: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Main_Page\n", "Q: Can I use SSD for system and HDD for /home partition w/o problems in future?

I simply boot up Ubuntu live cd, run gparted and there I can only shrink this partition.\n\n\nIt's weird, because I have ~hundred GB of free space on this HDD, but that's optional part of this question and if somebody could answer it I'd be grateful, but it's not necessary.\nMy real question is as in the title: Can I use such setup as I described or could mixing up SSD and HDD or having swap on SSD cause any problems in future?\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04.\nAs requested, here is output from sudo parted -l:\nModel: ATA ST1500DM003-9YN1 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 1500GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B\nPartition Table: msdos\n\nNumber  Start  End     Size   Type      File system  Flags\n3      107GB  760GB   652GB  primary    ntfs\n1      760GB  1500GB  740GB  extended                boot\n5      760GB  1500GB  740GB  logical    ext4\n\n\nModel: ATA INTEL SSDSC2BW18 (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sdb: 180GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B\nPartition Table: msdos\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system  Flags\n1      1049kB  32,8GB  32,8GB  primary\n2      32,8GB  180GB   147GB   extended\n5      32,8GB  180GB   147GB   logical    ext4\n\n\nA: Having your system / on SSD and your /home on an HDD is not a problem. I and many others have a setup like this, and it works fine. It allows your system to boot, run, and update quickly using the SSD while allowing you to store much more personal data on the /home using the HDD. More generally, separate / and /home lets you overwrite / with a new installation while not touching the user data on /home/.\nAs others have commented, having swap on an SSD is less advised. This can require lots of writes to the disk, which may reduce the usable life of the SSD. Also as commented, you probably don't need 32 GB of swap. If you have more than 4 GB of RAM, unless you are doing things that use a bunch of memory, a few GB of swap should be plenty.\nRegarding resizing the /home partition, you can't resize it while it is mounted. Running a live CD without the partitions mounted allows you to modify them, as you have mentioned. And as others have commented, your parted output does not show any free space on your HDD.\n", "Q: How to execute a terminal command every time the firefox windows closes I need to execute this:\nrm -rf ~/.wine-pipelight/*;\nrm -rf ~/.wine-pipelight/./.*;\ncp -a ~/viewright_backup/. ~/.wine-pipelight\n\nevery time the Firefox window closes. But not necessarily when all the windows closed, but on every window that is closed.\nFor example, if I have one Firefox window and one Firefox pop-up window. If I close at least one windows, I want to execute this command. Is this possible? Thanks!\n\nA: The only way I can think of is not very elegant. You can have a script running in the background that counts the number of open firefox windows every second and launches your command if that number changes. Something like:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n\n## Run firefox\n/usr/bin/firefox &\n\n## Initialize the variable to 100\nlast=100;\n\n## Start infinite loop, it will run while there\n## is a running firefox instance.\nwhile pgrep firefox >/dev/null;\ndo\n    ## Get the number of firefox windows    \n    num=$(xdotool search --name firefox | wc -l)\n\n    ## If this number is less than it was, launch your commands\n    if [ \"$num\" -lt \"$last\" ]\n    then\n        rm -rf ~/.wine-pipelight/*;\n        ## I included this since you had it in your post but it\n        ## does exactly the same as the command above.\n        rm -rf ~/.wine-pipelight/./.*;\n        cp -a ~/viewright_backup/. ~/.wine-pipelight      \n    fi\n\n    ## Save the number of windows as $last for next time\n    last=$num\n\n    ## Wait for a second so as not to spam your CPU.\n    ## Depending on your use, you might want to make it wait a bit longer,\n    ## the longer you wait, the lighter the load on your machine\n    sleep 1\n\ndone\n\nSave the script above as firefox, put it in your ~/bin directory and make it executable chmod a+x ~/bin/firefox. Since Ubuntu adds ~/bin to your $PATH by default and adds it before any other directories, running firefox will launch that script instead of the normal firefox executable. Now, because the script is launching /usr/bin/firefox, this means that your normal firefox will appear, just as you expect, only with the script running as well. The script will exit as soon as you close firefox.\nDISCLAIMER:\nThis script is\n\n\n*\n\n*Not elegant, it needs to be run as an infinite loop in the background. \n\n*Requires xdotool, install it with sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n*Does not work for tabs, only windows.\n\n", "Q: Is there a command to pause the native Ubuntu sound player? So under my volume drop down menu, I have Spotify, Rhythmbox and VLC:\n\nHere I can pause and play the various different applications. My question is, is there a command to pause the one that is currently playing, e.g. I could set up a short cut to pause whichever was playing. This is mainly because Spotify doesn't have command options as far as I can tell, and I would like to pause it using blue proximity when I get up?\n\nA: \nIf you need command-line access, you can talk to it directly over DBUS.

Seems as though there ought to be a simple solution to this: \nMy sound comes through a jack in the back of a Samsung HDMI monitor. If pavucontrol (Pulse Audio Volume Control) is running (if the window/dialog box is open) then the sound is flawless. As soon as I close it, the sound is badly distorted. Open it? Perfect. Close it?

I have Ubuntu on my computer already, but is it possible to copy the whole operating system to a flash drive? I wish to boot that OS, with all the files on it, on a separate computer.\n\nA: No, you'll have to download Ubuntu to the flash drive, then add the files separately.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nVisit the above link to download the 32 or 64 bit distro, then just use a separate USB stick for the files you want to add. Or install the distro, then use the same USB to transfer the files after the installation is complete.\n\nA: It might actually work just long enough, just well enough to sucker you in to spending hours trying to fix it before you give up and follow GFiasco's advise.\nWhen you installed Ubuntu (or any OS on any computer), the installation process includes creating a boatload of configuration files based on the hardware the installer detects.

Usually, I'll check the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*In Apache, remove the documentation or at least don't present it to trough the web server (by removing the link /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/apache2-doc.conf)\n\n*In Apache, be sure that unnecessary modules are not loaded. With Ubuntu, this is done by removing the links in the /etc/apache2/mods-enabled. Each link point to a file in the /etc/apache2/mods-available directory that loads and configure a module at a time.\n\n*You may want to review and enable the /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf. They propose some security tips, that are not activated by default :\n\n*Denying access to the whole filesystem except for the directories that you would explicitly allow later\n\n*modifying the server banner to give as less as possible information on the running software.\n\n*In PHP, check that you don't print too much logging information on the screen in case of error (parameters in the section Error handling and logging of the /etc/php4/apache2/php.ini file. The comments in the file give a lot of information on what is preferable to do)\n\n*No need to expose your MySQL server to the Internet. By default, in Ubuntu, the Mysql server listen only on localhost. Check /etc/mysql/my.cnf in the section mysqld for the parameter bind-address. It should be on 127.0.0.1 :\n\nbind-address = 127.0.0.1\n\n\n*Don't install more services on this server than what you need.\n\n*Don't forget to apply update when they arrive.\n\n*Don't rely only on the configuration of the LAMP server only, don't forget you also have to put run a PHP application that can introduce some security threats (input validation and all this stuff to avoid typing SQL query in input field to retrieve from the DB more information that you would have given yourself, ...)\n\n\nThese are the first things on the top of my mind.

In the case of postfix, it involves what type of server you're running, the hostname, and allowed IP addresses (among other things).\nIf you wanted to change those options afterwards, though, you can use dpkg-reconfigure which only goes through the configuration files phase of the package, where you can change those options.\nNote that not all packages have user-configurable options, so even if a package installs a configuration file in /etc, dpkg-reconfigure might not do anything.\n", "Q: How to uninstall all non-default software?

I want to install Ubuntu beside Windows 8 following this post on Ask Ubuntu guide, but I don't know if my Windows installation is booting in UEFI mode or in legacy mode (and it's said to be important in the post under the \"DUAL BOOT ISSUES\" paragraph). How do I get to know it?\n\nA: If you would prefer to check from Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu open the terminal and type \"sudo parted -l\". \n\n*Scroll to the part with information on the disk your Windows installation is using. Under \"Partition Table:\" it should say gpt or msdos. GPT is required for Windows to run in UEFI mode. msdos means you're using BIOS/Legacy Mode.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*In Windows 8 go to the start screen\n\n*Right click on \"command prompt\", and choose \"run as administrator\". [If you can't find it look under all programs.]\n\n*In command prompt type \"diskpart.exe\".\n\n*In diskpart type \"list disk\". It will show a * under the GPT column for\ndisks using GPT. Windows requires GPT in order to run in UEFI mode.\n\n\nAlternatively, another Windows 8 method is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows 8 go to the start screen\n\n*Click on \"command prompt\" [If you can't find it look under all programs.]\n\n*In command prompt type \"msinfo32\". Under \"BIOS MODE\" it should say UEFI if you are running in UEFI mode. \n\n\nA: The post you mention (Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI) already reports the command to launch:\n[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo \"Installed in EFI mode\" || echo \"Installed in Legacy mode\"\nIt's an elegant line that checks for you whether the directory /sys/firmware/efi exists. If so, then your system is in EFI mode, else it is in legacy mode. Look at ls /sys/firmware, more simply.\nThe answer already given with sudo parted -l is also valid, but it infers the answer from the way the partition table has been constructed. \n\nUsage notes\nI am aware that these commands are useless if you haven't installed Linux yet, but some viewers may come across this question in retrospect, for example near the point of re-installation and so forth.\nHowever, from the live USB/CD you can launch sudo parted -l in a terminal and see the requested information. For this use do not trust the information from /sys/firmware/ though, because it refers to the system in the live medium, rather than that in your computer.\n", "Q: How to remotely use Ubuntu software center my sysadmin set up my work machine such that I don't have root privilege but I can  use ubuntu software center to install packages by providing my password. \nI login to that Ubuntu machine remotely, and I'd like to install some packages from the software center, how can I do this? \nI tried \"software-center\" , which gives me the interface, but nothing happens when I click on \"install\" \nNOTE: both machines involved are ubuntu machine. \nThis post might help understand my situation, my sys-admin did the same thing.

I plugged a keyboard and monitor into the box, and I could not even 'ssh localhost' successfully (connection refused).  'ps -aux | grep ssh' shows only ssh-agent is running, and when I tried to restart the service, it said that sshd (and just ssh, I tried that too) wasn't a recognized service.  'dpkg -l | grep ssh' lists openssh-client, but not openssh-server.  \nNow, I assume I could probably install openssh-server and everything would be fine again, but I'm quite confused as to what possibly could have caused this.  dpkg.log makes no mention of openssh-server ever being installed, let alone uninstalled, which doesn't make sense considering I'd ssh'd to the machine in the past just fine.  Is there some other package Ubuntu comes with that would let me SSH to it?\n\nA: This might sound silly to you, but have you checked all the dpkg.log.* files? Some will be gzipped, you can grep them using zgrep or scroll through them using zless.\nI don't know for sure, but I think sometimes you might stumble over weird dependencies, so maybe you removed some package that happened to trigger openssh-servers removal? Did you do anything with dpkg, apt, or any other tools that use them?\n(This is an \"answer\" because I can't comment yet.
