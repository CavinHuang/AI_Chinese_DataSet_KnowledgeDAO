["Q: How to compile and install JBE Help I just downloaded JBE (Java bytecode editor) when I extracted it (because it was in a zip file when I downloaded it) it comes up with a folder named \"bin\", a folder named \"src\",versoion.txt, jbe.sh, jbe.bat and a copying.txt file. Please how to compile ,install, and run the application ?. I am using Xubuntu 14.04\n\nA: JBE can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install libbytecode-java libasm3-java\n\n", "Q: Reasizing partitions (make it larger) So I am dual-booting a Windows 7 laptop and I started Ubuntu with around 30 GB for small projects. Now that I am starting to use Ubuntu more than Windows, I am starting to run out of room. I have seen some tutorials on making partitions larger but I had to manually partition mine because of some weird error (I forgot what it was I did this a couple weeks ago). So I got GParted and it seems to work great (haven't really messed with it yet) but I want to know what partition do I mess with to make the space for Ubuntu larger. (Manually doing this in the first place was stressful enough so I don't want to guess).\n\n\nA: First, I advise you against doing this from within your Ubuntu. It would be best if you booted from a live Ubuntu USB drive. (I assume you know how to do this, since you have Ubuntu installed). \nThen, using the GParted in the live mode, resize sda4, the extended partition, to occupy the rest of the available space. And I mean ALL of the unallocated space, since you can only make 3 primary partitions and 1 extended, so you can't add a partition without deleting one, or resizing the extended partition. So keeping any free space outside the extended partition is pointless. You can unmount the swap without worry - the live mode automatically activates swap.\nThe way I look at it, you can't add space to /, since you'll have to move the /home partition, and that might take a long time (but can be done) and maybe risky. It can be done - right click the home and swap partitions, choose Resize/Move, drag the partitions to the end of the free space. Then extend the sda5 to as much as you need. Apply.\nI recommend two options with minimal risk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the swap space, extend sda6 (your home partition), add swap back again. -or-\n\n*Add a new ext4 partition in the free space within the extended partition.\n\n\nIt looks to me that you will have to edit your /etc/fstab either way: for re-adding swap in (1) or adding the new partition in (2). I prefer and suggest (2). Before you go about (2), think of where you want this extra space to be. I prefer a directory in my home folder (like /home/muru/devel). So decide where you want it to be. Let's call it /path/to/some/folder. In your Ubuntu installation, do: \nsudo mkdir -p /path/to/some/folder\n\nThis will create the necessary folder(s).\nNow boot to live Ubuntu and open GParted. To add a new partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the unallocated space within the extended partition, choose New, select the required size and format (ext4 recommended).\n\n*Apply (the green tick or the Apply All Operations entry in the Edit menu).\n\n*Right click on the newly created partition, choose Information and copy the UUID. It looks like this: 5784865f-7c42-4d8b-b692-2d27e06af9c1.\n\n*Open a terminal, and execute these commands:\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\nsudo gedit /mnt/etc/fstab\n\n\n*Add this line to fstab, after replacing the value with the UUID you copied earlier (and ext4 with the filesystem type, if you chose a different one):\nUUID=5784865f-7c42-4d8b-b692-2d27e06af9c1 /path/to/some/folder ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nI recommend you use a directory that is empty and one you will use a lot for /some/path.\n\n*Save, exit and reboot. You'll find the new partition mounted at /path/to/some/folder, but it will likely be owned by root. Do, in your installed Ubuntu,:\nsudo chown $USER:$USER -R /path/to/some/folder\n\nYou'll need to do this since mounting may make root the owner of the folder.\nHere $USER is a variable that usually automatically contains your username, You can directly use your username in place of it.\nNow you have all the space you need in /path/to/some/folder. You have ~14 GB of free space in your /, and for most users, that's plenty, especially given a separate /home.\n\nA: It depends.  I'm not sure if you are using GRUB or not,but Window's bootloader only allows for 4 'primary' partitions, so technically sda5, 6, and 7 are all extended partitions of sda4, and resizing any of the former three will logically expand the latter. sda5 is probably where the system installs new program files, and sda6 is where your documents and downloads will likely be.  It's worth knowing that any documents you have in Windows can be accessed through the 'host' folder which I think is placed at the root of the drive if you used WUBI.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_boot_record\n", "Q: Occasional artifacts when displaying characters To summarize the answer: switching to proprietary drivers should work, but the artifacts disappeared for me even on the free drivers now.\nUpdate: since switching back to the proprietary AMD driver (fglrx), I haven't seen these artifacts.\nOccasionally I see artifacts instead of correctly rendered characters:\n\nFor now I have only observed this in Firefox.\nThe characters become normal once I select the text.\nWhat's the issue here and how can I solve it?\nGraphics card:  AMD Radeon HD 7790\nDriver: radeon (free) -> now I'm no fglrx and am not seeing the artifacts (see the update)\n\nA: I've seen these artifacts on two completely different machines (MacBook Pro using Nvidia and desktop using Radeon HD7750).

This article has good information but is not exactly what I'm trying to do:\nhttp://daker.me/2014/05/how-to-use-oxide-in-your-ubuntu-qml-application.html\n\nA: There's no built-in equivalent, but you can reproduce this behavior by setting up a message handler in a user script that triggers an event in the DOM that you handle in the HTML document.  For each of these steps, the code to be executed is passed along.  For a simple example:\noxide-test.qml\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\nimport com.canonical.Oxide 1.0\n\nRectangle {\n    width: units.gu(50)\n    height: units.gu(75)\n    // Both the UserScript and the call to sendMessage need to share the same\n    // context, which should be in the form of a URL.

You may be able to pass a callback in, but I suspect this won't actually work.  Instead, you'll need to set up a parallel messaging chain to get the result back to the QML context.\n", "Q: Difference between apt-cacher and apt-cacher-ng What exactly is the difference between apt-cacher and apt-cacher-ng? I can't seem to find anywhere comparing the two. I've found tutorials and manuals on both of them, and they seem to be the same from the set-up point of view.\nIs one better or more reliable than the other? Does one offer services that the other does not? What are the pros and cons of each?\n\nA: From the documentation (available in /usr/share/doc/apt-cacher-ng/apt-cacher-ng.pdf, if you have installed it):\n\nThe program reuses many ideas behind the other famous proxy, its predecessor apt-cacher 1.x\n  (which has been written in Perl). In contrast to apt-cacher, different aspects have been declared\n  as primary targets during the development of apt-cacher-ng:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*lightweight implementation - allow use on systems with low memory and processing\n  resources\n  \n*internal (native) threading - avoiding process fork'ing wherever possible, avoiding kludges\n  for pseudo-thread synchronization, avoiding relying on special file system features for\n  internal operations where possible\n  \n*real (effective) support of HTTP pipelining, using an internal client with native stream\n  control (having the nice side effect: reduction of resource overhead and minimization of\n  possible points of failure)\n  \n*avoiding featuritis where they cause too much bloat and the functionality can be provided\n  by native OS features\n  \n*reliable but efficient content merging in the local package pool, avoiding delivering of\n  wrong data.\n  \n  \n  As with apt-cacher, explicit tracking of dynamically changed and unchanged files is established,\n  and the use in non-Debian environment is supported.\nLong story: Not all goals have been achieved. The initial plan of using background databases\n  to merge any download from any arbitrary location has been dropped because of complexity\n  and performance considerations, reliable heuristics could not be found either. Instead, a semi-\n  automated solution has been created which used machine-parsable files with mirror information,\n  like the one available for Debian mirrors in Debian's CVS repository.\n\n", "Q: What does it mean when I type a command and the terminal does nothing? I'm new to Linux (I am running Ubuntu). I am learning new commands for the terminal and even following some guides/forums on how to do stuff. Sometimes I will type a command and the terminal makes a newline then sits with a blinking cursor after the last command I typed. \nSometimes I think the computer is just thinking and needs time to do something (although it would be nice to have some sort of indication of the progress on the given task). Sometimes the terminal progresses to let me type a new command and other times I wait a few minutes before pressing ctrl+c to stop whatever it was doing.\nIt would be nice to know what I'm dealing with here so I can judge better whether I am supposed to be waiting or just wasting my time.\n\nA: I would quote Eric S. Raymond's The Art of Unix Programming:\n\nRule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.\nOne of Unix's oldest and most persistent design rules is that when a program has nothing interesting or surprising to say, it should shut up. Well-behaved Unix programs do their jobs unobtrusively, with a minimum of fuss and bother. Silence is golden.\nThis “silence is golden” rule evolved originally because Unix predates video displays. On the slow printing terminals of 1969, each line of unnecessary output was a serious drain on the user's time. That constraint is gone, but excellent reasons for terseness remain.\n\nI think that the terseness of Unix programs is a central feature of the style. When your program's output becomes another's input, it should be easy to pick out the needed bits. And for people it is a human-factors necessity — important information should not be mixed in with verbosity about internal program behavior. If all displayed information is important, important information is easy to find.\n-- Ken Arnold  \n\nWell-designed programs treat the user's attention and concentration as a precious and limited resource, only to be claimed when necessary.\n\nOf course, many programs don't obey this rule, and the answer really depends on the particular program.\n\nA: There are some commands that don't print anything on the standard nor error output.\nBut they set the return code accordingly. The return code of any command can be accessed by the $? variable just after executing the command. If it is 0, then the command ran successfully. If it is a value greater than 0, then an error occurred.\nThis is very convenient when using these commands in script, as you just have to do something like this :\ncommand && echo \"Returned an OK status\" || echo \"Returned an non-OK status\"\n\nOr, when more actions are to be taken base on the returned status :\ncommand\nif [ $? == 0 ]; then\n   # code to be executed when the command was executed successfully\nelse\n   # code to be executed when the command was not executed successfully\nfi\n\nIn other cases, this is the way used by command to tell that something is enabled or not, like the selinuxenabled command which return 0 if SE (Security Enhanced) Linux is activated, 1 if it is not.\n", "Q: Which package should I choose for the convert command? Typing convert on my system (14.04) produces:\nThe program 'convert' can be found in the following packages:\n * imagemagick\n * graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat\n\nWhy are there 2 packages providing the same command?\nHow do I figure out which one should I use?\nFollow-up\nI used IM with command convert -layers Optimize output*.png output.gif and this produced a file of size 25903 bytes out of my 222 frames.\nFor the record the man page for IM convert says:\n-layers method       optimize or compare image layers\n\nFor the sake of the test I uninstalled IM, installed GM and tried the supposedly equivalent command gm convert -delay 10 output*.gif animation.gif. It created an animated gif file with exactly the same size but different MD5sum.\nAgain, for the record the man page for GM convert does not mention option -layers.\nThis is not a bug in GM, it is just a different way of doing things. I guess I will be sticking with GM since it seems to be more actively maintained.\n\nA: According to the GraphicsMagick FAQ (which maybe outdated):\n\nGraphicsMagick is originally based on (forked from) ImageMagick 5.5.2 in November 2002, from the version distributed by ImageMagick Studio LLC, which is itself forked in August 1999 from ImageMagick developed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company starting in 1992. Other than utilities being executed as sub-commands of the 'gm' command, the command-line syntax and programming APIs remain entirely upward compatible with ImageMagick 5.5.2. A better question might be \"How does ImageMagick differ from ImageMagick?\" since ImageMagick continues to alter and evolve its interfaces so they are no longer completely compatible with earlier versions. While GraphicsMagick also adds new features, it does so in a way which assures that existing features work as they did before. ImageMagick focuses on adding new functionality and features and has dramatically mutated several times since the fork.\nGraphicsMagick maintains a stable release branch, maintains a detailed ChangeLog, and maintains a stable source repository with complete version history so that changes are controlled, and changes between releases are accurately described. GraphicsMagick provides continued support for a release branch. ImageMagick does not offer any of these things.\nSince GraphicsMagick is more stable, more time has been spent optimizing and debugging its code.\n\nAccording to this SO question (also possibly outdated), GM is faster than IM. This blog post from 2013 concurs.\nI have usually always used IM, and as the accepted answer in the above question indicates, for occasional low usage, it's fine.\nShort answer: pick GM unless someone above you in authority specifically asks for IM. I'll be switching to it in short order.\n", "Q: xrandr --addmode doesn't add to the wanted output (DVI-I-0), instead adding to HDMI-0 The monitor I use is a Samsung SyncMaster S24B300, and no matter what the heck I do, Ubuntu refuses to use 1920x1080 at 60hz for the output I want, despite my monitor (which is unrecognized by the system even after I added the most recent nvidia driver) supporting it.

Am I able to use substitute drivers or would the computer not recognize the monitor regardless?\nI've been digging and digging and digging through the forums for an answer, and so far they've worked more against me than for me, to the point of requiring a live CD for recovery; to the point of me having to use the CTRL+ALT+F2 command line to edit a file so that I can log in again, and overall just adding frustration to a matter that seems like it would be perfectly fine to do considering Windows is able to do this just fine without having a driver for this thing.\n\nA: Okay, so do you recall that I own a Samsung SyncMaster S24B300? One of the reasons it had very bad capability is because Linux doesn't take kindly to \"generic pnp monitors\" apparently. My copy of that monitor did not come with driver software, and Samsung is still very finicky about giving drivers for anything other than Windows.\nInstall the drivers for any new monitors as soon as you get them. This will make them compatible with all resolutions as long as they are compatible with Linux. I had to wait until six months later when I bought myself a BenQ monitor that came with the drivers that I could use it with Linux. During installation, I realized that I used a DVI-to-VGA converter, so it was a DVI signal being confused as a VGA signal if that means anything.\nBasically what I'm saying is that I've been wasting your time because I didn't have the driver software for my monitor.\ntl;dr this problem could have been nonexistent were it not for Samsung not knowing how to make drivers compatible with other operating systems.\n", "Q: Can I load this ubuntu on a mac ppc laptop running osx 10.5.8 and if not is there a version that I can?

This is my first endeavour of this type and I am still relatively new to using Ubuntu.\nI have an Zotac MAG HD-ND01 (Intel Atom/2gbRAM/160gbhdd) that I’ve installed Lubuntu 14.04 on. My biggest issue is that I’m looking for an emulator front-end that works well with many emulator types and is great with using a USB controller (PS2/PS3 or generic controller). Researching online doesn’t really provide me with the information that Im looking for without all the comments being 5-8 years old.\nI plan on putting this Zotac in my entertainment system where the hope is that I could just turn it on, and grab a controller without needing a mouse/keyboard.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Retroarch is a pretty good choice, it has cores for just about any older emulator type (the newest system I've emulated with it is PS1 with pcsx_rearmed core); as far as control pads, I find that a PS4 pad with ds4drv is the most plug-and-play (of course you have to configure the emulator itself to use the gamepads buttons).\n\nA: Just to note, I ended up using AntiMicro.

I often see a single dash - or double dash -- followed by linux commands or other installed linux programs. \nWhat are the differences between single dash and double dashes?\nIs it just about abbreviation?  For example, -v means --verbose most of the time.\n\nA: Usually - options can be chained together, like pacman -Syu being equivalent to pacman -S -y -u, and -- options generally take a parameter as in ./configure --prefix=/usr\n\nA: It is a matter of convention. POSIX standard programs usually only have single character options, and they're all prefixed with a single hyphen. The longer versions are a GNU improvement for clarity, as far as I can tell, and usually are prefixed with double hyphens. You can see this in the libraries and programs used to parse options - getopt and gnu-getopt respectively. Non-GNU and non-POSIX-compliant programs may do something else altogether. Note that you really can't be sure that the long form of an argument may be the same from program to program. -f usually means --force, but not with apt-get install (common misconception). -v may mean version - usually, or --verbose, and so on. Check the man pages or other documentation to be sure. Also have a look at the Wikipedia article on getopt. All this predates Linux by a decade or more.\ndd is an example of a POSIX standard utility which doesn't have any hyphenated options at all. find is the classic example of a POSIX standard utility that has word options with single hyphens - nearly all of find's options are multiple characters long. ps supports multiple option styles:\nThis version of ps accepts several kinds of options:\n\n1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.\n2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.\n3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.\n\nGNU tar also supports multiple option styles.\nAs a matter of usage, prefer the long options in scripts if you can be sure that the scripts will be run in compatible environments - the improvement in clarity is a blessing when debugging. For portability, the short options are preferred.\n", "Q: Mouse/Keyboard not working in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS My problem is that when I try to install ubuntu or even 'Try' Ubuntu on my computer the mouse will turn on for about 2-3 Seconds then turn off.\nThe keyboard is wireless and doesn't work either.

You can learn more about it later using man nano, but for now, log into tty1, like you already know, and do the following:\nsudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nAdd that [SeatDefaults] line and press Ctrl+O and it should ask you \"Filename to write: /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf \", so simply press enter. It should say [Wrote 2 lines]. To exit nano press Ctrl+X. \n*N.B.: Ctrl is symbolized as ^ in the command line, so you'll see that a lot, e.g. Ctrl+x = ^X.\nNow you should have exited nano, and can reboot using \nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nPersonally I prefer nano instead of gedit, but that's just a matter of taste and what works best for you. \nOption #2:\nlightdm is supposed to be a light display manager, but if you don't mind using something else you can download gdm display manager which has it's own login screen (or greeter, in the jargon or linux world). Actually, this is the same path i took when trying to solve the same problem. So how do we get it?\napt-get install gdm\n\nI don't exactly remember whether it should prompt you to set gdm as default display manager or not, but in case it doesnt, you can always do the following:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nNext you should see a prompt explaining what the display manager is, with  thingy at the bottom. Press enter. Now you should see a screen with two choices lightdm and gdm, and using arrows highlight gdm, and press enter. Reboot using the same command as before.\nReboot with the prompt that i mentioned before.\nSo after you got to login screen and back to your desktop( oh and you can actually change desktop environments from login screen, too, just in case you might need that ) you can open gedit again and change that lightdm.conf file again, or you can live on with gdm. Your choicese. You can always get rid of either desktop manager by using \napt-get remove command. For lightdm that would be\nsudo apt-get remove lightdm.\n\nBONUS: If you're like me, and mess with desktop environments every once in a while, you might wanna kill boredom while fixing your problem. moc player is command line music player (yup, that's right), which you can install using `sudo apt-get install moc\nAnd to run the actual player run mocp command. Also mc , aka midnight commander file manager is useful to have if you don't have access to graphical envirnoment. Again, sudo apt-get install mc is how you get this tool.\nAnd finally elinks or links internet browsers are nice to have in command line if you have messed up gui and need to look up some answers. Again, sudo apt-get install elinks, run elinks, and g to enter the address you need, like askubuntu.com\nLet me know if this helped a bit.\nSome more info here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM\n", "Q: General tips/ strategies for troubleshooting driver issues? Before I ask a question about each of the multiple driver issues I am having, what are some things I can do to either attempt to fix the issues myself or to at least provide helpful information in my question?\nI realize many proprietary drivers do unorthodox things, but perhaps there are general strategies that work for most drivers. \nBackground: I am using Ubuntu 14.04.

You can search through these logs for relevant info based on the type of driver or hardware, or based on the time that an issue occurred. The /var/log directory has other logs that may help depending on the issue.\nGraphics errors may be listed in ~/.Xsession-errors or /var/log/Xorg.0.log.\nIf you can find a relevant section based on that searching, then this section will be a good place to start for searching for solutions here or elsewhere.\nTypes of issues\nTotally dead\nThis may mean that you either must install the drivers manually, or the device is not supported by the drivers. Searching based on the hardware name will help in deciding which this is. If the device is not supported by the driver, you can file a bug (or see if one already exists).\nIntermittent problems\nTry to determine when the issues happen. Does a specific action trigger the problem? This information will probably be needed to fix the problem. Noting the times when the issue happens will help when looking through log files for clues.\nConfiguration problems\nThis will depend on the driver and type of device.\nAlternate drivers\nSome devices, notably certain graphics cards or network devices, have multiple drivers available. Try the \"Restricted Drivers\" tool in Ubuntu to see if options are listed there. If nothing shows up, search for your device model to see what the options are.\nThe Ubuntu help documents provide a good starting point for debugging many driver issues. Also, there's a good chance that someone has been in the same situation, so make sure to look on the forums and here for possible solutions.\nDevice info\nFor PCI devices, try lspci.\nFor USB devices, try lsusb.\nDevices may be listed at boot in /var/log/syslog when they are detected. Graphics hardware is listed in /var/log/Xorg.0.log.\nGraphics Drivers\nThe most common drivers are for graphics cards by Intel, Nvidia, and ATI/AMD.\nIntel drivers are included in the kernel, so they should automatically be loaded for most Intel cards. Updating your kernel (either through software updates or by upgrading Ubuntu) could fix issues with the Intel drivers.\nNvidia and ATI/AMD cards have two options: an open-source driver and a closed-source proprietary driver.\nFor supported cards, the open-source driver is used by default. For Nvidia this is the nouveau driver, and for ATI/AMD this is the radeon or ati driver.\nClosed-source drivers are also available from the manufacturers. Nvidia provides the nvidia driver, and ATI/AMD provides the fglrx driver.\nClosed source drivers generally provide better performance and features than the open source versions, and may be worth a try when resolving issues.\nFor other types of cards, such as SIS and VIA, the drivers are included by default, and may be updated between versions of Ubuntu or in regular software updates.\n", "Q: In my system details my graphics line is blank I tried updating my drivers and I typed these following commands into a terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nHowever now my graphics space is empty and I cannot play my games without it crashing is there any way to fix this/undo it ?\n\nA: To undo those commands, you can try:\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current\n\n", "Q: How to upgrade ubuntu 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS in Dual boot?

After a lot of searching I cannot find a way to get gnome-terminal to display italic fonts. I'm running version 3.6.2.\nSpecifically I would like vim to display comments in italics; I've added \nhighlight Comment cterm=italic\n\nto my .vimrc but it doesn't work.\nDoes anyone know if this can be done?\n\nA: No. I read man 5 terminfo to find out what the terminal ESCape sequences (what you send the terminal to cause the behavior) dealing with italics were called:  \nman 5 terminfo | egrep 'italics|Cap-|Code'|head -n 10| tail -n 4\n               Variable                   Cap-            TCap               Description  \n                String                    name            Code  \n       enter_italics_mode                 sitm            ZH             Enter italic mode  \n       exit_italics_mode                  ritm            ZR             End italic mode  \n\nThen, I used infocmp to dump each terminal description so I could see which terminals supported italics:  \nfor i in $( find /usr/share/terminfo -type f ) ; do \n    j=${i##*/}; hdr=\"$( infocmp $j | head -n 1)\";  \n    infocmp $j | egrep -q 'sitm|ZH' \n    if [ $? = 0 ] ; then echo $hdr; fi; \ndone\n# Reconstructed via infocmp from file: /usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt-unicode-256color\n# Reconstructed via infocmp from file: /usr/share/terminfo/o/opus3n1+\n# Reconstructed via infocmp from file: /usr/share/terminfo/i/iris-color\n\nSo, these three terminal-types (rxvt-unicode-256color, opus3n1+, iris-color) support italics. Others do not.\nSince I could not find a terminal definition for \"gnome-terminal\" (see ls /usr/share/terminfo/g/, I looked for italics in all. Try infocmp $TERM to see what capabilities your terminal supports. Read man tput to see how to emit control sequences. \n\nA: Gnome terminal does support italics (at least in version 3.8.4). You can test terminal support for italics by executing $ echo -e \"\\e[3mfoo\\e[23m\". If you see foo printed in italics, foo, then terminal supports it.\nThen you have to insert the following in .vimrc:\nset t_ZH=^[[3m\nset t_ZR=^[[23m\n\nNote that ^[ is a single character and can in vim insert mode be inserted by typing <ctrl>-v <esc>.\nAfter that you have to tell vim to italicize comments. You can quickly test if it works by executing :highlight Comment cterm=italic in vim when file with some comments is open. Comments should get italicized right away.\nI found the above instructions on reddit (Italics in terminal vim and tmux), but I didn't have to follow all the steps listed there.

I have Ubuntu 13.10 and I am running live image as making an entry in grub as per the tutorial: http://www.tecmint.com/run-linux-live-images-from-hard-disk-in-linux. So is there any way to make the changes persist? I want to save few changes like my wireless drivers, so if I am able to do so, it would save me from installing drivers every time I boot.\n\nA: Setting Up Your USB Stick\nSetting up a device for use as Live CD persistent storage device is fairly simple. We just partition it and format it while giving it a special name that the Live CD recognizes. Although you can use any device visible to the CD for persistent storage, in this example we will discuss using a USB stick since they are pretty common now and are relatively inexpensive. There are no minimum size requirements for your storage device, but naturally, the more storage space you have the more applications you can install and settings you can save.\nPlug your USB Stick into your computer and let's get it ready for Live CD persistence.\nNote: If you previously followed the instructions on this page for \"casper-cow\" and it didn't work, that's because it should have read \"casper-rw\".\nNote 2: In the instructions below the ext3 file-system is used. For a memory stick however where space is tight, the ext2 file-system will use up considerably less overhead and is probably good enough for this purpose.\nNote 3: The instructions use all terminal commands, many of them looking quite serious. However it can all be done using the graphical Gnome Partition Editor tool you find in the System -> Administration menu. The exception is giving the partition a label, for this you'd still need to go to a terminal and issue the command\nsudo e2label /dev/<yourpartition> casper-rw\nDetermine Which Device Your USB Stick Is\nNote: if you prefer, you can use GPartEd to identify and format the usb thumb drive to ext3 (or a different compatible format) and then skip directly to the \"Creating the \"casper-rw\" File System\" section.\nIn order to partition and format your USB Stick, we first need to determine which device your computer recognizes it as and what its mount point is. To find this information run the following command:\ndf -h\nThe output of df -h should look something like this:\nFilesystem    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/hda1     187G  4.0G  183G   3% /\nvarlock       9.3G  507M  8.8G   6% /var/lock\nudev          506M  156K  506M   1% /dev\ndevshm        506M     0  506M   0% /dev/shm\n/dev/hdb3     7.5G  1.4M  7.5G   1% /tmp\n/dev/hdb2     9.3G  507M  8.8G   6% /var\n/dev/sda1     124M   31M   94M  25% /media/USB DISK\nAs you can see, on my computer, my USB Stick is the last entry in the list and is seen as /dev/sda1 and is mounted and accessible at /media/USB DISK. Now that we know where our USB Stick is, let's go ahead and partition it properly.\nPartitioning Your USB Stick\nPartitioning your USB Stick is a fairly simple task and only requires a few short steps. To partition your USB Stick we will use the command fdisk so run the following command to start the process (replacing /dev/sda with your device path):\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\nWithout getting in depth about how to use fdisk (which is outside the scope of this document) here is how you can partition your USB by deleting any existing partitions and creating one new partition.\nFirst type “p” at the command prompt and hit  to print the current partition table. The output of this command should look something like this:\n Command (m for help): p\n\n Disk /dev/sda: 130 MB, 130023424 bytes\n 16 heads, 32 sectors/track, 496 cylinders\n Units = cylinders of 512 * 512 = 262144 bytes\n\n Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n /dev/sda1   *           1         496      126960    6  FAT16\n\nAgain, for this example, we will just delete all of the existing partitions so now type “d” at the command prompt. Then enter the number of the partition you wish to delete. Repeat this process for each partition on your USB Stick until they are all deleted. The following is a example of what your session might look like:\n Command (m for help): d\n Partition number (1-4): 1\n\n Command (m for help): d\n Partition number (1-4): 2\n\n Command (m for help): d\n Partition number (1-4): 3\n\n Command (m for help): d\n Selected partition 4\n\n Command (m for help): p\n\n Disk /dev/sda1: 130 MB, 130007040 bytes\n 16 heads, 32 sectors/track, 495 cylinders\n Units = cylinders of 512 * 512 = 262144 bytes\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n\nCommand (m for help):\nAs you can see we have now deleted all of the partitions on our USB Stick. Now we can create one new partition by typing “n” at the command prompt followed by your desired partition number. Once that is done type “w” and hit  to write the partition table changes to your USB Stick. Here is the output from my session:\n Command (m for help): n\n Command action\n   e   extended\n   p   primary partition (1-4)\n p\n Partition number (1-4): 1\n First cylinder (1-495, default 1):\n Using default value 1\n Last cylinder or +size or +sizeM or +sizeK (1-495, default 495):\n Using default value 495\n\n Command (m for help): w\n The partition table has been altered!\n\n Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.\n\n WARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 22: Invalid argument.\n The kernel still uses the old table.\n The new table will be used at the next reboot.\n Syncing disks.\n\nNow that we have our partition table all set let's format it.\nCreating the \"casper-rw\" File System\nFormatting your USB Stick is also a very simple task. First we will unmount the device so we can format it, then just format it.\nFirst unmount your USB Stick by running the following command:\nsudo umount /dev/sda1\nNow that your USB Stick is unmounted we can format it. The only special consideration is that we must give the formatted partition the label “casper-rw”. This is the name the Live CD looks for to store persistent information. You can properly format your USB Stick by issuing the following command:\nsudo mkfs.ext3 -b 4096 -L casper-rw /dev/sda1\nThe output of this command should look something like this:\n mke2fs 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)\n Filesystem label=casper-rw\n OS type: Linux\n Block size=4096 (log=2)\n Fragment size=4096 (log=2)\n 31744 inodes, 31740 blocks\n 1587 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user\n First data block=0\n 1 block group\n 32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group\n 31744 inodes per group\n\n Writing inode tables: done\n Creating journal (1024 blocks): done\n Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done\n\n This filesystem will be automatically checked every 20 mounts or\n 180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.\n\nNOTE: This example uses the ext3 file system, but almost any file system should work. Among the file systems which won't work are VFAT and NTFS\nNow that we have our partition created and formatted all that is left to do is use it. So let's go use it!\n__Using a Loopback File__\nInstead of using a USB stick, you can use a file on your hard disk to store persistent information. The file must be named casper-rw and must be on the root of a partition. This partition can be any type that can be mounted automatically (e.g. vfat or ext3). (The persistent mode still works, if the file is created on the root partition of an USB stick.)\nThe following commands assume that a partition is mounted at /media/hda1. You can use any partition; even / will do fine. A file 128 MB in size will be created on this partition. To change the size, modify the count parameter of the \"dd\" command.\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/media/hda1/casper-rw bs=1M count=128\n 128+0 records in\n 128+0 records out\n 134217728 bytes transferred in 0.947819 seconds (141606919 bytes/sec)\n\nmkfs.ext3 /media/hda1/casper-rw\n mke2fs 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)\n /media/hda1/casper-rw is not a block special device.\n Proceed anyway? (y,n) y\n Filesystem label=\n OS type: Linux\n Block size=1024 (log=0)\n Fragment size=1024 (log=0)\n 32768 inodes, 131072 blocks\n 6553 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user\n First data block=1\n 16 block groups\n 8192 blocks per group, 8192 fragments per group\n 2048 inodes per group\n Superblock backups stored on blocks:\n    8193, 24577, 40961, 57345, 73729\n\n Writing inode tables: done\n Creating journal (4096 blocks): done\n Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done\n\n This filesystem will be automatically checked every 23 mounts or\n 180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.\n\nThat's it! You can now boot the Live CD as described below.\nBooting the Live CD in Persistent Mode\nNow we get to enjoy the fruits of our labor. Make sure your USB Stick is plugged into your computer and take the Live CD that you downloaded and burned earlier and put it in your CD drive (if it is not already there). Reboot your computer and boot up using this Live CD.\nBefore you reboot there are only two things that you need to remember. When the Live CD menu gets displayed hit the  key to enter “Other Options”. This will display the arguments that the Live CD passes to the kernel. At the end of this argument list just add a space and add the word “persistent”. This will instruct the Live CD to maintain and use persistence. That is all. Go for it!\nNote: It appears that with Flight 5, you need to create a new user in the Live CD session (go System -> Administration -> Users + Groups, then press the \"Add User\" button) for it to save your settings; it does not appear to save most changes to the default user, \"ubuntu\". When you create the new user, be sure to check the box in the \"user privileges\" tab that says \"executing system administration tasks\" or you'll be pretty limited in what you can do Smile :)\nWhen you get back, or better yet, when you boot into your live environment come back to this page and see how you perform a few basic tests to make sure everything is working correctly.\nVerifying That Everything Worked\nHere are a few simple things you can do to verify that everything is working as expected.\nReboot the Live CD/USB\nThe first simple thing you can do to verify that persistence is working is install a few applications and change some environment settings (some thing highly visible and easily recognizable) like your theme or add some GNOME panel icons. Then just reboot... Hit , enter in “persistent” on the kernel arguments list and boot into your new custom Live CD environment. Your newly installed applications and your custom settings should all still be there.\nIf you want to dig a little deeper you could always inspect the contents of your USB Stick. This will also give you deeper insight into how this great system works.\n(you can do this from the Live CD by going System -> Administration -> Disks, selecting the appropriate drive, setting the access path to /mnt and pressing the Enable button followed by the Browse button)\nInvestigating What Is Now On Your \"casper-rw\"\nAnother relatively simple thing you can do to verify that everything is working and to learn more about how everything works is to just inspect what is now on your USB Stick in isolation. Reboot back into your regularly installed system, plug in your USB Stick and just have a look around. The contents of your USB Stick is what makes your custom environment your own.\nAutomatic Persistence\nBy using reconstructor a CD can be remastered and an additional menu item (Persistent Mode) added on boot. The persistent mode was added as the default. No changes were made to the CD except for adding the persistent menu item. This may be best described in another how-to. If there is a place where a persistent ISO can be uploaded I'd be glad to share\nConclusion\nThe new Ubuntu Live CD persistence is an excellent capability and in addition to current Live CD uses, this will certainly make Live CDs very much more viable, useful and important. Now you can carry around your own custom Ubuntu environment on a CD and USB Stick that all just fits in your pocket. Now go gloat to your friends and co-workers about how much Ubuntu ROCKS! \nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD/Persistence\nIf you encounter the problem of booting without persistence on on UEFI pc.

Or not if you just to create a bootable USB stick it's here How to create a bootable USB stick on Windows\n\nA: You do not have to copy the .iso file onto the pen drive. If you are on Windows follow http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows. If on Ubuntu use Startup Disk Creator that comes bundled with Ubuntu. \n\nA: Use Universal USB Installer to load your iso to the USB stick.

I return a function f, lets say f=logn.

Perl seems to be the simplest to rand and format.\nerror=$(perl -e 'printf(\"%.2f\\n\", rand()/2)')\n\nInstead of working out your log then working out an error multiplied by that and adding it on, you could just add 1 to the error and multiply the first result in one step:\nerror=$(perl -e 'printf(\"%.2f\\n\", rand()/2 + 1)')\necho \"l($i) * $error\" | bc -l\n\nI guess there's also an argument for staying in one language (rather than punting a number between things as a string). We still have to pass $i in but we can handle the rest in Perl:\nexport i=2\nperl -e 'print log($ENV{i})*(rand()/2+1)'\n\n\nA: Bash $RANDOM generates integers only, you could use /dev/urandom or /dev/random.\nHere is a Python one liner embed inside a bash script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# get a decimal random from the range of 0.0 up to 0.05\nresult=$(python -c \"import random;print(random.uniform(0.0, 0.05))\")\n# do something with the generated random\necho $result\n\n", "Q: How do I boot into a uefi usb drive?

Better than anything, it has a -format argument where you can do maths! \nfind -iname '*.jpg' -exec identify -format \"%[fx:w*h] %i\\n\" {} \\+ | sort -g\n\nUnfortunately, if you get above a certain size, you get scientific notation (eg 1.2*10^3) instead of an integer back from identify. Thankfully sort has a -g argument that will parse them out.\nOn the same files here, this version (not forking out to Perl) only take 60% of the time the Perl version does. That's not to say Perl is slow, but going into perl and subshelling back out is an unnecessary complication that's slowing things down (I think).\nMine still isn't ideal. Needing to parse numbers back to integers for sorting is fairly slow. Ideally you'd  do this all internally in one language where the size remains as an integer throughout... But the above is the shortest, sharpest one-liner I can do.\n\nA: If you're looking for a command-line tool, the following command will sort image files where the highest resolution comes first:\nfind . -iname \"*.png\" -o -iname \"*.jpg\" | perl -e '$f=sub{eval(`identify -format %w*%h ${\\quotemeta(shift)} 2>/dev/null`)};print sort{$f->($b)<=>$f->($a)}<>'\n\nI'm basically sorting the files using perl sort sub-subroutine where the key here is to call the identify command and eval its formatted output.\nidentify is available with the imagemagick package:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nUPDATE:\nThe following command will also output the resolution:\nfind . -iname \"*.png\" -o -iname \"*.jpg\" | perl -e '$f=sub{`identify -format %w*%h ${\\quotemeta(shift)} 2>/dev/null`};chomp&&print \"$_\\t\".$f->($_) for sort{eval($f->($b))<=>eval($f->($a))}<>'\n\nExample:\n./foo bar.png   1600*900\n./baz.png       1600*900\n./img_0004.jpg  1280*720\n./img_0006.jpg  1280*720\n./img_0001.jpg  1280*720\n./img_0003.jpg  1280*720\n./img_0002.jpg  1280*720\n./img_0005.jpg  1280*720\n./launcher.png  385*632\n./textfield.png 402*329\n./foo2.png      202*229\n\n\nA: Using find, file --mime-type, identify, awk and sort\nUsing file --mime-type we find all images, even without an extension.\nThe one-line at the end of this answer has a problem with newlines in the file name.

Of course with any disk operations a disk backup is recommended.\nBy the way, you should be able to download the Ubuntu LiveCD for desktops and use it in your VM by booting the iso, that does not destroy your current setup and might make you life easier while repartitioning. \n\nA: You can expand the partition if the disk is now bigger but as you're not using LVM, you have to do this with the partition offline... Which means you need to boot your VM into a Live environment.\nI'd personally just download the Desktop ISO, boot the VM to that and then use Gparted to alter the partitions (in a nice graphical way). Apply that and reboot and you should find your VM's sda1 has increased.\n\nA: Short answer: You can't do that (have a root partition spanning two volumes) with a normal install (AFAIK). You have a couple of possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu, this time using a LVM installation. You can check the instructions here. As you see it's not straight forward but it is really flexible when it's correctly set up.\n\n*Move your 20G hard disk to the SAN. Grow it to 40G using VMWare. Boot your VM using a LiveCD and resize your partition. Remove the local 20G disk from the VM. You will only have 40G but this is the easier way. No need to reinstall or to configure anything inside your VM. As a bonus there is no risk of data loss as your original hard disk is not touched.\n\n*Use the new 40G hard disk not as /, but as the directory where most of your date reside.

I dislike this because I'm clumsy and typically end up scrolling the window I'm in when I try to click the wheel. So I wanted to automatically remap the top side button (#9 in this case) to the middle button (#2). I also wanted to map the bottom side button (#8) so that it executes a double-click of the left button (#1).\nThough my aims were specific, the solutions below can be generalized to any situation in which you want to automatically remap mouse buttons at startup.\nMapping Mouse Buttons to Other Mouse Buttons\nYou will need xinput installed for this task. This can be done entirely in your .xsessionrc file. First, use xinput to discover the name that is assigned to your mouse, which is then correlated to an input device ID. Below is some sample output from my laptop:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer            id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Laser Mouse              id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard           id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nMy mouse calls itself Logitech USB Laser Mouse and is shown as id=11. Your mouse will have a different name; figuring that out is left as an exercise for the reader.\nWhile you still know the ID of the device in this session, find out how many buttons the input handler thinks your mouse has, by using xinput list deviceID. This may be different from the number of buttons that is apparent on the device.\nLogitech USB Laser Mouse                    id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n    Reporting 7 classes:\n        Class originated from: 11. Type: XIButtonClass\n        Buttons supported: 16\n        Button labels: \"Button Left\" \"Button Middle\" \"Button Right\" \"Button Wheel Up\" \"Button Wheel Down\" \"Button Horiz Wheel Left\" \"Button Horiz Wheel Right\" \"Button Side\" \"Button Extra\" \"Button Forward\" \"Button Back\" \"Button Task\" \"Button Unknown\" \"Button Unknown\" \"Button Unknown\" \"Button Unknown\"\n\nWith my mouse, there are only 9 obvious physical buttons, but xinput reports 16.\nGiven the nature of USB, this ID can change every time you restart, so it's not enough to script something that's statically keyed to an ID you discover once. You'll have to dynamically parse this at startup and execute your re-map based on the current ID.\nNow that you know its name, you can use xinput test deviceID to figure out which key to remap. Press the mouse buttons you want to map from and to, in order to get their indices. (For reference, 1, 2, and 3 \"always\" (i.e., usually) refer to the left, middle, and right buttons of a 3-button mouse. A common re-map reverses these to make the mouse left-handed.)\nbutton press   2\nbutton release 2\nbutton press   9\nbutton release 9\n\nIn this case I found that I want to map button #9 (side, top) to button #2 (middle).\nNow that you know what your mouse is called, and which buttons you want to change, you can write an ~/.xsessionrc script that invokes xinput to execute the button re-mapping at startup. Below is my complete script.\n# Map button 9 (top side button) to button 2 (middle button)\nmy_mouse_id=$(xinput | grep -m 1 \"Logitech USB Laser Mouse\" | sed 's/^.*id=\\([0-9]*\\)[ \\t].*$/\\1/')\necho $my_mouse_id > ~/temp/my_mouse_id\nxinput set-button-map $my_mouse_id 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n\nThe first line here sets a temporary session variable equal to the ID of the mouse as reported by xinput. This is done by greping for the known name of the mouse in the report from xinput, then using sed to extract the ID number from that id=xxx token in the report. This value is then used in an xinput set-button-map directive, which executes the re-mapping. In the example above, the only change is that button #9 is being re-mapped to mimic button #2. All others remain at their default setting.\nUpdate: As @Lokasenna points out below, if your device reports itself as both a mouse and a keyboard, you may need to limit the result count of the grep using -m 1. This will not cause problems if the mouse doesn't report itself as both, so it's been included in the script.\nMapping Mouse Buttons to Arbitrary Functions\nSee also this answer.\nYou will need xinput, xbindkeys, and xautomation (including xte) installed for this task.\nUse xinput list and xinput test to discover your mouse's device ID and the number of the button you want to assign. In my case, I wanted to map the bottom side button (#8) to a double-click of the left button (#1).\nCreate or edit ~/.xbindkeysrc. The format of this file is a series of paired lines. The first line is a command to be executed for an event; the second line is the event description. We will use the xte component of xautomation to send events directly to the input handler.\nTo create a double-click event when a button is released, I added the following:\n\"/usr/bin/xte 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1' &\"\nb:8 + Release\n\nThis configuration maps a sequence of two mouse clicks on button #1 to the release of button #8. (In theory I guess you could map any command to a mouse button, but this is the most common case. See this answer for other practical examples.)\nUpdate for 16.04 Ubuntu\nFor users with multiple mice attached to your system, you need to also pass in the ID of the device. This may not apply to all users and was discovered on Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity.\nxinput list\n\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Kensington      Kensington Expert Mouse   id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint                     id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nThen modify the .xbindkeysrc file by referencing the id= value from the command output (id=9 in this example):\n\"/usr/bin/xte -i 9 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1' &\"\nb:8 + Release\n\n\nA: I was able to change the mapping of my Logitech mouse's middle button to 'Return' using Easystroke Gesture Recognition which I downloaded from the Ubuntu Software Center. Edit: In the application, you would select Add Action, Name it, select the key type, click on Details and press Enter, hit Record Stroke, and during the prompt press down on the middle button.\n\nA: Prior to 12.04 there was an easy graphical tool called \"btnx\" in the standard repository, which added as \"Button properties\" in System Configuration.

Can Shotwell be configured to publish the CR2 file to Google instead of the JPEG? I was extremely disappointed to discover that all the time I spend publishing photos was wasted because it used the JPEG versions! \nUnfortunately the files it uploads are named IMG_xxx.CR2.jpg so that when you're viewing file details on Google, it hides the jpg extention and unless you notice the file is too small or download the full version you'll never know what happened. \nIt wouldn't be quite as bad if the JPEG was a 100% version, but it's not.

I want to install Synthesia, but the creators didn't bother with a Linux version (as usual). They said it would run under Wine 1.4, but my wine is higher than that apparently, and I don't know how to downgrade it. However, I saw that someone had made a Linux version called Linthesia [hypertext removed due to low reputation - <10 reputation = >2 links not allowed in posts] and put it up on Sourceforge in the form of a .src.tgz file. I have installed both Synthesia and Linthesia and currently am able to use neither (the audio doesn't work in Synthesia under my current version of Wine). Could someone please walk me through the steps of either installing Linthesia from the .src.tgz file or downgrading my Wine.\nThanks,\nNum\nYes, there is a README in the .src.tgz file.

So, just create a regular user, not an administrator. Then add this line to /etc/sudoers (do that by running sudo vosudo):\nusername ALL=PASSWD:/sbin/ifconfig\n\nThe user username will now have the right to run ifconfig but not anything else that a normal user wouldn't need to.

How do I fix this?\nthanks!\n\nA: I had the same issue, and here's how I solved it:\nAdding it via drag and drop from /usr/share/applications using nautilus was always giving me the duplicated unity launcher icons.\nI launched the application from a terminal window and used the \"Lock to launcher\" right click option on its panel icon, which seemed to work as expected once I dropped into the launcher from nautilus.\nThe problem was the desktop file from /usr/share/applications has some extra features which the drag-and-drop-generated shortcut(located in ~/.local/share/applications) was missing, like \"New Window\" and \"New file\" right click menu options, which I didn't want to lose. So I tried to see what's different between them, and the only significant difference I could see was this attribute:\n\nStartupWMClass=Sublime_text\n\nOnce I added that to the .desktop file from /usr/share/applications it started working. I then deleted the generated shortcut from ~/.local/share/applications and it seems to work.\nI hope this helps you as well. \n\nA: you can replace the default icon like this\n$ cd ~/Downloads\n$ wget http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/alecive/flatwoken/512/Apps-sublime-text-icon.png\n$ gksu 'gedit /usr/share/applications/sublime-text.desktop'\n\nchange this line: \n\nIcon=sublime-text\n\nto \n\nicon=~/Downloads/Apps-sublime-text-icon.png\n\nsave it \n", "Q: Duplicate file ~ in root folder I have a copy of all the files in my root folder with ~ symbol. I can see it on the terminal but not in the folder. How do i stop this\n\nA: Just in case:\nTo prevent Gedit from creating backups in the future, open up gedit, open up the Preferences dialog (Edit > Preferences), select the Editor tab, remove the check in the “Create a backup copy of files before saving” option, and click Close. After doing this, Gedit will no longer make the backups with tildes all over the place.\nPlease, include more details to receive more feedback.\n\nA: You don't. These are backup files generated by most editors when you change a text file. You really shouldn't worry about them, and they can very often save you. They are not shown in the GUI because they are considered hidden files.\nWhile you can disable their creation by tweaking the settings of the editor you use (see here for how to do this for gedit), I strongly recommend that you leave them be. You never know when having them might save you from loosing a few hours of work.\n", "Q: Dual boot data lost possibilities DiskDrive has 4 partitions C: D: E: F: \nC: drive has Windows Xp and D: drive is completely free. How I can install UBUNTU 14.04 LTS on D: drive and which partition and mount type I should use ,so will my data lost on drive other E: and F:?\n\nA: This is an old quedtion but an answer was never accepted, and it misses an important point, it's possible to install Ubuntu alongside Windows in the Windows partition. Now I don't know if that includes a D drive or can only be done on the C drive but the Ubuntu install lives on the NTFS partition and (assuming sufficient free space) does not require any other partitioning.\nHere's an interesting question where the user does not see this option and why/how to fix it.\nHere is a great question with a very technical long answer,search for \"alongside\"\nI am not certain this is an option any longer in Ubuntu 15 but for situations where Windows is on a logical partition it should be an option when installing Ubuntu 14.10.\n\nA: You can't install Ubuntu on D: drive. The D: drive is just a partition that Windows calls D:. Get rid of the D: partition and make a partition with the ext4 filesystem for Ubuntu. Turn the D: drive into free space THEN make the ext4 filesystem with the free space.\n", "Q: Manipulating users' computers remotely I need some service similar to Windows Terminal Services, which provides the ability to host multiple, simultaneous client sessions. \nSo, users run their applications on a remote server as if on their local computers.

Currently I have OOM disabled and a dummy process to test the control group, when the limit in memory is reached, the process freezes (as expected) but when I try to set a larger limit (like 2 times more memory), the echo command fails and the process stays frozen. \nHow can I set dynamic memory usage limits in a cgroup without moving the processes to another cgroup with the new limits set?\n\nA: When you mention \"dynamic limits\" using cgroups, you need to be a little more specific on what you are looking for. Its best to provide an example of what your app and cgroup does along with the cgconfig.conf. This would give us better picture.\nAlthough cgroups, allows limiting a process to certain amount of memory using memory.limit_in_bytes in cgconfig.conf, it only sets the upper bound and does not complain if your process uses a lower limit. Therefore, I am not sure if you require cgroups in this case. \nTherefore, if your program is allocating memory dynamically you may also need to check how much of memory is being over commited. Check the kernel tunables using sysctl -a | grep overcommit and change to always overcommit regardless of whether memory is available or not.\n\nA: Well, after some research I've found that some parameters in a cgroup cannot be modified when there are tasks on it. \nSadly, the memory limit parameters are one of those. \nI think my last option is to use the task migration feature and create cgroups with new memory limits on demand.\n", "Q: Install pygame in anaconda I have anaconda on Ubuntu 14.04.

I am creating a configuration package, and would like to stop and restart services whose configuration is affected. Right now I am using the service [stop|restart] in {pre,post}{inst,rm} way. I read in a question somewhere that invoke-rc.d is the right way, because it honours user preferences about a service. However, I couldn't find any guidelines about this. Does anyone know of such guidelines? Or have any advice as to which way I should pick? The package is of internal use, and will likely only be for 14.04 for the next two years. However, I'd like to leave as clean a state as possible for my successor, so systemd is in my mind as well.\nFrom the invoke-rc.d man page:\n\nAll access to the init scripts by Debian packages'  maintainer  scripts\n         should be done through invoke-rc.d.\n\nFrom the Debian Policy Manual, Chapter 9, Section 3.3:\n\nMaintainers should use the abstraction layer provided by the update-rc.d and invoke-rc.d programs to deal with initscripts in their packages' scripts such as postinst, prerm and postrm.\n...\nThe package maintainer scripts must use invoke-rc.d to invoke the /etc/init.d/* initscripts, instead of calling them directly.\n\nDebian has been using sysv-init and will shift directly to systemd, and I suppose the policy manual will be updated in due time to refer to systemctl. However, what I am uncertain about is this: Should I use invoke-rc.d instead of service? I can tell dpkg that I am interested in some files (via triggers), so is there a way to tell dpkg that I am interested in some services as well and get dpkg to do the restarting/reloading?\nTo clarify: I am not writing init scripts. I am providing a package with configuration for other applications, like Puppet, NTP, etc., so I stop and restart the corresponding services in the scripts.\nHere, for example, is a Docker issue about invoke-rc.d vs service. The issue is still open, with one person, probably a maintainer, commenting that they are definitely interested in doing this the right way - clearly neither of us are sure what that is. (My question is independent of that issue.)\n\nA: I would continue to use the pre/post inst scripts, \n\npreinst - This script executes before that package will be unpacked from its Debian archive (\".deb\") file. Many 'preinst' scripts stop services for packages which are being upgraded until their installation or upgrade is completed (following the successful execution of the 'postinst' script).\npostinst - This script typically completes any required configuration of the package foo once foo has been unpacked from its Debian archive (\".deb\") file. Often, 'postinst' scripts ask the user for input, and/or warn the user that if he accepts default values, he should remember to go back and re-configure that package as the situation warrants. Many 'postinst' scripts then execute any commands necessary to start or restart a service once a new package has been installed or upgraded.\n\nsee - https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html\nThe syntax of invoking start|stop|restart is written as a conditional, see https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html section 9.3.3.2 Running initscripts\n\nif which invoke-rc.d >/dev/null 2>&1; then\ninvoke-rc.d package \nelse\n/etc/init.d/package \nfi\n\nso ...\nif which service >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n        service package <action>\nelif which invoke-rc.d >/dev/null 2>&1; then\n        invoke-rc.d package <action>\nelse\n        /etc/init.d/package <action>\nfi\n\nand add another conditional for systemd when needed ;)\nSo yes, the proper way to start|stop|restart a service is with the appropriate wrapper script (invoke-rc.d / system), when possible, rather then calling the init script (/etc/init.d/package) and falling back to the /etc/init.d script when no wrapper is available.\n\nA: A better way for systemd systems is to use deb-systemd-invoke.\n", "Q: Xfce4 Alt F2 - xfrun4 command impotent in 14.04 Trusty I get used to run simple commands using Alt+F2 shortcut in 12.04 LTS Precise.\nMost of them needed sudo, others dont but mostly those are simply terminal commands.\nSo there must be checked \"Run in terminal\", and if started by sudo, password was asked.

I know that whenever I stick the USB into a Windows PC, I have the option of checking for errors, so is this procedure sufficient?\n\nA: If you are using NTFS on the drive, the open source NTFS utility is not capable of handling all the errors that the Windows utility can handle. In such cases, you have to check the disk from Windows. However, if you are going to format anyway, you can do that from Ubuntu, since Ubuntu does mount it as a read-only system, allowing you to backup content from it, while preventing further damage.\n", "Q: pptpd VPN: No internet access after connecting I've followed the instructions in this tutorial to set up a vpn server, so that I can connect to that and surf the internet virtually from another location.

I assume “net.ipv4.ip_forward” is commented in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:\nnano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nAdd or find and comment out the following line\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nSave, close the file and run the following command to make the changes take effect.\nsysctl -p\n\nThe following iptables firewall rules allow port 1723, GRE and perform NAT\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1723 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT\niptables -I INPUT -p gre -j ACCEPT\niptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nIn the last rule replace “eth0″ with the interface connecting to the internet on your VPN server.

This made clear that the tunnel was ok to the pptp server.\nThe problem was the fact that I had in this machine two independent up-links exposed to internet (ie. mainInf and support), both configured via netplan (no problem with that)\nbut, despite connecting to the pptp server using the IP address of the 1st up-link (i-face called mainInf), my default gateway was running in the seccond up-link (support).\nThe solution was to adjust the NAT to the correct output gateway and that allowed packets to reach other servers\nit was initially (not working)\niptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o mainInf -j MASQUERADE\n\n(have in your mind that, in our case, the connection to the pptp server is via an IP allocated in the mainInf adapter/uplink)\nand after changing to the same adapter/uplink as the default gateway (support), it worked:\niptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o support -j MASQUERADE\n\nHence, if you can stability the VPN connection, ping or connect the pptp server (via ssh in our case), but cannot reach any IP that is not in that server, you probably have a routing/forwarding issue.\n4 helpful commands for troubleshoting:\n\n*\n\n*watch iptables -t nat -L -nv\n\n*watch iptables -L -nv\n\n*route -n\n\n*tcpdump -i  -s 0 tcp port 1723 or proto 47 (read more here)\n\n", "Q: What is wrong with the browser Surf?

I'm using an Ubuntu system to download suspicious/suspected malware files for analysis.  I need to zip each file and password protect it to prevent accidentally infecting other systems when transferring the files. the \n\nA: You have two options with zip:\n\n  -e\n  --encrypt\n          Encrypt  the  contents of the zip archive using a password which\n          is entered on the terminal in response to a  prompt  (this  will\n          not  be  echoed;  if  standard error is not a tty, zip will exit\n          with an error).  The password prompt is  repeated  to  save  the\n          user from typing errors.\n  -P password\n  --password password\n          Use password to encrypt  zipfile  entries  (if  any).   THIS  IS\n          INSECURE!   Many  multi-user  operating systems provide ways for\n          any user to see the current command line of any other user; even\n          on  stand-alone  systems there is always the threat of over-the-\n          shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext password as part  of  a\n          command  line  in  an  automated script is even worse.  Whenever\n          possible, use  the  non-echoing,  interactive  prompt  to  enter\n          passwords.   (And  where security is truly important, use strong\n          encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively\n          weak standard encryption provided by zipfile utilities.)\n\n\nSo if you really wish to script this, you'll need to use -P, since -e forces the manual entry of passwords. Do so only if you are the only user in your environment, or if /proc was mounted with appropriate permissions (even then root will be able to see the password).\nThis command should do the trick:\ncd <path_to_directory>\nfind . -type f -printf \"../%f.zip\\0%f\\0\" | xargs -0n 2 zip -P pass\n\nThis will create zip files of each file, with the same name as that file (i.e., blah.doc will create blah.doc.zip) in the parent directory, each protected by the password pass.\n\nA: This may not be exactly what you wanted; I wasn't quite sure what you meant? My code assumes 3 things: you only have 1 file (or set of files) you wish to place into a single archive, you save the virus file in your user's \"Downloads\" folder, and you have created a folder called \"Viruses\" in your user's home folder that contains a sub-folder called \"Saved\"; this is where the finished file will be.\nUpon running the command the virus file will be put into a password protected .zip archive (you will be prompted to pick a password), moved to the \"Viruses\" folder and renamed virus.zip, and then moved to the \"Viruses/Saved\" folder. The original virus file will be deleted from \"Downloads\" (as well as anything else you have in that folder!!!).\nWhen you download another virus, and run the command again. The current \"virus.zip\" will be named \"virus.zip~1~\" and the new file will be named virus.zip. If you run the command again the current \"virus.zip\" will be named \"virus.zip~1~\", the current \"virus.zip~1~\" will be named \"virus.zip~2~\", and the new virus archive will be named virus.zip. This will happen everytime you run the command.\nTo see these files you will need to allow showing hidden files.

I am currently running Ubuntu 12.04, with Deja Dup 22.0.\nI would like to update Deja Dup to later releases so I can utilize the integrity check feature for the backups, as suggested here: (How can I test the integrity of a backup made with Backup (Deja Dup)?)\nHowever apt-get install --only-upgrade deja-dup, states that I already have the newest version (22.0). What is the optimal way to safely upgrade Deja Dup to newer versions on Ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: According to http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=deja-dup, 22.0 is the current version available for precise. All the newer ones are for newer releases. The Launchpad page for Deja Dup says that there are two options: the official repository, or a daily PPA. I don't recommend a daily PPA for something critical like a backup utility. However, it looks like the daily PPA hasn't been updated in months, so it might be missing bug fixes, or it might be perfectly stable. You can perhaps get the source package for trusty and the relevant dependencies and build your own package. Unfortunately that does not look like an easy task, since v30.0 depends on a much newer version of libc6.\n", "Q: Installing X.org (opensource) Ubuntu driver in the terminal Software Center messed up my proprietary driver installation and I must revert to the original driver (the one you can find in \"Additional Drivers\" tab under software sources.\n\nHowever Software Center corrupted my video driver and Software Sources does not allow me to revert or change anything.

If you check the other postings in the series (by filtering on Category = GRUB) you will also find information on removing old kernels and what happens when a new kernel arrives as an update. The postings include references to a number of related web sites.\n\nA: Not ubuntu, but https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB#Hide_GRUB_unless_the_Shift_key_is_held_down should be helpful; basic gist is placing a custom script in /etc/grub.d which gets included in /boot/grub/grub.cfg when you run update-grub; script is lengthy so I'll not post here.\n\nA: I would suggest installing Grub Customizer with the following commands in the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nOnce this is installed, run it (should show in the dash) and go to the \"general settings\" tab. In here there is a section called \"visibility\". See if \"show menu\" or \"look for other operating systems\" is ticked and untick them, choose save and then reboot and see if it is fixed.\nThere may be a flag set to show menu anyhow. The other reason it can show the grub menu is if there is an error being reported and it suspects you want to boot into recovery mode.

It is in the standard repos and can be installed easily\n    sudo apt-get install vlc\n\nYou can get more info from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\n\nA: The inf file can't be read because you are using Ubuntu and not Windows. \"inf\" files are used by the Windows operating system.\nYou can use any installed Ubuntu media player instead of relying on Wine to play media like movies, DVDs or even music if Wine is not working. You should have AT LEAST one kind of media player with a basic Ubuntu installation. All of them are more capable than Microsoft applications. In Unity, search the apps from the desktop search and the same goes for Gnome. For Xubuntu, Ubuntustudio, and Lubuntu, choose application search to find a media player.

When there is a program that I want to watch, I know that it won't work in Chrome, won't work in Chromium, probably will work in Firefox, and when Firefox doesn't work, I use Chrome in Windows XP in VirtualBox (which also, very occasionally, won't play the video).\nThe website video uses Adobe Flash Player. The browsers use the following versions of Flash Player:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox: 11.2.202.378\n\n*Chromium: 13.0.0.206\n\n*Chrome: 14.0.0.125\n\n*VirtualBox>Windows XP>Chrome: 14.0.0.125\n\n\nWhy would Firefox (using older version of Flash Player) work, while Chromium and Chrome don't? I ask this question purely out of curiosity. It's been occurring for a year or two on several different computers using various Linux distros, so I'd love to get to the bottom of it. My main computer uses Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Chrome and Chromium have now changed to PepperFlashPlugin to run all flash and while it seems to be a newer version, has quite a few problems when playing content on certain sites and providing hardware acceleration for streaming videos on certain vide cards...\nPersonally I prefer Firefox because of the fact it still works with the original flash plugin and gives my much needed hardware support and seems that bit more stable...\n\nA: This solution has worked for me . Try it and see if it does for you . \nGo to software centre and remove chromium and all its plug ins . Open your firefox and follow this link https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/ . Once its downloaded open it with software centre and instal it . That installs Google Chrome stable for 64bit Ubuntu , not that crap that chromium is . All flash video works for me now ( FB , Youtube , et.. ) \n\nA: I still had the problem, even when I had installed the PepperFlashPlugin.\nSince then, it has started working. ie. I have been able to play videos on that website.\nThe only difference between then and now is that I now have broadband internet (ie. > 15Mbps).

A few hours ago I installed 14.04 ubuntu and configured it for 2 hours and it just crashed and ran in low graphics mode. I was unable to fix this by (got very tired of it) and I just reinstalled it. Now I am afraid of the same mistake - should you, or should you not install propriatery nvidia drivers?\n\nA: I would suggest going with the proprietary nvidia driver. From my experience, that seems to solve system crashes. Also, you have to reboot the system after installing the new drivers for the changes to take effect.\nHowever, if the system crashed after you had installed proprietary drivers AND rebooted for the changes to take effect, I would stick with opensource.\n", "Q: Global sudo session in ubuntu Is is possible to keep the sudo session for sometimes? I mean when you open synaptic, each time you have to authenticate. In a single terminal, sudo session exits for a specific amount of time. You don't need to authenticate each time you run something with sudo. Also user account (system settings) has this feature(unlock). Can we do it system wide?\nI don't recommend to disable password or login as root. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: From the sudoers man page:\nSUDOERS OPTIONS\ntty_tickets\n\nIf set, users must authenticate on a per-tty basis. With this flag enabled, sudo will use a separate record in the time stamp file for each tty. If disabled, a single record is used for all login sessions. This flag is on by default.\n\nIn other words, disabling tty_tickets creates a single ticket that is shared across every tty for that user. Authenticating on any tty creates a new ticket which becomes valid on every other tty belonging to that user, voila - no redundant password prompt just because you opened a new tab.\nI recommend setting defaults on a per-user basis, along the lines of:\necho Defaults:$USER '!tty_tickets' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/mycustomconf\n\nIf you really want to, I suppose, you could make a change to the global defaults in /etc/sudoers with visudo. Something like this placed with the other defaults near the top should do:\nDefaults    !tty_tickets\n\nSince the next question is usually \"how can I change the session timeout value?\", I figured I'd include it here for the sake of convenience:\n## disable per-tty auth, timeout after 15 minutes\necho Defaults:$USER '!tty_tickets', timestamp_timeout=15 | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/mycustomconf\n\n\nA: Extending time: \nFrom the sudo man page :\n-v          When given the -v (validate) option, sudo will\n                 update the user's cached credentials, authen‐\n                 ticating the user's password if necessary.\n                 For the sudoers plugin, this extends the sudo\n                 timeout for another 15 minutes (or whatever\n                 the timeout is set to by the security policy)\n                 but does not run a command.  Not all security\n                 policies support cached credentials.\n\nSo according to this , running sudo -v should extend the time\nLogin in as root: Yes, you said you don't recommend logging in as root, but that's cheapest way to keep root privileges for extended time.You can always exit or log out from root, so it's not like you have to kill the terminal completely or log out of tty completely\nsudo su\n\n$ sign should change to # when you done it\n", "Q: How can I make the login screen appear instead of logging me in automatically?

You can switch desktops by choosing logout (not shutdown or reboot) which will take you to the login screen where you can then choose a desktop.\nChoosing a desktop is persistent - next time you reboot it will take you back to the desktop you have chosen.\nTo disable to automatic login, you can use the 'User Accounts' program -> open the dash and type user...\n", "Q: Is it possible to assign a shortcut to \"Switch Account\" in the login screen of Ubuntu 14.04?

Everytime time I boot and login into my Xubuntu 14.10, Skype, Thunderbird and Firefox start up even though I closed them before I logged out and shut down. These programs are not in the list of autostart programs. So how can I reset the session?\n\nA: I had a similar problem in Xfce as well where goldendict kept opening on startup. In order to solve this, you go to session and startup on settings and go to the application autostart tab. Then go to add, and make the name and description whatever you would like. Under command put killall (program name). Add this for whatever programs you don't want on startup. Also, under general, you may want to uncheck the Automatically save session on logout. Under the session tab you may want to clear saved sessions.\n", "Q: Bash Function Oblivion I'm fairly new to Linux, as many of you may have noticed. What I speak particularly is adding personal, user-generated functions and alias in my .bashrc file. I'm not exactly sure how bash works but according to many posts I \"add it to the end of my .bashrc file.\" Which does not work when the command is executed through the Terminal. \n\nA: For login shells, .profile in your home directory will be executed. So if you have functions defined in .bashrc, make sure the file is included in .profile as below:\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    # include .bashrc if it exists\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nAlso, you can issue the command below:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nand then call your functions. This will make sure there is no problem in including any files.\n\nA: Whenever you open a new terminal, all the commands in your .bashrc are carried out (the file is 'sourced'). If you add a new command to your .bashrc, you need to either open a new terminal or issue one of the following commands:\n. ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nFor example, you could put on a new line (each command has to be on a new line -- well, that's actually a simplification, but it's enough for an absolute beginner to be getting on with) at the end of your .bashrc something like:\nalias hello='echo \"Hello, $USER\"'\n\n...then, once you've either opened a new, fresh terminal window or used one of the source commands, you should be able to type hello and get a greeting back from your machine.\nIf you are doing all this and the functions/aliases don't work, then there's probably something wrong with the specific functions or aliases that you're using. If you suspect that's the case, feel free to ask a separate question.\nAs for tutorials, one I found very clear and useful when I was starting out with bash was linuxcommand.\n", "Q: go back to vim's default color I read this :highlight Normal ctermfg=grey ctermbg=darkblue from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1117526/setting-the-vim-background-colors\nBut I change the darkblue to white!!

If not, is there an alternative that can do this? I'm not completely against opening Unison all the time and doing the sync manually, but when it opens you must select a profile, which corresponds to just one directory, so you have to sync each individually. Add to that, the IP address is dynamic, and therefore has to be edited. This is quite tedious, and it seems there should be a simpler way. Am I missing something? Is there a way to simplify this process (possibly a bash script)?\n\nA: My suggestion would be to solve the problem of the dynamic IP (most routers have the concept of address reservation, that you can use to \"fix\" the IP of your computer). After that, you can use the command line version of unison: \nunison -auto -batch profilename \n\nand you can add it to your login/logout scripts or as a cron job.\nIf you still need to change the ip, you can use sed in a script: \n\n\n*\n\n*create a template file in ~/.unison, newprof.tmpl,  like this: \nroot = /home/romano/\nroot = ssh://romano@MYIPHERE//home/romano/\n\npath = education\npath = research\n\n\n*create the following script, call it sync_newprof: \n#!/bin/bash\n# \ncd $HOME/.unison\ncat newprof.tmpl | sed s/MYIPHERE/$1 >! newprof.prf\nunison -auto -batch profilename\n\nbasically, we create a profile file changing the MYIPHERE word with the script first argument  \n\n*now you can call it as \nsync_newprof 1.1.1.1 \n\nand it will create the profile with the given IP and sync. \n\nA: On a local network you have two machines on which you want to securely and automatically synchronize /home/<username>/Desktop every 10 minutes: \"Host\" which runs your OpenSSH Server and \"Client\" which connects over SSH to \"Host\".\nOverview of Solution*\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup an OpenSSH Server on Host\n\n*Install Unison on the Client and Host\n\n*Create Script 1 so that cron can use <username>'s RSA key\n\n*Add two lines to <username>'s crontab, and \n\n*Set Script 1 to run on startup.\n\n\nSetup OpenSSH Server on Host\nSee  Setup SFTP Server to setup an OpenSSH server that listens for SSH connections as <username> on Host, uses a Static IP, listens on a non-standard port, refuses password-based connections, and allows RSA key connections if Host possesses the RSA public_key.\nInstall Unison on Client and Host\nOn both machines, run (unison-gtk is GUI if you want it):\nsudo apt-get install unison unison-gtk\n\nCreate One Script\ncron does not share the same ENVIRONMENT as <username> and thus will fail to find the Client RSA key needed to connect to Host.

Where it says \"Command:\", enter:\n/home/<username>/Documents/Scripts/set_ssh_env_for_cron_unison.sh\n\nCongratulations!\nIf all went well, you will enter the password to Client's RSA key upon Client login and you will not have to enter the password again throughout the login session. Every 10 minutes, Client will then automatically negotiate a passwordless SSH connection with Host and Unison will synchronize /home/<username>/Desktop and //HOST//home/<username>/Desktop. Your laptop and desktop may now be joined in holy synchromony.\n*Details:\nMy final setup communicates as <username> (not root) using a non-standard SSH port to “Host” at a static IP. Password Authentication is disabled on “Host” (requiring a pre-authenticated RSA key), while my RSA key on “Client” requires a password for use (once per login session). Thus, an attacker needs to guess the correct port, RSA key, and password to create a shell as <username> with “Host.” \nAfter this one password entry per login session, “Client” and “Host” synchronize themselves automatically every 10 minutes. This was the method I found would work using <username>'s RSA key and cron's ENVIRONMENT.**\nCAVEAT! Of course, if one or both machines are offline, shutdown, etc., they will not synchronize!\n**Please don't hesitate to let us know if there is a simpler method using an RSA key belonging to root on Client that does not require a password for use while Host simultaneously refuses password-based SSH connections.\n", "Q: Which Version of Ubuntu is arm build?

Let's see it:\ndavidm@illergard:~$ which python\n/usr/bin/python\ndavidm@illergard:~$ which ipython\n/usr/local/bin/ipython\n\ndavidm@illergard:~$ cat /usr/local/bin/ipython\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'ipython==2.1.0','console_scripts','ipython'\n__requires__ = 'ipython==2.1.0'\nimport sys\nfrom pkg_resources import load_entry_point\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    sys.exit(\n        load_entry_point('ipython==2.1.0', 'console_scripts', 'ipython')()\n    )\n\nThe shebang corresponds to the very same Python! Virtualenv is not installed, so that is not the problem.\nSystem information:\ndavidm@illergard:~$ uname -a\nLinux illergard 3.2.0-65-generic #99-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 4 21:03:29 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\ndavidm@illergard:~$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS\nRelease:    12.04\nCodename:   precise\n\nRelated: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9386048/ipython-reads-wrong-python-version\n\nA: I don't know the cause, and I will be happy if someone can point it out, but I found a solution. Running \nsudo python ez_setup.py\n\nfrom ez_setup.py obtained here, magically solved the problem, and now python sees the updated libraries. No reinstallation was needed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 loosing wifi connection I using Ubuntu 14.04 and i connecting to wifi using network manager from system tray.\nThe wifi works fine, but after 5 minutes i loosing internet , but I'm still connected to wifi and i need reconnect with network to have internet again.

The versions are the latest ones offered in the Ubuntu Software Center. Synaptic shows them as installed, but only Thunderbird is shown to be supported, and Lightning is not shown to be supported. \nThe treatment according to Howto have thunderbird/lightning open ics files does not work even for a single event: Dropping the event ics file from Krusader to the Calendar tab only shows a forbidding icon. Dropping it from Nautilus appears to be accepted (an icon like a text file), but nothing is imported even if it has been dropped into the box of the same day as the starting day of the event.

I was able to successfully import an event from an .ics file to Thunderbird by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an example event and save it as an .ics file. I created an example event at Create an iCalendar Appointment File (.ics) website. The website shows you an event data form with several input text boxes and all you have to do is to fill in the event data form and then click the Create Event button.  \n\n*Copy the resulting iCalendar Output into a local text file called example-event.ics and save the file.\n\n*Open Thunderbird and select Events and Tasks -> Import.\n\n*A new Import window will open. Browse to the example-event.ics file (or whatever the name of your .ics file is), click on the .ics file to select it, and click the Open button to import it.\nThe new event will now be added to your Lightning calendar.\n", "Q: Digigram VX222HR Not Detected I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a computer, but it doesn't recognize the extra sound card.

So can someone show me a procedure to fix this in basic non computer nerd language cause I'm not very computer savy?\nThanx \n\nA: When you do updates and install packages, \"deb\" package files are downloaded and put into the directory /var/cache/apt/archives/  and will stay there unless you clean them out.\nThe way to do this is with the command\napt-get clean\nwhich will delete all of the \"deb\" package files from that directory which been processed.\nIf you want to clean up your system further, install deborphan\nsudo apt-get get deborphan\nRunning deborphan will show you which packages installed on your system and are redundant.  Typically these are library packages which no other package requires because the package that required them was removed for whatever reason.\nYou can if you choose remove them by passing the output of deborphan to the command to remove them with\ndpkg --purge deborphan\nWhen running dpkg --purge, one is always prompted for confirmation to remove the packages specified.\nIf your /var directory is on your \"volume boot\" and not on a separate file system, you should check to see how much space it is using and if the problem is also due to large log files which have gradually accumulated.  These can be kept trimmed down using the logrotate package and specifying how often to process the log file and how many previous versions to keep either on a daily, weekly, monthly basis or just on fixed size.\n", "Q: Backports wifi driver wont reload after eboot on ubuntu 14.04 I am having some problems with wifi after installing Ubuntu on my ASUS F551CA.After having problems with a hard block (which i solved by black listing one of the two drivers) I was able to get a connection but it would only discover signals and log on after I suspended the system.

I can see the phone's files, transfer files, and so on via MTP and the transfer speed is about 20 to 30 MB/s or something like that.\nBut the cable is 3.0, my computer is 3.0, and there's an option that says 3.0 (I have other USB storage that is 3.0 so I miss the high speed :) However, when I click on the USB 3.0 option on the phone nothing really happens. I can no longer use MTP, of course, but I don't see another option for the device.\nHas anybody else come across this? How do I use the USB 3.0 option with the Samsung Galaxy s5 in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: Answer to original question:  \nYou should continue to use USB 2 with MTP until Linux libraries are updated, or you can use something like Wifi File Transfer (web based) or ES File Manager (supports SFTP for file transfers over SSH) and Samba, etc.  \nHowever, please consider that USB 2 is faster than what many external hard drives can provide, is faster than almost all insertable SD cards, and the bus of the Samsung is totally saturated by USB 3 transfer speeds (its a phone, not a PC) and it can't do transfers to the SD Card and the USB 3 at the same time.   Basically, you won't get any additional speed.  Try it under Windows with USB 3 and then try it again under Ubuntu with USB 2 ... and you tell me if there is an appreciable speed difference.\nYou can try USB 3 and then tether the phone to enable USB networking.  You can then attempt a file transfer via one of the above methods, such as ES File Manager and SFTP (uses your SSH server).  However, for the reasons above, you likely won't get speeds much above USB 2.   Basically, USB 3 support on a phone is more of a marketing gimmick.\n\nA: From what I see it's a technical issue with the Android OS.  Certain android applications are restricted from being moved from the internal memory to your internally mounted external SD card.  That's part of android's protection:  your \"external\" SD card is no longer considered as an USB mass storage device.  The reasoning popped out at me when I began to think about my HP Touchpad running CM10 (ICS).  When I mount it to my Linux Desktop, it's still recognized as USB Mass storage device.  \nUsing MTP protects permissions, users, groups, and other file management parameters.  Unfortunately, libmtp has not yet been updated to support USB 3.0 speeds.  We can only hope it will be as USB 3.0 is becoming more and more prevalent.  \nThe only way I see one can benefit from USB 3.0 transfer speeds to and from android devices (Kit-Kat and beyond) now is to use an OTG 3.0 thumb drive, until that glorious day when USB 3.0 is supported by libmtp.\n", "Q: Thunderbird: composed email font size?

There is a lot of good advice and also a lot of bad advice.  And how are noobs supposed to tell the difference?\nYou can't really tell if a forum users is reliable from their number of posts.  I've seen people with well over 1000 posts that don't really particularly know what they're talking about.  And others with 10 who were clearly pretty expert.\nBiggest hint IMO: whatever it is ask your question clearly.  Learn how to display your hardware devices' make/model.  Saying it's some model with a 1.9GHz cpu doesn't help much.\nIt also helps a lot if you can say what you were doing when you had problems.  This isn't easy sometimes.

I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a Dell laptop with 1.7Ghz Pentium M and 1Gbyte memory.\nGraphics are Intel® 852GM/855GM x86/MMX/SSE2, OS type is 32bit.\nThe whole system is VERY slow. When I launch the applications manager, for example, I need to wait in order to see the letters I typed appear!\nIt is as if the CPU was overloaded and no memory available, but I only have Firefox running.\nHow can I make the system run smoother? It used to have Windows XP installed and it worked fine.\n\nA: Because you only have 1GB of RAM! That isn't the only problem, but it is part of it. Simply, your computer can't handle the intensity of Unity's graphics.\nWindows XP is not nearly as CPU / Graphically intensive as Unity, the default desktop of Ubuntu 11.04+. It is based on compiz and has all sorts of fancy graphics, such as the see through dash and the expanding launcher. I would advise installing Lubuntu or Xubuntu, or putting XFCE or LXDE on, and using that rather than unity.\nI have both on 3 old XP computers, and they are running well (typed on a 2006 Lubuntu laptop with 683 MB of RAM).\n\nIt is as if the CPU was overloaded and no memory available\n\nThe CPU probably is overloaded / there probably isn't enough RAM available. Try installing and using midori - it is lighter, and is what I'm using at the moment.\nMy pronouns are He / Him\n\nA: You are extremely likely to have 2 relevant bottlenecks:\n\n\n*\n\n*the low amount of RAM available to the system, which in some cases is even less then the nominal value, for example if your GPU is stealing some RAM from the system the total amount available to the system is obiviously 1Gb - WhatTheGPUIsUsing\n\n*the slow HDD. Tipically old notebooks have a 5400rpm disk, this is probably a really small figure for todays standards, there isn't a good troughtput that the OS can use.\n\n\nThe first consequence is that you have low RAM and not even the SWAP does any good because of the slow HDD.\nBasically when you have a low amount of RAM the system uses the SWAP, a partition on your HDD, to store temporary files just like you do with your RAM in the first place, this allows the OS to get more temporary storage and \"fix\" things when there isn't a good amount of RAM available.\nUnless you have deactivated or removed the swap partition, the swap is there and it's working against your timings, but you can't really do too much because even using a swap on a slow HDD is better then having your OS or your applications terminated because of the memory that is not there.\nSo you should just keep things as they are now, you can maybe do 2 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*try another distribution like Archlinux, which is tipically faster and lighter but requires some tuning and you need to read some wiki articles and manuals to know what you are doing\n\n*try to boot into console without a GUI, if you can live with just the console your performane will benefit from that, obiviously it depends on what you have to do, if you have to code and write documents or check emails, you can do it with a terminal, if you like to browse the web, well you can do that too but it's certainly not up to what you get with firefox under an X11 session.\n\n\nA: There's also gnome-session-flashback which should look familiar if you have used previous iterations of Ubuntu. Apart from having a similar look-and-feel, it is also less resource-intensive.\n\nA: Two things:\n1) Ubuntu 14.04 uses Unity 3D, which is based on Compiz. The whole thing is rendered through hardware-accelerated OpenGL. This is fantastic if you have good drivers and a good video card, not so much if either is missing.\nThere is absolutely no need to switch distributions. Just install a lighter desktop environment, log out, and log back in to the new desktop. For ease of use the preferred one is usually Xfce.\n2) Combination of the broken update-apt-xapian-index cron job, and broken process scheduling in the kernel. Long story short, you need to append 'noautogroup' to your boot options, otherwise process niceness will not work. So:\n\n\n*\n\n*elevate to root with sudo\n\n*in /etc/default/grub, edit GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to be \"quiet splash noautogroup\"\n\n*run 'update-grub'\n\n*reboot\n\n\nThis is safer than using the kernel.autogroup sysctl variable, which may panic some computers.\nAnyway, contrary to what a lot of people say, Ubuntu runs fine with 1 GB of RAM if you don't use the bloated default desktop.\nEdit: actually I filed a Launchpad bug about the second issue last year: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1219548\n\nA: Have you checked your swap file in System Monitor/Resources - though it was working OK in 13.10 - it has not been activated when I upgraded to 14.04 on my laptop.  \n", "Q: Wired USB Ethernet Connection disconnecting sporadicly first, I'm not a Linux Pro, so please forgive me if I write any nonsence :)\nSo I have quite an unusual constellation. \nI'm running a Ubuntu 14.04 Virtual Machine on my Mac Pro using VMWare Fusion 6.\nBecause I have to forward ports (for an Owncloud Installation) for a specific and unchanging MAC Adress on my router, I have connected a USB Ethernet Adapter and connected it to the VM.

How is it possible for users of Ubuntu 14.04 to use an application similar with Silverlight?\n\nA: You will need to install wine-compholio from a PPA called ppa:pipelight/stable. Basically, it runs Silverlight in a Wine environment. See here: http://www.compholio.com/wine-compholio. Install the package with your browser closed. When you reopen it, you should be able to use Silverlight sites. For Netflix and a couple of other sites you will also need to adjust the user agent your browser sends out.\n\nA: You should probably chase down piplight to try to use silverlight in Ubuntu - I think the moonlight project for Ubuntu was abandoned.

Sorting the column is very easy. Assuming your list looks like this:\n\nYou could either sort it using menu \"Data\" -> \"Sort\"; or you enable the \"AutoFilter\" (using menu \"Data\" -> \"Filter\" -> \"AutoFilter\"), then you can enable sorting by clicking on the little button in the header cell (in my example: the first cell, with green background):\n\nWith Writer, you would have to insert a table into the document first (menu \"Table\" -> \"Insert\"), deciding how the table should look like (how much columns and so on).

For example:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npwd\n\nIf you run this from /whatever/path, it will display /whatever/path, no matter where the script is placed.\nIf you want to operate on files in the directory where you are running the script from, you can omit pwd like this:\nchmod +x D3GO\n\nThis will be interpreted as chmod +x /whatever/path/D3GO if you run it from /whatever/path, no matter where the script is actually placed.\nTo operate in the directory where the script is located, you can use the $BASH_SOURCE variable. It is an array, and it's first element is the path to the script itself (i.e. /script/directory/myscript.sh). You can combine this with the dirname command to get just the directory:\nchmod +x `dirname ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}`/D3GO\n\nThis will look for D3GO in the directory where this script is placed instead of where it's invoked from. (Thanks to @muru for pointing out my mistake.)\n\nA: You were super close!\n#!/bin/bash    \n\nchmod +x D3GO\n\n", "Q: Getting SFTP to update Wordpress It took me  a while to figure out how to install SFTP, and set up a user, sftpwp, that was restricted to it's own home directory and to using only those commands that are internal to SFTP.  I created a symbolic link between /var/www in the home directory of user sftpwp.\nThis is on Ubuntu 12.04.  (I don't run the more recent releases of Ubuntu because they don't seem to like the KVM I use to access this machine directly).\nAlas, I get the following error when I try to update Wordpress.\n\nCould not copy file.: wordpress/wp-admin/includes/update-core.php\n\nI know SFTP is working, and observed Wordpress' panel saying it successfully downloaded an update file: but then it stopped at the above error.\nI tried to get help on the Wordpress forum, but was told that because this is an administrative issue, it was off topic for the Wordpress fora.\nSo, what might be the problem: restricting the user sftpwp to only what is internal to sftp, or restricting it to it's home directory, or is it some other permissions issue?  And, what would be the fix?  Please remember, I am not an administrator, but rather a programmer.\nThanks,\nTed\n\nA: I tried it out. I just noticed that the Wordpress directory as extracted from tar.gz file is owned by nobody:nogroup. Is that the case with you? If so, change it to sftpwp:www-data. Note that we're setting the group to www-data, but we could add the www-data user to the sftponly group as well and use www-data:sftponly as the owner. In either case, this is to allow write permission to the server, for media upload and such. So you'll at least need to do:\nchmod g+w wordpress/wp-content\n\nFurther, we can apply setgid. When a directory is setgid, any file created within it inherits the group of that directory, irrespective of the active group of the user who created it. So this guarantees that any file add to the Wordpress folder retains the www-data (or sftponly, if you so choose) group. Do:\nchmod g+s wordpress/wp-{content,includes}\n\nI only included these two folders since uploaded content usually affects them. I noticed that uploaded media had www-data:www-data as the owner, so you might want to use sftponly as the group owner and then do setgid - then the sftp user can also access them.\n", "Q: FAT32 formatting I just took a dive into the Ubuntu world jumping from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 14.04. I must say that I am impressed, I do like it a lot. However, I just ran into an unexpected problem; I have an LG DVD player w/USB support that I use to watch videos. \nThe problem is that the player no longer reads the files in my USB drive, it says that there are no files at all. I started getting this issue after I re-formatted the USB drive using FAT32 in Ubuntu.\nIs Windows FAT32 different than Ubuntu's? It must be even though it shouldn't because the player is no longer able to read the files (or partition?).\nIs there an Ubuntu tool/utility that will allow me to do a \"Windows FAT32 format\"?\nI will really like to keep Ubuntu but I won't be able to if I cannot get my pen drive working on my DVD player. ANY suggestions guys?\nThanks in advance for your help? \n\nA: Well this is weird to say the least. I'm guessing your TV's OS has additional requirements beyond simply FAT32. For example Windows XP has limitations on cluster size, number of clusters, and partition size when booting from FAT32 partitions (REF). Perhaps your TV doesn't like the allocation size? If that's not it then I don't know :P. You should check to see what allocation size you use when doing a format with Windows, and then use the same allocation size when formatting with Ubuntu. \nFormat With A Specified Cluster Size:\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your terminal type \"sudo mkdosfs /dev/DISKANDPARTITION -s 16 -F 32\".\n\n\nThis will format the entire device as VFAT32 with a 4096 byte allocation size which is commonly used by Windows. If you wish to adjust the size just replace \"16\" with the required number. Most disks uses 512 bytes sector sizes with the exception of the modern 4K disks (REF). 16x512bytes=4096bytes. You will need to substitute /dev/DISKANDPARTITION for the correct device and partition (something like /dev/sdb1).\nAdditional Information:\nVFAT:\nVFAT is an extension for FAT filesystem that adds support for long filenames (REF); systems that don't support VFAT but do support the underlying version of FAT will be able to read the partition using the underlying version of FAT (REF). VFAT is most commonly misused to refer to FAT32, but it can be applied to any version of FAT. Files saved to a VFAT partition will have 2 filenames: a short name for being read under FAT, and a long name for being read under VFAT (REF). If the file is renamed while accessed under FAT support then the long name is lost (REF). VFAT accomplishes this 2nd name by splitting the long name across directories; in locations that have a max folder limit you could end up severely limiting the number of files you can create in that directory (REF). The short name is made from the first six characters of the long filename, a tilde, and a number (REF). VFAT is used by default on both Windows 7, and Ubuntu 14.04 when creating FAT32 partitions.\nAllocation Size:\nAllocation size, also called cluster size is method of grouping sectors within a partition; sectors make up a cluster. Disks have a set number of sectors, and sectors have a specified data size typically 512 bytes (REF). You can think of a cluster as a box. Within that box a single file, or part of a file can be saved. You cannot save more than 1 file in a cluster. Due to this the last cluster used in a series to save a file will have free space remaining that cannot be used by the system for anything else. The amount of space wasted will depend on the size of the file, and size of the cluster. For example a small file of 1KB written to a 64KB cluster will result in 63KB of lost hard drive space. Cluster sizes will also have an impact on write speeds because it takes longer to fill more clusters. When storing large files it's better to use a large cluster size, and when storing small files it's better to have a small cluster size. Most people need a balance that leans towards the small cluster size. Because disks only have a set number of sectors, having larger cluster sizes reduces the number of clusters you can have, and therefore may reduce the number of files you can have.\n", "Q: tlmgr TexLive 2013 in Ubuntu 14.4 I am new so I hope that I'm asking in the right way.\nI have the following problem:\nOn my Ubuntu 14.4 machine I installed texlive from the official repositories.

I looked in the .bashrc file and noticed that the path variable was changed as below:\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH\"\n\nI think the \":$PATH\" part was included to include the old path contents. I would like to know what would happen if a program that modifies the path variable doesn't include the \":$PATH\" part. Would I not be able to run some programs from the command line since the bin directories in which they reside are no longer included in the new path variable?\n\nA: You are correct. Third party packages should therefore only extend the current path, not limit it.\n\nA: PATH is a colon separated list of directories that your shell (bash, fish,ksh,sh, etc) uses to find something to execute. If the first word of the line you type to the shell is not a Shell builtin or alias, the shell steps through the list of directories in $PATH, looking for an executable file with the same name as the first word of the command you typed.  \ncommand not found errors for common commands (da/media/w3/0123-4567/PODCASTS/2016-Nov-27/loe-wildlife-decline.mp3te, ls, ...) is indicitive of a malformed PATH. An emergency PATH (enough to let you fix the problem can be set with export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/snap/bin. \nMany PATH errors are shell syntax errors (Space before or after =. It's PATH=value, no spaces).\nAs far as \"path corruption\", if I have created a \"special\" version of ls, stored in /.evil/bin/ls, AND I can corrupt your path so that it has /.evil/bin BEFORE /bin, when you type ls, the shell will run /.evil/bin/ls instead of /bin/ls. A Well Known Gotcha, but your system is thoroughly penetrated by the time it becomes useful.\n\nA: You would be able to run them, you will just have to specify the full path.

Is there another location that records all programs which were installed via compiling?\n\nA: No, installing something from source is just copying files, it's not recorded anywhere. However, by default programs installed from source are copied in /usr/local/bin, while programs installed from packages are copied in /bin or /usr/bin, so ls /usr/local/bin can give you a rough idea of what you have installed from source if you didn't use --prefix=/usr.\nIf you did use --prefix=/usr, you can still get to see which files where installed from a package and which were not using dpkg -S: dpkg -S FILE will look to see if FILE was installed from a package. If it was, it will print the name of the package, otherwise it will print an error. So if you want to see which files in /usr/bin were not installed form a package, you can do\nfor i in /usr/bin; do dpkg -S \"$i\" || echo \"$i\" >> ~/notfrompackages.txt; done\n\nand it will write in notfrompackages.txt a list of all files in /usr/bin which were not installed from a package.\n", "Q: How to connect laptop to TV using a VGA cable and a 3 RCA cable I would like step by step instructions showing me exactly how to do it especially with pictures to show me where the cables connect to. I don't know what goes where and what program I need to connect a TV to a laptop to watch my movies.\n\nA: VGA \nVGA or Video Graphic Array output has separate (Component) colour outputs. It has separate outputs for Red, Green, Blue colours. \nAlso it doesn't have audio output.\n\nRGB \nRGB or Red, Green, Blue cables have one (Composite) video line while having two stereo audio lines. Even though it is called red, green, blue, it doesn't have separate video lines.\n\nSo VGA output needs to be converted into one or Composite line before it's connected to a RGB or RCA cable.\nSuch a converter is called a VGA to Composite converter or Component to Composite converter.

When I booted up, ubuntu complained that the graphics config had changed, and gave me a terminal session.  I copied /etc/X11/xorg.conf.failsafe to xorg.conf, and that gave me the standard graphical login manager.  \nNw, when I try to log in the screen goes blank for a second, then returns me to the login manager.  It tells me when I give it a deliberately bad password, so I know I'm authenticating.

I have to do a bunch of file copying, moving, svn check out commands, directory checking etc. and I'm trying to make a script to do it for me. I have basic python syntax, but I'm not sure how to use python to execute linux commands.\nI know the linux commands needed for example sudo apt-get install subversion i just don't know how to wrap python around it.\nSpecifically, could anyone give examples on how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check if a package (like svn) is installed, if not then install it. I know this is a simple if-statement but no idea how to write it...\n\n*Check if a folder with a specific name is installed, if not create it on the desktop/some other directory.

Thanks for your time~\nEDIT: I am specifically required to use python\n\nA: You surely can do everything using Python's built-in stuff from os and subprocess modules. \nA slightly tricky thing would be if you want your script to \"interact\" with the programs you're invoking (like \"wait until it prints 'Press Enter to continue', then send it an Enter keypress) - for that you can use pexpect module.\nFor slightly higher-level way have a look at the Fabric library - besides running local commands it would also allow you to easily execute code on remote machines via SSH.\nA small sample of code using Fabric:\nif \"dirty\" in api.local(\"git describe --dirty\", capture=True):\n    print colors.red(\"\"\"Your repository is dirty, commit any changes first\"\"\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nReads almost like poetry:) Similar code in Bash would look like unintelligible mess in comparison...\n", "Q: How to reinstall Mac OS X 10.9?

By default , ubuntu uses /usr/local and /usr/local is on the default path.\nAnd third your are using ambiguous locations such as .. and pwd and ~ . It is best to use the full path and standard locations.\nWhy not use $HOME ?\n[[ -d \"$HOME\"/.D3GO ]] || mkdir \"$HOME\"/.D3GO\nMost of your other problems are solved with a decent make file or a well packaged .deb . If your script is dependent on things outside the script, files or .png, package it into a .deb or write a make file so that the things you need are installed into standard locations /usr/local or in the system if you wish.\nIf you are installing something, you would provide an archive and you should write your script relative to the archive you provide.\nSo your archive might be FOO and inside you would have\nFOO/files\nFOO/img\nFOO/Your_script\nSo \"Your_Script\" can just call \"cp ./file/file_to_install /where/to/install\"\nTo be honest, most of your installation (\"cp pwd\" stuff) is best handled with either \n\n\n*\n\n*Proper packaging into a .deb\n\n*A make file .\nEither of the above have numerous advantages including, but not limited to, ease of installation, ease of removal, and installing files to standard, known locations.\n", "Q: Why has my keyboard change layout settings?

Should I make my swap partition 4GB also, to be able to hibernate later?\nNote: the last time I contemplated installing Ubuntu was when 12.04.4 was new-ish, so my information might be out of date.\n\nA: Swap = RAM indeed when you want to hibernate. However, it never hurts to have a little bit extra. On modern systems with terrabytes of data, 4GB is peanuts.\nIf you have a busy system that uses a lot of swap, I would definitely go for 8GB. Otherwise, all your swap will be killed when you hibernate and that could cause some trouble. If you rarely or never use swap, you could get closer to your 4GB, but even then it doesn't hurt to give it a little extra.\nSystems that are too narrowly measured (in every sense of the words), tend to cause problems later on that cost more time and money to solve than the original extra that could've avoided the problems.\n", "Q: PulseAudio: Setting a default sink for created sink inputs From what I can tell, each time youtube loads a new video, it changes the index of the sink input that it uses, or creates a new sink input to use for that new video and trashes the old one.

I created a bash script:\nFile: move-sink-input\n#!/bin/bash\nindex=`pacmd list-sink-inputs | grep index: | grep -v \"index: 0\"`\nindex=${index:11}\nif [ $index ]; then\n    pacmd move-sink-input $index 3\nfi\n\nThen I created another bash script:\nFile: move-sink-input-loop\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile true; do\n    move-sink-input\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nI then kick this off with \"move-sink-input-loop > /dev/null &\".\ntl;dr: I wrote a script that moved the latest input every second.\nThe reason why I needed a second script for the loop is that somehow the result of \"pacmd list-sink-inputs\" stays the same within a running instance of a script, so doing the loop in another script to kick off the initial script seemed to actually update the data.\n\nA: If you use KDE I think I've found the solution.\nIn start-pulseaudio-x11 script that is used to autostart pulse, there is this clause:\nif [ x\"$KDE_FULL_SESSION\" = x\"true\" ]; then\n    /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-device-manager \"do_routing=1\" > /dev/null\nfi\n\nMy guess is that it gives KDE a way to control the sinks and makes pulseaudio ignore the default sink that you've set with pacmd... Well, there is no KDE tool that controls the sinks anyway so you better just remove this clause altogether - and then the default sink setting works, for me.\n", "Q: MineCraft freezes on Orcale Java but not openjdk So when I updated from 13.04 to 14.04 LTS (I do a clean reinstall of the new ubuntu version) and did minecraft on the first time using orcale java.

Every time the bios runs, it overwrites the boot sequence to make sure that Windows boots.  As a temporary workaround, you can interrupt the boot sequence and choose to boot ubuntu (in my laptop, the sequence is Esc, then F9).  \nHowever, that is probably not a good long term solution to the problem. I also did not like the USB boot solution proposed above.  I don't want to have my system on a USB drive. Fortunately, you can make it work. Use the dual boot instructions here and the HP fix/workaround below.\nGreatEmerald writes the solution here, but I will copy so to have more references to this important solution. The below recipe worked for me, although I used bootmgf2.efi instead of bootmgfw.efi~.\n\nThere is some sort of a \"recovery feature\" or so that on every boot sets the very first UEFI load option to point to one of the two locations, in this order:\n\n\n*\n\n*\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi\n\n*\\EFI\\Boot\\bootx64.efi\nThis option is displayed as \"OS boot Manager\" (for the first path) and something akin to \"UEFI partition\" for the second path, completely ignoring the actual name given to it (when you look at the EFI variables through efibootmgr, you can see that what is displayed as \"OS boot Manager\" actually is set to the name \"Windows Boot Manager\"; why anyone would do such renaming is beyond me). If you try to change the boot order so that this slot isn't the first, the UEFI will overwrite the BootOrder variable on next boot and reset it to point to \"OS boot Manager\" anyway.\nBy default, both of the paths above contain the same Microsoft bootloader (if you check the md5sum of both, you'll see they match).\nSo, until HP releases an updated UEFI that allows turning this \"feature\" off or rearranging boot options through the F10 UEFI setup, this is what you can do to get dual boot with the least amount of hackiness:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows, mount the UEFI partition (mountvol S: /S mounts it as the S: drive) and copy the file \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi to use some other name (for example, I copied it to \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi~, but you can change the name to anything else).\n\n*In the Windows command prompt, update the Windows UEFI entry to point to the new name:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi~\n\n(adapt to your set name accordingly).\n\n*Optionally, change the name of the Windows boot loader so that you would be certain that it points to the new file location:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} description \"Fixed Windows path\"\n\n\n*Install the other OS. In my case the bootloader was installed into \\EFI\\opensuse\\grubx64.efi.\n\n*Delete the two files, \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi and \\EFI\\Boot\\bootx64.efi.\n\n*Use efibootmgr to delete the \"OS boot Manager\" entry:\nsudo efibootmgr -b 0000 -B\n\n\n*Set the new OS bootloader to be the default bootloader by using efibootmgr with the -o option. In my case, I had an entry called \"opensuse\" in slot Boot0001 and the updated path Windows entry in slot Boot0002, so I had to do sudo efibootmgr -o 0001,0002\n\n*Update GRUB to point the Windows entry to your renamed file (you'll have to create a new file in /etc/grub.d and rerun grub-mkconfig).\nAnd that's it, now the UEFI will boot GRUB by default (it won't regenerate the \"OS boot Manager\" entry since it won't be able to find either of the two hardcoded paths and will \"fall back\" to properly reading the BootOrder variable), and the F9 menu will still allow choosing to boot Windows directly.\n\nSo you don't have to struggle with the grub configuration, here is the windows entry that I put in my /etc/grub.d/40_custom file:\nmenuentry \"HP / Microsoft Windows 8.1\" {\n   echo \"Loading HP / Microsoft Windows 8.1\"\n   insmod part_gpt\n   insmod fat\n   insmod search_fs_uuid\n   insmod chain\n   search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,gpt2 --hint-efi=hd0,gpt2 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,gpt2 3C62-71F3\n   chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgf2.efi\n}\n\nYOUR UUID WILL NOT BE 3C62-71F3.  Use this command to find it:\ngrub-probe --target=fs_uuid /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgf2.efi\n\nYOUR gpt partition and hints may be different. Use this commannd:\ngrub-probe --target=hints_string /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgf2.efi\n\nTo get your grub configuration edits compiled:\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n\nA: \nI have Ubuntu on a USB, and I have toured it on that device. When I tried to install Ubuntu on the HD, I did not get the option of installing it along with Windows.\n\nThe \"Install Alongside\" option is (almost?) always missing when doing an EFI-mode install of Ubuntu. You'll have to either use the \"Something Else\" option or completely wipe Windows from the computer. There are numerous descriptions of how to use the \"Something Else\" option, both on this site and elsewhere, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*“Install alongside” option missing. How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using “Something Else”?\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu alongside UEFI enabled Windows 8?\n\n*How to use manual partitioning during installation?\n\nIn Win 8's Disk Management I created 300 GB unalloated partition by shrinking C:. The partition is GPT. The other partitions seem to be MS-DOS. Based on my understanding of the above articles, I leave UEFI enabled/installed, and I leave Secure Boot enabled.\n\nYou're confusing two things. The GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a data structure that describes the entire disk. On a GPT disk, every partition is a GPT partition -- but these partitions can belong to different OSes or be used for different purposes by a single OS, just like partitions on a Master Boot Record (MBR) disk.\nThe term \"MS-DOS,\" applied to disk, can refer either to an entire disk that uses the MBR partition scheme or to a single partition that uses the FAT filesystem. Given your context, I suspect you mean the latter, although if you've got two physical disks, it could be that you've got one GPT and one MBR disk. A GPT disk can certainly hold FAT partitions, and in fact, one special FAT partition, known as the EFI System Partition (ESP), holds boot loaders that enable the computer to boot. If you need more help interpreting your disk layout, you must provide more details, such as a screen shot of a GUI partitioning tool or cut-and-pasted output showing your partitions from a text-mode tool like parted or gdisk.\n\nA: An additional important point if you want both Windows and Ubuntu to be bootable through EFI:\nWhen you select the Installation Type of \"Something else\" and then get the screen that allows you to do partitioning, select the EFI partition (e.g. /dev/sda1, not /dev/sda) for \"Device for boot loader installation\".  This is allows GRUB to work together with EFI.  At least in 14.04, this selection is not the default, so look at the partitions to find one with a Type of \"efi\".\n\nA: I answer my own question above in the form of a newbie step-by-step guide for getting Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 8.1 dual booting on an HP 15 Notebook sold in the US.\nThanks to all above who provided their own answers and follow-up questions to my own question and for putting up with my ignorance and nevertheless helping me along the way. Most of what follows merely applies your suggestions to this particular situation. [DISCLAIMER: Things always change. Your situation may differ for some reason. OR I might have made a mistake in remembering exactly what I did. Always back up your files before messing with the computer in ways not familiar to you. Know how to restore the computer before proceeding. See the User Manual in HP Support Assistant.]\n\n\n*\n\n*Assumption: You have an HP 15 Notebook with Windows 8.1 preloaded.\n\n*In Win8.1 download the iso file of Ubuntu 14.04. Copy it to a USB stick or DVD [I used a USB stick, and the following directions reflect that. Adjust these directions if you are using a DVD or another source for Ubuntu.]\n\n*Restart or power up the computer. Immediately press ESC f10. This gets you to the BIOS file. Use the arrow keys to select System across the top. Press Enter. This will give you a list of system settings. You will see that UEFI and Secure Boot are Enabled, and Legacy Support is disabled. Leave all that as is.\n\n*In the UEFI Boot Order, use arrow keys to select USB diskette on Key/USB Hard Drive. With the f9 or f10 key [see bottom of screen] move that to the top of the list. OS boot manager should be second in the list. (Doing this allows you to boot with the USB stick and try Ubuntu.)\n\n*Exit BIOS with changes saved.\n\n*In Windows go to Control Panel -> Power Options -> Choose what the power button does. Here turn off fast startup.\n\n*In a console, and with administrator rights, disable hibernate with this command: \npowercfg.exe -h off\n\n*Shut down (not restart, etc.).\n\n*Power on. In Windows, find Disk Management, which I think is through Control Panel. Since this was a brand new computer for me, it had a lot of space in the c: partition. I shrunk that by about half, leaving it free, unallocated space.\n\n*Shutdown.\n\n*Place the USB stick in and power on. You should be asked here if you want to install Ubuntu or try it without installing. I always selected the latter. You can install from the live-session of Ubuntu.\n\n*Be sure to have your internet connection working. \n\n*When you're ready, click on the Install Ubuntu 14.04 icon. If you're really lucky, you'll be given the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows. I was not lucky, so here's what needed to be done.\n\n*Choose \"something else.\" Du courage!\n\n*Select the empty partition you produced in Windows Disk Manager. Here, one by one, you will make a root partition (/), a home partition (/home), and a swap partition. For each you select a size, its name, and its mounting point. Root ad home are both primary; swap is logical. I did this in that order. Since my RAM is 64 GB, I made the swap partition that size. The root partition I made about 50 GB, and the rest I gave to /home. For file type I followed sage advice and remained with EXT4. When all that is done, click \"Install Now.\"\n\n*Shut down. Take the USB stick out. Power up, and what happened is that all I got was a direct boot into Windows. Fear not. Shut down. Power up again and immediately press ESC f9. That should bring up boot options. OS boot manager, ie Windows, comes first. Select Ubuntu, which is second, and the computer boots into Ubuntu. \n\n*Done, unless you'd rather not have to do the ESC f9 business every time you want to boot Ubuntu. Then, I suggest you follow instructions provided by \"oldfred\" to the question at \"Dual Boot Win8/Ubuntu Loads Only Win.\" I'm not enough of a non-newbie to be able to follow it, but installing rEFInd is tempting.

Any ideas why this might be happening?\n\nA: TLDR:\nIn Gnome Tweak Tool, set \"Ctrl key position\" to \"Caps Lock as Ctrl\" and \"Caps Lock key behavior\" to \"Caps Lock is disabled\".\nFull story:\nThe problem appears to be how Ubuntu is remapping the CapsLock key. When Gnome Tweak Tool's \"Caps Lock key behavior\" property is set to \"Make Caps an additional Ctrl\", xmodmap reports:\nxmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock        Caps_Lock (0x42)\ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Caps_Lock (0x42),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3      \nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\n\nThe problem appears to be that both lock and control list \"Caps_Lock (0x42)\". Everything works well until you set focus into a VMWare VM (I tested using VMWare Player). After focusing VMWare's window, xmodmap will report an empty mapping:\nxmodmap:  up to 0 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift     \nlock      \ncontrol   \nmod1      \nmod2      \nmod3      \nmod4      \nmod5      \n\nRunning setxkbmap resets the keyboard mapping and temporarily resolves the issue.  Playing with xmodmap, I found that removing Caps_Lock (0x42) from lock stopped VMWare from flushing the keyboard mappings. But, Ubuntu 14.04 ignores .Xmodmap files, so there was no simple method to use xmodmap.\nWe can fix the root-cause of this situation by changing two settings in Gnome Tweak Tool, as described at the top of this post. Doing so will properly configure the keyboard mappings so that Caps_Lock (0x42) does not show up in two locations:\nxmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock      \ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_L (0x42),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3      \nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\n\n", "Q: League of legends games will not start, bugsplat I'm trying to run League of Legends on Ubuntu 14.04 using Play on Linux.\nI followed this guide to install it.

They recommend disabling Secure Boot because there is a bug in the Ubuntu installer that deletes the Windows 8 bootloader altogether. Is disabling this still necessary in Ubuntu 14.04? Can I enable it again after I am done installing? Also, on a related note, I KNOW that disabling Fast boot is needed for the installation, but after the installation is done, can I re-enable that too?\n\nA: You've actually raised four distinct issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure Boot -- In theory, disabling Secure Boot should not be necessary to install Ubuntu 14.04 (or even a couple versions before that). Practice usually follows theory, but sometimes it doesn't -- some computers just don't seem to get along well with Shim (the program that Ubuntu uses to work with Secure Boot). A Secure Boot problem is almost certain to manifest itself as an inability to even begin to boot -- either the Ubuntu installer or the Ubuntu system once it's installed. If you see so much as a GRUB menu or an Ubuntu boot logo, the Secure Boot hurdle has been passed. (In Fedora, Secure Boot can have follow-on effects much later, but this is much rarer in Ubuntu.)\n\n*ESP-deletion bug -- Old versions of Ubuntu would blindly create a fresh FAT16 filesystem on the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is where EFI boot loaders are stored. This action would erase the Windows boot loader, along with any other files on the ESP (such as third-party boot managers, firmware update files, etc.). This bug was reported in 2011 and fixed prior to the release of Ubuntu 12.04, and so should not affect Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, 13.04, 13.10, or 14.04. That said, backing up all your current partitions before installing Ubuntu (or any OS) is a worthwhile precaution.\n\n*The firmware's fast boot feature -- Modern EFIs usually have a feature called \"fast boot\" or something similar. When enabled, the firmware takes certain shortcuts in its startup process, which can include minimal (rather than full) initialization of USB devices. (The OS must do its own full initialization later, no matter what the firmware does.) The effect can be that the computer won't boot from a USB flash drive. This is obviously bad if you're trying to install Ubuntu from such a disk, so it will be necessary to disable this feature when installing Ubuntu. (If your system has an optical disc and you're trying to install from it, USB-initialization shortcuts should be irrelevant, though.) Note that the details vary from one computer to another; you might not need to disable a \"fast startup\" feature on all computers. Once Ubuntu is installed, it's usually possible to re-enable the feature and Ubuntu will continue to boot -- but you'll need to disable it again if you want to boot from an external medium (say, for emergency maintenance).\n\n*Fast Startup in Windows -- Windows 8 has a feature called Fast Startup (aka Hybrid Boot or Hybrid Shutdown). This feature turns an ordinary shutdown operation into a suspend-to-disk action. One consequence of this change is that filesystems, including the ESP, are not properly unmounted. If you then try to dual-boot, the result can be filesystem damage to shared filesystems and/or an inability to mount shared filesystems. Thus, it's imperative that this Windows feature be disabled, and left disabled. Many Internet sites, such as this one, provide instructions on how to disable this feature. Note also that the Windows Fast Startup feature is completely unrelated to the firmware feature that may bear a similar name.\n\n\nI hope this clarifies matters.\n\nEDIT:\nRecent versions of Ubuntu (I don't recall precisely when this started, but 16.04 is affected) tightened Secure Boot controls, making these versions susceptible to the \"follow-on effects\" I noted earlier. Specifically, third-party kernel modules (drivers) may not load unless you jump through hoops to sign them, as described here. Drivers for ATI and Nvidia video cards and for VirtualBox are commonly cited as reasons to disable Secure Boot to work around these problems, but there are other unsigned drivers that affect some systems. Secure Boot does offer benefits, at least in theory, so if you're up to the technical challenge, I encourage leaving it active and signing any kernel modules you need. (Personally, I'm not a fan of proprietary video modules, but some people do need them to get adequate performance with some games and applications. If you don't need them, using the standard open source drivers is an adequate workaround.)\n\nA: The question of disabling/enabling SecureBoot really is device-specific, but I don't know about enough models to answer that. It has worked on a few laptops for me but on most I have had to disable it. As a general answer, turn it off. As for FastBoot, the thing is, it will make your Windows partition unreadable to Ubuntu. The Windows partition will be marked unclean and Ubuntu can't mount it - it may also affect other partitions used in Windows. So enable FastBoot if you are certain that you won't need to use the Windows partitions from Ubuntu. Disable it if you may need to access them Ubuntu.\n\nA: My Windows 10 would tell me I had to check MOK and then \"continue boot\", then it would fail and not load, then go straight to Windows. I turned off secure boot, loaded into Ubuntu, installed it. Secure Boot is messing with our process. Next time you boot into Windows when you're done, turn Secure Boot on\n", "Q: Xubuntu 14.04 setting Primary Monitors I'm using Xubuntu 14.04 with the 331.38 drivers that I installed via the \"Additional Drivers\"\nMy issue is that when ever I start up a game it starts up in the wrong monitor, to fix this I when my computer starts I set the primary monitor in the Nvidia settings manager.. the only problem is every reboot it looses the setting of the primary monitor... and I have to keep setting this every time.\nI notice there is no more Xorg file... so how would I fix this seeing that the Display settings of XFCE is not able to set \"Primary Monitor\"\n\nA: use xrandr and find the display you want to set as primary, then\nin your .bashrc add the command\nxrandr --output [DISPLAY DEVINCE] --primary\n\nExample:\nxrandr --output DP-1 --primary\n\nthis is the same as going into the nvidia-settings app and applying a primary monitor. \nlog out and log back in, and you should see that your primary monitor is set correctly.\n", "Q: Will ubuntu supports switchable graphics? does ubuntu supports switchable graphics? I am using HP Pavilion dv6 laptop. I tried ubuntu 12.04 but my laptop is becoming too hot.\n\nA: Some graphics switching is available depending upon the type of graphics your HP has - nvidia-prime and bumblebee are often mentioned in posts here for that purpose.\nI have a DV7 that I run for my kid, and it's a real space warmer.  I would not be able to run the computer at all without tlp, available on the Ubuntu software center or the tlp website at linrunner.de/tlp\nAs far as graphics are concerned, my DV7 would not recognize the graphics card properly with early releases of Ubuntu 14.04, and the proprietary drivers would not work properly either - HP may have some BIOS specific to them which is not well recognized.  What worked on that computer were the oibaf graphics drivers available at launchpad.net/~oibaf\nThe combination of tlp and more advanced drivers has at least kept my dv7 operable, although temperatures are regularly over 60 Celcius while idle.\n", "Q: Cannot find device path for USB Bluetooth adapter I am trying to use a Bluetooth adapter (known as Broadcom Corp.

Selecting Press [Tab] to edit options and editing the options has no effect. When I go back to the boot menu, it keeps repeating the same countdown loop. \nI've tried redoing the UNetbootin extraction, but I still have the same issue.\n\nA: The \"Automatic boot in 10 seconds...\" countdown loop is a UNetbootin problem. If the UNetbootin boot menu does not have an entry for the OS you are trying to boot to under the Default boot menu entry, this is another sign that UNetbootin is not working properly. I know that it's a problem with UNetbootin because I have seen it before, and managed to solve it by reformatting the USB flash drive to remove to bootloader and then making the live USB again with Startup Disk Creator. Startup Disk Creator is capable of making both Ubuntu and non-*buntu bootable live USBs.\nThis wouldn't solve your problem because you are trying to boot Windows 7, so I suggest that you use the WoeUSB application to make the bootable Windows 7 USB flash drive.\nFirst reformat the USB drive as FAT32 to remove whatever obsolete boot information UNetbootin wrote on the USB flash drive. If your computer detects obsolete boot information on the USB flash drive, it may try to boot an operating system that no longer exists on the USB flash drive, and then UNetbootin will get stuck in a repeating countdown.\nThen download WoeUSB and install it. Native UEFI booting is supported for Windows 7 and later images (limited to the FAT filesystem as the target device). WoeUSB is an updated fork of the WinUSB project.\nSome third-party installers feature Windows installation images (/sources/install.wim) greater than 4GB making FAT32 as target filesystem impossible. NTFS filesystem support has been added to WoeUSB 3.0.0 and later.\nInstallation\nTo install WoeUSB (GUI+CLI) in Ubuntu 14.04/16.04/17.10-20.04:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8 \nsudo apt update  \nsudo apt install woeusb\n\nThis will install the WoeUSB graphical interface and the WoeUSB command line tool. WoeUSB supports both UEFI and BIOS for FAT32/NTFS/ExFAT USB flash drives.\nTo install the WoeUSB command line tool snap package in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo snap install --edge woe-usb  \nsudo snap connect woe-usb:removable-media\n\nTo launch the woe-usb snap package command line tool run the following command:\n/snap/bin/woe-usb.woeusb\n\nIf you get a permission denied error click the Permissions button on the woe-usb screen in Ubuntu Software and toggle the permissions options from OFF to ON as shown in the below screenshot.\n\nThe WoeUSB GUI is easier to use than the WoeUSB command line tool. Click the radio button to the left of where it says From a disk image (iso), browse to the location of the Windows .iso file, under Target device select a USB flash drive, open Disks application and check that the Device name in Disks matches the Target device in WoeUSB (it should be something like /dev/sdX where X is a letter of the alphabet), and click the Install button to install to create a bootable Windows installation media on the USB flash drive.\n\nWindows USB drive from Ubuntu failing repeatedly\nWoeUSB Issues\n\nA: Install WoeUSB instead of Unetbootin\nWoeUSB is now WoeUSB-ng and a way easy to install, just follow these two commands and you are done:\nsudo apt install git p7zip-full python3-pip python3-wxgtk4.0\n\nsudo pip3 install WoeUSB-ng\n\nNow search for WoeUSB in your apps\n\nA: Just reinstall UNetBootIn and it should work fine. I just did that myself. I realize that your question has probably been solved, just putting this here for the other people that may come across this thread. \n\nA: I got stuck with the same error after all windows installations completed(my previous os has gone already) and I used these below steps. \n1.

Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a new partition and installed Windows 7.\n\n*Booted into the Ubuntu Live Disk and selected \"Something Else\".\n\n*I had 3 partitions:\n/dev/sda1 - fat32 - Recovery Partition || \n/dev/sda2 - ntfs - System Reserved || \n/dev/sda3 - ntfs - Windows 7  ||\nfree space\n\n*I clicked on \"Add\" in order to create the /boot partition. I selected Primary and ext4.\n\n*The next moment I find my free space being marked as unusable.\nNow, I've always had this layout while dual installing Windows 7 and Ubuntu. And I am pretty sure I selected Primary while creating the /boot partition. And things have worked out pretty well.\nBut this time, if I follow the same steps, it marks the remaining free space as unusable. I had to proceed by making all the linux paritions (/boot, /, /home) as Logical. Ubuntu installed correctly, but now when I start up, I am presented with the Linux operating select screen.\nI mean I don't get this screen, which is quite understandable since I didn't have the /boot partition as Primary : \n\nI get a screen similar to this from where I can select Windows or Ubuntu:\n\nMy question is why am I blocked if I select /boot as Primary. It worked fine earlier, but now it doesn't.\n\nA: the point is that in hard disks with MBR you can only create four primary partitions. To create extra partitions, you need to have logical partitions. Hence the trouble.\non the other hand using GPT, you can make a lot of partitions. I can only assume that you've had GPT before.\n", "Q: How to uninstall Hbase from Ubuntu? I had installed HBase -0.94 in my Ubuntu system.\nI want to uninstall it now. I tried,\nsudo apt-get purge hadoop-hbase \n\nbut it shows unable to locate package.\nHelp me uninstall it.\n\nA: If you downloaded the apache version from their website you downloaded a \"tar.gz\" file and extracted it into your system. Ubuntu Software Center will know nothing about your installation so apt-get is not the correct method. \nUninstalling it is equal to removing the directory you extracted it into. So open a terminal, navigate to the directory you extracted it into and remove the directory \"hbase-0.94.20/\".\n\nLet us assume you extracted the software in \"Downloads\" in your \"Home\". Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\ncd ~/Downloads\nrm -rf hbase-0.94.20/\nexit\n\n", "Q: ACPI not running custom script on power button press Any idea how I can debug acpid not starting my custom script on modified xfce4 environment. I've modified \"/etc/acpi/events/powerbtn\" to point to the correct script:\nevent=button[ /]power\naction=/etc/acpi/my-acpi-script\n\n\nA: As the post that @tuknutx mentions says, acpid no longer handles  power button events. They're now handled by systemd's logind . I was quite surprised by this because I had assumed that Ubuntu wasn't using systemd components this release.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have f.lux (software that adjusts display's color temperature) on Ubuntu 14.04? f.lux is software which adjusts temperature of your display according to time of the day. Is it possible to make f.lux work in Ubuntu 14.04? If so, maybe you can share your knowledge or point me to a guide.\n\nA: May I suggest RedShift?\nIt's more maintained than flu.x, it has more options and it works perfectly with Ubuntu 14.10 x64 and Ubuntu 15.04 x64.\nIt can be installed from the repositories (12.04, 14.04, and newer):\nsudo apt-get install redshift redshift-gtk\n\nYou may optionally create a configuration file for RedShift. It is NOT created automatically, so you'll have to create it using gedit ~/.config/redshift.conf.\nThis is how my redshift.conf file looks like:\n; Global settings for redshift\n[redshift]\n; Set the day and night screen temperatures\ntemp-day=4500\ntemp-night=3500\n\n; Enable/Disable a smooth transition between day and night\n; 0 will cause a direct change from day to night screen temperature.\n; 1 will gradually increase or decrease the screen temperature\ntransition=1\n\n; Set the screen brightness. Default is 1.0\n;brightness=0.8\n; It is also possible to use different settings for day and night since version 1.8.\nbrightness-day=0.9\nbrightness-night=0.7\n; Set the screen gamma (for all colors, or each color channel individually)\ngamma=0.8\n;gamma=0.8:0.7:0.8\n\n; Set the location-provider: 'geoclue', 'gnome-clock', 'manual'\n; type 'redshift -l list' to see possible values\n; The location provider settings are in a different section.\nlocation-provider=geoclue\n\n; Set the adjustment-method: 'randr', 'vidmode'\n; type 'redshift -m list' to see all possible values\n; 'randr' is the preferred method, 'vidmode' is an older API\n; but works in some cases when 'randr' does not.\n; The adjustment method settings are in a different section.\nadjustment-method=randr\n\n; Configuration of the location-provider:\n; type 'redshift -l PROVIDER:help' to see the settings\n; ex: 'redshift -l manual:help'\n[manual]\n; set these values if you've set the location-provider to manual instead of geoclue\n;lat=51.522698\n;lon=-0.085358\n\n; Configuration of the adjustment-method\n; type 'redshift -m METHOD:help' to see the settings\n; ex: 'redshift -m randr:help'\n\n[randr]\nscreen=0\n\nIf you need to, compiling it manually is also quite easy. Here is the official repository: https://github.com/jonls/redshift\nJust make sure that you've installed all the dependencies specified in the travis.yml file before running the bootstrap executable file.\nInstructions here: https://github.com/jonls/redshift/blob/master/HACKING.md\nFor Ubuntu 15.04 users: it could be that you won't be able to use redshift because of some missing dependencies. Try to compile it by getting the code directly from github.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libxcb-randr0-dev\n./bootstrap\n./configure --enable-randr\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\n...or just install if you don't want to use checkinstall.\nThe libxcb-randr0-dev package should satisfy the dependency to use randr as an adjustment method. Otherwise try to enable vidmode by doing:\n./configure --enable-vidmode\n\n\nA: Here is another way I just found. I had to do this way because company firewall won't let me add apt repository no matter what I tried.\n\n\n*\n\n*download source code from author's github\ngit clone https://github.com/xflux-gui/xflux-gui.git\n\n\n*install\ncd xflux-gui\nsudo python setup.py install\n\n\n*run from command line\nfluxgui\n\n[update as of Feb 23 2017] repo is changed\n\nA: New Flux app for Ubuntu 15.04+\n\nKilian Valkhof's repository for Flux does not update anymore, but you can use Nathan Rennie-Waldock’s PPA.\nRun these commands to install Flux:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nathan-renniewaldock/flux\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install fluxgui\n\nTo remove:\n$ sudo apt-get remove fluxgui\n\n\nVia: Ubuntu Handbook\n\nA: Ubuntu 17.10 and later\nStarting with GNOME desktop environment 3.24, which was released on March 22, 2017, a new Night Light feature is included that automatically reduces the amount of blue light emitted by screens during certain times of the day. The new feature can be enabled from the display settings. The screen color follows the sunrise/sunset times for your location, but it can also be set to a custom schedule. The Night Light panel indicator shows when the feature is active, and the system menu allows it to be temporarily disabled.\nIn Ubuntu 17.10, Ubuntu ships with GNOME desktop environment, not Unity, and the Night Light feature is included by default. Night Light works with both X11 and Wayland. To enable Night Light in Ubuntu 17.10 go to System Settings -> Devices -> Displays -> Night Light and slide the Night Light slider from OFF to ON. Then configure the schedule settings.\n\nNight Light settings in Ubuntu 17.10\nThe Night Light Slider GNOME Shell Extension provides an easy interface to tweak the temperature of the night light from the notification area of the panel. Be sure to check out the preferences in GNOME Tweak Tool to customize or enable added functionality. You can also easily configure the night light to always be on or to always show the status icon.\n\nUbuntu 12.04-17.04\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nathan-renniewaldock/flux\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fluxgui \n\nUbuntu 12.04-14.04\nInstallation is of f.lux in Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 is easily done by adding the PPA for f.lux. Simply type the following in your terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kilian/f.lux\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fluxgui  \n\nInstalling xflux daemon terminal program from the official f.lux website\n64-bit\nwget -c https://justgetflux.com/linux/xflux64.tgz\ntar -xvzf xflux64.tgz\nrm -rf xflux64.tgz\nsudo cp xflux /usr/bin/\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/xflux\n\n32-bit\nwget -c https://justgetflux.com/linux/xflux-pre.tgz\ntar -xvzf xflux-pre.tgz\nrm -rf xflux-pre.tgz\nsudo cp xflux /usr/bin/\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/xflux\n\nf.lux GUI can be started from the Dash or from the terminal with the command fluxgui. When it is running there is a f.lux icon in the notification area of the panel.\n\n⠀f.lux indicator applet preferences in Xubuntu 14.04\n\nA: May I suggest eyesome?\neyesome\nEyesome is a bash script running as a deamon and sleeping most of the time 24/7. It automatically adjusts screen brightness (and optionally gamma too) for your laptop display via hardware interface and up to two other monitors using xrandr's software control.\nAt sunrise (the time is automatically obtained from the internet each day), your screen brightness (and optionally gamma too) is adjusted gradually. The gradual adjustment is defined by you but, 120 minutes works for me. To keep the adjustments unnoticeable set a sleep interval between adjustments. Anywhere between 15 and 60 seconds is probably best and the default is 60.\nAfter sunrise transition is complete, eyesome daemon sleeps many hours until sunset transition starts. I'm using 90 minutes before sunset but you can set any period you like.\nInversely to sunrise transition, the sunset transition gradually decreases screen brightness (and optionally gamma too) so it is unnoticeable.\nNote that during nighttime transition gamma may increase. For example Red gamma may be defined as 1.0 during day and 1.2 during night to reduce eye strain. Blue gamma in turn may be defined as 1.0 during day and .8 during night so it will decrease instead.\nTo reduce resources, eyesome sleeps the entire period between sunset and sunrise. Depending on where you live and the season of the year, the average sleep will be 12 hours.\nEyesome Setup - Main Menu\nTo configure eyesome, a main menu is provided:\n\nEdit Configuration - General tab\nWhen you click the Edit button from the main menu the edit configuration general tab initially appears as shown below.\n\nYour country/city name should automatically appear. If necessary you can override it.\nEdit Configuration - Monitor 1 tab\nClicking on Monitor 1 tab above will reveal this panel in my configuration (yours may be different):\n\nDon't be daunted by these settings they are for the most part automatically obtained by eyesome. You will need to set the daytime and night brightness/levels though.\nEdit Configuration - Monitor 3 Tab\nClicking on Monitor 3 Tab reveals this panel in my configuration (yours may be different):\nMonitor 2 Tab is not shown because it is a new TV with adaptive brightness and Smart OS. It requires no overrides by Eyesome.\n\nIf after eyesome is installed you attach a different monitor to your system you may have to enter the xrandr monitor name.\nEyesome Setup - 5 second test\nFrom the main menu you can test your daytime and nighttime brightness and gamma settings for 5 seconds by clicking the Daytime and Nighttime buttons respectively. You can change the duration of the test from 5 seconds up to 20 seconds from the Edit Configuration - General Tab.\nHere's what the 5 second Nighttime test looks like:\n\nUnusual event handling\nAssume you suspend your laptop when it's morning before work and the screen is at full dim. You come home after work when the sun is high in the sky and open your laptop. The screen is so dim you can't read it.\nTo address this scenario a systemd control file is provided:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/systemd/system-sleep/systemd-wake-eyesome control file is called whenever the system suspends or resumes.\n\n*The control file calls the bash script /usr/local/bin/wake-eyesome.sh to reset brightness to full and then sleep until sunset transition.\n\n\nYou are watching a movie on your external TV at night and close your laptop lid for better viewing. Ubuntu / Lightdm / xrandr takes a few seconds and then resets your external TV to full full brightness. OUCH to your eyes.\nTo address this scenario an acpi event control file is provided:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/acpi/event/lid-event-eyesome control file is called whenever the laptop lid is opened or closed.\n\n*The control file calls the bash script /etc/acpi/acpi-lid-eyesome.sh to handle the lid opening and closing.\n\n*In turn the eyesome bash script calls /usr/local/bin/wake-eyesome.sh to reset brightness for nighttive viewing and then sleeps until sunset transition.\nSuspend/Lid close/Test brightness/power off/hotplug\nSummary\nEyesome can be downloaded from: https://github.com/WinEunuuchs2Unix/eyesome\nThis program was just released in September 2018 so please let me know if you find any problems or have suggestions for improvement.\nThe documentation phase is just starting so don't hesitate to ask any questions. Your questions may even result in documentation improvements.\n\nA: In ubuntu 20.04, you don't need to install any external packages. It has inbuilt package named xgamma.\nYou can use it as follows:\nxgamma 0.5\n\nor you can adjust only blue color:\nxgamma -bgamma 0.5\n\nIts value can vary from 0 to 1.\n", "Q: Battery consumption comparison of Unity, Gnome, Gnome Classic XFCE and LXDE I would like to know what is the rank of the current LTS version in term of probable consumption of battery power -ie: for a same usage.\nIs the following rank probably correct, where top of the rank means \"uses the highest level of battery power\", and where bottom of the rank means \"needs the less level of battery power\":\nConcerning Ubuntu 14.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Unity\n\n*Ubuntu Gnome\n\n*Ubuntu Gnome Classic\n\n*Xubuntu\n\n*Lubuntu\n\n\nThat will usefull for people who would like to optimize their instant battery duration, like travellers using laptop for example.\n\nA: To consume the minimum battery charge you have to load at minimum your pc, so use the minimum resources and this include ram. \nThe order that you did is correct, is difficult to make a rank because it varies. But if you want realy load at minimum your ram you can choose Enlightenment.\n", "Q: how to make USP pendrive as bootable in ubuntu I am using Ubuntu 12.04.

Mount: only root can mount i'm trying to use cifs-utils to get files in another machine. In the other machine i've installed samba. Everything works fine if a try in the same machine (the one with samba) using cifs-util, but it doesn't if i try with another in the intranet. Here's what i've done: \n\n\n*\n\n*i've installed cifs-util\n\n*i've added the following line to the /etc/fstab file: \n//192.168.0.72/Triple_RDF /media/Triple cifs credentials=/home/ubuntu/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0\n\n\n*i've created the .smbcredentials file typing:\ngedit ~/.smbcredentials\n\nand adding the lines \nusername=[username]\npassword=[password]\n\nOf course i put my real username and password instead of [username] and [password].\n\n*then i changed the permits of the previous file typing: \nchmod 600 ~/.smbcredentials\n\nSince i'm using Ubuntu 14.04 it apppears an icon on the nautilius bar (the one on the left side), but when i click on it appens nothing. If i try to go inside of the \"Triple\" which now appears with my network resources the system says: \nmount: only root can mount //192.168.0.72/Triple_RDF on /media/Triple.\n\nI thought that may be it could be a problem of permits in the destination folder, /media/Triple. So i changed those. Here my ls -al output of the /media/Triple folder:\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 user group 4096\n\nwhere instead of user and group i put the real ones.\nAnybody knows which could be the problem ?\nAnswer: make sure you have installed cifs-utils and you have user in the fstab entry.\n\nA: I solved the same problem by adding the UID info as an admin user from my Linux machine, so my /etc/fstab line now looks like this:\n//192.168.1.X/Multimedia /media/dungeonmultimedia cifs uid=[linuxadminuser],username=[nasadminuser],password=[nasadminpass] 0 0\n\n\nA: Just add users in /etc/fstab like that:\n//192.168.0.72/Triple_RDF /media/Triple cifs credentials=/home/ubuntu/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,users 0 0\n\nNormally, only the superuser can mount filesystems. However, when fstab contains the user option on a line, anybody can mount the corresponding system.\nOr if you want any user to mount/unmount the drives use users instead.\n\nA: Actually the problem was that I hadn't restarted the system, so I had mounted nothing.\nRestarting the system or just forcing the mount everything works perfectly.\nI've just typed: \nsudo mount -a\n\n\nA: I had the same problem, I put it in /etc/fstab so it mounts automatically on boot.\n", "Q: Mail Server Postfix + Dovecot I'm running mail server on Ubuntu 12.04 and box has Web Server + Mail Server (Postfix + Dovecot).

You have to give it a name, you can create several networks in this mode. VirtualBox will connect all guests in the same internal network, so names must match on both virtual machines. The default should work right out-of-the-box.\nThe server needs an Internal networking with the same name and another one which connects to the world, in your case NAT.\nNow the guest server should be able to connect to the internet through the NAT interface.\nGive IPs to the machines\nIn order to the client and the server reach each other, their interfaces must be configured in the same network. You can do it manually (static addresses) or configuring a DHCP server in the server machine.\nThese are the steps to do it manually:\nroot@server:~# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0\nroot@client:~# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nYou can set any IP you want, but they must be in the same network. Here, eth0 in the server machine refers to the Internal interface, if you set interface 1 as Internal and 2 as NAT, the above commands will work fine.\nNow you should be able to ping each other, but packets from the client machine won't be able to travel through the server machine yet, only to the server.\nNote: These changes will be lost at next reboot, to make the changes permanent you have to edit and configure /etc/network/interfaces. If you are configuring the client with GUI from the desktop, skip the CLI configuration.\nConfigure forwarding\nYou need to configure forwarding. You could simply do\nroot@server:~# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\n\nbut this would only work until you reboot the machine. You need to edit /etc/sysctl.conf and uncomment #net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n so it looks like:\n# Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward=1\n\nThis will configure the server machine to forward packets (at next reboot).\nEnable masquerading\nThis will configure the server to do IP masquerading.\nroot@server:~# modprobe iptable_nat\nroot@server:~# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE\nroot@server:~# iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT\n\nTake care about eth0 and eth1, here the 2nd line must be -o NAT_interface and the 3rd line -i Internal_interface.\nConfigure the client to go through the server\nThis setting should have been already set, either in the GUI assistant or by editing /etc/network/interfaces/. Just in case it is not applied, add the default route through the server machine:\nroot@client:~# route add default gw 192.168.1.1\n\nConfigure DNS\nNow you should be able to communicate from the client machine, but if you configured the IP addresses manually, you still need to provide the DNS servers so you can resolve names.\nEdit /etc/resolv.conf and add the servers you like:\nnameserver 4.2.2.1\nnameserver 4.2.2.2\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nIf you configured DHCP in the server machine, you should have already told the DHCP server which DNS servers to use (if not, do it now).\nAgain, if you configured the client with a GUI assistant, just make sure the DNS are valid and skip this section.\n", "Q: can't locate storage. dual boot system I am new to ubuntu. I am dual booting my system w/ windows 8. I have the os on a ssd I have 4 1 terabyte hhd for storage. they are set up in windows under a storage pool. when I am ubuntu the drives are not visible. how do I fix this?\n\nA: At this time, there is no support for \"Storage Space\", a feature of Windows 8, for Linux. See this question on SuperUser, and this info from Acronis.\nKeep in mind that other Windows versions can't use this feature either.\n", "Q: Installing Ethernet Card driver while inside Live CD I want to install rtl8723au Ethernet driver before actually installing OS, so that i would have access to the internet in the process(wi-fi is the only option). I have all the files i need for that, but i don't know how to actually access them while i'm inside the Live CD. Is there a way to include it (the folder with the driver) somehow into the Live CD and install it from there, or preinstall it into ISO image?\nI need to be able to execute the following commands for drivers to be installed:\n\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo modprobe 8723au\n\nAlso, one additional question, if i somehow don't have \"make\" preinstalled, how can i install it without internet connection?\n\nA: (rtl8723au is not an Ethernet driver, but a wireless network adapter driver.)\nWhile you could do complicated things just to get a network connection during the installation process, I suggest to drop that idea and just proceed without network connection. Then, after the installation has finished, boot your fresh installation, install the driver and update packages. This has the same result.\nIf you would like to have a network connectiong during the installation that requires that driver, you could open a terminal and invoke the commands. Note that a kernel module requires more than just make, you will also need kernel headers matching the target kernel (linux-headers-3....-generic) and a compiler (gcc). The compiler and make are installed with the build-essential package. For offline package installation, see How can I install software or packages without Internet (offline)?\nWhen booting the Live CD, chose for Try instead of Install. You will then start a graphical desktop where you can look for the Terminal application to invoke the commands. If you have a USB, you could then also use the graphical file browser to find out.\nBe also aware that manually installing a driver module like that will break every time you update your kernel. To avoid that trouble, you could DKMS to rebuild your module at every update, and/ or file a feature request at the Ubuntu Bugtracker (Launchpad) for driver inclusion (if it was not already available).\nThe linux-image-extra-3.13.0-30-generic package ships with the rtl8723ae module which should support built-in PCIe cards, so maybe you do not have to go through that trouble of manually installing a driver. Note the e suffix for PCIe, you mentioned the rtl8723au module which exists for USB devices, but maybe that was a typo?\n", "Q: Hardware Enablement Stack (HWE) out of support From yesterday my update manager gives me this message:\n\nYour current Hardware Enablement Stack (HWE) is going out of support\n  on 07/08/2014.

I am testing my SMTP Server through wormly.com\nWhen I do the test, I end up with \n> SMTP -> FROM SERVER: 250 2.1.0 Ok RCPT TO: mygmailaddress@gmail.com\n> SMTP -> FROM SERVER: 554 5.7.1 : Relay access denied SMTP -> ERROR:\n> RCPT not accepted from server: 554 5.7.1 : Relay access denied\n\nMessage sending failed.\nI setup my mail server with the help of this Link\n\nA: This is the correct message since a third party website is connecting to your server and is not able to send out emails to external domains.\nIdeally, as per the configuration, if you send an email to one of your own domains, then it should be delivered.\nHad you been having an open relay, which means accepting emails for any domain, then it would be a big security risk and in no time your server would be blacklisted. It could also cause problems with your ISP for abuse.\nTesting out the email server\nI would highly recommend using services such as Mandrill.com to send out transactional emails rather than setting up your own server if you are inexperienced managing it. It can cause more harm than good.\nHowever, based on your comment, you need to setup and test out your mail server. That is not a trivial task and requires testing at various levels. Try the following at the basic level:\na) Create a virtual domain, and a virtual user inside that domain\nb) Do a telnet to the port 25 of your server and send a mail to that domain and see if it's delivered. You can check the error logs through tail -f /var/log/mail.log -f from a different console. Using telnet is easy\n  telnet yourserver.com 25\n  helo test.com\n  mail from: <test@example.com>\n  rcpt to: <youruser@yourdomain.com>\n  data\n  Type any content that you want, press enter, then put a period (.) and then enter to exit\n  .\n\nNow check if the email is delivered successfully through the error log. Once it's done, you'd know that incoming mails should work fine (provided A record/MX record for that domain is set correctly). Otherwise, based on the error, fix the issue.\nc) Now login into the server via ssh, and use mail command to send out the email\n  echo \"Test Email from the new server\" | mail -s \"Test Subject\" youruser@gmail.com\n\nCheck the spam folder of gmail as most likely, if all went well, it would have landed there. This way you would be able to check out the outgoing email.\nIf the java web application is residing on the same server, then you can use localhost as the email server within the application. If it is on another server, then you can enter that server's IP address under mynetworks line in postfix/main.cf, restart postfix and you can send email without authentication.\nOnce again, any wrong configuration can lead to misuse of the server, so be careful.\n", "Q: How to install library files I installed skype translting software CLOWN FISH in linux(ubuntu 14.04 LTS).

These are a portable and robust method of specifying certain problematic characters (such as non-printing characters and quotes) to programs that cannot recognize them in other ways. In this case, I am using them in a character class. When a character class begins with ^, it means \"match anything except the characters in this class. So, [^$'\\n'] means \"match anything except a newline character\". This ensures that the matches wer are looking for are all on the same line. \n\nA: What it is saying is that there is 'binary' somewhere in the stream:\nMaybe try:\npdfgrep regexp1 ./locn to file|grep --text regexp2|grep --text regexp3\n\nOr try using strings:\nAccording to strings manual,\n\n   For each file given, GNU strings prints the printable character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the\n   number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character.  By default, it only prints the\n   strings from the initialized and loaded sections of object files; for other types of files, it prints the strings from\n   the whole file.\n\n   strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.\n\n\nAlso of interest: \n\n\n*\n\n*How to grep a text file which contains some binary data? | Stack Overflow\n", "Q: How can I confirm that the binaries in my Ubuntu are from the source code it should be from? Like 99% of users, I install Ubuntu from ready-made binaries.\nHow can I verify myself that those binaries are in fact from the original source code from Ubuntu?\nIt would be good to verify that NSA/someone has not collaborated with either Ubuntu or Linode (my VPS provider) to mess with the binaries. If we could verify the binaries, they would also be unlikely to attempt this in the first place as it would be easy to call them out on it.\n\nA: If you're not willing to accept \"because Ubuntu says so\", then you can't.\n\nA: Ubuntu offers convenient means to compile a package on your own machine. However, there is no way to check that the executable in a binary package that you downloaded has been obtained from that source code. The signing process used by Ubuntu reduces the risk of  third-party tampering with the packages substantially, but you still have to trust that no harmful code has been added before the compilation that is not reflected in the downloadable source code.\nThe reason is that it is tremendously hard to obtain precisely the same binaries as there are in the compiled packages, as these depend on the precise compiler version, its options, and probably there are also some paths or environment variables compiled into the binary. So you will be unable to obtain precisely the same binary when compiling yourself, which would \"verify\" the downloaded binary.\nThere is actually a small research community around precisely this problem - how to make compilation reproducible.\nHaving said that, a manual comparison of a downloaded binary and a self-compiled one can detect added/modified code, so it would be risky for someone offering binaries and the source code to hide something in the binaries, as this can be detected.\nBut then there is also the problem of trusting the compiler, as already mentioned...\n\nA: It is a difficult problem to create the exact same binaries on two different machines.\nThe TOR project does this as regular part of their build. There is a description how they do it.\nDebian and Fedora seem to have projects making this possible for this distributions, but they are in the early stages.\nIt doesn't seem like there is any work done in Ubuntu.\nTo reproduce a Ubuntu binary Package you would need to reproduce the environment it was created in as closely as possible. To start with that, you first need to find out where and how this packages where compiled. It doesn't look like that information is easy to find.\n\nA: You can download the sourcecode and compile it yourself. But wait - first you have to check that sourcecode, because if Canonical collaborated with the NSA, they probably have entered some code somewhere to allow for a keylogger or something that can be activated remotely. \nSo...\n\n\n*\n\n*after downloading the sourcecode, \n\n*you have to check all code, \n\n*and then compile it!\n\n\nBut wait - can you trust the compiler?\n\nA: Checking with Ubuntu's MD5. If the MD5 you get from your files matches the one published by Ubuntu then no one has tampered with the binaries inbetween.\n\nA: That is a Hard job , I think trust here is better than this complicated job. But the question Can you trust ?\nBecause Open source software gives many freedoms for users to change in the code , you cant trust anyone .\nLets make a scenario for this purpose , i wanna check that my Ubuntu == source code , wait Why you don't try to compare packages to their source ?\n\n\n*\n\n*Build a binary package for Ubuntu from source .\n\n*compared the self-built binary package with the one published by the distribution.\n\n*Use apt-get -b source  to download the source .\n\n\nBut for me comparing well give you minor different results due to different timestamps , environments , but does that prove that its not from the source code ! \n", "Q: Wireless problems I have ubuntu 14.04 and haven't had any problems at all, but yesterday I got a new router and suddenly it can't find the network on the network list, and if I go in to settings>Network>Wireless it shows the Network but says it's out of range.\nI have surfed the web and tryed countless of options, but nothing works.\nIs it possible to make it work without reinstalling ubuntu from scratch?\n\nA: It might be related to settings in router, if you have an old laptop it might have difficulty at communicating with router.\nopen your router interface in a browser\n192.168.2.1\nnavigate to wireless>wireless net settings and pick up 802.11b then save and restart router.\n\nA: Have you configured the name of the wifi network in the router ? (It's called SSID).  A new router will have a new network name. You can either configure the SSID to be the same as the old one, or you can delete the wifi network from Ubuntu and connect to the new one. I would suggest deleting the wifi from Ubuntu, configuring your SSID and password on the router, and connecting to this new wifi.\n", "Q: apt-get upgrade fails with \"adduser: The user `messagebus' already exists.

Is there any way to find out how far it is, or if it is even still partitioning, or hanging?\nI'm just using the partitioner built into the Xubuntu installer.\nThe partman log says this:\nparted_server: resize_partition(openfs=true)\nparted_server: opened file system: yes\nparted_server: try to check the file system for errors\n/lib/partman/active_partition/80resize/do_option: error_handler: exception with type Timer\nparted_server: OUT: Timer\n\nparted_server: OUT: 0 (null)\n\nparted_server: OUT: ready\n\nparted_server: successfully checked\n/lib/partman/active_partition/80resize/do_option: error_handler: exception with type Timer\nparted_server: OUT: Timer\n\nparted_server: OUT: 0 (null)\n\nEDIT:\nI can't hear the hard disk doing anything at all either, but I don't want to reboot.\n\nA: I ended up rebooting, and nothing was broken; it just hadn't been doing anything at all; the resize failed. Next time you're wondering what is happening, these points might help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the log of the partitioner (e.g. /var/log/partman), maybe you can understand enough (although I didn't this time)\n\n*If you think something is happening, remember that resizing partitions takes ages, especially shrinking, and FAT32 (but also other files ystems)\n\n*What is the output of lsblk? Just like the original scheme? Or different?\n\n*How I decided it wasn't doing anything: Can you hear the hard disk working (or see the HDD LED blinking)? When resizing a partition, it should be working constantly. If, after half an hour, you still don't see any major disk activity, it isn't doing anything\n\n*Last point: Use GParted to partition. It generally works much better than anything else, gives you output, and is to be recommended.\n\n\nI hope this helps anyone who is in my (ex-)situation.\n", "Q: Hbase master not running in pseudo-distributed mode I am trying to run Hbase in a pseudo-distributed mode. I followed the link http://archanaschangale.wordpress.com/2013/08/31/installing-pseudo-distributed-hbase-on-ubuntu/ \nI am using ubuntu version 12.04\nHbase version 0.94.8\nHadoop Version 2.4.0\nIn hbase/conf/hbase-env.sh, i added the following\n\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_25\n\nexport HBASE_REGIONSERVERS=/usr/lib/hbase/hbase-0.94.8/conf/regionservers\n\nexport HBASE_MANAGES_ZK=true\n\nThen I set the HBASE_HOME path in bashrc file\nIn   hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml\nI added the following,\n<configuration>\n\n<property>\n\n<name>hbase.rootdir</name>\n\n<value>hdfs://localhost:9000/hbase</value>\n\n</property>\n\n\n\n<property>\n\n<name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>\n\n<value>true</value>\n\n</property>\n\n\n<property>\n\n<name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>\n\n<value>localhost</value>\n\n</property>\n\n\n<property>\n\n<name>dfs.replication</name>\n\n<value>1</value>\n\n</property>\n\n\n<property>\n\n<name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>\n\n<value>2181</value>\n\n</property>\n\n\n<property>\n\n<name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>\n\n<value>/home/prashasti/Installed/hbase-0.94.8/HBASE/zookeeper</value>\n\n</property>\n\n</configuration>\n\nTo prevent version mismatch between hadoop and hbase, I added  \nhadoop-common-2.4.0.jar\n\nand \nhadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.4.0.jar in hbase/lib folder\n\nWhen I start hbase using\n$./bin/start-hbase.sh\n\nNo error turns up, but the Hmaster doesn't start. \n\nA: This question is bit old.

We have network problems at our company and the network is often disconnected. At each disconnection Ubuntu (12.04) displays a pop-up in the right corner of the screen to inform me of this event. This is really annoying when it comes very often. How do I deactivate this?\n\n\nA: You can change it with gsettings:-\n\ngsettings offers a simple commandline interface to GSettings. It lets you get, set or monitor an individual key for changes.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To get current setting, run following command:\ngsettings get org.gnome.nm-applet disable-disconnected-notifications\n\n\n*To set (Enable) of disabling disconnected-notifications, run\nfollowing command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nm-applet disable-disconnected-notifications true\n\n\nHowever you can grep all settings for all available notifications by gsettings as follows:\ngsettings list-recursively | grep \"notifications\"\n\n& specifically for schema = org.gnome.nm-applet,\ngsettings list-recursively org.gnome.nm-applet\n\n\nA: In 12.04, you should be able to toggle that behaviour via the gconf database entry for nm-applet, using the gconftool  (or gconftool-2) command\ngconftool --set /apps/nm-applet/disable-disconnected-notifications --type bool true\n\nYou will likely want to disable the corresponding connected notification as well\ngconftool --set /apps/nm-applet/disable-connected-notifications --type bool true\n\nYou can check the current settings using\ngconftool -a /apps/nm-applet\n\n\n\nFor those seeking an answer for later versions of Ubuntu, @Jos has confirmed that in 14.04 the settings have  been migrated to the main dconf database at /org/gnome/nm-applet and can be toggled using the GUI dconf-editor tool. Modification via the CLI should be possible using gsettings.\n", "Q: Is there a \"Settings history\", or a log of changes in configuration? P.S. I have just found Is it possible to monitor dconf for changes?\nIt, together with the answer by Volker Siegel, answers my question. A note for Xubuntu users: some settings are not in dconf, but in xfconf.\nP.P.S. Related:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to keep \"dot files\" under version control?\n\n*How to backup settings and list of installed packages\noriginal question:\nWhen troubleshooting, sometimes I wish the application remembered: what exactly has the user changed in its settings recently. \nI wonder: does anybody know any application that has something like the log of changes of its settings?\nThe most similar things I knew about are:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt/history.log (but that is the installations history) \n\n*prefs.js of Firefox (but that is the union of all changes = without time). \n\n\nA: The program etckeeper keeps track of setting changes in the /etc directory, using a source code repository like git or bzr. So it really tracks the actual changes of config files. It commits changes automatically when installing packets, for example.\nSee man etckeeper\nIt's easy to set up - not much more than apt-get install etckeeper and optionally editing /etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf to select git instead of the default bazaar as version control \"backend\" - see this answer: Kevin Bowen on: \"Is there an application to manage config files in the /etc folder with version control software?\"\nIn theory, you could actually manage all your configuration files in a source code repository.\nIn practice, that is more tedious than it sounds - I would not recommend it as a general solution.\n\nThe question whether to use Canonicals bazaar (bzr) or Linus's git as repository backend is not really important;\nYou do not interact much with the repository in normal operation, and if you need to, like for tracking down a config problem, you'll need only basic vcs features, easy to look up. \nIf you are familiar to one of them more than the other (or plan to get familiar), choose it.  \nOne can discuss the question a long time in the style of the editor war of vi and emacs; for\nthe basics see Is it easier to manage code with GIT or Bazaar? - Google will keep you stocked with ammunition of your preferred side.\nOne objective reason to choose git is working in a software related field; I would expect more git to be used, or migrated to; so it's a useful skill to have worked with it a little. \n", "Q: How can I add a message after the \"last login\" shown when starting san ssh connection? I can't find how to add a message after the \"last login...\" line on my Ubuntu 14.04.

Or, alternatively, how can I edit the last login message?\n\nA: One way would be to run a command in the bashrc for SSH connections:\nIn /etc/bash.bashrc (for system-wide) or ~/.bashrc (for your user only), append these lines:\nif [[ -n $SSH_TTY ]]\nthen\n    # Do stuff to get the output.\n    echo \"Hi, SSH user $USER!\"\nfi\n\nI don't know how to edit the last login message, but you can disable it and simulate it by using the last command, and the filter and modify the output according to your need.\n", "Q: reliable USB wireless adapter I am aware that questions that are considered as subjective, will not be allowed on this forum.  But, the following question i have is very specific, because of the way i constructed this question (to avoid being subjective), and the answer could be useful to many like me, who are moving to Ubuntu 14.04, but stuck at the networking step.   I have searched long and hard on the net, to find an answer. But after many hours spent, i could not find anything. Posting this question in Ubuntu forum, did not produce any answer either. So, i created this account here, as a final resort. I hope the admins will not close this thread.   \nI am newbie to Ubuntu & Linux. I want to setup my Windows 7 PC for Ubuntu. This machine will run both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 (booted from a USB drive), when i finally set it up. During my preparation, i noticed that there are lot of questions on the net about USB wireless adapters not working with Ubuntu. I want to buy a wireless USB adapter that will \n\n\n*\n\n*be compatible and has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04.  \n\n*not only compatible, but more importantly, will work reliably without\ndropping connection everyday.  \n\n*will run in N300 or N150 (second\nchoice) protocol.  \n\n*currently my other machines are on WPA2-PSK (AES\nencryption). So i would like the same in this new USB stick.  \n\n*will also\nwork reliably when the machine boots in Windows 7 mode.\n\n\nI tend to run this machine continuously; so i need a wireless USB stick that will run for atleast a few days , without disconnections. If you have come across a USB for 14.04, that meets all OR some of the above criteria, please let me know. I have to buy this USB (hopefully from local Frys store) as soon as possible. I am using a NetGear (N 300 speed) router, and so it would be nice if i can find a Netgear USB wireless adapter. From past experience i know that it would be a safer bet, when the router and desktop receiver are paired from the same company. So, i am leaning towards NetGear, but am not tied to the brand, if i can find a reliable USB dongle that works on both Windows and Ubuntu 14.04. \nLooking forward to preparing my Ubuntu bootable USB drive tomorrow. \nThanks for any leads.\n\nA: What do you think of netgear.

I listen to a streaming radio broadcast on my Ubuntu GNOME PC for most of the day.  I'd like to send its output to my desktop speakers, while continuing to send the rest of the output to my headphones.\nWould it be possible to direct a single audio stream to a specific output device, while allowing all others to continue to use the default?\n\nA: To supplement what StallionSA wrote above, you do need a second audio device, but it does not have to be a sound card in the physical sense of a card which you insert into a slot on your mainboard.\nIf you do  a search on the web you will find many USB \"sound card\" devices  which could be used to connect your headphones and these range from budget to some quite expensive USB DACs specifically designed for quality headphone listening.\nOnce you have your USB sound card plugged in (which should in most cases be plug and play to use so long as it conforms to the USB audio conventions) you then would then need to configure /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf.\nto set the USB device to default ALSA sound card 0, and the other as sound card 1, and then use pavucontrol to direct the application streaming the radio station to the sound card to which the speakers are connected.\nIt is also possible to do via the environmental variable PULSE_SINK at the time of launching the application, eg in a Bourne shell \nPULSE_SINK=\"alsa_output.usb-Creative_Technology_SB_X-Fi_Surround_5.1_000004it-00-S51.analog-stereo\" mplayer \"http://mozart.wkar.msu.edu/wkar-fm-mp3\" &\n\nThe list of available sinks (Pulseaudio term for output device) can be found using\npactl list short sinks\n\n\nA: From my understanding you would need an second sound card, as most sound cards only have a single DAC \"digital to analog converter\", which can route an audio source to multiple jacks, you need a second sound card to have a second DAC to be able to route a second audio source to a second jack.\n", "Q: Automatically run a command on start up?

I've installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my desktop alongside windows 7.\nWhen I try to play any mp3 file with Parole Media player (which I believe is the default) , it says :\n\nParole needs MPEG-1 Layer 3(MP3) decoder to play this file.

It installed successfully, but I still can't play Music.\n\nA: You need to enable the Ubuntu Partner Archives and install the Fluendo MP3 plugin.\nYou may also want to install Ubuntu-Restricted-Extras, which includes LAME.  LAME generally provides better MP3 compression.\n\nA: I have used Parole in Ubuntu before. Although its from Xubuntu/XFCE but it works flawlessly on Ubuntu. To solve all the codec problems you need to install ubuntu-restricted-extras package.\nFor this you will have to enable universal repository (if you haven't already). If you don't have it enabled, go to \"Software & updates\" from dash or Settings. Then check all the checkboxes (except sources) and click Close. Then do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Ubuntu Software Center and search for \"Ubuntu Restricted Extras\" and install it.\n\n*If you don't mind using the terminal here's what you should run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\nAnd you should have the problem solved.\n", "Q: How to print all columns using AWK In AWK, is there a way to print all columns?

I started to install it and everything seemed to work fine, after i check the launcher after an hour it was at the same when i started it just saying \"Installing...\". Any suggestions why it's doing this?\n\nA: Sometimes, Wine 1.7 has problems installing straight to the OS, you need to install PlayOnLinux from the software center, then do the following.\nOpen PlayOnLinux\nClick Install a Program from the menu to the right\nFollow the steps\nCreate the drive\nChose the .exe file, follow the steps, restart PlayOnLinux, then run!\nThis should work for you.\n\nA: \"Why it's doing this?\":\nYou forgot You \"had a 30 gb game downloading\".

Once I log in and startx I see nothing but the blank desktop (resolution is correct).  No menu on left side.  I can right click or use power button to shut down.  What happened???\n\nA: While trying your suggestions I viewed this page: Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears\nThat solved the issue.  I started to step backwards, because the launcher DID show on first boot with the new card installed.  It was after I installed the NVidia drivers that I lost my launcher/title bar.\nI removed the discrete card and was able to check \"ubuntu unity plugin\".  Rebooted with card re-installed and the plugin must have fixed it. \n", "Q: Shell on ubuntu touch I want to test some C-code on Nexus 7 under Ubuntu touch.

I also like to stick with the \"no virus protection needed\" that linux is known for, since I've been a windows user for many years.\n\nA: Well, a \"Windows Virus\" is not going to run without Wine, and if you see that wine is running while you are not really using it, you should see what program is actually using it. But it's very unlikely that you will get a virus that way, I can't say it's imposible, but now you know how to detect one if it exists.\nSo I would not be worried about wine and viruses, because if you get one, it will be through your internet browser or mail for sure.\n", "Q: Touch Screen Clicks Repeatedly on Press - Can't Drag Ubuntu 12.04 LTS recognizes my touchscreen correctly.

This means that trying to drag something causes hudnreds of \"click\" events. I've looked through dozens of posts about evdev, xserver, xconfig, etc.\nHow can I make BTN_TOUCH stay a \"1\" as long as my finger is held down?!\n\nA: Installing the touchscreen drivers should solve the problem.

I more than likely screwed up the upgrade by forgetting to pass in a parameter and or messed up an answer during the upgrade.\nClarification:\nThe Upgrade to 14.04 LTS caused other problems, Getting the busy computer “spinner” a lot more than before, plus a few other problems. \nI decided to try to fix the spell checker first since I think that I might have a chance to save the old added words before trying to fix the other problems.\nReload all my words is a survivable problem but I like to avoid if possible.\nThank you for your help,\nMark\n\nA: Regardless of spell checking tool (libreoffice uses hunspell) the new words are added in standard.dic by libreoffice.\nIn 14.04 this file is in $HOME/.config/libreoffice/4/user/wordbook/standard.dic\nI am guessing that in 12.04 since libreoffice was at version 3.x so the file might be in $HOME/.config/libreoffice/3/user/wordbook/standard.dic\nOr if not there you can search for standard.dic in your home. From terminal: cd && find . -name standard.dic\nIts possible that the format of the file changed between 3.x and 4.x versions, or when moving to 4.x the profile did not correctly copy over standard.dic. In that case you should be able to find the words in 3.x standard.dic and copy them over to 4.x version in the location mentioned above.\n", "Q: How to install an earlier version of matplotlib? I have matplotlib 1.3.1 installed on my computer.\nHowever I have to run some code that runs with matplotlib 1.1.1 but not with 1.3.1.\nTherefore I should remove this version and installed 1.1.1.\nHow is this possible without breaking my python installation or anything else?\nAnd in addition how I prevent my computer from updating this library?\nI have Ubuntu 14.04 64bit\n\nA: Apart of the obvious solution of upgrading your code to work with the new versions of Matplotlib, you could perfectly install matplotlib in a virtual environment. For that you need to install the virtualenv package, then create your virutalenv (I will make it short and explain at the end):\nmkdir matplotlib_1.1.1\ncd matplotlib_1.1.1\nvirtualenv env\nenv/bin/pip install numpy\nenv/bin/pip install https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/m/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.1.1.tar.gz\n\nIf you used virtualenv/pip most of this isn't new. First we create and move to a new directory, then we create the virtual environment in the env directory. We proceed to install numpy which is one of the dependencies of matplotlib, and finally we manually select and install the sources of matplotlib with the version of our preference.\nYou can now use env/bin/python to open a interactive python shell, or run source env/bin/activate to change temporally the default python binaries.\nAh, btw, this doesn't require you to remove your already installed version of matplotlib, if you don't want to.\nMore reading about pip and virtualenv as well as some references http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/\n", "Q: '[Error writing /filename: Permission denied]' while trying to save a file using the nano editor Using the Nano text editor, I'm trying to save and exit a file.\n I already have the file named.\nI click Ctrl+X to exit.

U-boot does filesystem discovery  and that may be the place where you are seeing the performance issues.

The\n    entries in $PATH are used to find the directory containing FILENAME.\n    If any ARGUMENTS are supplied, they become the positional parameters\n    when FILENAME is executed.\n\nHence, the line where you execute the configuration file should be changed to source it:\n#!/bin/bash\nsource ${HOME}/.ssconfig\necho \"Hello, ${VARIABLE}!\"\n\nNote that source is a shell command, so the help for it is not in man source, but help source.\n", "Q: Prevent parameter expansion in shell script I often have to do a recursive search in files.

Must be something simple that I am missing.\n\nA: You need to familiarize yourself with the basic rules concerning shell expansion of variables.\nNAME=\"start\"\n\nIF you present $NAME to the shell it will be exanded to the string start\nIf you put single quotes around a string, the shell does not expand whatever is within the single quotes, so '$NAME' stays as $NAME\nNow with double quotes, the shell expands the variable $NAME to the string start but the double quotes prevent what is known as file globbing.\nWhat is file globbing you ask?\nWell it you do\nls -l *\n\nyou expect the ls command to list all of the files.  It is not ls which is converting * to all of the file names in the directory, but the shell.\nNow say you had a file named * in your directory and you just wanted to list that file, then you could use either \nls -l '*' \n\nor \nls -l \"*\"\n\nand both the single and double quotes prevent the shell from expanding the * to the list of files.\nGlobbing can also be turned off by doing\nset noglob\n\nRather than having this simple find string as a separate shell script requiring a new shell to be invoked every time it is used, the more efficient way is to create \nis as a shell function fs (find_string)\nfunction fs ()\n{\n \\find . -type f -name \"${1}\" -exec egrep --color \"${2}\" {} /dev/null \\;\n}\n\n\nA: I've demonstrated the problem here:\n$ pie() { echo $1; }; pie '*'\n1 2 3 4 5 file\n\nExpanded.

That is, when I open any application, it opens at the top-left of the screen.\nThe first thing I have to do for every application opened is to move it to the center of the screen (or wherever I want it to be). Then later on I'll close the app. But next time around, it's back at the top-left of the screen again!\nI have read related questions on AskUbuntu and across the web. However I was wondering, since those questions were asked with regards to Ubuntu 12.04, if there was a better solution to this problem for 14.04 users? Shouldn't something like this be in Settings? I mean, that's just common sense really. Isn't it? I really don't know anymore.\n\nA: (My other answer describes why restoring a window position is not possible for the general case.) \nFor special cases where saving and restoring a window position is feasible,\none can use shell scripts to save and restore the position or geometry (geometry is position plus size) for cases that can not be handled by the window manager configuration (see below).\nThere are various command line tools to read and set properties of windows -  for example wmiface and wmctrl.\nA minimal example:\nGet the geometry of a window in X geometry format (usually WxH+X+Y) (note the y coordinate - I am using 16 compiz virtual desktops/viewports):\n$ wmiface windowGeometry 46137711\n1256x814+1186+5005\n\nMove the window elsewhere (note the different format for geometry):\nwmctrl -i  -r 46137711 -e \"0,1186,4005,1256,814\"\n\n\nAnother approach is to define fixed positions for certain windows instead of restoring its position. This can usually be configured in the details of window handling configuration, like ccsm.\n\nA: Install ccsm (CompizConfigSettingsManager).\nAfter starting ccsm (launched from the Unity Search Button) perform the following:\n(Click on) Windows Manager\n(Click on) Place Windows\nUse these settings:\nWorkarounds    Unticked\nMulti Output Mode Place across all outputs\nThe Placement Mode Smart is the key for remembering your desired position.\nPlease keep in mind that some applications are programmed to override your system's perferred settings.\n\nA: Window positions are not that simple to handle as \"common sense\" may suggest.\nA position is ralative to some reference - like \"the screen\". But tere are so many variants of what \"the screen\" could mean here (see below), that it is not possible to save positions in a general way.\nOf course it can be done in various ways which are adapted to some environment - but if it's about \"just save a position, and restore later\" - that's not possible because the coordinate system to restore the position in is unclear.\nSo, what's difficult about showing a window at some position on a screen?  \nUnder Ubuntu - as on any modern X11-based system - the \"screen\" can change in various ways - during runtime, so saving position needs to handle that.\nFor example, the shape can change; From one rectangle to two rectangles side by side, to three rectangles with unaccessible space in between. The \"Virtual desktop\" can change. The viewport can change. Each affecting the coordinates that would be restored. \nA special problem is to make sure nothing is moved out of the currently accessible part of the \"screen\".\n\nOn the side issue of opening windows at the top left: You can choose one of multiple algorithms to decide where to place a new window in the window handling settings (eg. in ccsm). For example, you could have them opened where the current mouse pointer is.\n\nA: Just in case anyone lands here and really wants windows to be where you put them- install Enlightenment desktop. You can right click the icon top left of any page, select window, remember, and select size and position. I love that option and is one of the reasons I stay with e17.\n", "Q: GRUB rescue problem after deleting Ubuntu partition!

So I right-clicked the usr/share/themes folder > Properties > Permissions tab and tried to change the permissions but they're all greyed-out/disabled.\nSo then I opened up Terminal, entered groupmod TAB TAB TAB > sudo adduser jase root to try and get higher permissions or something - and it worked. I verified that I added myself as root by id jase. But that still didn't fix the problem. I still can't copy folders or files to usr/share/themes folder.\nHow can I do this? How do I become \"owner\"?\n\nA: You copy the file using sudo\nsudo cp file destination\n\nFor directories use th -R flag\nsudo cp -R directory destination\n\nIf the files or directories have spaces, you have to quote or escape ( \\ ) them\nsudo cp \"file with spaces\" destination\nsudo cp file\\ with\\ spaces destination\n\nFor information on Linux permissions and the use of sudo, see:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\nand\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\n\nA: You can't copy directories with cp in linux, unfortunately. The other answer is correct that you need root privledges with sudo, but you should do something like this to copy a directory:\ncd /home/jase/Downloads\ntar cvf flattastic.tar flattastic/\nsudo mv flattastic.tar /usr/share/themes/\ncd /usr/share/themes\nsudo tar xvf flattastic.tar\nsudo rm flattastic.tar\nBUT, in your specific case, there's something else you can do, I think.\nTry\ncd ~\nmkdir .themes\nmv /home/jase/Downloads/flattastic/ ~/.themes/flattastic\nYou might have to log out and back in, but I think that this would let you add themes without using sudo or root privledges at all.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 14.04 with Windows 8.1 I have a Sony Vaio SVS13A1S9ES.

The problem is that when I boot, I directly boot with windows and i'm not asked if I want to boot with Ubuntu. \nI've tried the following things:\n- Boot-Repair gets an error: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7772352/\n- I can't disable Windows Secure Boot because the option doesn't appear in my BIOS menu.

It is intended to replace the traditional BIOS firmware interface that is prevalent on earlier machines. This page provides information about installing and booting Ubuntu using EFI, as well as about switching between EFI mode and legacy BIOS mode using Ubuntu.\nInstalling Ubuntu Quickly and Easily via Trial and Error\nIf you have a computer that is more recent than 2010 and you do not know whether or not you need to install Ubuntu in EFI mode, you should be able to get Ubuntu installed quickly and correctly using the following steps:\nCreate a LiveDVD or LiveUSB of Ubuntu (>=12.04.2) 64bit.\nIn your BIOS, disable QuickBoot/FastBoot and Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT). If you have Windows8, also disable FastStartup.\nBoot your PC using the LiveDVD or LiveUSB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\". If you get a Secure boot or signature error, you may wish to disable SecureBoot then retry to boot the disk.\nInstall Ubuntu from the Live CD/DVD or Live USB in the usual manner, then reboot the PC.\nIf the PC does not load Ubuntu (but instead loads Windows, for example, as in Bug #1050940), or if the Windows entry in the GRUB 2 menu does not boot Windows (see Bug #1024383), boot your PC using the Live CD/DVD or Live USB and choose \"Try Ubuntu\" once again. When the live session has loaded, run Boot-Repair (see link for details). When Boot-Repair loads, click on the \"Recommended repair\" button, and write on a paper the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXXX/) that will appear. Then reboot the pc. Do not run Boot-Repair unless you have problems booting the computer; the expression \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" applies to this tool.\nThis should fix most boot problems. If this does not fix your boot problems, please try to determine if you have accidentally installed a 32 bit version on a system that requires 64-bit EFI version or perhaps installed the right version in legacy mode. If you installed the right version in the wrong mode you can convert it (more on this later) \nInstalling Ubuntu in EFI mode\nWarning: if you are a new Ubuntu user, you may want to follow the advice of the previous paragraph.\nCase when Ubuntu must be installed in EFI mode\nHaving a PC with EFI firmware does not mean that you need to install Ubuntu in EFI mode. What is important is below:\nIf the other systems (Windows Vista/7/8, GNU/Linux...) of your computer are installed in EFI mode, then you must install Ubuntu in EFI mode too.\nIf the other systems (Windows, GNU/Linux...) of your computer are installed in Legacy (not-EFI) mode, then you must install Ubuntu in Legacy mode too. Eg if your computer is old (<2010), is 32bits, or was sold with a pre-installed Windows XP.\nIf Ubuntu is the only operating system on your computer, then it does not matter, you can install Ubuntu in EFI mode or not. \nGeneral principle\nTo install Ubuntu in EFI mode:\nUse a 64bit disk of Ubuntu (Ubuntu32bit cannot be easily installed in UEFI mode)\nUse a supported version of Ubuntu. Support for UEFI appeared in 11.10, but has become more reliable in next versions. Support for UEFI SecureBoot appeared in 12.10 and 12.04.2.\nSet up your firmware (BIOS) to boot the disk in UEFI mode (see the \"Identifying if the computer boots the HDD in EFI mode\" paragraph below)\nThen:\nNothing special is required if you use the automatic installer of Ubuntu (\"Install Ubuntu alongside others\" or \"Erase the disk and install Ubuntu\"). Important: if you have a pre-installed Windows and you want to keep it, do not choose \"Erase the disk and install Ubuntu\".\nIf you use the manual partitioning (\"Something else\"), the difference is that you will have to set the /boot/efi mount point to the EFI partition. And if there was not any EFI partition on your HDD, you first will have to create it (see the \"Creating an EFI partition\" paragraph below). \n\nIdentifying if the computer boots the HDD in EFI mode\nThis is possible only if you have already installed Ubuntu on the HDD, or by looking at the BIOS setup (see paragraph below).\nFrom an Ubuntu installed on the HDD (neither liveCD nor liveUSB), open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), then type the following command:\n[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo \"EFI boot on HDD\" || echo \"Legacy boot on HDD\"\nRemark: if the result is \"Legacy boot on HDD\", then either the BIOS is not UEFI type, or the BIOS is not set up to boot the HDD in UEFI mode.\nIdentifying if the computer boots the Ubuntu DVD in EFI mode\nWarning: even if your PC boots the DVD in EFI mode, it might boot the HDD in Legacy mode (and the contrary).\nWhen booting on a 64-bit Ubuntu disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the BIOS is set up to boot the CD in EFI mode, then you will see the screen below:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If the BIOS is NOT set up to boot the CD in EFI mode, or if the disk is not 64-bit, then you will see the screen below:\n\n\n\nSet up the BIOS in EFI or Legacy mode\nSome recent computers (>2011) allow to set up the boot either in UEFI mode or in Legacy (not-EFI) mode. The way to carry out this setting depends on the computers, but generally this setting is located in the \"Boot order\" tab of the BIOS (to access the BIOS screens, it is generally necessary to press a key during the PC startup).\nNote: Some BIOSes (e.g. American Megatrends' \"Aptio\", found on the Asus vivobook series) call Legacy mode \"Compatibility Support Module\" or simply \"CSM\".\nRemark: Some BIOSes allow one to set up the boot mode for the optical drive separately from the boot mode for the HDD.\nFor example, below:\nThe \"UEFI Hitachi\" line allows to boot the HDD in EFI mode,\nThe \"P1: Hitachi\" line allows to boot the HDD in Legacy (not-EFI) mode,\nThe \"P3: DVD\" line allows to boot the Ubuntu CD in Legacy mode\nThe \"UEFI: USB\" line allows to boot the Ubuntu liveUSB in EFI mode. \n\nHere is a 2nd example of BIOS, simpler, where the \"Boot Mode\" parameter allows one to choose the boot mode (\"UEFI\" or \"Legacy\") for all media (hard disk, CD, USB...) at the same time.\n\nSome other firmwares (BIOSes) propose an \"UEFI/Legacy Boot:\" option with the following choices: [Legacy only], [UEFI only] and [Both]. This last one boots in EFI mode when possible, then in Legacy mode if no EFI files are detected.\nCreating an EFI partition\nIf you are manually partitioning your disk in the Ubuntu installer, you need to make sure you have an EFI partition set up.\nIf your disk already contains an EFI partition (eg if your computer had Windows8 preinstalled), it can be used for Ubuntu too. Do not format it. It is strongly recommended to have only 1 EFI partition per disk.\nAn EFI partition can be created via a recent version of GParted (the Gparted version included in the 12.04 disk is OK), and must have the following attributes:\nMount point: /boot/efi (remark: no need to set this mount point when using the manual partitioning, the Ubuntu installer will detect it automatically)\nSize: minimum 100Mib. 200MiB recommended.\n    Type: FAT32\n\n    Other: needs a \"boot\" flag. \n\nIdentifying if an Ubuntu has been installed in EFI mode\nAn Ubuntu installed in EFI mode can be detected the following way:\nits /etc/fstab file contains an EFI partition (mount point: /boot/efi)\nit uses the grub-efi bootloader (not grub-pc)\nfrom the installed Ubuntu, open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) then type the following command:\n\n[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo \"Installed in EFI mode\" || echo \"Installed in Legacy mode\"\nConverting Ubuntu into EFI or Legacy mode\nConverting Ubuntu into EFI mode\nNote: Do not follow this procedure if your computer is already booting correctly. Use this procedure only if you believe you've accidentally installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and you want it to boot in EFI/UEFI mode.\nStart Boot-Repair, click on \"Advanced options\", go to the \"GRUB location\" tab.\nIf you do not see a \"Separate /boot/efi partition\" line, this means that your PC does not have any EFI partition. In this case, exit Boot-Repair, then create an EFI partition (see the \"Creating an EFI partition\" paragraph above).\n    If you see a \"Separate /boot/efi partition\" line, tick it then click the \"Apply\" button.\nSet up your BIOS so that it boots the HDD in EFI mode (see the \"\"Set up the BIOS in EFI or Legacy mode\" paragraph above). \n\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n", "Q: Ethernet not working on Ubuntu 12.04 I've installed UBUNTU 12.04 on my laptop & when I plug-in the Ethernet cable, it says \"Disconnected\"\nPlease advise on me this\nPC Info:\nHP Pavilion ze4600\nPreviously- Windows XP Pro\nNow- Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Connect to the internet from Broadband or Wifi:\nInstall the ethernet drivers:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-3.8.0-42-generic\n\nThen reboot.\n", "Q: Read/If command help I'm trying to run this-\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Who are you?\"\nread NAMES\n\n{\nif [ \"$NAMES\" == \"Mallory\" ] ; \n    echo \"Hello, me!\"\nelse [ \"$NAMES\" == \"Palmer\" ] ; \n    echo \"Hey, baby!

Last night I set the BIOS to automatically start to the SSD and I chose the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows.  I intended for Ubuntu to solely be on the SSD and Windows to only be on the hard drive.  I am fairly certain that Ubuntu was properly installed on the SSD, however, for whatever reason I can't find it when I am using Ubuntu, I can only find the hard drive.  How do I find this SSD where Ubuntu is supposed to be installed?\nimages from gparted:\n\n\n\nA: You are doing well, the disk/partition with Ubuntu itself normally is not shown in the Nautilus as, for example, the Windows partitions are shown. Instead you can see it in gparted as at your picture,\n\nor, for example, in:\nmount -l\nwhich makes me thing you will find there this string:\n/dev/sdb1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n\nA: Run Disks (14.04) or disk Utility (12.04) On your system you will see something very similar to this:\n\nHere you will see all your drives. Select one and you'll see details regarding how they are partitioned and where they are mounted (if they are). You can see above that the first partition of my SSD is mounted at / (yours looks to be the same).\nYou can see all your drives and partitions with the command sudo fdisk -l everything that's currently mounted to the tree with cat /etc/mtab and all the filesystems that are configured to mount at boot with cat /etc/fstab. If you manually mount or unmount a drive /etc/mtab will be updated but /etc/fstab will not be. /etc/fstab can be edited to add \"permanent\" mounting of a filesystem at boot time.\nIn short you have done everything right and have no problem. To see how much space you have available  on your mounted drive(s) issue the command df -h in the terminal. You'll get a response similar to this: \ntvbox@tvbox-G31M-ES2L:~$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sdb1        58G   11G   45G  20% /\nudev            995M  4.0K  995M   1% /dev\ntmpfs           201M  832K  200M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone           1002M  920K 1001M   1% /run/shm\n/dev/sda3       867G  387G  436G  48% /home\n/dev/sdc1       3.7G  7.5M  3.5G   1% /media/0c3616b2-8c41-4e6d-8a1e-4dd192923088\n/dev/sr0        6.2G  6.2G     0 100% /media/08294\n", "Q: Are re-combined BTRFS incrementals identical to the original? I have several systems running btrfs, and I'd like to use the btrfs subvolume send/receive features as a backup solution. I want to send daily incrementals to remote as efficiently as possible. That means I want to avoid sending changes in a daily incremental and later sending the same changes in a monthly incremental.\nSpecifically, I want to generate nightly incrementals as such:\nbtrfs subvolume snapshot /home /backup/volume-date-daily\nbtrfs send -p /backup/volume-previous-daily -f daily-date /backup/volume-date-daily\npush daily-date to remote\n\nAfter a while I'd like to combine daily incrementals into monthly incrementals without re-sending all that data from the client. If I unpack all the incrementals (btrfs receive), then remove all the intermediate subvolumes I don't want, is the remaining subvolume sufficient for me to unpack all future daily incrementals generated by the client?\nFor example, the server has dailies 1-30 from the client. I unpack them and erase all subvolumes but daily 30. When I receive daily 31 from the client, can I unpack that using btrfs receive?\n\nA: As of BTRFS tools 3.12 and Linux kernel 3.13, the answer is no. When serialized BTRFS data (incremental or otherwise) is deserialized (btrfs receive), and the intermediate volume deleted, the latter volumes are updated. When they're re-serialized (btrfs send) they have different IDs. Latter serialized volumes which refer back to their parent volume by ID are unable to find their parent, due to changed ID.\nIt's not known if there is any workaround for this behavior.\nHere's what is possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create volume snapshots on disk, serialize them where each refers to the previous snapshot, and keep all those serialized files forever.\n\n*Deserialize volumes to disk (btrfs receive), remove some intermediate volumes, and re-serialize all volumes after the deleted volumes.\n\n", "Q: Netcat not working (at least, not that I can tell) Last night, I discovered that netcat, was behaving... well, oddly, to say the least. When invoked (I didn't use flags, just the basic \"netcat [hostname] [port number]), it would do one of two things depending on what was using it. That is, it behaved slightly differently if I ran a bash script that uses netcat, as opposed to using it on the command line. The script, which also used echo to supply a HEAD request on port 80, would prompt for user input as normal. Immediately after pressing enter, though, the script would instantly end and return me to the command line. On the command line, though, invoking netcat with a hostname and port number would start a new line with no command line. After a few seconds, it would go to the next line and I'd get the command line back. Long story short, I tried to fix it by using sudo to remove the netcat files from /bin/ (in hindsight, I'm not sure why I thought that'd help) before immediately realizing that I had screwed up and never once backed up, so I reinstalled the VM, which returned netcat to working order. At least, until just now, because it's doing the same thing again. Is there something I can do to troubleshoot this?\nEDIT: I didn't realize that I'm still running 13.04, which could (I hope) have something to do with netcat not working. Once I have version 14.04 running, I'll see if netcat works again and then edit the question again to share the results. If it works, I will also wait for one or two days to see if the issue reappears. If it doesn't, I'll add an answer.\nEDIT: Now I'm very confused. Netcat was still behaving the same way after I updated to 14.04. Worse still, the problem wasn't fixed, even temporarily, by reinstalling 14.04 through an .iso. If anybody can help me fix this, I'd be extremely grateful.\n\nA: Your example, INPUT=hostname; echo -e \"HEAD / HTTP/1.1\\nhost: $INPUT\\n\\n\" | nc $INPUT 80, works in the command line (shows ok result from server), but not when put in a script, containing just the line (shows bad request error from server). \nIt's caused by a tricky shell incompatibility related to dash:\nYou run the shell script with the minimalistic shell /bin/dash - which is also linked as /bin/sh, the default shell. It's used when there is no \"shebang\" line, or #!/bin/sh.\nThe problem is caused bu the echo builtin command of dash, which does not support the -e option. The -e is literally passed as part of the HTTP request - which causes the server to return an error \"400 Bad Request\".\nTo fix, use bash instead of dash, for example by using the first script line #!/bin/bash\n", "Q: 32-bit OS on a 64 bit processor I have a laptop with a 64-bit processor, but by accident i installed the 32-bit version of Ubuntu 14.04. i can always back my data up, and re-install Ubuntu, but i want to know if using 32-bit will be slower on a 64-bit processor, than a 64-bit OS on a 64-bit processor. thanks guys\n\nA: Like @neon_overload said, almost none-no difference. Usually with 32 bit, it's easier to install software, such as Skype etc. But nowadays, it's pretty easy. BTW, 64 bit is more powerful and if you can have it, why not? \nBenefits of 64 bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*16 general purpose registers instead of 8\n\n*Additional SSE registers\n\n*A no execute (NX) bit to prevent buffer overrun attacks\n\n*More powerful compared to 32 bit\n\n*Higher C integer limit\n\n\nBenefits of 32 bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Easier install of software sometimes\n\n*Faster if low on RAM (512 MB - 1 GB)\n\n\nA: Running 32 bit Ubuntu will only be marginally slower than running 64 bit Ubuntu. Some software benefits more from the new instructions in x86_64 than other software. Overall the speed difference will be negligible.\nA more important issue is the memory limit of around 3GB for the system and a per process limit of 2GB even if you have more RAM installed. If you have no more than 2GB RAM on the machine the drawback of 32 bit Ubuntu will be small but if running with more RAM the drawback is that you won't be able to use all that RAM which is somewhat more severe a drawback.\nConversely when you are severely limited in RAM, for instance you have less than 512MB, then 32 bit can theoretically gave some benefits in that compiled 32 bit code takes up a little less memory than compiled 64 bit code. However the difference is small and increasing system RAM if possible is a much better solution than the small percentage of benefit you'd get from smaller code size of 32 bit code.\n", "Q: How do I manually partition my hard drive correctly?

Then, replace the MBR with a another partition table. I would suggest using GPT, as it has a capacity of 2^64-1 sectors. Please note, wiping your partition table will also wipe everything on your hard drive.\nIf you want to do this, you must first backup anything important to another location (such as an online storage service or another hard drive). Then, open GParted, and select your device in the upper right corner (it should be /dev/something). In the Device menu, select Create Partition Table. In the drop-down menu, select GPT. Then, create your partitions, Select the Apply All Operations button from the Edit Menu, and begin installing Ubuntu.\n\nA: I haven't done a Windows 8 Ubuntu dual boot before, but I've done several Windows 7 Ubuntu dual boots. I can't help you with the UEFI aspects of the boot, but maybe you can take some info from my usual partition scheme and apply it with UEFI specific boot solutions:\nWhen dual booting I usually have (in an Extended partition, each partition is Logical, and at the beginning of the space):\n500 Mb /boot partition ext4 (I install grub to this location)\n~30 GB / partition ext4\n??? GB /home partition ext4 (this is any size you want it -- it's where your files are going to live. Take advantage of your large harddrive. Think how much space you will likely need at max for your files.)\n3-4 GB swap partition \"swap area\" or \"linux swap\" type.\nI format every partition but swap and install. Be sure to install grub to the /boot partition or else it will install to your MBR! Which is fine if you know how to get Windows booting with your grub in the MBR, but I usually install a utility such as EasyBCD (free) to my Windows OS, and use that to configure the MBR boot manager. \nI imagine you can do something similar with UEFI ... point your windows boot manager to the /boot partition and boot up linux. It calls grub, so you have 2 layers of boot menus basically, but I'm fine with that. I find it feels safer to install grub to a separate partition, as it's a lot easier to get Linux to boot  from a Windows bootmanager than Windows to boot from a Linux boot manager, at least for me. Usually your Windows partition will also already have all your files and data you don't want to lose, in this scheme you are sure that if everything fails you will still have a bootable, working Windows install.\nOf course, this all worked for Win7/Linux dual boots, but the main partition scheme (/ , /home , swap) should be universal. There are many ways of partitioning your system, this is the scheme I find has worked best for me.\n", "Q: How can I install ansys, nastran or any designing software?

I've been using Record My Desktop for a while but a \"problem\" shows up. Today I have two monitors. One monitor extend another, but RMD when is capturing my desktop, records the entire desktop which means the capture of both monitors.\nIs there a way to record only one monitor with Record My Desktop? If this is not possible, what software can I use to capture only one monitor (desktop), main one for example?\nJust for comparison, on Windows there is a software called Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) wich have the options to separate the capture. I know they are working on a multiplatform software (OBS Studio). But for now, it's not avaliable.\n\nA: From the Record My Desktop website, you can apparently select a window to record, an area of the screen to record, or the entire desktop.  For what you are trying to do, I would set an area to record equal to the one monitor that you want to record.\n", "Q: Boot-repair: \"You have to give the partition where EFI files are located.\" I'm using the 64 bit ISO of Boot-repair to deal with UEFI.

Be careful to install the correct version (the same version which is \"installed\" currently).\n", "Q: Restoring backup files from XP to Ubuntu Since XP is no longer supported and I have no desire to enrich Mr. Gates any more by upgrading I have decided to take the plunge and run Ubuntu on my main home desktop.  The goal here is to completely wipe my main drive and install Ubuntu.  However, I have ammased quite a collection of photos and important documents on my drive and I need to backup and then restore them.  These files are frankly scattered all over the place on my drive and it would likely take days to ensure I have them all backed up if I were to do it one folder at a time.  I currently backup my files using Windows backup to a second hard drive.  What I want to know is can I view the Windows backed up files in Ubuntu and then select the ones I need to restore?  I'd like to be able to sort them by filetype and then choose the ones I want to restore.  And what about specific Windows programs?  For example, I have an extensive file on geneology using Family Tree Maker.  Will I be able to access this file using Ubuntu?  Is there frankly an easy way to do all this?\n\nA: \nWhat I want to know is can I view the Windows backed up files in Ubuntu and then select the ones I need to restore? \n\nNo / doubt it. These backups tend to be created for that specific program in Windows and have some form of encryption or compression. You need to restore the files you want in Windows and then copy them over to Ubuntu. \n\nFor example, I have an extensive file on geneology using Family Tree Maker. Will I be able to access this file using Ubuntu? Is there frankly an easy way to do all this?\n\nNo / doubt it. There are 3 programs that are about creating a family tree in Ubuntu: Gramps, Lifelines and Geneweb. But it would also mean you need to start from scratch. \n\nUbuntu is another operating system with its own methods of doing things. You need to unlearn everything you know about using your computer and re-learn the Ubuntu way. That also means that most of the data files will need to be created. If at all possible. jpegs, pngs etc are not a problem.  xls(x), doc(x) are readable with OpenOffice with some restrictions (VB macro's do not work since there is no VB).\nSo you will run into some challenges.\nBut there is a way to make the transition easier: \nI would buy a new harddisk, make it the primairy disk, install it in your system, install Ubuntu on that new harddisk. Your Windows disc will be mounted automatically in Ubuntu and that way you can copy over any file from Windows to your Ubuntu system with the least amount of risk. And you can take your time copy'ing those files over. \nIf at any time you feel you need to go back to Windows take that new disc out and set your system up as it was before your inserted that disc. \nYou can do the same by clearing out parts of the current harddisk(s) and create unallocated space and install Ubuntu in the unallocated space. This will also get you a dual boot setup. This is more risky though: you can tell the installer to delete your Windows if you do this wrong. I would not do this without creating a backup (but since you said files are all across your system that might be daunting to do correctly).\n\nA: Just adding some additional considerations to Rinzwind's great answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Importing data files from Windows is easy as long as they are not in a very uncommon format.   \nPictures, videos, office documents and more can be opened and viewed right away (you will be prompted by the Ubuntu software for installing any missing components for closed source formats such as mp3 or video).\n\n*To test this just try out Ubuntu from an installation CD (or USB).  \nYour Windows partition can be mounted and viewed. Files supported from the default Ubuntu applications will open from there on double-click.\n\n*Do not expect that a proprietary Windows backup/restore solution will be supported from Ubuntu.  \nFiles that are just copied to an external backup medium (hard drive, CD-ROM) can be easily imported however. Common compression formats will also be supported, hence you will be able to also unzip your ZIP archives.\n\n*Many but not all software has good and free alternatives in Ubuntu.  \nIn case any special software is not available or can not be replaced you may be able to still run it by installing the compatibility layer Wine. Some older program versions of Family Tree Maker were reported to perform well, but there is no guarantee for that. A better approach is converting your data to a natively supported genealogy software.\n", "Q: php5enmod returns command not found I've tried a number of guides on this issue, but so far I cannot get php5enmod mcrypt to work.\nUbuntu 12.04\nPHP 5.3.10\n\nHere is the output ls of /etc/php5/conf.d and /etc/php5/mods-available\nhttps://privatepaste.com/35aee04356\nroot:~# sudo php5enmod mcrypt\nsudo: php5enmod: command not found\nroot:~#\n\n\nA: php5enmod was introduced in Debian in version 5.4.0~rc6-2 of the package php5 (see the changelog, Ctrl+F is your friend).

I have a 2 Gb USB stick and it works fine every time I try Xubuntu in live mode.\nMy plan is to install it on an SD card with 32 Gb capacity.  \nI do not want to do partitioning on my current hard disk, I am not the only user of the computer. We have no external or portable hard disk.\nI will try Xubuntu in live mode and install it on the SD card without modifying any portion of the current hard disk (now with Windows 7).\nWill my plan work? I do not know if it will affect any content on our Windows 7 or any portion of the boot manager.\n\nA: Yes. This can be done provided you proceed with caution. The grub bootloader doesn't have to be installed on the same drive as your Windows installation.  I do similar things with USB sticks often. If your BIOS supports booting from SDcard it's a standard installation, if not, there's a tutorial on how to do exactly what you have in mind here.\n\nA: That is not a very good idea.. Once you install any version of Ubuntu or Xubuntu, it creates and manages the GRUB loader, which stores all the information about the booting point of both Windows and your current distro. If anything should go wrong, you might have to repair Windows for recovering the bootloader for Windows.\n", "Q: How can we remove text from start to some particular selected word using sed command in linux I have a simple query related to selection and replacing text in linux. I am using sed command. I have the following text:\n\nhello world, I am just simple text for display.\n\nNow I want to print to \"hello world\" only I can do it using following command in linux.\necho \"hello world, I am just simple text for display.\" | sed 's/, I am.*//g'\n\nNow I want totally inverse of this function, how can I remove \"hello world\" by using a simple command just like sed.\nOutput required:\n\n, I am just simple text for display.\n\nI would prefer if linux commands (sed etc) are used.\n\nA: To reverse the effect of your command AND keeping the same part of the string to be matched (assuming that this is the only fix part of the string and you want to get rid of any other part that may vary), you can do :\necho \"hello world, I am just simple text for display.\" | sed 's/^.*\\(, I am.*\\)/\\1/g'\n\nResult :\n, I am just simple text for display\n\nWhat the regular expression is doing :\n\n\n*\n\n*^.* : matching any character at the beginning of the string until the next expression\n\n*\\( & \\) : to catch the part of the string which is matched by the expression in between (must be escaped by \\ or they will match the parenthesis character).\n\n*, I am.* : the match you give us, \n\n*\\1 : will be replaced by the result of the match of the first sub-expression between parenthesis\n\n\nThis way, you have the exact reverse effect of the command in your question, using the same part of the string to do the match.\n\nA: You could use the sed option s. The command will be,\necho \"hello world, I am just simple text for display.\"|sed 's/.*, //g'\n\ngives\nI am just simple text for display.\n\nExplanation\n\n\n*\n\n*.* matches any number of any characters\n\n*,<space> matches , and space\n\n*So the combination .*,<space> matches everything before , and space including both, and replaces them with nothing.\n\n\nA: $ echo \"hello world, I am just simple text for display.\" | sed 's/^hello world//'\n, I am just simple text for display.\nExplanation: in sed (and elsewhere, like in vim), use carat (^) to indicate start of line.

I've created and used \"Live SD\"'s like this with persistence before, but I needed more space. I checked out a number of sources (like this one), and most of them recommended using GParted to create a separate \"casper-rw\" partition. \nI usually use Windows 8.1 for most of my work, so I loaded up a Ubuntu 14.04 (not Lubuntu) virtual machine in VirtualBox. After managing to access the SD card in the virtual machine, I brought up GParted and followed the instructions (except I used ext4 instead of ext2). GParted gave me a number of warnings such as \"Moving a partition might cause your operating system to fail to boot.\" that I hadn't seen mentioned in the tutorial. Finally, I clicked \"Apply All Operations\", and it asked me if I wanted to use FAT32. I chose yes. Seconds after this decision, the program closed altogether, followed with messages about hardware problems. \nI figured that it was an issue with the way that VirtualBox was accessing the SD Card, so I decided to create an additional Live-USB with Lubuntu on it. I booted from this Live-USB, then inserted the SD card. I used GPartition again, and it gave me the same warnings. Finally, after choosing to use FAT32, the program simply shut down again, this time with no warning.\nI found another post suggesting that I simply use Fedora, though I don't think this really solves or explains the problem.\nIs there a new way that I should be doing this? Is the tutorial simply outdated?\nUPDATE: It appears that using GParted on Fedora works well, though it took an exceptionally long time even on my best computer. Will make sure to test this out on Ubuntu again later to find out what the problem is.\n\nA: If GParted closes when an operation is applied, then that is not normal and sounds like a bug.\nCan you try performing one step at a time and applying?  That will help to isolate what step is failing - the fat32 resize, or the ext4 file system create.\n\nA: I've had the same problem, both with gparted and fatresize. It seems to be a bug, specifically bug #1313600.\nIn the end, my solution was to format the USB drive manually and not use any move or resize operations for FAT32.\nFYI, note that using the command-line tool parted to resize/move the partition doesn't work either, as it is not filesystem-aware and will corrupt your data (see here).\n", "Q: Software updater needs more disk space I got the following error message from Software Updater:\nThe upgrade needs a total of 74,6 M free space on disk '/boot'.

However, every time I start Ubuntu, the keyboard language/layout has switched to English (I think) and I have to select the correct disposition again (\"Es\"). The tray icon, though, always shows \"Es\" as the input language, which, by the way, is the only option available. \nIs there a way to tell Ubuntu to properly configure the keyboard?\nEdit: Once I login, I always change the language using the top-left button on the tray (see the \"[Es]\" icon in the picture below:)\n\n\nA: I have an idea that may appear somewhat counterintuitive...\nOpen the Text Entry window and add English (US) to the list of input sources, while keeping Spanish at the top of the list. That's how I have it setup myself (even if I have Swedish instead of Spanish) and it usually works fine.\n\nA: Starting from the first boot after a successfull Ubuntu installation the typical scenario, according to my experience, is:\n\n\n*\n\n*you get the US/American language for the UI, for the input you get the keyboard layout according to your locale\n\n*\n\n*if Ubuntu can't determine your locale the fallback is on the US keyboard everytime\n\n\n*after the first boot you have to download and update all the language packs for all the software that you have, this way you get to complete the setup for the language for your specific locale for both the interface and input.\n\n\nYou can always enable and disable more than 1 option for the keyboard layout, after downloading and installing all the language packs I tipically go into the setting panel and make sure that all the keyboard layouts are disabled except the one I'm interested in. The little icon with the locale in the upper right corner of your desktop should contain a shortcut to the settings anyway.\n", "Q: How to disable the \"unlock your keyring\" popup? I read through all the related answers, but they do not apply to Ubuntu 14.04.\nI have no .gnome2 folder and no Passwords and Encryption keys item in the system settings. I tried to crawl through every possible menu, but I could not find out how to do it.\nThe popup usually pops out when I start Chromium.\n\nA: Fire up \"User Accounts\", set \"automatic login\" to \"off\". At startup you will be asked your user/password only once; popups like \"unlock keyring\" will never pester you again.\n\nA: This is for 14.04\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the password/keyring manager from settings (or run it directly - seahorse)\n\n*Ensure Menu > View > By Keyring is ticked.\n\n*In the sidebar, under 'passwords' create a new keyring 'Unprotected' (or re-use an existing keyring, e.g. 'Default', but NOT 'Login' because that will make everything unprotected which you probably don't want)\n\n*Right-click the new keyring, and 'set as default'\n\n*Right-click the new keyring and set its password as empty (only needed if you adopted an existing keyring)\n\n*In the 'Login' keyring, delete the network secret for your wifi.\n\n*Go to the network manager and add the network again - its secret should appear in the default keyring, which has no password.\n\n*Set the default keyring back to Login.\n\n\nA: About the Chrome and the keyrings\nThis problem occurs because Chrome wants to store usernames/passwords in the keyring (so they are encrypted). Therefore, every time you open Chrome, it tries to unlock the keyring.\nPlease note that, in Linux, Chrome can use different keyring types for the passwords you store in the browser:\n\n\n*\n\n*Basic keyring: where Chrome stores passwords in a local SQLite database called “Login Data” ($HOME/.config/chromium/Default/Login Data). There, the passwords are unencrypted.\n\n*Desktop keyrings: (i.e., gnome-keyring or KWallet) where Chrome stores the passwords in the services provided by GNOME or KDE. It stores the encrypted passwords in a special database that must be unlocked before it can be used.\n\n\nTo disable the “unlock your keyring” popup permanently, you may (1) instruct Chrome to avoid the desktop keyrings or (2) create a desktop keyring or modify the default one using Seahorse (for GNOME) or KDE Wallet Manager (for KDE).\n\nYou may instruct Chrome to avoid the desktop keyrings and use a local database. If you do that, Chrome will not try to unlock the keyring again. However, every time you instruct Chrome to \"remember a password\", the password will be stored in plan-text in the your local computer. An expert user may get access to your passwords in plan-text if you use this alternative. This solution is recommended only if you do not ask Chrome to remember your passwords.\n\n\nInstructing Chrome to avoid the keyring \nTo run Chrome without using the keyring, you may use the option --password-store=basic:\n$ google-chrome --password-store=basic\n\n\nModifying the Chrome launcher (icon) to avoid the keyring\nConsidering that you usually run Chrome doing a doble-click on an icon, you must change the command for the icons you use to include the additional option to run chrome in this way all the time. You may edit (1) the global launcher in the /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop \n folder or (2) the personal launcher file located in the ~/.local/share/applications/ directory. \n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the launcher file.

It ended.\nI changed my password using:\nsudo passwd vimal\n\ngave changed password for sudo, the current login and then new password (my old password, typed twice).\nShut-down.\nAnd it did not come again!\n\nA: Just remove it's file as a charm:\nrm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring\n\n\nA: Just remove / turn off your online accounts when not needed. I had the same problem and I solved this by removing my online account.\n\nA: I know this question is rather old, but for me the cause was WiFi networks. The configuration utility for NetworkManager (right-click on nm-applet and choose \"Edit Connections...\") offers two ways to save a WiFi password - one is to use a keyring and the other is to save it internally. I had switched from using a keyring to saving it internally because I preferred the convenience of the latter method, however the password was still saved in the keyring which then wanted unlocking.\n", "Q: Gnome on Ubuntu 14.04 crashes after starting Progress DB I am a Progress 4GL application developer.

Oracle VB Has troubles like this because you're running two operating systems at the same time. it all depends on your specs, if I could get those. Running two OSes at the same time on a (no offense, if applies) crap computer can make the VM crash like a drunk driver. You might just need to actually install Ubuntu on the computer as a real OS.

The laptop has a built-in Intel sound card, but I use the HDMI connection to my monitor to play the sound on my monitor speakers.

I recently decided to set up my custom built system to be Linux only and I manually set up /boot, /, and swap partitions with /boot and / being ext4 filesystem types. Upon completing installation of Ubuntu 13.10 (as my 14.04 iso was corrupt) and restarting, I would be faced with grub rescue prompt. I tried installing the boot loader installation on /dev/sda and /dev/sda1 where my /boot partition was and it seemed my system could not find grub. I finally got tired of messing around with this and deleted all my partitions using GParted and installed from a Live DVD and allowed the installer to install Ubuntu for me. When it was done installing, I became curious and checked via GParted how the partitions were set up and the partitions were the same with the exception of /boot was using the fat32 filesystem. I rebooted the system and it booted up correctly with no problems.\nAre there certain filesystem types that should be used for the /boot partition simply so grub will be found/read?\n\nA: Do not use ext2:-\n[root ~]# grub2-install /dev/sda3\nInstalling for i386-pc platform.\ngrub2-install: warning: File system `ext2' doesn't support embedding.\ngrub2-install: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using blocklists.  However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..\ngrub2-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.\n[root ~]# \n\n\nA: In theory, almost anything that both the Linux kernel and GRUB (or whatever boot loader you use) can read is suitable for /boot. Most distributions default to ext4fs, but I've used ext2fs, ext3fs, and XFS with no problems under Ubuntu. I don't recall offhand if JFS is supported at installation. If so it should work fine, too. ReiserFS, HFS+, and FAT are not supported for /boot by Ubuntu's installer, but they all work fine if you set them up after the fact. Chances are a few more (NTFS, exFAT, and some others) would work, too, but I've never tried them -- at least, not with GRUB. FAT deserves special mention because, if you're using EFI, the EFI System Partition (ESP) is FAT, and mounting the ESP at /boot can simplify use of certain boot loaders and boot managers, such as ELILO and gummiboot, which require the kernel to reside on the same partition as the boot loader. Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 by default, so this isn't an issue with Ubuntu if you use the default boot loader, but if you want to experiment it might be worth considering. OTOH, using FAT for /boot will slightly complicate OS version updates and re-installations.\nOne complication to changing the filesystem on /boot (on an already-installed system) is that you may need to completely re-install GRUB. The reason is that its filesystem driver gets built into its binary (stored in the sectors following the MBR, in the BIOS Boot Partition, or in the grubx64.efi file, depending on the boot mode and partition table type). Thus, if you change the filesystem, that binary must be reconstructed, which is done by grub-install. This isn't an issue for fresh Ubuntu installations, since the installer will run grub-install as part of the installation process, so it should work fine as long as the Ubuntu installer itself accepts your choice of filesystem -- which, as I've said, will actually narrow your choices from what GRUB permits.\n\nA: I use ext2 (more of a habit), you can use ext3, ext4 too for grub2, it is not that important.\n\nNowdays on modern Linux distros ext2, ext3 and ext4 are equally supported so it means you can use one of them. \n\nsource: https://superuser.com/questions/470688/why-100mb-ext2-boot-partition-recommended-for-linux\n", "Q: How to properly restart unity?

When reading the content of a script, I found something like:\necho \"An Example\" > !$\n\nSo I wonder what does !$ mean in bash .\n\nA: From man bash (somewhere after the line 3813):\n\n!      Start  a  history substitution, except when followed by a blank,\n          newline, carriage return, = or ( (when the extglob shell  option\n          is enabled using the shopt builtin).\n\n[...]\n\n$      The  last  word.   This  is  usually the last argument, but will\n          expand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.\n\n\nSo, the !$ will recall the last argument from the last command from history.\nHere are some examples and equivalents:\n$ echo foo bar\nfoo bar\n$ echo !$ # recall the last argument from the last command from history\necho bar\nbar\n\n$ echo foo bar\nfoo bar\n$ echo !:$ # the same like `!$'\necho bar\nbar\n\n$ echo foo bar\nfoo bar\n$ echo !:2  # recall the second (in this case the last) argument from the last command from history\necho bar\nbar\n\n$ echo foo bar\nfoo bar\n$ echo $_ # gives the last argument from the last command from history\nbar\n\n$ echo foo bar\nfoo bar\n$ echo Alt+. # pressing Alt and . (dot) in the same time will automatically insert the last argument from the last command from history\nbar\n\n$ echo foo bar\nfoo bar\n$ echo Alt+_ # the same like when you press Alt+.\nbar\n\n$ echo foo bar\nfoo bar\n$ echo Esc. # the same like when you press Alt+.\nbar\nAll of these will work only inside of an interactive shell. But if you use that command from your question inside of a script as you said that you sow it, then the things are different: when you run the script, this will start in a new shell, a non-interactive shell, so the history expansion doesn't has any effect in this case and so the command:\necho \"An Example\" > !$\n\ncreates the file !$ if not present (otherwise overwrites it) and write An Example into it.\n\nA: Well i found that !$ means last argument so for an example :\ntouch /tmp/file1\n\nHere the argument is /tmp/file1 , so !$ replaced /tmp/file1 in echo example .\nIf then you type the command du -b !$ , the output will be the disk usage in bytes for /tmp/file1\n", "Q: Is ubuntu touch available for phones with physical keypads? I'm using NOKIA X2-01 and want to install Ubuntu. Can I? I guess it is the same for a Nokia 201 or even a blackberry - will it work?\n\nA: Ubuntu phones is not available for the Nokia phone.

I'm in the process of reinstalling the oses I had installed but when I go to install ubuntu, it says there are no recognized install operating systems. i have almost 2/3 of the disk as unallocated space with windows 7 on a 75G partition. what could be wrong?\n\nA: You did not boot the installer into UEFI mode.

For rams higher like 8 GB swap partition of 2 GB will be sufficient.\n\nA: Personally I always make my swap 512 MB, just to have some wiggle room. If the OS starts using a lot of swap, you really need more RAM. (And if getting more RAM is not an option, then you can consider having more swap, it's better than nothing.)\n\nA: 4GB.\nWithout additional information we can't be specific, so I'm erring on the larger side: 4GB is probably more than you need, and disk space is cheap.\n", "Q: How to mount ZFS drive on Ubuntu?

How to recover back?\nIm not able to find it in trash folder\n\nA: The 'rm' command does not employ the Trashcan mechanism of Unity.  You may be able to employ some of the tools mentioned in How to recover deleted files?, however it might already be too late - one of the first steps in a situation like this is \"stop using the hard disk\"\n\nA: First you should mount the partition in read only mode to prevent the OS accidentally overwriting the deleted content.\nYou could try it with PhotoRec. Although there is \"Photo\" in the title it can recover any files. You need a second partition in which PhotoRec then writes the recovered files. Because it can't check how recent the file was deleted, it will recover files which you might have deleted ages ago (depending on the usage of the drive).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 14.04: How to keep the state in remote desktop sessions? I need to prepare an Ubuntu server for concurrent use for 5 users. The idea is using this server from Windows 7/8 clients remotely, through \"Remote Desktop\"-like applications. At this moment I have done the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) in the server computer + GNOME3 desktop\n\n*Installing xrdp for the remote sessions\n\n*Installing xfce4 as GUI for remote sessions \n\n*Creating users in server and configuring .xsession file to serve xfce4 desktop\n\n\nWith this, I can open several Windows Remote Desktop Connections, log in to the server and get some basic concurrent working with no problem, but using xfce desktop.\nHowever, this is not exactly what I need, because if the remote session is terminated by any reason, the work that has not been saved is lost.\nMy idea was having a remote session, where the state is kept in the server if the connection crashes. Like a real Ubuntu login (with GNOME, not xfce) directly to the server, but from Windows. We need to run long processes (lasting hours or days) and we can't lose the state just because the session was terminated.\nI read that someone tried something similar with VNC, but does not say if it keeps the session state. However, I am having a lot of problems to get VNC server running in my machine (don't know yet why, but it is another issue), so I can't try.\nSo my question is: What are the alternatives to classic Windows remote desktop that allow keeping the state? Is it VNC? Is it NX? Any software recommendation for intensive use in terms of performance and efficiency? Am I asking for too much? :-)\nThank you very much for your help!\n\nA: For what you are wanting to achieve I think you really need to use NoMachine Enterprise Server see link below. NOTE: I have nothing to do with them, however I researched this about 12 months ago for a client and that was the best option. Alternatively You could look at the Linux Terminal Server Project, or specifically these references here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP#Linux_Multi-User_Server_Configurations \nAlthough they seem to be for older versions of Ubuntu.\nNoMachine Enterprise Server provides multi-node support:\nhttps://www.nomachine.com/enterprise\n\nA: What you need is the Small Business Server or Workstation from NoMachine. With only 5 users which need access, one of these will probably suffice. All desktop sessions will be 'suspended' and leave the applications running in the backgroun.\n\nA: I'm running XFCE remote desktop via Microsoft mstsc. If I simply kill the window (use the \"x\" on the window-control area at the top center of the screen), the remote session continues to run, even though the RDP connection gets terminated. Later I can reconnect to the same session, rather than creating a new one..\n", "Q: r128 driver not loaded I have now successfully installed Lubuntu, only to find that something is very wrong with the graphics. glxinfo | grep -i vendor gave me this output:\nlibGL error: dlopen /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri/r128_dri.so failed (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri/r128_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)\nlibGL error: dlopen ${ORIGIN}/dri/r128_dri.so failed (${ORIGIN}/dri/r128_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)\nlibGL error: dlopen /usr/lib/dri/r128_dri.so failed (/usr/lib/dri/r128_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)\nlibGL error: unable to load driver: r128_dri.so\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: r128\nserver glx vendor string: SGI\nclient glx vendor string: Mesa Project and SGI\nOpenGL vendor string: VMware, Inc.\n\nThe graphics card is an ATI Rage 128, so it found that right driver, but isn't loading it.

While searching on well known and reliable pages, I suddenly had a new tab in firefox open with offending content.\nI closed the page, but it is still visible in the history of firefox.\nI want to know which site has opened this page. \nIs there a way to get this information?\n\nA: Yes, look in your history, what page were you on before it opened? It was probably that one, or one that had only recently loaded.\n\nA: If you can't find it in the History itself, it is time for some detective work. Open up a terminal window and cd to your profile folder, something like ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxx.default/. Open the places database:\nsqlite3 places.sqlite\nIf you don't have sqlite3, simply install it. Note: sqlite3 is NOT the same as sqlite.\n\nNow Firefox distinguishes web pages from visits to that page. First, we look up the id of the offending page.\nselect id, url from moz_places where url like \"offending url here\";\nIf you don't know the whole URL but a significant bit of it, put it like this:select id, url from moz_places where url like \"%part-that-you-do-know%\";\nThis will give you a number, let's say xxx. Let's find the most recent visit to that page:\nselect * from moz_historyvisits where place_id = xxx;\nThe first number on the resulting line is the number of your visit; the second number, call that yyy, is the visit to the referring page. So do:\nselect * from moz_historyvisits where from_visit = yyy;\nThis will give you a similar line. This contains the id of the page that led you to the offending page. The third number on that line is that id. Call it zzz. Now find the URL from that visit:\nselect url from moz_places where id = zzz;\nAnd that gives you your URL.\n", "Q: Installing Gnome 3, should I use gdm or lightdm?

You don't need both installed as gdm is a recommends dependency of gnome-shell, not a hard dependency. You can uninstall one or the other depending upon how you like them.

I have installed VirtualBox and I would like to have a Windows session from within my Kubuntu session. I have my hard drive partitioned so as to contain both OS. However, VirtualBox seems to only suport OS installed from scratch. Whenever I launch a Virtual Session, it prompts me to insert installation mediums. I have looked into the docs and it similarly details how to launch a VM and then prompts you to install an OS.\nSo my question is, if I already have an OS installed on a different partition on the same hard drive, how can I go about associating that partition with a virtual session? Is it as simple as copying the entire OS (which I seem to have access to from within Kubuntu session) into the Virtual Box directory containing the \"Windows Session\" I have created within Virtual Box?\n\nA: Virtualbox.org has a very long answer to this question - it is not always easy, because your existing installation in dependant upon hardware which will not be present in the virtual machine.  The hardware is not missing, but the concept of a virtual machine means that the hardware will be replace with emulations of hardware, probably different than what you machine physically contains.\nThe answer to how to do this is far to long to type here.

Just make a backup of your files and use whole disk to install current version of Ubuntu - 14.04.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Installation Intel I would like to install Ubuntu 14.04 but i saw on the file i downloaded that is for AMD 64 bit processors. My Pc-Desktop has an Intel Core i7 64bit proseccor and i was wondering if is it ok for my PC this Ubuntu amd file of installation.\n\nA: Intel 64bit CPUs use the AMD64 instruction set, which Intel calls EM64T.\nYou do want the AMD64 build of Ubuntu, so you've chosen correctly. \n\nA: the amd64 works just as well for intel processors, it's named amd because amd developed the 86-64 (64-bit) architecture. So go ahead and install it. It will work just fine. \nIntel developed the original x86-32(32-bit) architecture, amd developed the 64-bit version so they could never lock each other out.\n", "Q: How can I prune my BTRFS backups? I have a BTRFS backup system where I take daily snapshots (btrfs subvolume snapshot) and serialize them into incremental change files based off the previous days backup (btrfs send -f backup.date volume -p backup.date-1).\nUnfortunately this means I have to keep every serialized volume forever, because I need every serialized snapshot in the chain.\nI've tried deserializing (btrfs receive) these incremental snapshots and deleting intermediate volumes, but the subsequent volumes are assigned new IDs. Incremental volumes refer to their parent volumes by ID, so this breaks the chain.\nThus I have backup.Jun01.daily and backup.Jun01.monthly where the latter is pruned and has a different ID. These two files effectively contain all the same data.\nIs there any way to change the ID on backup.Jun01.monthly so that backup.Jun02.daily can refer to it, whereas it did refer to backup.Jun01.daily?\n\nA: I've taken a somewhat different and perhaps incompatible approach to yours. Rather than save the btrfs send stream with -f, I always btrfs receive to reproduce the snapshot on the backup media (also a btrfs filesystem).\nAdditionally, all snapshots are indistinguishable from each other - there is no difference between monthlies, daylies, hourlies etc. - they are simply named according to an isodate of the form YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS+hhmm. Pruning snapshots on the original host and pruning snapshots on the backup media separately hasn't so far caused me issues with incrementals but it's still early days.\nWhat started out as a github gist has turned into something bigger, so I've named it snazzer - see https://github.com/csirac2/snazzer\nI wrote what I hoped was a generically useful pruning script, or rather, a script which emits the paths of snapshots which should be candidates for pruning. See https://github.com/csirac2/snazzer/blob/master/doc/snazzer-prune-candidates.md - see the synopsis with this example:\nfind /some/.snapshotz -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | \\\n    snazzer-prune-candidates | xargs btrfs subvolume delete\n\nSadly this won't work for you, because it relies on the snapshot names having iso dates. If you get a chance to have a look at snazzer, snazzer-receive or any other bits, please do give me feedback - I'm not quite ready to release to the world (I only just added the ability today to receive snapshots from a local filesystem rather than ssh), but any feedback at all would be most welcome.\nP.S. If you're initially repulsed at the fact I've chosen POSIX shell and perl for this first version, it's because I'm on a zero-dependencies rampage - I'll be adding python implementations in coming months :D\n\nA: a very simple solution would be\n\ncd /whever/.shapshots\nbtrfs subvolume delete *\n\nSince the snapshots are stored in the .snapshots folder, the command would list them (hence the * parameter) and then remove all the snapshots.\n", "Q: Permissions error trying to create local web dev environment in home folder Hi I've been trying to create a local web dev environment in my home folder.

(I have seen by brother doing that, i have asked him how to do it but reply was find it out yourself.)  \nSo please anyone can give me step wise instruction how to use simple flash drive to install ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: If I were you I'd use a small program called Unetbootin, it allows you to install any OS from a pendrive. Go here (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) and download the Linux version or instead you can use the terminal to install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gezakovacs/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\nNext, you need to plug your pendrive and download Ubuntu from the Ubuntu website then save the file on a folder or on the desktok. \nThen you run Unetbootin (it might ask you to run it as sudo, just enter your password), select the second option and browse to your ISO file and press OK. If your pen drive has enough space this should work, I use an 8GB pen drive.\nFinally you restart your computer and go to the BIOS and select external media boot as the first one and install Ubuntu. \n\nA: As agha rehan abbas suggested you, first of all you have to download the Ubuntu installation image file (the .iso file). \nInsert your USB flash drive in such a way that it auto-mount it. Open the Startup Disk Creator utility. You will probably find it in the menu: System --> Administration --> Startup Disk Creator. Within this utility, select the .iso file you downloaded (you can look for it by clicking the button \"Other\") and your USB flash drive partition. Click first at the \"Erase Disk\" button and then at the \"Make Startup Disk\" button. \nNow you have to access the BIOS setup of your computer and configure it to boot from USB flash drive.

Am I just stupid and blind to the fix for this or is my aggravation justified? Please help.\nEdit: I should point out I don't want the screen to never sleep. If I walk way from the computer I want it to, to save battery. Because if I walk away from my computer it won't be while in a Skype call or with a video playing. It's obvious tasks like those I want it to not sleep, and let it do so when not doing them.

It has nothing to do with the current filesystem on thumbdrive as WinUSB formats it. \nTo fix it you must edit the winusb script which is located in /usr/bin. Open it with any text editor with root permissions (e.g. gksu gedit /usr/bin/winusb). Now search for grub-install in that file (it may be on line 401 - 402) and change that line so it looks like this:\ngrub-install --target=i386-pc --boot-directory=\"$partitionMountPath/boot\" \"$device\"\n\nSave the script.

To do this, reboot your comptuer and hold the shift key down.  The grub menu will appear, and you can press 'e' to edit the boot entry for Ubuntu.\nScroll down until you find the line that has \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.dpm=1\"\nand remove the radeon.dpm=1\nPress F10 to continue the boot process.  This has temporarily changed your grub, and when you reboot it will go back to what you just edited out.  So, you need to reverse the permanent changes you made:  Edit the grub command file:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nremove the radeon.dpm=1, save the file, and execute sudo update-grub\n\nNow that your computer is running you should tackle the heat issue.

Your reference to a Mythbuntu-related bug in the question notwithstanding the server tag does make it necessary to double-check if you are using a flavor eligible for 12.04.5.\n", "Q: Cannot run the Unity 8 openclipart scope example Following the instructions of this page, I have installed the Ubuntu SDK and downloaded the tutorials source code.\nThe openclipart scope builds correctly, but I have a runtime error:\n$ unity-scope-tool src/openclipart-scope.ini \nscoperegistry: no remote registry configured, only local scopes will be available\nRegistryObject::ScopeProcess::exec(): Process for scope: \"openclipart-scope\" started\nfile:///usr/share/unity8/Dash/DashContent.qml:100: TypeError: Cannot read property 'loaded' of null\nfile:///usr/share/unity8/ScopeTool.qml:77:31: Unable to assign [undefined] to scopes_ng::Scope*\nfile:///usr/share/unity8/ScopeTool.qml:149:23: Unable to assign null to QString\n\n(unity-scope-tool:6243): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_unref: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed\nfile:///usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/qml/Ubuntu/Components/Themes/Ambiance/TabBarStyle.qml:303: TypeError: Property 'select' of object QQuickRepeater(0x2711350) is not a function\nfile:///usr/share/unity8/Dash/DashContent.qml:100: TypeError: Cannot read property 'loaded' of null\nNeed to use QMirServerApplication\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Since Unity 8 (and unity-scope-tool by extension) are designed so they can run under both Mir and X11, there is some ambiguity in the dependencies.  The error you got indicates that it is trying to use the Mir backend.\nYou should be able to fix the problem by installing the unity8-fake-env package, which provides some of the needed APIs to run the tool under X:\nsudo apt-get install unity8-fake-env\n\n", "Q: Specify password for sudo in script I am making a script that will update my system (and do some other things, but that doesn't matter). I want the script to run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade --yes automatically. I use --yes so I won't have to choose yes when it runs; it upgrades all packages automatically without me having to do anything. That said, I want to put my password in the script somehow so I won't have to type in my password when I run it either, probably with an argument or something. You know, something I can put at the end like sudo apt-get update --passwd MYPASSWORDHERE. I have tried that and it doesn't work, but that's an example of what I want. What argument (--passwd or --password or something) do I put at the end to do this?\n\nA: If your script runs as \"yourUser\", you could create a simple file:\n  sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/myOverrides \n\nwith this directive:\n  yourUser ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/apt-get\n\nYou can find an useful explanation here.\n\nA: Sudo doesn't behave that way, for security reasons. You can echo the password to sudo using the -s option, but I don't suggest it. Even if you protect your script from other users, they can still see your parameters using e.g. ps -ef.\nI think your problem is better solved by installing the unattended-upgrades package.\n", "Q: Tracker recursive indexing fails I would like tracker to index my complete home directory and all sub-directories / files.\nI set my home directory as the only directory in the tracker \"places\" (for indexing) in the tracker configuration and turned on recursive indexing but unfortunately it seems to have no effect.\nWhen I start Activities (Ubuntu Gnome 14.04) via the super key I just can reach all files/direcotories that are directly in my home directory, all sub-directories or files are not indexed and not reachable by the Activities view :(.\nHow can I fix that? Any ideas?\n\nA: This is a known bug with gnome-shell, but has been fixed in 15.04. You can use tracker-search or tracker-needle instead in the mean time.\n", "Q: Viruses in Ubuntu 14.04? My Ubuntu 14.04 system has been hit by a virus, I am 100% sure this is a virus, let me tell you what happened.\nSo, I was playing Minecraft in my desktop with some friends on Skype, then my Skype logs out due to a Disk I/O error. So, I reboot my PC, and it boots up. So, since I run a gaming server, I decide to modify the files, but first I start Skype, and my best friend is messaging me and is mad at me for reasons I don't know, so I go onto the server he is usually on and try to confront him, and he just leaves the game! I was mad at him back and then wanted to download this file, unfortunutely it didn't let me because I had no space left. So, I go into the system disks, and what do you know! I have 40GB space left! I thought it was just a bug, so, I open GParted, and try to resize this other partition to make it smaller and see if it fixes the problem, but I couldn't change the numbers as it kept resetting to what it had before, so I try moving the box where you usually resize it, and it doesn't even budge! I then modify the files to prepare to delete this big directory I have backed up, and do it, but when I restart the computer to delete the directory, the computer boots up to a black screen! How can I fix this?\n\nA: Your disk is probably failing. You probably don't have a virus.\nYou can check your drive SMART data using smartctl -H /dev/sda, but if Ubuntu told you there's a disk error you should believe it.\nStart copying your data to another drive. Stop using the drive for any other purpose in case you're destroying your documents.\n", "Q: Virtualbox Bridged network ethernet cable disconnecting I’m trying to connect to a ethernet device (like a scanner/printer) to a guest Ubuntu 12.04 running on Virtualbox 4.3.12.

along these lines (this is the part where the system actually performs the suspend):\nFri Jul 11 07:17:01 PHT 2014: performing suspend\nsh: echo: I/O error\nFri Jul 11 07:17:03 PHT 2014: Awake.\nFri

part here is the sh: echo: I/O error that shows up every time the system does a suspend, as you can see, the system immediately awakens after the error.\nI've tried a lot of workarounds that include the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling Virtualbox's vboxdrv modules as I have read that they sometimes interfere with a host machine's ability to suspend\n\n*Disabling all devices that could wake the system in /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\n*Replacing the errors=remount ro option for / in /etc/fstab to errors=continue\nDespite all of those the problem still persists. Could it be an issue with the kernel? Back when I was still using Opensuse 12.3 I was stuck in kernel 3.7, and now here in Ubuntu 14.04 I'm using kernel 3.13. Though I kind of doubt that the kernel might be the issue since 3.13 came out of the box and suspend still worked at that time.\nUPDATE:\nI've found that the cause for the echo that causes the I/O fail is in line 321 of /usr/lib/pm-utils/pm-functions. I got this by turning on verbose logging and debugging for pm-suspend, and disabling all hooks (by moving them temporarily to another directory).\nThis is the line in question:\n do_suspend() { echo -n \"mem\" >/sys/power/state; }\n\nAs I understand it, this echo is crucial because it's the interface between pm-suspend and the low-level functions in the kernel that handle suspends. The issue now is why would an I/O error occur at that moment. I'll try to manually perform the command on a terminal and see if an I/O error still occurs.\n\nA: Okay, I managed to finally find the culprit for this issue, but first, a little background: I neglected to mention that my laptop has a hybrid HDD by default. It's a regular 500GB mechanical HDD supplemented by a 24GB SSD, which used to be used by Windows 8 for hibernation and probably cache stuff. I used the SSD to stash my root partition before in OpenSUSE until it eventually died (I/O errors all the way down), prompting me to move the partition to the HDD whilst also installing Ubuntu 14.04.\nLong story short: The I/O errors I'm getting at standby were somehow caused by my faulty SSD.\nWhat I did to fix this was to remove the block device of the SSD from /dev. In my case, my SSD is always shown as /dev/sdb, so I entered the following in a terminal as root (solution courtesy of this helpful article):\n# echo 1 > /sys/block/sdb/device/delete\nBe sure to replace 'sdb' with the device you think is faulty. I only have it as /dev/sdb because as I've mentioned before, my SSD always gets that first.\nThe \"deletion\" gets reset on every fresh boot, so what I did was add that line to my /etc/rc.local, which ensures that /dev/sdb will get deleted at boot. This might affect booting with removable drives inserted on your machine, but in my case the SSD is physically part of the HDD anyway so it automatically gets the /dev/sdb block device after the HDD gets /dev/sda.\n\nA: Same problem here:\n  sh: echo: I/O error in /var/log/pm-suspend.log in 14.04 (or rather Mint 17).\nDifferent answer. I played with 'su pm-hibernate' instead, it also fails with nice in-your-face warnings like \"Freezing of tasks failed after...\". Then doing \"dmesg | less\" and searching with \"/Freezing\" reveal a stack trace involving \"fuse\". The reason: a open network mount in Files/Nautilus/Nemo. The fix: unmount in the GUI. Then, use /etc/fstab entry instead to mount network drive. That's far more robust.\n\n[122274.535148] Freezing user space processes ... \n[122294.540137] Freezing of tasks failed after 20.009 seconds (1 tasks refusing to freeze, wq_busy=0):\n[122294.540167] bash            D ffff88022ec74480     0  6868   6825 0x00000004\n[122294.540178]  ffff88021e6ddb50 0000000000000082 ffff8800c8a9e000 ffff88021e6ddfd8\n[122294.540180]  0000000000014480 0000000000014480 ffff8800c8a9e000 ffff88021f7c8660\n[122294.540181]  ffff880034813800 ffff88021e6ddb78 ffff88021f7c8740 ffff88021f7c8660\n[122294.540183] Call Trace:\n[122294.540188]  [<ffffffff81723129>] schedule+0x29/0x70\n[122294.540192]  [<ffffffff812aaa95>] __fuse_request_send+0x115/0x280\n[122294.540195]  [<ffffffff810aafd0>] ? prepare_to_wait_event+0x100/0x100\n[122294.540197]  [<ffffffff812aac12>] fuse_request_send+0x12/0x20\n\n\nA: The most likely cause of this issue (for people reading this) is leaving a USB stick or SD card connected in the laptop (not necessarily mounted).  Unmount if it's mounted (the I/O error means that is unlikely).  Once you're happy it's not mounted, remove it and try pm-suspend again.\nA big thank-you to @rey-balgs for sharing his research (and saving me a lot of grief).\n\nA: I had similar issue and it was about: swapoff\nTry to run:\nsudo swapon -a\n\n", "Q: Will files created in windows open in Ubuntu? I'm currently considering switching totally to Ubuntu. The only thing holding me back is whether or not my photos, music, word processor, and other document files will open in Ubuntu. For example, I have done important files I created in open office on my windows computer. Will they open on open office in Ubuntu? Will my images and photos be displayed the same as they did in windows?\nI apologize if this question has been answered previously. I searched, but was unable to located any discussion that addressed my specific question. I am a complete novice when it comes to Linux, but I look to learning more.\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, the standard file formats are supported in Ubuntu. By standard I mean: images like JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, audio files like WAV, MP3, AAC, FLAC. The compressed archives like ZIP, RAR, 7ZIP are supported as well.\nAll RAW image formats can be opened in GIMP with dcraw or UFraw plugin, or more workflow-oriented program like Raw Therapee. All those programs are available for free in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nObstacles may arise when you need to open and edit some proprietary file formats like Microsoft Office files or Adobe Photoshop formats. The Microsoft Office files are opened by LibreOffice, mostly successfully, but your mileage may vary depending on the version and complexity of specific file. If you need to open Adobe Photoshop files then you should keep your Windows installation handy.\nAnd remember, that you don't have to switch totally to Ubuntu, abandoning Windows. I recommend to have dual-boot setup: Windows and Ubuntu on the same PC.\n\nA: Most filetypes can be opened in Ubuntu. Newest versions of Ubuntu use LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice, but they do read odt and doc formats. Music will work perfectly fine,too. Image files, such as jpeg, bitmap, and png all open, too. If you use Photoshop, then it's a program-specific file format. There is an editor similar to Photoshop called GIMP, but I have used GIMP exclusivelly and never used Photoshop, so don't quote me on that part. There's PDF viewers - that works well enough for opening my college documents.\nActually, you can run many Windows applications with WINE, which is sort of virtualization software. People run all sorts of things there.\nNow, I am electrical engineering major, and I use a software called Multisim, which HAS to run in Windows, so keep that in mind - some software just has been build to run only in Windows. But unless you aren't doing anything exceptional and plan to do all the things 99% windows desktop users do - surf web, save music and pictures - you'll feel at home in Ubuntu.\nI've been using Ubuntu for couple of month and am happy enough with it. Of course, it is intimidating to switch at first, but once I got it up and running - I spend most of my time in Ubuntu now, and come back to Windows only on rare occasion when I need to delete some files or use Multisim. Oh, and did I mention that I have both installed on my hard drive ?

Periodically my system downloads minor kernel updates, but does not rebuild the ZFS module.  On the next reboot, none of the ZFS filesystems can be mounted.

I didn't have that file, nor any of /usr/src/zfs-0.6.2.\nAha!  I installed zfs to import an existing zpool and mount filesystems from a FreeBSD system, including a /usr/src.  So when I built this system I \"lost\" (covered up) everything that went into /usr/src as part of the initial configuration.  After that, any kernel upgrades will leave you with an updated grub that points at a kernel with no matching zfs.ko.  Shouldn't that be an error?

If I create an empty file with that name then the error goes away although I'm not sure why this is.\nI've looked in the manual as the comments suggest and it looks like the lines in the conf file are specifying either merges or redirects, thought I can't tell which one. I can't seem to understand what these Remap-* statements are for and if I need them or not? Also why were the other backend_* files automatically created but not the gentoo one?\n\nA: Those are examples. Use only the ones you need to. I only use the Debian and Ubuntu configuration lines. From the manual, the syntax for the Remap directive:\nRemap-RepositoryName: MergingURLs ; TargetURLs ; OptionalFlags\n\nThe MergingURLs are set of mirrors which are considered equivalent. I think this lets you mix and match mirror URLs in the client sources.list, but downloads usually will only take place from the URLs specified in TargetURLs.  The lists of mirrors are provided with the package, and should be in the /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng directory.\nThe backends_* files are provided with package as well, presumably because this package is for Debian and Ubuntu, and people using it are likely going to use it for Debian and Ubuntu. The point of creating empty backend files eludes me, as does the reason behind the lack of complaints about the other files.\n", "Q: Differences between restricted repositories and partner repositories?

Thanks.\n\nA: The Ubuntu Help site has the answer:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*\"Important Security Updates (raring-security)\". Patches for security vulnerabilities in Ubuntu packages. They are managed by the Ubuntu Security Team and are designed to change the behavior of the package as little as possible -- in fact, the minimum required to resolve the security problem. As a result, they tend to be very low-risk to apply and all users are urged to apply security updates.\n  \n*\"Recommended Updates (raring-updates)\". Updates for serious bugs in Ubuntu packaging that do not affect the security of the system. \n  \n*\"Pre-released Updates (raring-proposed)\". The testing area for updates. This repository is recommended only to those interested in helping to test updates and provide feedback. \n  \n*\"Unsupported Updates (raring-backports)\". As the name states, these are unsupported new versions of packages which have been backported to an older release. Packages may contain new features, may introduce new interfaces, and bugs.\n  \n\nFor example, the phpldapadmin package that was released for trusty has a serious packaging bug, where it expected a directory structure use in Apache 2.2, whereas trusty had Apache 2.4. It couldn't even be installed. The fix was released in trusty-updates.\nFor most users, enabling all four shouldn't be a problem most of the time. For a very stable environment, keep only security enabled. Keep updates enabled if some package you're using has a packaging issue. Updates packages have to conform to policies regarding stable updates, so they shouldn't cause breakage and keeping them enabled all the time is recommended. Keep proposed enabled if you don't mind testing out new things. This might cause things to break on occasion, so if you're not a fan of the \" latest and greatest\" philosophy, keep it disabled unless you have a problem and devs ask you to enable it. Keep backports enabled if you wish to have software that is typically only available for a newer release of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Java iced tea isnt working with runescape, ubuntu 14.04 java -version\njava version \"1.7.0_55\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.4.7) (7u55-2.4.7-1ubuntu1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)\n\nThis is a copy and paste from my terminal of my openjdk....I install the runescape game and when it loads it goes to automatically choose graphic settings (only button to push) I push it and the game goes black and then crashes...any one know how to fix it?

But I need to unboot my pen-drive now. I formatted my pen-drive once,But the size of the pen-drive still shows 2.25 MB. Whereas,this is an 8GB pen-drive. How can I get rid of this problem. I'm still using Windows 7.\n\nA: If you want to know how to reformat your 8GB flash drive from Windows 7, then ask how to do it on Superuser Q&A, not here. The following commands are run from the terminal in Ubuntu. The results of these steps are reproducible. I reformatted 2 USB flash drives with the following steps after writing Ubuntu ISOs to them with dd\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all of your USB devices except for the 8GB USB flash drive that you want to reformat, so you won't get confused about the device name of the USB flash drive later on.\n\n*List all the partitions.\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nSearch the results of the command for output that looks like this:\nDisk /dev/sdc: 7864 MB, 7864320000 bytes\n30 heads, 33 sectors/track, 15515 cylinders, total 15360000 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00016288\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdc1   *        2048    15359999     7678976    b  W95 FAT32\n\nIf you see something like 7864 MB (8GB) in the output (see the example output above), then that is your 8GB USB flash drive. In this example it is called /dev/sdc. Now open the Disks application from the Dash and check again to make sure that the device name of your 8GB flash drive is the same as what you got from running the command: sudo fdisk -l. \n\n*Create a partition table on the disk of type msdos, sometimes known as MBR or Master Boot Record. \nsudo parted /dev/sdc mklabel msdos\n\nIn this example I used /dev/sdc for the name of the device which is what was found in the results of step 2. I can't stress strongly enough how important it is to verify the device name before running this step! \nWarning: If you type the wrong device name you may overwrite your operating system or another one of your partitions containing important personal files!!! So be careful and check the device name a second time. Open the Disks application and check the device name of your 8GB USB flash drive in Disks. It should be the same device name!!! Now check again! You don't want to accidentally type the wrong device name!\n\n*Add an empty \"primary\" partition, which will hold a FAT filesystem later.\nsudo parted -a none /dev/sdc mkpart primary fat32 0 8192 \n\nOnce again in this example I used /dev/sdc for the name of the device which is what was found in the results of step 2. The command specifies the start point (from 0 MB) to the end point (8192 MB). If the 8GB USB flash drive does not have the full 8192 MB space, parted will adjust it automatically. If the terminal returns a message that the start point can't start at 0 MB and you have to use some other small number close to 0 MB, type Y to accept this. Note the command is creating a single, primary partition on the whole disk.  \nThis newly created partition will have the ID /dev/sdc1. That is because the device name in this example is /dev/sdc and the 1 at the end is because it is the first partition on that device.\n\n*Create a FAT filesystem on the /dev/sdc1 partition by formatting the partition.\nmkfs.vfat -n \"8GB-USB\" /dev/sdc1\n\n/dev/sdc1 is the partition ID from step 4. \"8GB-USB\" is the partition label, which can be your own choice of label, just enclose the label inside two double quote characters.  \nYou now have a ready-to-use reformatted USB flash drive with an 8GB FAT partition. \n", "Q: How to move an Ubuntu VM from Windows host to Ubuntu host?

LAMP stack (it's used for web development), otherwise pretty vanilla.\nApplications occasionally freezes when accessing the home folder.\nI think I saw advice suggesting a reboot when this happens, but I can't find that page again.\nTake with a grain of salt, I don't think it is related to any GUI because it also happens in the terminal.  In the case of being in terminal, if I \"ls\" in ~/, it stops responding.  It's not happening now, so I can't remember if Ctrl-C restores control.\nIt's intermittent: usually I have no trouble, but once the home folder becomes unavailable, it doesn't come back.  What I mean by that, even when opening Nautilus, another terminal window, etc., I won't be able to see the files in the home folder until I reboot.\nI realized yesterday that this problem also causes trouble with apps. I installed EasyTag and it always locked up.  I figured out that EasyTag locked up because it was trying to read my home folder, and I fixed it by changing the default directory.\nIs this a well-known problem (it's an old version) with a well-known solution?

Also a failing disk can produce the same effect. To verify neither of those reasons affect you, you must from a Live Environment run fsck on the affected partitions (ie. sudo fsck /dev/sda1) and check the SMART values with a SMART tool (ie. sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda).\nIs important that you create a backup of all your important data somewhere safe, preferable that can be unplugged of the system.\n", "Q: How to dual boot my laptop with Windows 8.1 with Ubuntu?

But you might not want to do that for other commands you run later, so you can run it and your gzip  command in a subshell instead.\nThis command gzips all .css and .html files in the current directory any of its subdirectories, any of their subdirectories, etc., keeping the original files (-k) and telling you what it's doing (-v):\n(shopt -s globstar; gzip -vk **/*.{css,html})\n\nIf you want to match filenames case-insensitively so those extensions with some or all letters capitalized are included, then you can also enable the nocaseglob shell option:\n(shopt -s globstar nocaseglob; gzip -vk **/*.{css,html})\n\n; separates the two commands, and the outer ( ) cause them to be run in a subshell. Setting a shell option in a subshell does not cause it to be set in the calling shell. If you do want to enable globstar then you can run shopt -s globstar; then you can just run the command:\ngzip -vk **/*.{css,html}\n\nYou can disable globstar with shopt -u globstar. You can check if it's currently enabled with shopt globstar.\nHow It Works\nThe key to how this gzip command works is that the shell performs expansions on it to produce a list of each file in the directory hierarchy with a matching name, then passes each of these filenames as arguments to gzip.\n\n\n*\n\n*Brace expansion turns **/*.{css,html} into **/*.css **/*.html.\n\n*Then globbing expands those two patterns into the names of files accessible under the current directory (**, due to globstar) whose filenames consist of anything (*) followed by the specified suffix (.css or .html in this case).\n\n\nThis does not match files whose names start with . or those that reside in directories named this way. You probably don't have any such HTML and CSS files and, if you do, you probably don't want to include them. But if you do want to include them, then you can match them explicitly depending on your needs. For example, changing **/*.{css,html} to **/{,.}*.{css,html} includes files that start with . while still not searching in folders that do.\nIf you want both files whose names start with . and files in directories whose names start with . to be included, there's a cleaner and simpler way: enable the dotglob shell option.\n(shopt -s globstar dotglob; gzip -vk **/*.{css,html})\n\nOr if you want case-insensitive matching and matching of filenames that start with .:\n(shopt -s globstar nocaseglob dotglob; gzip -vk **/*.{css,html})\n\nIt's possible, though very rare, for ** to expand to something too long.\nIf you have a huge number of files named this way, then this may fail with an error message explaining that the shell cannot build the command line because it would be too long. (Even with thousands of files, this usually is not a problem.)\ngzip won't be called at all, so you won't get a half-done job.\nIf this error happens, or if you're worried about it, you can use find with -exec, either as steeldriver describes (with {} \\;) or as I describe below (with {} +).\nYou can use find with the -exec action and + for efficiency.\nThe gzip command supports being given names of multiple files to be compressed. But this find command, although it works well and won't be slow unless you have many files, runs the gzip command once for each  file:\nfind . \\( -name \\*.css -o -name \\*.html \\) -exec gzip -vk {} \\;\n\nThis works, and you can definitely use it. (. searches from the current directory. Besides that, it's really a slightly different way of writing the command in steeldriver's very good answer; you can use whichever style you prefer.)\nYou can also make find pass multiple filenames to gzip and run it only as many times as necessary--which is nearly always just once. To do that, use + instead of \\;. The + argument should come just after {}. find replaces + with additional filenames, if any.\nfind . \\( -name \\*.css -o -name \\*.html \\) -exec gzip -vk {} +\n\nIt's fine to use + even if there are only a few matching files, and when there are many of them, it can be noticeably faster than having a separate gzip invocation for each file.\nAs steeldriver mentions, you can use -iname instead of -name to match files whose name end like .css or .html but with different capitalization. This corresponds to enabling nocaseglob in the globstar-based method described above.\nFinally, you probably don't have any matching files or directories that start with .. But if you do, find automatically includes them. If you want to exclude them (as happens with the globstar-based method detailed above when dotglob is off), you can:\nfind . -not -path '*/.*' \\( -name \\*.css -o -name \\*.html \\) -exec gzip -vk {} +\n\nThe globstar-based way described above is simpler to write, especially if you're excluding directories and files that begin with ., since that's the default.\nWhat not to do...\nFilenames can contain any character except the path separator / and the null character. Many techniques that break on weird filenames exist, and they are usually more complicated than techniques that always just work. So I suggest avoiding them even when you know (or think you know) they're okay in your specific situation. And of course you must not use them if you might have filenames with characters that may be treated specially, including spaces.\nIt is possible to safely pipe the output of find to another command that processes it if you use -print0 or a similar action to cause it to place a null character between paths instead of a newline, and not otherwise. Filenames can contain newlines (though I discourage you from deliberately naming files with them). A find command with the -print action--including find commands with no explicit action, since then -print is the default--does not produce output that can safely be piped or otherwise provided to another command that performs an action on the files.\nThe output find produces with the -print0 action may safely be piped to xargs -0 (the -0 flag tells xargs to expect null-separated input).\n\nA: I used steeldriver's answer, but I like to complete it with the --best and --force options.\ncd into any folder and type this code. All your matching files will be gzipped.\nfind . \\( -name '*.css' -o -name '*.js' \\) -exec gzip --verbose --keep --best --force {} \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use --best for best compression ratio.\n\n*Use --force for overwriting without asking if there is already a gzipped file.\n\n\nA: I would use\nfind /path/to/dir \\( -name '*.css' -o -name '*.html' \\) -exec gzip --verbose --keep {} \\;\n\nChange name to iname if you want to match the extensions case-insensitively (i.e. include .CSS and/or .HTML extensions). You can omit the /path/to/dir if you want to start the recursive search from the current directory. \n\nA: To zip all files in a folder/subfolder recursively:\ngzip -r `find . -type f -name \"*.html\"` \n\nTo unzip:\ngunzip -r `find . -type f -name \"*.gz\"` \n\n", "Q: Not understanding /var/www permissions I know similar questions have been asked, but I couldn't find a solution because I'm not looking for a command to give new rights to the directory, I would like to understand it. \nI'm very new to Ubuntu, have installed the server and Apache2 (not LAMP, or at least not aware of it). \nI access the server by SFTP.

Administrator-you gets to decide who has access to what. If administrator-you decides that user-you must have access to /var/www, then changing the permissions and/or ownership of that folder is the correct thing to do. In some cases (if the directory in question is group-writable) adding user-you to the relevant group will be sufficient, the point is that administrator-you needs to take whatever action is necessary and sufficient.

You will be able to select which OS to boot into when starting your computer.\n\n*You can also use Wubi to install Ubuntu sort-of like a Windows application. This will have some performance drawback, but it's easy and safe. You can also remove it easily. Recommended if you only want to use Ubuntu occasionally and don't want a full install.\n\n*You can just use the installer as a Live USB stick, making no changes to your hard drive whatsoever. Recommended for just testing and very rare usage.\n\n*And of course, you can always buy a new hard drive for your Ubuntu install.\n", "Q: FATAL: role \"roelof\" does not exist I did install postgresql according to the manual.\nBut as soon as I do rails server I see the above error. \nRoelof\nEdit 1: the sudo -u postgres createuser roelof did the trick but now when I do rake db:create I see this errror message:\nPG::InsufficientPrivilege: ERROR:  permission denied to create database\n\nA: You can create a role with your name by running a createuser command as the postgres system user.

Try installing my rEFInd instead; it's based on rEFIt, but is under active development. Install it in OS X, and either use the --alldrivers option to install.sh or manually install the EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem you use for Ubuntu (ext4fs by default). (Manually installing a filesystem driver involves copying one file; see the drivers documentation for details.) If all goes well, you should be able to boot Ubuntu from rEFInd, although you may end up with extra boot options you'll want to delete from the menu.\nWindows is another matter. I'd be shocked if it can boot as it is now. To get it booting, you'll need to either replace your hybrid MBR with a conventional protective MBR and do an EFI-mode installation of Windows, or edit your hybrid MBR so that it includes your Windows partition (#5). The first is a cleaner solution, but isn't guaranteed to work. The second solution is more conventional (on a Mac), but it perpetuates the use of a hybrid MBR, which is an ugly and dangerous hack.\n", "Q: How to install Starry Night on Ubuntu I wish to install STARRY NIGHT on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

In order for xrdp to work, you need to have X (meaning a desktop environment). If you are managing a server, I would not recommend using RDP at all. Instead, use SSH. It is so easy to set up and use that JUST before I wrote this answer, I set up SSH to let me use my Windows 8.1 laptop to connect to my server. It was easy to set up. For information on setting up SSH on the server, go to https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/openssh-server.html. Do NOT install the client packages. Then, on your Windows computer, download PuTTY. http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe lets you download the main component of PuTTY (the one that lets you send and recieve commands and has a GUI), but also make sure to download PSFTP at http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/psftp.exe. PSFTP is a (simple) tool for transferring files between your Windows computer and your server. I think you'll love it and it is very easy. Also, SSH is much more secure than RDP and much more secure than VNC, so you can be confident knowing your data is safe when managing your server over the internet.\n", "Q: Is is possible to have one computer rendering screen and providing CPU-RAM for 2 or 3 other computers that act as client, rendering the output?

Is is possible?\nWhat would I need (programs) and how to set up the network?\nLinux is multitask and multiuser, how could I make use of it so I have to buy only 1 very powerful computer?\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: If you are on a fast local network, you can simply forward X server with ssh.\nEstablish an ssh connection with X forwarding enabled like\nssh -X user@host\nThen simply run the application remotely like gimp, librewriter, gedit within the ssh session to have it shown over the remote computer.\n\nA: What you're looking for is a remote desktop session, there's a Citrix presentation server available for Ubuntu that would do this, or you could try to use the method this guy did in Ubuntu 10.\n\nA: The technology to do this is usually called \"thin client\" (or sometimes, in enterprise-speak, you might hear \"Virtual Desktop Infrastructure\", though that term actually means a lot more1). Basically, the client collects input and sends it to the server, then displays the output which the server returns.\nWith a good server, you can handle many such clients, possibly dozens on a powerful modern computer.\nThe platform I have used the most in the past is the Sun Ray, but it's a proprietary hardware solution, which is not what you want.  Just for reference, there are also other commercial offerings, like VMWare Horizon / VMWare View, Microsoft RDS, and Citrix XenApp / XenDesktop which work on thin and thick clients.\nThere are a number of open-source projects that enable you to set up a thin client; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so I'm going to list all the ones I know of and you will have to evaluate them based on your needs. (Note that if you are doing anything graphics-intensive, you will likely need to tune your settings and network for best performance.2)\nDIY\n\n\n*\n\n*This guy did it by connecting to an RDP server automatically on boot.\n\n*You could also do it with SSH and X Forwarding.  In this setup, you would boot to a regular desktop on the client, but all programs would be links that run the command through SSH with the -X flag instead of running the programs locally.\n\n\nPackages\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Terminal Services Project (LTSP) - This is one of the more well-known projects, though I have found the documentation to be lacking in some areas.  They do have a community, including an email list and IRC chat, if you have questions.\n\n*Open ThinClient - This one is a bit more \"enterprisey\" and may be a little more of a management headache for simple environments.  It also has a user email list.\n\n\n\n1. VDI also includes other \"Remote Desktop\" technologies, like RDP, VNC, and Citrix, running on \"thick clients\" - a.k.a. full computers.\n2. If you are doing anything graphics-heavy, you might be better off with a Thick client - running some programs on the computer itself and others on the server.  If you are using one of the DIY solutions I mentioned, this is pretty easy - just do some stuff on the remote server and some locally.  I don't know how to do it in any of the packages that I mentioned.\n", "Q: No sound from right speakers I have Creative Sound Blaster Live 24-bit sound card and 5.1 surround speakers.\nFront & rear left, center speakers are working but no sound from right speakers (both front and rear).

Right and left to select the bar, up and down to lower/raise the volume).\nHope it's your case too!\n\nA: I faced the same problem but found that it was due to the sound card.\nWhen I had Windows & my Yamaha card did not work at all I bought Creative SB 5.1 which worked when the software was downloaded and installed.\nWhen I switched over to Linux only the left speaker worked. I switched back to the Yamaha Sound card and everything was fine without any effort.

The Server is currently running Ubuntu 14.04, which was installed just 3 weeks ago.\nEverything was running fine until a few days ago, we've had a few issues. I suspect someone hacked into our SSH server and managed to seriously mess something up.\nWhen I try to execute the command sudo I get the following error:\nsudo: unable to stat /etc/sudoers: No such file or directory\nSo first thought is the file got deleted and just needs to be recreated, however ls /etc/ shows that the sudoers file already exists. Furthermore, when edited with nano (my preferred editor) It becomes apparent that the file is completely in tact and formatted correctly.\nls -l also shows that the sudoers file has the permissions -r--r---- for user root and group root, which from research should be completely sufficient for sudo to be able to read the file, to make sure temporarily I gave the file -rwxrwx--- for root root (were using tmux for session control and we already had a session up as root), still failed.\nSo the file exists, the content inside of it is correct, it has the proper permissions. What else could it be. I looked a bit at people who have had similar problems here on askubuntu.com, one solution I found that sounded hopeful, was to back up the sudoers file, then use:\n\napt-get purge sudo\napt-get install sudo\nAnd then replace the new sudo file with the old one. This did not work unfortunately. To rule out farther that the sudoers file didn't have errors, I tried the solution again, and tried executing just sudo with the newly created sudoers file, and got the same error.\n-------- EDIT --------\nFor anyone interested in what the supposed non-existant sudoers file contains, here is a filtered version (usernames filtered) by request: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7781967/\n\nA: Ok. I have fixed my issue. And like I thought, it was not the file.\n\nSolution\nI had up until 10 minutes ago, only noticed that sudo wasn't working. As most of my work takes place in tmux, I never noticed my user account.\nUpon first logging in I would get the following error:\n-bash: /etc/profile Permission denied\nAnd it would set me to: I have no name@<ipaddress> as my account.\nSo I did some research on this issue and found more results then the other issue. Including one result that was a perfect match for my situation, as found here.\nThe issue was that my /etc/ folder was missing the execute permission on the group. So executing: chmod g+x /etc fixed the issue after logging out and back in.\n\nThanks\nThanks for the help in the comments, the suggestions you gave were still valuable and helped narrow down the problem more.

I used Ubuntu via Live CD  on my lenovo laptop which had Windows 8.1 installed on it. Then I decided to install Ubuntu and while doing that I accidentally click next when it said wipe Windows and install Ubuntu, after which my whole HDD got formatted in some weird partition and all my data (250 GB) got lost. \nSo I tried putting my HDD in an external case and connecting it to another laptop to recover my data with software like (Get Data Back) but when I connected my laptop HDD to another computer and went to management page to initialize the disk it keeps showing data redundancy error, I've tried every single way to get my HDD showing on windows but its not working. Although it still shows in Ubuntu which means my HDD is in good state, so can someone please tell me how to get my Windows partition back so that I can recover my data ?\n\nA: If you overwrote your original Windows partitions with with Linux partitions and installed the whole operating system on it, it might not be possible to get back a lot of data. If you really require the old data, the first thing you need to do is stop using the hard-disk to boot Linux from it. \nConnecting the hard-disk to a second PC is a good idea. Tools like Get Data Back should be able to help you to recover data that is not yet overwritten with new data. For help with GDB you would need to contact their support.\nIf that does not work out, and the data is valuable enough to you, try a professional service like http://www.data-recovery-software.net/.\n\nA: I guess you have two separate problems:  the formatting and the HDD type.\nFirst, if you selected the option to format the HDD...the entire HDD, then you are stuck.  All of your data is gone and trying to get it to a drive type that is compatible with Windows won't get it back.\nSecond, Windows and Ubuntu uses a different drive type.  Windows uses NTFS and Ubuntu uses ext4 (among others).  You can use programs such as gparted to change from one drive type to another.  As you are already doing, you can use an external enclosure but try booting into Ubuntu instead of Windows.  There are other programs, too, but gparted should be on your Ubuntu boot disk and it is friendlier than the command-line programs.\nYou may also confirm if the HDD has been formatted.  Take a look at gparted screen shot.  In the top picture, it shows a 60 GB HDD on /dev/sda which has been partitioned into multiple parts that include ntfs, ext4, and linux-swap.  If you see that, then there is hope.  That might mean that the Windows partition is still intact and you just need Windows to see it.\nBased on what you're describing, it sounds like what you may end up seeing is one or multiple blocks that all say ext4, linux-swap, etc.  And nothing that is still ntfs.  If that's the case, then your data is probably gone -- your NTFS partition has been deleted and replaced with Linux-compatible partitions.

Usually, if you have the correct drivers and you restart, the hardware will start working.\nIf things still do not work, you may have the wrong drivers.\n", "Q: how to direct php version to php in LAMPP to set default? i'm just newbie in ubuntu\ni have install php before install lamp, when i type \"which php\" ==> /usr/bin/php\nnot to direct in directory php in LAMP\nbecause php in LAMPP have enable mcrypt...but php in default now doesn't active mcrypt..how  to set php in LAMPP to default ? i have tried to input \"alias php='/opt/lampp/php'\" in .bash_profile and .bashrc, but it's still not work,, but when i type \"php -v \" ==> bash: /opt/lampp/php: Is a directory\nhow can i fix it ?\nThx\n\nA: The problem is that you have two php executable: one located in /usr/bin and another in /opt/lampp/bin.\nWhen you type php in your terminal, bash search it in $PATH directory list, and it found php in /usr/bin, so /usr/bin/php is executed.\nIf you want to exec /opt/lampp/bin/php, open you .bashrc and at the end add this line:\n      PATH=/opt/lampp/bin:$PATH\n\nOnce saved .bashrc, exec:\n      source .bashrc\n\nor close/open your terminal and try re-do your php command.\n", "Q: MSI Radeon R9 270 Graphics drivers How am i supposed to download these drivers and utilities?

Is there an alternative to iTunes where I can buy music/back up phone? \n\nA: iTunes is a closed-source program like Skype. So, there is no source code to compile from for Linux or any *nix based system. Also, Apple does not provide any binaries for Ubuntu, or even for any *nix based system. You have 4 options:\nOption 1: Use a Windows emulator\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), and run apt-get install wine.\n\n*Get iTunes for Windows at apple.com\n\n*Go to the terminal again (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run wine ./NAME_OF_EXECUTABLE.exe and replace NAME_OF_EXECUTABLE.exe with the name of executable.\n\n*Install as needed and when needed, run wine ./NAME_OF_APPLICATION.exe.\nDisclaimer: Sometimes, wine will not work and use it at your own risk. You also may have issues and bugs with the installed application (iTunes)\nOption 2: libimobiledevice\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Ubuntu Software Center, and check that libimobiledevice4 is installed and latest version.\n\n*Plug in device, and let the device mount automatically.\n\n*Open Nautilus, and find your device in the left column.\n\n*Select all the files, and copy to a directory in your home directory. Here's a script to do that:\n\n #!/bin/bash\n[ -d ~/PhoneBackup ] || mkdir ~/PhoneBackup\n    PATHOFPHONE=df -h|tail -n 1|awk '{print $6}'\n    read -p \"Is $PATHOFPHONE the location of files (yes/no)?\" yesorno\n    if [[ $yesorno == \"yes\" ]]; then\n    echo Copying\nif diff $PATHOFPHONE $HOME/PhoneBackup|grep -iv common 2> /dev/null \nthen difference=diff $PATHOFPHONE $HOME/PhoneBackup|grep -iv common\nif [[ echo $difference == \"\" ]]; then\n    echo \"Nothing to do... already backed up\" \n    else\n     rm -rf ~/PhoneBackup;mkdir -p ~/PhoneBackup; cp -r $PATHOFPHONE/* PhoneBackup/.\nfi\n\nelse echo Everything already backed up\nexit\nfi\nfi\n\n\n\nOn all the tests, this script has worked. Feel free to post any bugs. As a workaround, just cp PHONEDIRECTORY ~/BACKUP.\nOption 3: Music Syncing\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Banshee or Amarok Player to sync your music. Use the Ubuntu Software Center to get those.\n\n*To sync, follow instructions on many other guides. By far, this is the easiest idea out of the four.\n\n\nOption 4: Run a Windows VM\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a copy of Windows lying around, put it in a Virtual Machine, and use iTunes from there.\n\n*Install kvm from the Ubuntu Software Center. Load the iso from the menu.\n\n*Install iTunes from the Virtual Machine. For more info, do a Google on virtual machines for Ubuntu.\n\n\nBTW, I use option 2 almost every month with no issues. Of course, there are some bugs, but I made it really quickly. FWIW, option 4 is just too hard to do and hogs your CPU and RAM. However, it's your choice on what you want to do.\nHTH, James\n\nA: iTunes will not run on Ubuntu but many programs exist that will allow you to copy music onto your iPhone, best of which is Banshee and that's available from the Software Centre...\n\nA: Well there are many like RhythmBox, Banshee, Amarok, etc...\nThey all resemble iTunes. Amarok is feature-rich media player out of all.\nAll these are found in Ubuntu Software Center. \n\nA: On Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Ubuntu Software Center, install libimobiledevice\n\n*In the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), run:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ingo/ios7support\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nOn the iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to App Store\n\n*Install free FileMaster\n\nA: Some time ago, I was trying to find an alternative to iTunes in Ubuntu. I tried using it by Wine and didn't have much luck. I must of tried everything (hythmBox, Banshee, Amarok). At one point it even cost me all my music on my iPod. Thank the lord that I had it backed up on a separate HDD. PLEASE before you start doing anything, make sure you have a backup of your music library. I have my original collection and then two other backups. I have been bitten with a hdd failure before and lost all my data. I promised myself that I would not go through that again.\nI tried them all and spent many an hour truing to feel comfortable with the. In the end I settled for RhythmBox. I found it to be nice and easy to use and a great gui. It takes my music library from my hdd and then I can sync it nice and easy to my iPod when I connect it. Just make sure you have your original library down as the master and the iPod as the slave. If this is how you have your set up. It is how I have mine. It allows me to edit track in the app and I can get the covers sorted there too. For me it does it all.\n\nA: It's easy to Remmina (Ubuntu 16.04 at time of writing) to your PC/Server and run it remotely with audio enabled. Works nicely.\n\nA: You can install itunes via playonlinux. Install playonlinux from the below command\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nThen after the installation finishes, click install a new program on playonlinux then type iTunes. Select the version you need to install and follow the on screen instructions. Once the installation finishes, iTunes will be available in your system.\n", "Q: Is it possibly to install Ubuntu without making partitions? I'd like to make dual-boot (Windows 8 + Ubuntu) for my pc, which has a second HDD. Is it possible to simply install Ubuntu on the second one (which is empty) without making any shrinks/partitions?\nAnd is it possible to make Ubuntu use only the second disk without even touching first one (possessed by Windows)?\n\nA: You can install.\nAs you said you have second hard-disk which you want to use only for Ubuntu. while coming to partition step choose manual.\nThen choose your 2nd Harddisk which is usually /dev/sdb then make it as root partition with mount point /  thats it. \nNow Ubuntu will install in that total harddisk(2nd one) and total space will be for Ubuntu only.\n@OP : Recommended partition scheme \n\nA: The only way to install Ubuntu without partitioning a hard disk is to use a VM, which you don't want.  You can install Ubuntu exclusively to your other hard disk, but you must partition it.  A hard disk without a partition is like an encyclopedia without an index or table of contents: useless.  Just use custom partitioning when you are installing Ubuntu and be sure to tell it to install everything (your OS files and your bootloader) onto the correct hard disk.\n\nA: You might be confusing \"making partitions\" with \"making multiple partitions\".\nPartitioning is usually necessary, because it reserves space on the hard drive before the first partition for the master boot record, and most computers expect that record to exist in order to boot your computer.\nThus, a standard Ubuntu install will always use at least a \"root\"-Partition, even if that partition spans the whole hard disk (apart from that very small first part, which usually covers either the first 512 bytes or the first megabyte of the drive). AFAIK, this is what the solution by AgentCool will give you. So you would have your second hard disk \"/dev/sdb\", and on it your root partition \"/dev/sdb1\". So no, a standard Ubuntu cannot be installed without partitions.\nBesides that, it is technically possible for a Linux system to put a file system directly on a whole drive instead of in a partition, just not for the drive that you want to boot your Ubuntu from. So you could have an additional data file system on a third hard drive (/dev/sdc) and have the file system directly on /dev/sdc instead of on a partition /dev/sdc1. However, since this is a non-standard approach, most graphical tools will not allow that, and you would have to create the file system manually (e.g. mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sdc). And even then you have to use the parameter -F to force the creation. Once created though, Ubuntu will use this file system just fine.\n\nA: About your second question on whether putting Ubuntu on your second hard disk while leaving the first one untouched: That is possible, but usually not desirable.\nIt detail: You can put your Ubuntu partitions on your second hard drive without touching the first drive in the way several posts suggest, but you will need to also tell the installer to install the boot loader on the second hard drive (default is on the MBR of the first drive).\nHowever your computer by default will boot using the boot loader from the first hard drive, and thus will continue booting your Windows. To be given the choice to boot either Windows or Ubuntu, you would need to additionally change your BIOS boot settings to boot from the second drive.\n", "Q: Problem in skype I use Skype on my computer and when I try to call my friend so we can CoOp on MineCraft I have the problem of not being able to hear him and he is unable to hear me.

However some videos from some sites aren't playing - Foot ball videos (FIFA) and Cricket videos (Starsports) etc. Just black screen appears.\nSame videos are working fine on Google chrome\nSome links which I couldn't play on Firefox\nhttp://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186474/index.html\nhttp://www.starsports.com/cricket/tour/tourid=130/matchvideos/vod/videoid=1340276/index.html\n\nA: This is looks like this is to do with the version of Flash - Linux systems now have to use an old version of Flash.\nThe short answer is use Google Chrome - command line instructions for installing it are here. Chrome uses an embedded version of Flash (Pepper Flash), which is still updated to the latest version on all distributions.You can also use Chromium and the Pepper flash plugin:\nOther answers - which are better for Firefox users (like me):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use FreshPlayerPlugin, which borrows the plugin from Google Chrome.\nInstructions for 14.04:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install freshplayerplugin\n\nYou can then open about:addons in Firefox, and enable the plugin under 'Plugins'. It may be easier if you remove the original Flash plugin first, as Firefox seems to prefer using that. It does seem to work (the usual Flash plugin doesn't):\n\n\n*Use Pipelight (instructions here) which sort of uses Wine to pretend to be a Windows machine.\n", "Q: How can I repair unity from terminal while on a WiFi that requires me to login through a web browser? I was trying to reinstall unity-lens-applications but couldn't remember the name. I typed unity- and pressed tab to see the options. Instead of using the down key I just held enter to scroll through the results and that ended up with me attempting to install unity-*. I quickly regretted this and killed the process but now it fails to load after rebooting.\nNormally I would log in with ctrl+alt+f1 and reinstall unity from terminal but I am staying a hotel that requires me to sign in to the wifi so I can't download unity again.\nFor the time being I've booted into an Ubuntu install USB, but I'm wondering how I can repair unity on my normal installation from here.\n\nA: Text mode browser\nYou could try a text mode browser, if you have one installed: elinks, links2, w3m, lynx (roughly in order of preference for your use case). They may or may not work depending on whether the login page requires fancy stuff that these browsers don't support.\nDownload the files on another computer\nSince you seem to have access to a computer, you could download the packages on the other computer and copy them. The following command displays the URLs of the packages required to install unity; the second one displays just the URLs with no extra noise.\napt-get --no-download --print-uris install unity\napt-get -y --no-download --print-uris install bup | sed -n \"s/^'//; s/'.*//p\"\n\nAnother approach that leverages another computer would be to use that computer as a router. If you have a smartphone and a USB cable, activate your phone's tethering mode.\nRunning a GUI anyway\nAt the GUI login prompt, click on the icon with the Ubuntu logo and you'll see a list of possible sessions (corresponding to the window managers and desktop environments that you have installed). The menu may be accessed through a different UI element if the interface you see isn't the default display manager from 12.04. If you have a session type other than Unity, select it.\nIf you have no window manager at all from your system, you can still run GUI applications: all it takes is the X server. From a text console, run the following command:\nstartx firefox -- :1\n\nReplace firefox by your favorite browser. You may prefer to run a terminal emulator where you can more easily start other commands. The -- :1 part instructs X to use a different display number from the default (0), in case there is already a GUI login prompt occupying display 0.\nYou may even run the X server directly, this has minimal dependencies. You can start a GUI application by specifying the display number through the DISPLAY environment variable.\nX :1 &\nDISPLAY=:1 firefox\n\nTo kill the X server, run jobs -l in the shell, note the job number (which will be 1 if you hadn't started another background job before), and run kill %1 (or whatever the job number is).\nWithout a window manager, with just the X server, you get an extremely crude interface. There are no menus, workspaces, window borders, keyboard shortcuts or anything convenient. Worse, the only way to switch the focus between windows is to move the mouse cursor, and there is no way to move a window or raise a window that's hidden behind another one. Nevertheless this is a convenient method when you need to run one application (such as a web browser with support for fancy Javascript) in an emergency.\n", "Q: How to get information for fps for a video file in properties menu?

As your machine looks to be several years old, it could most likely be a problem with the power supply or the mainboard (capacitors are prone to fail after a while). If you have a spare power supply, I would recommend you try replacing your power supply with that.\nIt might also be related to the memory, or the BIOS. In How to diagnose and fix Kernel Panic Fatal Machine Check error?, the problem was fixed by switching the BIOS boot mode to UEFI OS from UEFI and CSM OS. I would try that suggestion first.\n", "Q: Files Shown in Terminal not Show on Desktop I have an issue where I am creating .cap files with aircrack-ng and am saving them to the desktop, but I can't see them.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!\nEDIT: Turns out I am not saving them to the desktop, but rather the /home/user/ directory.

How can I get the hidden files to show up in the terminal as well?\n\nA: Files that start with a . are hidden from the graphical interface.\nTo view them, just open up your file browser and go to 'Edit'->'Preferences' and check 'Show hidden files and backup files'.\nYou can also toggle the hidden files using Ctrl+H\nEDIT:\nTo get the hidden files to show up in terminal, use:\ncd\nls -al\n\ncd takes you back to your home folder while ls -al lists (the -l flag) all files (the -a flag) hidden or not.\n\nA: To view files list use ls command. \nTo view hidden files as well use ls -a or la commands.\nHidden files will have . before them.\nEg: you should use ls /home/user/ and for hidden files la /home/user/ for list view ls -al /home/user/\n", "Q: \"you have held broken package\" While trying to install R I know this question has already been asked, but all the answer posted weren't able to help solve my problem.\nI tried the following command on Ubuntu 14.04:\nsudo apt-get install r-base-core\n\nand I get:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n r-base-core : Depends: libtiff4 but it is not installable\n               Recommends: r-recommended but it is not going to be installed\n               Recommends: r-base-dev but it is not going to be installed\n               Recommends: r-doc-html but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nI have also tried it with aptitude:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n r-base-core : Depends: libtiff4 which is a virtual package.\nThe following actions will resolve these dependencies:\n\n      Keep the following packages at their current version:\n1)      r-base-core [Not Installed]                        \n2)      r-base-dev [Not Installed]                         \n3)      r-cran-boot [Not Installed]                        \n4)      r-cran-class [Not Installed]                       \n5)      r-cran-cluster [Not Installed]                     \n6)      r-cran-codetools [Not Installed]                   \n7)      r-cran-foreign [Not Installed]                     \n8)      r-cran-kernsmooth [Not Installed]                  \n9)      r-cran-lattice [Not Installed]                     \n10)     r-cran-mass [Not Installed]                        \n11)     r-cran-matrix [Not Installed]                      \n12)     r-cran-mgcv [Not Installed]                        \n13)     r-cran-nlme [Not Installed]                        \n14)     r-cran-nnet [Not Installed]                        \n15)     r-cran-rpart [Not Installed]                       \n16)     r-cran-spatial [Not Installed]                     \n17)     r-cran-survival [Not Installed]                    \n18)     r-recommended [Not Installed]                      \n\n\n\nAccept this solution?

One of these things was to set my screen resolution to 16 bit, in order to play an old game. After browsing through a bunch of questions here, I figured I had to create an xorg.conf file in /etc/X11 (in the latest version of Ubuntu, this file didn't already exist, I think), and fill it with\nSection \"Screen\"\nIdentifier  \"Default Screen\"\nMonitor     \"Configured Monitor\"\nDevice      \"Configured Video Device\"\nDefaultDepth    16 \nEndSection\n\nAnd I did.\nAfter doing this and rebooting, however, I found my desktop displaying 16 bit colour depth, but there was no launcher, no menu bars at the top of the screen, or at the top of any open folder or program. Luckily, I had an applications folder on the otherwise empty desktop, and managed to browse through other folders from there. But most applications in the folder now have blank icons, and new names, ending with \".desktop\", and attempting to open them results in\n\"Untrusted application launcher\nThe application launcher \"debian-xterm.desktop\" (or any other name) has not been marked as trusted. If you do not know the source of this file, launching may be unsafe.\"\nAnd there's only a cancel button present. Not option to launch anyway. This, however, has been partially resolved through the terminal, where I sudo chmod +x the applications I need to use (network, firefox and things like that). Going through all the applications this way seems like a lot of hopefully unnecessary work, though.\nI've looked at a lot of different questions about the menu bars and launcher missing, but none have helped fix the problem. I managed through the terminal to delete xorg.conf, and while the screen is back to 32 bit, the launcher and menu is still missing. The super key (windows key on my keyboard) doesn't work either.\nAny ideas what I could do to make things work again?\nETA: Typing sudo chmod +x /home/jarle/Desktop/applications/*.desktop fixed all the application files.

According to this, do the following in a terminal: \nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\nunity-tweak-tool --reset-unity\n\n\nA: Try resetting Unity as explained here (Note will likely remove settings you have made).\nAs for setting to 16bit again, it might mess it up, as it may have detected the colour depth and decided to remove incompatible things such as the launcher and panel, or just not display them correctly. This would be more appropiate for a new question - you will likely need to specify which game, what you are using to try and play it, etc.\nFor experimenting with emulating games, I did use VirtualBox a while back with some success - this also has the advantage that it mucks up you should be able to use the computer\n", "Q: X Server config used by lightdm What I want to do is to start a x server just like the lightdm did.\nBut I can't get the X server perform just like the one started by lightdm.\nI see the X server process executed by lightdm is:\nroot      4984  4978  4 19:57 tty7     00:00:48 /usr/bin/X -core :0 -seat seat0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch\n\nWhen I stop the lightdm and used the command above to start an X server, it works, but I feel something different, the performance and some advanced support.\nFor example, using the X server I started, I may get some errors when running Android emulator with GPU support:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create pbuffer failed.

I have about half a dozen NFS shares mapped to my Ubuntu 14.04 box. Each one of them shows up as an icon in the Unity Launcher. This is unnecessary and annoying - they take up a fair bit of space, and in any case I only need them to be visible from Nautilus, which they are.\nRight clicking any of them and 'unlock from Launcher' gets rid of all of them. But they come back the next time I log on, or if I remount them, or sometimes seemingly at random.\nIs it possible to stop them appearing in the launcher ever? \nRunning dconf-editor -> com -> canonical -> unity -> devices shows something is blacklisted, and removing an NFS from the launcher appends '-' to it. \n\nA: This is similar and related to (and perhaps the same as) bug 1103593.\ndafreez has suggested a workaround that I think might help you (which I've reproduced here with small spelling/capitalization and formatting tweaks):\n\nI've created a workaround until this is fixed:\nCreate a text file foo in directory bar with the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile [ 1 ]\ndo\n gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"['-']\"\n sleep 1\ndone\n\nMake it executable.\nRun crontab -e from terminal.\nAdd a line as follows:\n@reboot /path/to/bar/foo\n\n\nIf I understand it correctly, this actually automates the dconf changes you found were applied when you manually removed the launcher items. A variety of circumstances seem to undo the settings blacklisting volumes from being shown in the launcher--this script re-blacklists them every second.\nThis is not specific to NFS shares, so if you use icons for other volumes (such as local ones) often, you might be inconvenienced. But if you don't rely heavily on that behavior, you should be fine--they should still be accessible in Nautilus (the file browser).\n", "Q: Typing multiple line commands in the Terminal I know that I can copy paste this command in my terminal, but how do I type this? \nmake ex1\ncc ex1.c -o ex1\n\nTyping it all on one line produces the following: \nmake: Nothing to be done for ex1.\nmake: *** No rule to make target cc.

What will be installed when I click Install?  (Clicking \"Description of Update\" got me nothing...)\n\nA: It's simple, really. Ubuntu 14.04 is now out, so what the Ubuntu developers did was make an update that makes Ubuntu 12.04 compatible with all of the same hardware Ubuntu 14.04 is compatible with in the form of an update. This makes Ubuntu 12.04 work with more computers, but if you're already running Ubuntu 12.04 just fine and all of your hardware is working properly, then this update probably won't do anything beneficial to you. I still strongly recommend that you install it anyway, even if all of your hardware is working right.\n\nA: OK, I bit on it and clicked install.  It then gave the desired info via a link to this web page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/1204_HWE_EOL\n\nA: It looks mandatory to me since the link (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/1204_HWE_EOL) said:\n\nStarting Aug 8, 2014 systems running 12.04.2 HWE, 12.04.3 HWE, or 12.04.4 HWE will no longer receive software updates for the kernel and, if you're running it, the graphics stack.\n\nSo there will be no more update for those who are running old HWE stacks (e.g. fresh install from 12.04.x ISO)...\nI think the Update Manager should give us more info besides that simple \"Install\" button hanging over there.\n\n\nA: I can't comment on an answer because I don't have enough rep, but my husband did that update on Precise and it completely hosed up his system and he had to do a total re-install. So my advice would be if you are running Precise 12.04, don't do that upgrade. We spent hours trying to repair his system because of it.\nIt sure would be great if, instead of just putting the message and an install button in the update center, they would leave a link to let you know what it was all about.\n", "Q: MyCraft download error Hi I purchased and attempted to download MyCraft, but there was an error in the download.

You need a live cd/USB and boot from them and then you can make changes to your Ubuntu partition.\n\nA: If you want to wipe your current setup and redo it you format your disc with the installation media of the operating system you want to install on to the system.\nSince you will need an installation disc to install an operating system that is the easiest method.\n\nA: 'Gparted' has its own Live CD.

What exactly is the difference and how do i know which one i should be using?\nFor example, i have an executable adb in DEV/ADT/sdk/platform-tools folder.\nIn bash, if i enter adb and run it, i get the error : The program 'adb' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: apt-get install android-tools-adb\n\nBut if i type ./adb, it works perfectly.\n\nA: The reason is that if you don't begin it with ./, it will search the PATH for executable - you can see your current PATH by running echo $PATH - example output:\n/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/wilf/.local/bin:/usr/games\n\nSo if you want to add DEV/ADT/sdk/platform-tools to your PATH, add the following in ~/.bash_profile (you may need to run source ~/.bash_profile first, or logout and login):\nPATH=$PATH:DEV/ADT/sdk/platform-tools\n\nAnother example for ~/.local/bin:\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin\n\nIf you prefix it with ./ , it will search the current working directory (you can find this with echo $PWD, pwd, etc) for the file. \n\nA: The first key point is that ./ specifies the current or working directory, that is, the directory that you are in now which is also the one that you see if you type the command pwd (print working directory).  Bearing that in mind, bash works two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you specify a bare executable, such adb where no directory is given, then bash searches along the directories listed in the system PATH for an executable of that name and executes the first such executable that it finds.\nTo see what directories are in the system PATH, run\necho $PATH\n\n\n*If you specify an executable with a directory, such as ./ in your case, then bash looks only for an executable in that directory.  If it is not there, it stops with an error.\nIn your case, you were in the DEV/ADT/sdk/platform-tools folder where the executable, adb, was located.  So, when you type ./adb, bash looks for adb in the current directory and, if it finds it, it executes it.\nAlternatively, when you type adb, bash looks through the directories in the PATH.  Since DEV/ADT/sdk/platform-tools is apparently not in the PATH, it doesn't find the executable and complains.\nOften, people avoid this problem by putting the current directory in their PATH via something like:\nPATH=\"$PATH:.\"\n\nAfter this is done, when you type the bare executable's name, such as adb, bash will look for it, as before, along the PATH.  But since the PATH now includes the current directory, it will look there also.\nThe addition of . to the PATH is commonly done for personal users.  Because it is more dangerous when root accidentally runs the wrong executable, this is usually not done for root.\n", "Q: gedit problem when open by terminal when I open terminal and run the command sudo gedit first.cpp it shows this error in terminal:\n(gedit:24589): IBUS-WARNING **: The owner of /home/bonny/.config/ibus/bus is not root!\n(gedit:24589): Gtk-WARNING **: Calling Inhibit failed: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any .service files\"\n\n\nA: it's because you are running the application in foreground of you'r terminal\npress ctrl + z\nthen type jobs command and check the number of that gedit first.ccp process\ntype bg [the number you checked in jobs command ]\nyou won't see those warnings anymore.\n\nA: The reason for the warning is that you are running a GUI app with sudo - this can lead to several problems (one of them: you might not be able to log in again, because your Xauthority file belongs to root).\nThere used to exist a \"graphical\" sudo - gksudo or gksu or kdesu which prevented that problem.\nWith current Ubuntu versions the proper way to execute GUI apps with root permissions is a three step process:\nsudo -i\ngedit first.cpp \n....\nexit\n\neplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a shell with root permissions\n\n*execute the desired command as root\n\n*Don't forget to close that shell again.\n\n\n\nUpon rereading your question I see that you are using sudo just to edit a file in your home directory -- don't  do that, is is neither necessary nor useful.\n", "Q: How do I install nessus on ubuntu 14.04?

I'm using Windows 7 and trying to install Ubuntu.

With wubi.exe now in the same directory as the ISO file ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso, I went ahead and ran wubi.exe.\nEverything seemed to be going well, however, once I rebooted the computer and selected Ubuntu (rather than Windows 7), I received this error message:\n\nI chose \"I\" for \"ignore\", then received this error message:\n\nI selected \"S\" for \"skip mounting\".

If I try moving stuff there with mv folder ~/bin it just deletes it, so I can only assume that location doesn't exist?\nI also don't seem to have the home/user path that I also see mentioned a lot.\n\nA: Assuming that you really want to have bin folder in your home directory, first create the folder using command \nmkdir ~/bin\n\nAfter following command is executed, then your mv command will work. What's most likely is happening is you don't have bin folder, but when you try to move, the file is moved as \"bin\" - that is your file now becomes bin.\nIf you want to move file \"myscript.sh\" to bin execute following command after making sure directory/folder exists.\nmv myscript.sh ~/bin/.\n\n\nA: Make sure you are in the root directory\nWhen in the file browser, on the side there should be a panel, click on the computer button, there should be all the folders in your root directory, including bin and home.\n", "Q: Failed 14.04 install and BIOS problem After upgrading to 14.04 LTS from 12.04 LTS, I received the error\nfile not found\ngrub rescue\n\nSo my boot loader is stuffed and I need to repair it.

You need to enter a password for that.\n\n*For more convenience, write a script to set up the encrypted loopfs, run that script after you boot the server.

I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity and I'd like to switch the desktop environment to Xfce instead of Unity. I was wondering if my files (pictures, music, pdfs) will switch over or would they be deleted?\nI'm using this guide to switch from Unity to Xfce.\n\nA: Your files in the home directory will be untouched, and available from the new GUI. No need to worry. :)\n\nA: Essentially, a desktop environment is a piece of software that you install on your system. It is like any other programme, but with the broad task of providing you with a visual environment to manage running programmes and the file system. \nThus, the result of installing Xubuntu from the Software Centre or Synpatic is simply the addition of a large set of libraries, programmes and configurations to your system. These will usually go into places such as /usr/bin and /usr/share. No files are deleted in the process and the operating system (Linux kernel) is left untouched. Your home folder is also left untouched, as well as any personal configurations you may have stored there.\nAnd the most beautiful thing of all is that Unity will remain installed and you may (at log in time) choose which desktop environment to use in that session.\n\nA: Installing additional desktop enviroments such as Xubuntu or Lubuntu won't touch your personal files. In most cases files will remain untouched, especially if they are in your home directory.\nThe only time you would lose all your files is if you was to install a new version of Linux (Xubuntu, etc.) over your old partition from a Live CD.\n", "Q: How to Install Ubuntu with FreeDOS already Installed I just bought a new notebook with free DOS installed. I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I've been stuck in disk partitioning for 6 hours (even more). I've explored questions about it and I knew that it's normal to take a couple hours. But, I'm afraid that it's actually stuck. How do I know whether or not it's stuck? Is there a way to see the progress?\nP.S. when I chose 'try ubuntu', I got an error message 'The system is running in low-graphics mode'. I pressed OK button, but it did nothing. Does it have something to do with my question above?\n(Edit: the error has nothing to do with the problem as stated by Karel below.)\n\nA: You don't need to do any disk partitioning before you install Ubuntu on a computer that comes with only FreeDOS preinstalled. The Ubuntu installer will take care of all the partitioning for you. If you choose the option in the Installation type window that says Erase disk and install Ubuntu, the Ubuntu installer will use the entire hard drive for Ubuntu and you won't need to do any manual partitioning. \nThe whole installation process from start to finish should take about a half hour. If the Ubuntu installer gets stuck for more than an hour in the middle of the installatiuon process, then you definitely have a problem installing Ubuntu. If you are installing Ubuntu on a computer that comes with only FreeDOS preinstalled, you can safely overwrite FreeDOS, as it no longer serves any purpose.  \nThe error message that you got about graphics config has nothing to do with FreeDOS. If you have successfully installed Ubuntu, you should open the Additional Drivers utility and check if there are any proprietary graphics drivers available to be installed.\n", "Q: swap partition shows as unknown in gparted My swap partition does not seem to be operating properly.

Since I cannot just show you a screen cap of gparted, here is what parted print shows:\nModel: ATA WDC WD2500BEVT-6 (scsi)    \nDisk /dev/sda: 250GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B    \nPartition Table: msdos\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    Type      File system  Flags    \n 1      210MB   73.2GB  73.0GB  primary   ntfs         boot\n 2      73.2GB  250GB   177GB   extended\n 5      73.2GB  248GB   175GB   logical   ext4    \n 6      248GB   250GB   2074MB  logical\n\nThat last one, number 6, is supposed to be a swap partition. Linux lives on 5, of course, which is part of the same extended partition 2 that the swap partition is also on. Windows lives on 1. Grub does work and dual boots defaulting to Linux. \nIn blkid, it shows a different ID from fstab and calls it cryptswap instead of just swap.\nroot@darkstar1:/home/darkstar# blkid\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"A84E02644E022C1E\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"c8635db4-5951-47fc-8f84-19b706a2e9ec\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1: UUID=\"9b77fefd-115c-4bf2-8e17-52d1bcf58fee\" TYPE=\"swap\"\n\nfstab looks like this:\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).\n#\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n\n# / was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=c8635db4-5951-47fc-8f84-19b706a2e9ec /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\n# swap was on /dev/sda6 during installation\n#UUID=c44f68cd-e433-462f-81dc-16b8e52c7abb none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nIs cryptswap1 the same as my swap partition? Do I need to change my fstab to show the same ID the blkid is showing for the cryptswap1? I need swap, as my computer only has 2 GB of ram and easily locks up when playing video online. When the swap was running yesterday, it ran smoothly with no problems whatsoever. I had just replaced my older Ubuntu install with a Xubuntu install. Windows is on the first partition, Linux and the swap are supposed to be on the second extended partition. \nI would rather have my home drive encrypted. Xubuntu did not give me a choice to NOT have it encrypted when I installed it (the boxes were prechecked in the installer and I could not uncheck them). So it should be encrypted. \nI think this might have something to do with my old install of Ubuntu (I was testing KDE, XFCE and Gnome and decided to just reinstall with Xubuntu since the swap NEVER worked on the original install and I had numerous issues with the other window managers - XFCE really is the best).\n\nA: Now that the question is better formatted, I can make more sense of it. \n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, your swap partition is being used, as swapon -s shows. It is a 2GB swap partition of which 56 KB is being used. (You can also check with the free command.) \n\n*To GParted and most tools, the encrypted swap partition is a section of meaningless data with no detectable file system (as it should be), so they show it as \"Unknown\". If they ever do show it as a swap partition, SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG.\n\n*No, you need not replace the line in fstab (the one with /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 with the UUID of the cryptswap1 partition. The commented out UUID is of the swap partition as it was originally created and should remain commented out.\n\n*You can add more encrypted swap using swap files. A combination of https://askubuntu.com/a/178726/158442 and https://askubuntu.com/a/396137/158442 (replace the devices with the path of the swap file in the steps for encryption).\n\n\nAll that said, it looks to me your problem is unrelated to swap.\n", "Q: Does XFCE have a sticky edges option or plugin? I'm using two monitors and really enjoyed the sticky edges feature of GNOME.  Does XFCE have something similar?\nSticky edges, in Unity, meant that when moving the mouse between your two displays, it would stick to the edge of your current display initially, and if you kept moving it would finally pass the edge into the other display.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for but try enabling \"Window snapping\", \"To screen borders\" or \"To other windows\" at:\nSettings Manager > Personal > Window Manager > Advanced > Window Snapping.\nOR\nWindow Manager GUI > Advanced > Window Snapping\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Dell Latitude E5440 Sound I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Dell Latitude E5440 but i am getting no sound.

How can I set up the dual-boot?\n\nA: Option 1:\nUsing \"gparted\" (Live ubuntu (sudo apt-get install gparted)) (or any disk partitioning tool), clear out one of the NTFS partitions to 'not partitioned', (hopefully that space is at least 18GB), and then proceed to the installation, Linux is usually installed on EXT4 partition and it is not for NTFS partitions.

I can't do that as there is no icon.  If I click the camera icon in Hangout the phone appears to be calling the laptop, but nothing happens on the laptop.\nSo how do I set up a Video call call using Empathy and google+?\nTerry\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, this is no longer supported -- in late 2013, Google announced that they were \"dropping\" XMPP support. What this has meant in practice is that multi-protocol chat clients are still able to connect to Google Talk via the existing XMPP authentication mechanism, just as it's still possible to chat with non-Gmail XMPP contacts from the sidebar chat within Gmail, but XMPP is no longer supported for voice or video, as their Hangouts implementation is proprietary. It's not clear whether they'll eventually disable XMPP for regular instant messaging as well, but I expect and hope not.\nThe only way to do a Google voice or video call at this point is through the browser -- I believe there's a desktop client for Windows and ChromeOS which you might be able to get working through Wine or Archon, respectively, but it wouldn't have the same level of desktop integration or multi-protocol support as Pidgin and Empathy.\n", "Q: My-Weather-Indicator has stopped working My-Weather-Indicator has stopped working after I filled in a second location although did fine before that.

Some people have been able to get around by removing the offending symbols in the source files then installing the module (removing/blacklisting the kernel installed module). See this and this. Apparently there is also a more recent source of the driver mentioned here though it has the same compilation problems which can be fixed as above.\nThis will be somewhat painful to maintain since it has to be recompiled on every kernel upgrade. Someone has created a dkms package here, and though it is for older 12.04 release, it should be possible to pick up the source deb of that and integrate the patch mentioned above in it.\nStill I will suggest trying to get it working with the kernel driver first. I had two suggestions before: a) does it show up in gnome-disks, b) is it enabled in BIOS . In any case I think this should be reported in kernel upstream since the kernel driver is supposed to be created from the GPLed Realtek's driver.

This is still an option in today's UEFI systems. However, GRUB is started as soon as Ubuntu boots, and when you choose Ubuntu in GRUB, it continues the boot process. If you choose Windows, it \"redirects\" you to the Windows partition and boots. However, if you boot straight to Windows, that means that your system is not attempting to boot Ubuntu at all. There is a simple fix for this. As soon as your computer turns on, press F1, F2, delete, esc, or something similar to access the settings. If you did this correctly, you will see a screen similar to the one displayed below, but every BIOS is accessed and is displayed differently.\n\nNavigate to the boot settings. In this example, you should go to the tab labeled \"Boot\" by pressing the right arrow key four times. Then look for something called \"Boot Order\" or \"Boot Priority\". Here is where things get complicated. In BIOS', you would see a list of devices and move them up or down a list. However, in UEFI (which you have and, if you don't know this already, is the same thing as EFI), you would choose from a list of all existing bootable partitions on all detected devices. You want to set the Ubuntu partition to boot first, so, if you're not already, get to the boot order settings and make sure you see a screen like the one displayed below (except the one below was taken in a traditional BIOS, sorry).\n\nDespite what you may have heard, you should keep Secure Boot enabled. Let me tell you how Secure Boot works. Every UEFI system that has support for Secure Boot (basically just about any computer that came with an OEM installation of Windows 8) has a list of keys made into the BIOS. There is almost always a key for Windows. Basically, your UEFI needs a key for something before it can boot. That way, if a virus tries to make your computer boot a virus, your UEFI will just say you can't boot from that because you don't have the key. You have to have a corresponding key before something to boot. That's how Secure Boot protects you. However, not every UEFI has a key for Ubuntu. There is no difference in the boot process when you boot from a CD, flash drive, or hard drive. So, if you can boot Ubuntu live fro a CD or flash drive or ran the installation program, your UEFI has the key for Ubuntu and knows that Ubuntu is safe. That means you can leave Secure Boot enabled without problems. Hooray! Also, you need to keep UEFI enabled and never ever set it to Legacy mode or BIOS mode or whatever your UEFI may say. Then, in the list, you should see an option labeled Ubuntu or something similar. Move it to the top of the list, as the list can be rearranged. Save and exit your UEFI, and, if you're lucky, you should see GRUB asking which operating system to boot.\n\nA: Get EasyBCD: problem solved.

Perhaps it has something to do with this.\nIf anyone has any idea or hint, it would be most appreciated.\nAnother thing is that I did this to another laptop with switchable graphics, a Samsung with Intel HD 3000 and AMD Radeon HD 8750, and it works perfectly fine. As soon as I installed the proprietary drivers, I was able to execute CCC and set it up to use the Intel VGA only.\n\nA: Have you tried removing the aticonfig?\n\nsudo aticonfig --uninstall\n\nIf it persists...I had a similar problem last week and this worked for me:\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-core\n  xserver-xorg-video-intel libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri\n  libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386  \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg \nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nI hope you can fix it...

It happens regardless of the driver I install.\nTried all the following drivers: Xorg default, ATI Proprietary, Catalyst 14.4 (didn't work at all) and Catalyst 14.6 Beta (using this one now).\nI already tried MANY different fixes I found online during this week, but nothing seems to work.\nGaming, for instance, does not get affected as far as I can notice.\nMy CCC doesn't show the 'Anti Tear' option. I read somewhere that it's due to dual graphics card being present (Intel/ATI).\nDoes anybody have a clue how to fix this?\nThanks!!!\n\nA: Reinstall the Graphc driver:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove xserver-xorg-video-radeon && sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-radeon\n\nThen reboot.\n\nA: @Mookey's solution worked for me, but I would like to expand on it a bit more.\nI too had the same problem on Ubuntu 15.10 with the open source radeon drivers. Video playback caused severe tearing during high-motion scenes. One video caused lots of tearing in VLC but next to none in Totem.\nThe xorg options for radeon point at the solution:\n\nXV_VSYNC ... If you are using a compositer, this does not prevent tearing because Xv is rendering to an offscreen buffer and the compositor copied it to the front buffer.\n\nIf you install CompizConfig, you can adjust Unity's Composite plugin—among a great many other things. Search for it in the filter dialog box. If you mouse-over the \"Unredirect Fullscreen Windows\" option, the tool-tip reads:\n\nAllow drawing of fullscreen windows to not be directed to offscreen pixmaps.\n\nTurning the option off (it defaults to on) will use the offscreen pixmaps, allowing the radeon driver to do its work. If this works, the effect will be nearly immediate. No need to close CCSM or reboot. Just restart VLC or the offending application and try it out. If it doesn't work, reset the option to default.\nIt is somewhat ironic that a feature introduced to prevent tearing actually causes it. But the feature was introduced to fix performance issues with the compositer. If you disable the option, you may have performance issues with full-screen games.\nSo instead of disabling it entirely, you might try editing the \"Unredirect Match\" option to remove the applications which are giving you trouble. Oddly, the entry for VLC is wrong. It is listed as Vlc, but xprop lists its class as vlc, all lower-case. Perhaps this is a bug. When I fix the spelling, but leave Unredirect on, VLC no longer tears.\nUltimately, we need a replacement for X, such as Wayland or Mir, which will finally make tearing a relic of the past. Tearing is a common issue on many linux installs, and it's very difficult to stamp out.\n\nA: Found the solution as follows:\n\nGo to chrome://flags\nLook for “Override Software Rendering List”, i.e. enabling GPU\n  acceleration on unsupported hardware and ENABLE it, RESTART chrome\n  (close the background process if you have that running on the top of\n  the bar)\n\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/enable-hardware-acceleration-in-chrome.html\n\nA: I had the same problem and actually, what helped me was the opposite of what people are stating.\nINstall Compiz with plugins\nUnder Composite UNCHECK detect frame rate + undirect fullscreen windows.\nLet me know if it helps.\n", "Q: Sync Thunderbird configs across computers I sync my thunderbird profile folder with owncloud so that I can have the same configs across all my computers. \nBecause of the size of the folder, data sometimes get corrupted or version conflict.. \nDoes anyone have a better solution? \nThe important part I would like to sync is mail accounts config and calendars, mails can sync naturally by imap.\n\nA: the best way I've found to sync Thunderbirds settings, even mail boxes across machines is by using TEBE\nhttp://www.customsoftwareconsult.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=2957\nIt's an off branch of FEBE (firefox) but since now Firefox has its own sync, FEBE became less, it's still great for Offline Backup purposes.\nHowever FEBE is still the main tool I use to keep my Thunderbird settings across machines, since Thunderbird does not yet have a online sync tool built-in as Firefox does.\nand TEBE has BOX.net sync option, so you can pick it up from another computer via TEBE by connecting to the same account, after each scheduled backup, or manual backup.\nYou can also specify what to backup and what to skip.\n", "Q: triple booting on ubuntu I have Windows 8, Windows 7 and Ubuntu x86 installed on my PC.\nWhen I boot, GRUB2 comes up so I can boot.\nI want to uninstall Windows 8 but keep Windows 7.

I downloaded today and installed the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 something,and i installed it via Live CD. All went well, I created a partition of 150GB and another one of 508MB (the latter for the swap space) and when i restarted the PC it automatically booted to Ubuntu, it didnt ask for which OS to boot to.\nI booted to Ubuntu alright, but noticed that it wasnt working properly - the mouse lags and leaves trails of itself, typing had a delay - and so i figured that i shouldnt have installed the 64-bit version cause i have 4GB of memory. I tried downloading the boot repair tool by typing in the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\n\nbut i received an error saying something like: cannot locate /cow in grub. I googled it but couldn't find anything. Then i typed:\nsudo update-grub\n\nand it did find my Win7 installation. Next time i rebooted i was prompted which OS to boot from and I chose the win7 loader. All went well and there I was at my windows. I then proceeded in formatting the disk partitions that were used by Ubuntu, but then when i rebooted there was an error on the screen saying that there is no bootable device. I rebooted and pressed F12 to access the boot options and  I found 2 of them, one with the tag P0 and one P1. I tried both of them, the first one redirected me to the previous message, whereas the 2nd one redirected me to a message saying:\ngrub rescue>\n\nI had no idea what to do, so I re-installed the Ubuntu OS from the cd and ran the update-grub command again (boot-repair still didn't work).

It will favor apache2. So, just pass nginx explicitly and it should install, because nginx offers httpd (see output of apt-cache showpkg httpd).\n$ apt-cache showpkg httpd|grep nginx\nnginx-naxsi 1.4.6-1ubuntu3\nnginx-light 1.4.6-1ubuntu3\nnginx-full 1.4.6-1ubuntu3\nnginx-extras 1.4.6-1ubuntu3\nnginx-core 1.4.6-1ubuntu3\n\nEdit:\nTried this myself on Ubuntu 14.04 just to find out that it doesn't work. Apparently one of the dependencies is hardcoded and not tied to httpd only. Presumably because no configuration exists for anything other than Apache? Anyway, I set out to find out and it turns out the Depends line from above holds the key. It's not just apache2 | httpd but also libapache2-mod-php5 | php5-cgi. So we need to be explicit about these things as well.\nThe package apt-rdepends shows what's going on:\n$ apt-rdepends phppgadmin|grep apache2\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information... Done\n  Depends: apache2\n  Depends: libapache2-mod-php5\napache2\n  Depends: apache2-bin (= 2.4.7-1ubuntu4)\n  Depends: apache2-data (= 2.4.7-1ubuntu4)\napache2-bin\napache2-data\nlibapache2-mod-php5\n  Depends: apache2 (>= 2.4)\n  Depends: apache2-api-20120211\napache2-api-20120211\n\nThe libapache2-mod-php5 line is also to be found in the dependencies of phppgadmin and is the issue here.\nTherefore we end up with:\n$ apt-get install --no-install-recommends nginx php5-cgi phppgadmin\n\n\nA: You don't need apt to install phppgadmin.\nDownload the compressed folder from sourceforge and unzip into your root (or into a folder that you symlink into your root).\nThat's all you need to be up and running. Some points that might help:\n\n\n*\n\n*PhpPgAdmin requires another user besides postgres. In Linux:\n$ sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser --pwprompt dev\n\n*If you get login failed, you probably are connected over Unix socket.\nEdit pg_hba.conf (/etc/postgresql/9.x/main/pg_hba.conf).\nReplace local all all peer with local all all md5\n\n*If you get a 403 error, then phppgadmin was probably unzipped as root.\nChange the user to www-data: sudo chown -R www-data phppgadmin \n\n*The detailed install instructions can be found here, and common issues here. \n\n\nUsing --no-install-recommends as 0xC0000022L suggested does not work, as Apache is a dependency, not a recommendation.\nHe correctly explained the issue, though. If you use apt, the install will probably work, it just will install Apache and then err out when Apache is unable to run.\n", "Q: Changing the background of terminal in ZSH when connected to server I use terminator as a terminal, zsh shell and oh my zsh, on both my laptop and my server, for what it's worth, I created an alias named vps to connect to my vps using ssh.\nCurrently terminator background color is black, could it be made lets say white when connected to vps, although it's pretty easy to tell when I'm connected to the vps and when I'm not, still it would be nice if such thing is possible.\n\nA: One method is to use different profiles for the Terminator windows - for example, you could have this as the profile at ~/.config/terminator/config:\n # This is a comment\n [global_config]\n   focus = system\n\n [keybindings]\n   full_screen = <Ctrl><Shift>F11\n\n [profiles]\n   [[default]]\n     font = Fixed 10\n     background_color = \"#000000\" # A comment\n     foreground_color = \"#FFFFFF\" # Note that hex colour values must be quoted\n     scrollback_lines = '500' #More comment. Single quotes are valid too\n     cursor_blink = True\n   [[ssh]]\n     font = Fixed 10\n     background_color = \"#0000BB\" # A comment\n     foreground_color = \"#FFFFFF\" # Note that hex colour values must be quoted\n     scrollback_lines = '500' #More comment. Single quotes are valid too\n     cursor_blink = True\n     #exit_action = restart #Stops the terminal from closing after the command has been run\n\nThen you could open the terminator window, selecting the profile with:\nterminator -p ssh\n\nYou could also run the command directly with the -e option - e.g.\nterminator -p ssh -e \"ssh vps\"\n\nFor this you may want to uncomment the exit_action = restart line, so the terminal does not exit immediately after the command is run.\nFor more on how to edit make/edit Terminator profiles, run man terminator_config - you can easily change the background colour by editing the background_color line - you will need to quote it.\n", "Q: A few beginner questions Greetings to all here..\nI'm a complete Linux virgin, so apologies if anything I'm asking is blatantly obvious..

I wanted to remove Elementary OS Linux and replace with Ubuntu 14.04. I downloaded the iso file and transferred to a DVD. Checked the DVD and it was on there.

Or check if your pc is 32 or 64 bit\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads\n\nA: Reinstall 12.04. I have found it well supported for drivers and more amenable generally than 14.04. I  a newbie running both. By the way when I first tried to install 14.04 it would only install partially then crash. The download was corrupt so I did a fresh download and reinstall and all was well.

I have a problem with HDMI sound on both Ubuntu 14 and Windows 7, is this hardware?\nThe problem only occurs when running games (something sound intensive) I get ugly noise through the speakers. This also occurs in Windows and didn't until a couple of months ago.\nSwitching to optical stereo has resolved the issue but I have lost 5.1 sound.\nI think it may be the hardware itself since this is a new problem and is common to 2 Operating Systems. I also think this because HDMI sound is relatively simple to do.\nI have a Geforce 670 GTX and is fairly new, still in warranty, does this sound like a hardware problem?\n\nA: Yes. It sounds like a hardware problem as it persists regardless of operating system. This does not necessarily mean the your 670 GTX is faulty. Try a different (known working) cable. If you get the same result with a known good cable, you know where the problem is.\n", "Q: dig +trace returns my DNS IP When I'm trying to execute dig +trace command, output is the following:\n$ dig +trace google.com\n\n; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-3-Ubuntu <<>> +trace google.com\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Received 12 bytes from 127.0.1.1#53(127.0.1.1) in 10 ms\n\nI assume there are some issues with my DNS setup, but I do not know where to look.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Took me a bit of digging to find out what is going on here. Basically, the new systemd nonsense has forced itself into the DNS space. If you read /etc/resolv.conf, you'll see it refers to systemd-resolved. You'll also see your nameserver entry is 127.0.0.53.\nnetstat -pntul | grep :53 show: \ntcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:53 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 29133/named \ntcp 0 0 127.0.0.53:53 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 27505/systemd-resol\n\nBut systemd-resolved passes queries NOT to your bind9 server, but to glibc. Unfortunately, glibc isn't a resolver. It will pass queries, but does so in a way that breaks +trace. +notrace works just fine.\nTo get around this, I removed resolvconf, turned off systemd-resolved, and changed the /etc/resolv.conf entry from 127.0.0.53 to 127.0.0.1.\nBefore you make the change, you can dig @127.0.0.1 +trace google.com and see that dig +trace works as expected proving the systemd implementation is broken and should be removed.\n", "Q: Binding Synapse shortcut to key-release instead of key-press Background\nSo I've already referred a question that demonstrates how to bind the Synapse launcher to the \"Super (Win) Key\". (Can I change Synapse shortcut to Super/Windows key alone?)\nThe problem is that combinations involving the Super key now all launch Synapse.\nI believe this is happening because Synapse is being activated on the button-press event rather than on the button-release event as would happen with, say, Unity or while using it on Windows.\nQuestion\nIs there any way in Ubuntu to bind a shortcut to the button-release event? That way I can use the Super button in other combinations, like \"Super + D\" for show desktop or something.\nEnvironment\nI'm using the Gnome (Compiz) Flashback session environment on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: ksuperkey worked well for me. I followed the instructions here:\nhttps://blog.hanschen.org/2012/10/17/open-application-launcher-with-super-key/\nExcept, I'm on Ubuntu 16.04 + MATE, so what I did was:\na) Removed Alt+F1 as the shortcut for the MATE menu in Preferences --> Hardware --> Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nb) Set Alt+F1 as the Synapse shortcut:\ncat ~/.config/synapse/config.json       {\n          \"ui\" : {\n            \"global\" : {\n              \"ui-type\" : \"default\"\n            },\n            \"shortcuts\" : {\n              \"activate\" : \"<Alt>F1\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n\nc) Installed and ran ksuperkey\nksuperkey now does the mapping from the release of the Win key (Super key) to Alt+F1, which triggers MATE to launch Synapse. At the same time, other combinations involving Win work fine without invoking Synapse. (In particular, I set up Win + M to minimize all windows and show the Desktop and that's important to me).\nNote that ksuperkey is quite flexible and the can map the release of any key to send any key combination, not just Alt+F1 (the default).\nd) Added ksuperkey to Startup Applications\n", "Q: 14.04 Wireless throughput issues Using iperf to test throughput using Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205, I'm getting 20Mbps up and 50Mbps down.

I have to uninstall the mod to play Minecraft even though I am using the correct version. This worked for my friend (who uses Windows 8).\nHow can i fix this?\n\nA: The shaders are likely utilising OpenGL/GLSL features that your graphics card and its driver have not yet implemented. Even if hardware can do something, it needs the software there to interpret it and these drivers sometimes lag behind their Windows counterparts.\nThis is most true on the Intel and other open source graphics drivers.

The rest of the information I have gathered is in this set of crudely capture screenshots.\nThe problem also occurs in a clean installation of Lubuntu 12.04, so I fear a hardware problem but am unsure how to proceed. \n\nA: From the stack trace it looks like your hitting a kernel panic, possibly due to referencing an invalid NULL pointer.  Also from the screen shot shows a diffirent issue, related to a unhandled paging request. \nIts best to raise an issue/bug with this link with the os vendor. \nThese could be a possibly bugs in the kernel version you are using as Ubuntu 12.04 has LTS if its shipped with the hardware.

I've installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and am slowly getting things back in shape again. I'm using IMAP with my local folders under Evolution. Prior to the crash I was using fetchmail and procmail.\nFor some reason procmail won't install which is too bad as it was working great for me. I've moved onto Maildrop, have it installed but I'm having problems finding examples of the /etc/maildroprc file.\nI've reinstalled fetchmail and courier-imap and both seem to be running fine. Would anyone have any examples of what a maildroprc file should look like? All the sites I've looked at on-line just don't seem to help or else I just don't understand them\n\nA: Preamble:\nI have been using maildrop for many years now to filter my mail (as a drop-in replacement for procmail). My usage has been:\nmutt --> msmtp --> GMail --> getmail --> maildrop --> mutt\n\nMy mail spool is a very traditional /var/spool/mail/andrew and my central mailbox delivery is to $HOME/mail/mailboxes. So a little different to your own setup!\nNevertheless I can give an edited version of my maildrop filter, which I have placed as $HOME/.mailfilter (whereas I see that you have chosen /etc/maildroprc).\nFilter example:\nBelow is a modified version of my own mailfilter, as you have requested in your question, which has in its expanded form served me well for many years:\n#-------------------------------------------#\n#  maildrop filters for $HOME/.mailfilter   #\n#-------------------------------------------#\n\n# --> Some Variables... <--  #\n\nDEFAULT=/var/spool/mail/andrew\nMAILBOX=\"$HOME/mail/mailboxes\"          \nSENDMAIL=\"/usr/bin/msmtp\"\nlogfile \"$HOME/.mailfilter.log\"\nVERBOSE=9\n\n# --> Filter / deliver mailing lists...<-- #\n\nif (/^List-Id:.*ffmpeg-user.ffmpeg.org>/)\n    to $MAILBOX/ffmpeg\n\n# --> Filter / deliver Forums email...<-- #\n\nif (/^From:.*forum@linuxquestions.org>/)\n    to $MAILBOX/linuxquestions\n    \n# --> Filter / deliver old friends... <-- #\n\nif (/^From:.*an_old_friend@une.edu.au>/)\n    to $MAILBOX/an_old_friend\n\n# -->  Send a CC on receipt ...      <--  #\n\nif (/^From:.*@iinet.net.au>/)\n{\n    cc\"!another_address@gmail.com\"\n}\n\nIn conclusion:\nThis is the old school way of doing mail and I hope this example of a working mailfilter will assist you to get your own setup working and perhaps interest other AU users in trying out the old ways...\n", "Q: Server side filtering - Courier, Postfix, Roundcube I have a mail server running Postfix, Courier, and Roundcube.  I'm looking to add the ability for a user to assign their own custom mail filters from the web.  I haven't yet found a way I can do this, from what I can tell Roundcube's filter plugin works just like it would on a mail client - that meaning, it has to check the mail before it can filter them.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: If you can find something that does the Sieve protocol, I think you will have found just what you want. Sieve is a protocol that lets you upload filters to the server and have them applied as the mail is delivered to the users. I have set up Sieve on my server setup (about 2 years ago), but I was using Postfix, Dovecot, and the Sieve plugin for Dovecot. So I'm probably not much direct help, but hopefully it will give you an idea of a direction you could go. I would not be at all surprised if Courier has a Sieve plugin you can set up. Then I guess if you could find a webmail client that lets you set Sieve filters, then you would be all set.\nMaybe one of these would be something that would work:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://squirrelmail.org/plugin_view.php?id=73\n\n*http://plugins.roundcube.net/packages/johndoh/sieverules\n\n*http://trac.roundcube.net/browser/github/plugins/managesieve/managesieve.php\nThe one thing that concerns me is that I haven't found anything saying how to set up Courier to do Sieve. When I set up my mail server, it was using Dovecot. I did find something on a mailing list about it not supporting Sieve at the time of that message, but couldn't find anything that said either way if current version of Courier can do Sieve.\n", "Q: How to resolve disk space problem in Ubuntu while using apt-get -f install?

Open a terminal and start the alsamixer program. Change cards if you think the channels are too few. The last few columns will contain one for the auto muting option, which can have various values. Toggle to see if any one is the effect you want. If none suit you, experiment with disabling channels until it's satisfactory.

1\nmake[1]: *** [modules/core/CMakeFiles/opencv_core.dir/all] 오류 2\n\nI'm trying to install OpenCV 2.2.0. I think that I followed all the steps before I ran make, but whenever I type make, it doesn't work and 2 errors occur. I don't know why it is happening. Please let me know how to fix this.\n\nA: I'm trying to figure out why you are using version 2.4.  Errors often are secondary in nature. For example, you may have not installed secondary dependencies. These usually can be detected by paying close attention to the warnings in the installation process. \nMy suggestion is to delete all of the stuff that cmake created and then rerun cmake. When it is done, scroll to the top and check to make sure everything it was looking for had been found. If it isn't a strong dependency, when you compile, it will just skip that. \nFor the case of installing an older version of the software such as you are doing, I would make sure none of the dependencies are newer than the older version you are trying to install. Most newer versions are compatible with the old, but they can't test everything. According to the DoD 100% testing is 60-80% effective.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.3 End of Support I have a pc for working with 12.04.3, I've read that it will lost support, do I need to install 14.04.1? \nI would like to use 12.04 until 2017, it works great and as we use it for working I would'n want to have the risk of installing another version.\n\nA: You don't need to update to 14.04, Ubuntu 12.04 will be supported until 2017.\nTechnically, 12.04.3 is no longer supported, since it has (since February) been superseded by 12.04.4. That's nothing to worry about, since that last digit just signifies the service release, which (basically) only matters when installing a new system. Any currently installed Ubuntu 12.04 with all the latest updates automatically is a 12.04.4.\n", "Q: Setting up multiple Ubuntu computers to share files and users I'm very new to the *nix world and only vaguely have heard of things like YP/NIS, LDAP, Kerberos, etc. If I have several machines that I want to toss Ubuntu on to and share users and files/mounts across them, what programs and services provide the necessary elements to do so?\nI have a computer with more storage that can serve as a server, but what do I need to install and configure on it and all my workstations to-be? The network is shared with other, unknown groups, so security is important.\nI don't really expect a detailed answer here; my problem is more I don't know where to start. LDAP sounds interesting, but it seems to do so many things I don't know if it's actually what to use.\n\nA: I think you can use LDAP and NFS.\n\n\n*\n\n*LDAP can do a lot of things - and it is best suited to what you are doing for authentication. Managing LDAP is not a big chore, especially with utilities like phpLDAPadmin. There are plenty of scripts in the ldapscripts package to simplify command-line tasks. The Ubuntu Server Guide has a nice, detailed entry on installing and configuring LDAP and enabling STARTTLS. Once the server is set up, configuring the client is very easy - just install libpam-ldapd, libnss-ldapd and nslcd and choosing the right options when asked, and run the pam-auth-update command to enable LDAP. LDAP can also specify a lot of details about the user - the home directory, the shell, the mail server, etc.\n\n*NFS can be used to share home folders, but I am not sure of securing it. You can allow and deny access to specific hosts, but I don't know how secure an IP-based restriction is - what's to prevent someone from using the IP of a system that's down and gaining access?\n\n\nI have never set up Kerberos, so I won't comment about it, but it seems you can integrate Kerberos with LDAP and NFS, considerably increasing the security of NFS. But for now, start small with LDAP and NFS.\n", "Q: BIOS Corrupted After A Failed Suspension Currently typing from a friend's Wii. My HP 2000-299WM laptop stalled while suspending one night, so I forced it to shutdown with the power button.\nNow, initial HP splash screen is blank, and leads me to a non-blinking underscore, (Frozen?) which stays locked up.\nI am currently unsure if the bios settings are corrupted, or if the UEFI loader, if the splashscreen is one, is broken. Because I have tried many methods to clear the CMOS by removing the bios battery, which means disassembling my laptop multiple times to access it, and it doesn't work.\nThe battery itself is not dead either. I hooked it up to a small electric motor, and it received power.\nI also did the caps lock LED test, and it gave me two blinks, signifying bios corruption instead of a hardware problem. The GPU, CPU, RAM, fan, HDD, and wireless card were operating at their best without any sign of degradation before this happened, so it's telling me that the hardware is likely okay. I have owned this laptop for two years without any issues previously.\nHow do I reset the CMOS on my laptop model, if that's the issue, or does it go deeper that? I am so short on answers at the moment, and it's driving me crazy.\n\nA: This is a longshot, but it sounds like your machine might be making it past the BIOS and then just hanging at boot. My MBP used to do this. Had something to do with not being able to resume from the memdisk when booting from EFI. Every boot would take me to the same screen you're getting.\nIf this is the case, and you are indeed getting through the BIOS, think you could manage it to boot from CD? If so, you could burn a copy of Super Grub Disc 2 and boot up with that. It'll find your exisiting GRUB install. Edit that to include acpi_sleep=nonvs before the quiet splash params and then boot up. That'll force your Ubuntu to wake from its slumber.\n", "Q: Photo lens only searches one subfolder On my computer (running Ubuntu 14.04) Unity's photo lens only searches one subfolder of my Pictures folder.\nThe strange thing is that there is nothing special about that folder. My photos are organized in folders by year and month in folders named like this:\n~/Pictures/Share/yyyy/yyyy-mm/\nThe photo lens only searches subfolder 2013/2013-06, but not 2013/2013-05 nor 2013/2013-07 nor anything else. The permissions on the searched folder are not different from other folders.\nWhy might be? What can I do to debug this problem?\n\nA: The photo lens only searches pictures imported in shotwell and some online apps.\nIf you got only the 2013/2013-06 folder imported there it won't search other folders.\nIf you import the other folders as well your problem should be gone.\n", "Q: How to find out the amount of hard drive space consumed by installed programs? I was wondering if there is any way to see the total hard drive space used by any  program, after the installation has been completed?\n\nA: For a particular package:\napt-cache show <packagename> | grep -E '^(.*Size|Version|Package)'\n\nAdd or remove fields in the grep string as necessary. Since multiple versions may be present, I added the Version and Package fields as well. Note that the Installed Size field is an estimated value, in KB, whereas the Size field is for the package file and is in bytes.\nExample:\napt-cache show blender | grep -E '^(.*Size|Version|Package)'\nPackage: blender\nVersion: 2.71~git201406121839.169c95b-0irie1~trusty1\nInstalled-Size: 140334\nSize: 39108640\nPackage: blender\nInstalled-Size: 63238\nVersion: 2.69-4ubuntu2\nSize: 18696012\n\nTo get a list of installed packages, see How to list all installed packages Essentially:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall\n\n\nA: I am a big fan of baobab to figure out where the big files are hidden.\nTo install:\nsudo apt-get install baobab\n\n\nA: Here is an answer which doesn't show directly asked packages info, it is covered in other answers in this thread, but though you will probably find helpful to have a list of what takes a lot of space on your file system.\nsudo du / -h|sort -n -r|less \nwill show you the biggest files of your / at the top of the screen. \nIt is generally related to looking for taken space,\n\nA: You can do this graphically in Synaptic. if it is not installed, Install it with the command:\nsudo apt install synaptic\n\nthen:\n\n\n*\n\n*First ensure that you enabled the Installed Size and Download size\ncolumns (or only one if you want that one).\n\n*To do this, go to Settings>Preferences and choose Columns and\nFonts, then tick the columns you want to see.\n\n*!Then click \"OK\".\n\n\nNow whenever you will search package It will show Download size and installed size.\n", "Q: How to set version numbers and package file names via dpkg-buildpackge for automated builds on a build server? Our build server builds ubuntu packages (*.deb) via dpkg-buildpackage. The server checks out the source code via git and runs the build via make <target>. The source directory contains the debian/ subdirectory where the dpkg configuration files are.\nI would like to add the internal build counter number to the current package version and further set the package file name but dpkg-buildpackage does not let me control how the resulting package_version_arch.deb looks like. How can I achieve this?\n\nA: Have a look at git-buildpackage:\n\nCustomizing snapshot numbers\nIf the auto incrementing of the snapshot number doesn't suite you needs you can give any python expression that evaluates to a positive integer to calculate the new snapshot number:\ngbp dch -S -a --snapshot-number=1  \ngbp dch -S -a --snapshot-number='snapshot + 2'\ngbp dch -S -a --snapshot-number='os.popen(\"git-log --pretty=oneline | wc -l\").readlines()[0]'\ngbp dch -S -a --snapshot-number=`git-log --pretty=oneline debian/0.3.3 | wc -l`\n\nYou can also add the snapshot-number calculation to gbp.conf:\n[DEFAULT]\nsnapshot-number = os.popen(\"git-log --pretty=oneline | wc -l\").readlines()[0]\n\n\n\nA: You can change the version number in the control file, sampkg/DEBIAN/control \nThe control file is the core of the Debian package; it contains all relevant metadata. Things such as package name, version, supported architectures, and dependencies are all included in this file. \nPackage: sampkg\nArchitecture: all\nEssential: no\nSection: web\nPriority: optional\nDepends: python (>=2.3)\nMaintainer: Swaminathan Mathivanan\nDescription: Sample package.\n\nAnd the final pkg name will be sampkg_1.0.0_all.deb\n", "Q: MySQL 5.6 depends on client 5.5 I've installed Mysql-(server/client)-5.6 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server\nbut for some programs I need mysql-client (automysqlbackup and postfix for example)   \nroot@server:~# apt-get install automysqlbackup                  \n automysqlbackup : Depends: mysql-client\n\nso:\nroot@server:~# apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server    \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n mysql-client : Depends: mysql-client-5.5 but it is not going to be installed\n mysql-server : Depends: mysql-server-5.5 but it is not going to be installed\n\nand:    \nroot@server:~# apt-get install mysql-client-5.6 mysql-server-5.6\n mysql-client-5.6 is already the newest version.\n mysql-server-5.6 is already the newest version.\n\nDo I need to install mysql-(server/client)-5.5 alongside 5.6?\n\nA: If automysqlbackup can work with mysql-client-5.6 (In other words, if it's binary compatible with mysql-client-5.6). \nIs possible to use equivs to create dummy packages for mysql-client, mysql-server.

If so, why am I unable to locate it?\n\nA: If you use NetworkManager to configure your wifi connections look in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections\nThere should be files in there for all your configured network connections.\n\nA: wpa_supplicant doesn't run with a conf. It's a daemon that communicates with your network manager using DBUS. You can see what's happening with wpa_cli which will show you the instructions being received by the daemon.\nThat's not to say you can not run with a configuration file, you can. But, Ubuntu doesn't use that configuration file at all. It's all remotely controlled through the DBUS api.\n\nA: The specific answer to the question \"Where is my wpa_supplicant.conf?\" is as follows:\nMethod 1:\nCopy a specimen file from /usr/share/doc/ to /etc  as per README instructions in line 262 in /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/README.Debian.gz :\n# copy the template to /etc/wpa_supplicant/\ncp /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/examples/wpa-roam.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\n# allow only root to read and write to file\nchmod 0600 /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nI found the README file- and the specimen files to create a wpa_supplicant.conf - with: \ndpkg -L wpasupplicant\n\nAbove answer produced from an Ubuntu 18.04 system.  \nMethod 2\nPut the following into a script, edit the directives with values specific to your setup, chmod 700 the file and execute it.  It's minimal, but should suit most use cases. This should do all the related grunt work to get your wpa_supplicant configured.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncat <<EOF> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\ncountry=GB\nap_scan=1\n\nnetwork={\n        ssid=\"SSIDNAME\"\n        psk=\"AP-WPA2-PASSWD-GOES-HERE\"\n}\nEOF\n\nchmod 0600 /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nusermod -G netdev -a pi\n\nsystemctl unmask wpa_supplicant.service\nsystemctl enable wpa_supplicant.service\nsystemctl start wpa_supplicant.service\n\nHope this helps you\n", "Q: Namenode format and starting the namenode in hadoop2.2.0 I am trying to install Single node configuration, I succeeded to certain point like downloading and unzipping the tar and editing all the configuration files, but faced problems when formatting the namenode.\nThe errors are:\n14/07/14 02:56:40 WARN fs.FileUtil: Failed to delete file or dir [/home/renu123/yarn/yarn_data/hdfs/namenode/current/seen_txid]: it still exists.\n14/07/14 02:56:40 WARN fs.FileUtil: Failed to delete file or dir [/home/renu123/yarn/yarn_data/hdfs/namenode/current/VERSION]: it still exists.\n14/07/14 02:56:40 WARN fs.FileUtil: Failed to delete file or dir [/home/renu123/yarn/yarn_data/hdfs/namenode/current/fsimage_0000000000000000000]: it still exists.\n14/07/14 02:56:40 WARN fs.FileUtil: Failed to delete file or dir [/home/renu123/yarn/yarn_data/hdfs/namenode/current/fsimage_0000000000000000000.md5]: it still exists.\n14/07/14 02:56:40 FATAL namenode.NameNode: Exception in namenode join\njava.io.IOException: Cannot remove current directory: /home/renu123/yarn/yarn_data/hdfs/namenode/current\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.common.Storage$StorageDirectory.clearDirectory(Storage.java:299)\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NNStorage.format(NNStorage.java:523)\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NNStorage.format(NNStorage.java:544)\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSImage.format(FSImage.java:147)\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNode.format(NameNode.java:837)\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNode.createNameNode(NameNode.java:1213)\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNode.main(NameNode.java:1320)\n14/07/14 02:56:40 INFO util.ExitUtil: Exiting with status 1\n14/07/14 02:56:40 INFO namenode.NameNode: SHUTDOWN_MSG: \n/************************************************************\nSHUTDOWN_MSG: Shutting down NameNode at ubuntu/127.0.1.1\n************************************************************/\n\nAfter searching on google I formatted namenode by switching to root account as below:\nroot@ubuntu:~/yarn/yarn_data/hdfs/namenode# hdfs namenode -format\nRe-format filesystem in Storage Directory /home/renu123/yarn/yarn_data/hdfs/namenode ?

Nice, but my AltGr does not work. The key I want to use for AltGr has keycode 134 (found out using xev). So I create a .Xmodmap file:\nkeycode 134 = ISO_Level3_Shift Multi_key ISO_Level3_Shift Multi_key\n\nthan I execute \"xmodmap .Xmodmap\". When I now show my modifier, I get:\n> xmodmap\nxmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):\n\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock      \ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        Alt_L (0x85),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3      \nmod4        Super_L (0x40),  Super_R (0x6c),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  ISO_Level3_Shift (0x86),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\n\nBut ... pressing AltGr (the key with code 134=0x86) + q does not give the expected result - which would be \"a-umlaut\".\nIt should! xmodmap -pke contains this line:\nkeycode  24 = q Q q Q adiaeresis Adiaeresis adiaeresi\n\nSo what is wrong and what can I do?\n\nA: According to the Xmodmap Manual, when you want to swap or change modifier keys you need to remove & clear their ties to their original keycodes and modifier groups.  Then after assigning them to a new keycode you must also assign them to a new, unique group.\nIt looks like the problem is that you've assigned two different modifiers to the same key: [ISO_Level3_shift] & [Mode_switch].  And you've also assigned them to the same modifier group.  The effect of assigning them to the same group is that: pressing one of them, activates/sends them both to the system.\n[ISO_Level3_shift] & [Mode_switch] are not synonymous.  Each of these keys is meant to provide access to a unique layer/level of the keyboard.  And when pressed together they can access even higher levels if your keyboard supports them.\nAnother potential complication is that on virtually all systems Xmodmap is running on top of xkb (which defines certain aspects of the underlying virtual keyboard).\n[Mode_switch] is synonymous with [AltGr] to Xmodmap providing access to level 2- that would be the second set of [q] & [Q] in your example.  Whereas [ISO_Level3_shift] provides access to level three- the [ä] & [Ä] in your example.\nBut since both keys share the same modifier group in your example they are both being pressed which is probably trying to access your highest level; but since there seems to be an error* you are probably either not getting any output, or some unexpected output coming from the underlying xkb.\nBasically you can fix this by changing your .xmodmap file.  Just assign [Level3_shift] & [Mode_switch] to separate keys and separate modifier groups.  Or, actually I would just recommend that you just remove the reference to Mode_switch altogether.  I have found it to behave rather oddly; the 3rd level shift key seems to behave more consistently and reliably.\n*-your second \"adiaeresi\" (sic.) is missing the final [s] so it wouldn't produce any character.\nI know this rather confusing and convoluted for no apparent reason, plus this thread is old.  But hopefully someone will find my explanation useful at some point!\n", "Q: USB port sniffing on Ubuntu 14.04 I am working on a project now and I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04.

If you think you've done that but you're seeing the same error, run killall soffice.bin and try again.\nIn terms of retaining the same name, it does that by default.\nunoconv -f csv filename.xls\n\nThat will create a filename.csv file. In my mind, this is really desirable because then you know the format of the file (and you won't try to do silly things by accident). And that works for wildcards too:\n$ ls *.xls\nie_data.xls  QTL_Sample_data.xls  WBC_FTTC_Price_List_Entry_16-Aug-10.xls\n\n$ unoconv -f csv *.xls \n\n$ ls *.csv\nie_data.csv  QTL_Sample_data.csv  WBC_FTTC_Price_List_Entry_16-Aug-10.csv\n\nSo you just need to get it up and running and it'll do what you want.\n", "Q: How to remove a third party software that is installed but cannot be located? I have been on Ubuntu 14.04 for a while now. I was looking for a DVD burning software because both Brasero and K3b proved quite unsatisfactory.

The Software Manager warned me that the application (Nero Linux) is of poor quality and can severely harm the computer. But since I desperately needed a DVD burner, I decided I would \"Try Ubuntu\" from the Ubuntu installation disc, install the Nero Linux within it and see how it goes. To my great relief, it worked so well that I decided to install it permanently. However, before doing so I wanted to make sure how to uninstall it -- in case something should go wrong.

I've been running Lucid NBR since forever and I love it. A recent kernel update broke some services and while a revision fixed them, the writing is on the wall, I have to update.\nUnity fits on my netbook like an elephant in a bucket, but I read on a Linux Mint forum that I can modify the buttons on the Unity launcher to make them bigger, in some way emulating the UNB launcher.\nCan someone tell me how I can do this?\nThe next step, of course is to get the launcher to show more launchers as its children. So, for example, I would have an electronics entry in the Unity launcher, and it would offer my electronics calculator, my circuit simulator, my schematics capture software and links to my parts suppliers and PCB manufacturers as a launcher. Similarly fo my programming stuff and my other applications. Is this possible? If so, can someone tell me how (in detail)?\nPogo (standing at the door and looking towards Linux Mint)\n\nA: The Appearances settings has a slider for the launcher icon size - and it can go pretty high, I think. My bad - it doesn't go very high (only about 25% more than the default):\n\nAs for the second part, as I understand it, you want one launcher icon to do multiple things or you want multiple launcher icons added by you? For the former, you might have to create a custom desktop file and add actions to it. There is a detailed guide available at the Ubuntu help centre. \nEssentially, it boils down to having multiple actions in the desktop file, with each action having its own Exec field, where you can put whatever command you want. For the latter, you just have to drop a desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications/ - this is also mentioned in the help centre article linked above. I'm not adding a detailed guide here, since it would essentially involve me doing CtrlA, CtrlC, CtrlV. :)\nHere's a sample file I tried out (in GNOME Shell, but it should work in Unity as well).\nFinally, nothing prevents you from installing Cinnamon on Ubuntu.

However, after booting ubuntu after doing the above, the screen just went blank.\nAfter further checking, I found /sys/class/backlight folder is empty, and I have not been able to add a folder even under root permissions.\n\nA: Sys is special, you won't be able to create folders there (answers in linked question explain why). Per Fabby's answer to similar question, that would indicate Kernel thinks you have a CRT, therefore you have knobs to adjust brightness and contrast. You may want to search supported hardware to see whether yours is there, or file a bug against kernel.\n", "Q: Problem with partitioning I have a problem trying to partition my hard drive.\nI recently installed Ubuntu, to find out if I have a problem with the internet connection on my PC, since the Windows I was using couldn't connect to the local area.\nAfter I deleted Windows and installed Ubuntu I didn't select partitions and just installed it.

How can I do that?\nThis is in particular the sequence of command that I need to run:\nvirginia@asus-F552CL:~$ cd MT7630E_Wi-Fi_BT_Source_Release_20140625/rt2x00/\nvirginia@asus-F552CL:~/MT7630E_Wi-Fi_BT_Source_Release_20140625/rt2x00$ sudo su\n[sudo] password for virginia: \nroot@asus-F552CL:/home/virginia/MT7630E_Wi-Fi_BT_Source_Release_20140625/rt2x00# ./load.sh\nroot@asus-F552CL:/home/virginia/MT7630E_Wi-Fi_BT_Source_Release_20140625/rt2x00# exit\nvirginia@asus-F552CL:~/MT7630E_Wi-Fi_BT_Source_Release_20140625/rt2x00$ \n\n\nA: Since you've mentioned having to do sudo su, I assume that you want these commands to be executed after login.\nTo do so, you'll have to put your commands in a script file, say, myCom.sh. The contents would look like below:\ncd MT7630E_Wi-Fi_BT_Source_Release_20140625/rt2x00/\necho myPassword | sudo -S su && sudo su -c ./load.sh\n\nNote that exit is not required as each command is run as root and script returns back after completion.\nAlso \"myPassword\" is to be provided in plain-text.\nThen Use KDE/ Ubuntu's startup manager to start this script. Or you could place this file directly in ~/.profile.\nOn the other hand, if you want to run these commands on startup rather than login, you could use init scripts. You'll not have to use sudo su there as everything will run in root context.\n\nA: You can modify your /etc/rc.local file that is executed as last service at run level startup sequence and it grants root permission.\nHere is an example:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\ncd /home/virginia/MT7630E_Wi-Fi_BT_Source_Release_20140625/rt2x00\n/bin/bash load.sh\nexit 0\n\nVerify your change with this command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/rc.local start\n\nPlease note the following points:\n\n\n*\n\n*load.sh will run as root\n\n*the environment is restricted, so you may need to define missing variables\n\n*if you want to log into syslog, use logger \"message\"\nIf is possible I suggest you to execute your script like this:\n  /bin/bash /home/virginia/MT7630E_Wi-Fi_BT_Source_Release_20140625/rt2x00/load.sh\n\nOn Ubuntu runlevel start when filesystem and static-network-up event occurs. If you need to start load.sh at particular event, than is better define upstart task.\n", "Q: OEM version of ubuntu 14.04 I was wondering if there is an OEM version of Ubuntu like that of windows which has nothing but the necessities to operate.

I have a relatively powerful computer (8gb ram, 64bit, quad core) and I can easily drive three monitors, my tv over hdmi, my 17 inch hd internal laptop display, and an external hd display. I have (literally) 8 laptops, and only one vga port on my main one, and my tv is impossible to use much of the time. I really like the idea of using my wireless (all of my computers have it) to link them all and display all six of my desktops on my computer at once, or just have a 6 monitor extended desktop. How would I achieve this? I don't just want them to share my cursor, I want to be able to drag windows between them, too.\n\nA: Basic way.\nIf sshd is installed on your laptops you can connect with them with ssh -X from the central one. Once you have done you can run each graphic program and the graphical output will be redirected to your main one.\nMore complex one.\nWith NoMachine e.g., server and client, you can connect to a remote computer as if you where connected directly. It's a remote desktop as many other. So from your central computer you can connect to all your laptop, maybe one for desktop. \nTo exchange windows from one computer to another... I suppose for this you need to create a something like a grid with all cloned machine (probably you can realize with virtual machines...). I see it a little bit more challenging. \n", "Q: problem to update bash profile Each time i work with a tool named criu, i set the path variable:\n PATH=$PATH:/home/th/criu-1.3-rc2; export PATH\n\nto be able to run \ncriu dump\n\nbut when I close the terminal and open it, it does not work\ni update the :\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/th/criu-1.3-rc2'  >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nbut the same problem persists \n\nA: Update your .bashrc instead of .bash_profile that is used only for bash in interactive mode.\nHere is a useful explanation.\n", "Q: Can't connect to computer via VNC running x11vnc I've got a desktop computer and a laptop, both running Ubuntu 14.04.

My setup process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu USB drive trial, shrink the Ubuntu partition and create NTFS partition, restart\n\n*Boot to Win7 CD, install, reboot, log into Win7 fine, restart\n\n*Boot to Ubuntu USB drive trial, run Boot-Repair, restart\n\n\nNow I get a Grub menu on startup, and can get into Ubuntu no problem.  However, trying to access Win7 results in a blank 'purple' screen (color of Grub screen), although I can hear the 'startup music' of Windows 7.\nIf I boot off the Windows CD again, and run \"bootrec /fixboot\" from the command line, then I am able to reboot, choose Win7 in Grub, and get into it correctly.  HOWEVER, if at any point I go back into Ubuntu, then afterwards I run into the same problem above when trying to access Win7 unless I repeat the CD boot/bootrec step first.\nAny ideas as to why accessing my Ubuntu partition keeps rendering my Win7 partition non-accessible?\nFURTHER INFO: I tested, and it is not the selection to boot from Ubuntu that causes the subsequent Windows boot to fail.  If I do two back-to-back Windows boots, the one after the CD boot/bootrec works (via a \"Boot to safe mode or normally\" menu), and then the next one fails.\n\nA: As it turns out on further experimentation, the problem was that I had not yet installed the official graphics drivers for Windows 7 after the initial install.  As far as I can tell, the handoff from GRUB to Windows 7 screws up the use of the very basic default graphic drivers to display.\nBut, as it turns out, if I did anything that would result in the system displaying the \"Boot from Safe Mode or Normally\" menu, or if I powered off and powered back on and then re-accessed Windows, prompting it to try and resume its previous session, the default graphics drivers were able to take over and work.  I was able to use this to get in long enough to install the system-specific graphics drivers, after which it booted repeatedly with no problems.\nI'm leaving this here for anyone who has the same problem (or wants to investigate why this happens in the GRUB-Win7 handoff).\n\nA: It seems that grub is not making the display available to windows 7 in the way it'd expect, so windows 7 doesn't think there is a display connected. Try going into ubuntu and installing burg, I've found that it has much better support for windows based systems than grub\n", "Q: Ubuntu on a new HDD? Is there anyway possible to install Ubuntu on a new, blank hard drive, if yes can someone please tell me how?\nMy laptop broke and after I bought a new HDD which is a 2.5 SATA, I've asked people that I know who can provide me with a copy of windows 7 but none of them can, so I would like to get this OS on my laptop for some time.\n\nA: This should not be any special case unless I'm missing something. 2.5 inch SATA should fit into your laptop and you should be able to boot it (assuming laptop is not completely broke.) Then simply pop-in your Ubuntu CD and install.\nNote: You may have to choose \"CD\" as first media in bios settings.\nAlso choose \"Use entire disk\" during installation. Ubuntu will take care of partitioning for you. \nHere's a useful link!\n\nA: Just do a normal installation, pretty much just google \"how to install ubuntu\". Just boot the cd, select \"install now\", select \"use entire disk\" and then just follow the prompts. BTW, Welcome to Linux!\n\nA: download iso image completly free on a running computer from here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nburn the iso on empty CD DVD, or create a bootable USB stick :\nhttp://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/\nafter that is easy install:\nRegards,\n\nA: If you swap old and new drives in your laptop you will be done with installation easily like a charm. \nHowever if you add new drive as a second one, then pay attention  what drive/partition you install to. Especially take into account that in case of two physical drives you will need to consider what is the best of the drives to keep GRUB boot loader. \nBecause when it is placed on the different from new Ubuntu holding drive you would have some issues if you later would like to disconnect a drive containing MBR.\n", "Q: Error message at startup I just installed Ubuntu on my Gateway NE56R41u yesterday. Infact, it dual-boots with Windows 8.1 UEFI, but that has nothing to do with my problem. However, when I turn on my computer, I get an error message that displays for about a second. I don't know what it means, though and it displays for less than a second. Tell me, does it mean anything important? How do I fix it? Also, regardless of if it's important or not or if it is fixable, how can I prevent the message from displaying when I turn my computer on? The error is below:\n[10.987] info @wl_cfg80211_attach CFG80211 Phy\n\n\nA: Overall, that is just a report that it issues while it hasn't loaded the boot screen, if you press any of the f(#) buttons you will see the boot log, and you will see a lot more of those. It is not an error, it is just a report in the log that it successfully loaded a particular sector/file.

The computer is currently running 64-bit window 7, which I plan to dual boot with Ubuntu.  I downloaded the iso image, burned the image to a DVD, and booted from it.  The installation process gets to the purple screen with the word Ubuntu in the middle and the flashing dots below the Ubuntu word.  I waited for over 1/2 hour and the screen still shows the same image. I noticed the Ubuntu download web page also offers a Mac 64-bit version that says \"(AMD)\".  Do I need to use the MAC version instead of the regular 64-bit version given the fact that my computer has an AMD Athlon 64 CPU?\n\nA: Try redownloading the image and reburning it, I've had the problem before and it really usually just needs to be remade.

Currently using Ubuntu and Windows 7 duel install. I am wondering if there is an easy way to switch operating systems without having to keep shutting down my computer and turning it back on.\n\nA: Unless you run one in a virtual machine, no. An OS needs exclusive rights to the entire cpu and root device, and if you tried to boot them simultaneously then they would completely crash the moment one of them issued an instruction after the other had, as the cpu is only meant to handle one kernel thread.

It used to do everything in Windows XP and is fairly new. I don't want to run Windows any more. SANE says the MX890 is complete but maybe the MX892 is a completely different creature.\nFinally I decided I will go out and buy a scanner that has a \"complete\" rating from SANE with the exact same model number. At Office Depot there was a Canoscan Lide 210 so I bought it because it has the \"complete\" rating On Simple Scan it scans but I just get a light gray blank image. I installed Xsane using the package manager and it does the same thing. I'd be willing to take it back and get an HP or a Epson if I knew it would plug and play and was locally available at Office Max, Office Depot,Best Buy etc.. But not all of HP or Epson get a complete rating from SANE. Therefore I'm afraid I'll be in the same situation.\nI'm new to Ubuntu. I have it on 2 computers. I've managed to run Netflix and enable the cube. I've done a little in the terminal but this scanner thing and back ends etc has me lost at the moment. Canon does not have a driver. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04. If I have to do something in terminal it will have to be step by step and hopefully not too complicated. I guess that's all for now. Hopefully someone can shed some light on this and offer a simple solution.\n\nA: I just found the answer to my own question. I did an internet search on the Canon Lide 210 and blank gray image and I found this. Someone stated that on the underside of the machine is on the outside is a simple mechanical lock. Just slide it to unlock and it will stop putting out blank gray scans and start scanning. Now for how well it scans I'm not sure I just got it working. What a relief. Oh well at least it is solved. I've had time to try it out and it works great. Problem solved.\n\nA: I had the same thing happen to me; I was getting black pages when I scanned.  However, the scanner had worked before.  I checked, and the lock switch was not \"off.\"  It also scanned the same way (black pages) through Adobe Acrobat (\"Scan Document\" function) as well as with the Canon software.  My colleague has the exact same scanner and when I plugged hers in, same result (BLACK PAGES).\nI was also getting an intermittent error message requesting that I turn off the lock button, unplug the USB, and plug it back in.  Even when I switched it off & on, and unplugged / re-plugged, it still gave the error message a few times, then scanned black pages.\nI had our IT guy take a look at it, and what it ended up being was, the scanner was plugged in through a USB hub, and somehow that was what was preventing it from working right.  I plugged it into an empty USB slot on the back of my computer, and it worked just fine again.

I have (sitting right next to this laptop on which I am typing this answer) a Canon MG-2570 (scanner + printer). Why am I telling you that? Because I had to install special drivers to get the Canon MG-2570 to work on my Xubuntu 14.04.\nI checked the Canon site and your Canoscan Lide 210 does not have any Linux drivers for it. It is supported \"out-of-the-box\" by Linux, as you already know.\nYou should look at this thread on Ubuntu Forums: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2015354\nI will summarize it for you: install xsane (sudo apt-get install xsane)\nThat will help you scan whatever it is you are trying to scan. Ppl have reported that they got \"black\" scans initially, but things \"settled down\" after some time and they got scans that they liked/desired.\nAt the same time, there seem to be bugs with the drivers. Essentially, only the following resolution/colour depth settings seem working:\n- 600 dpi 8 bit colour\n- 1200 dpi 8 bit colour\n- 1200 dpi 16 bit colour\nMore information about that here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sane-backends/+bug/996741?\nIf any of that helps, let us know.\nEnjoy your new scanner.\n\nA: I had the same problem with Canon LiDE 120.

Did you follow the instructions on their site?\nIf yes (you installed mopidy with apt-get install ...): mopidy has been installed as a service and therefore is started whenever you start your system. So, the process monitoring your ports 6600/6680 is actually mopidy. Just configure your local music source (some local directory in which you have some music) and then make mopidy rescan your local source. You should be up-n-running after that.\nIf not (you installed mopidy not with apt-get, but in some other way): specify details of installation so we may have a clue about what's going on.\nReading the fine manual (RTFM) may help. :)\nHTH!\n", "Q: Installed Ubuntu 14.04 to external drive on Windows 8 system. Now can't boot windows without external disk attached? I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on an external USB disk drive from a Windows 8 system. If I reboot the system with the external disk attached then I can successfully boot Ubuntu or Windows 8. The instructions I was following seemed to indicate that upon removing the external disk drive Windows would just boot as before. However I now get a Grub prompt (GNU GRUB version 2.02~beta2-9) at which I'm not sure how to boot Windows. Does this mean I always have to have the external disk drive attached when I want to boot Windows? I was hoping this wasn't the case. How can I allow Windows to boot as before without the external drive attached but when the drive is attached allow Ubuntu to be booted? \nAny help gratefully receive and many thanks.\nSteve\n\nA: That is happening because you put grub on the other disk, but it still removed the bootloader on the internal disk. Try running \"sudo update-grub /dev/sd(what ever the name of the internal drive, mine is sda)\n\nA: You should be able to set things up the way you want.  Your machine is UEFI, so to boot an Ubuntu system of USB, you should set up the USB with its own EFI partition (300M, FAT32, flagged bootable), and specify that PARTITION to the installer (might or might not work, specifying the device has NEVER worked for me). \nAnyway, check after the installation, and if the USB's EFI partition is empty, just copy it from the hard disk's EFI.  Now, the USB default bootloader is not indicated by some nvram entry in the firmware, so NOTHING needs to be changed on the Windows side (other that selecting USB before hard disk, and maybe adding some boot delay to give yourself a chance to hit a function key).  The USB bootloader is /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi.   For a non-secure boot, that file should be a copy of the unsiged grubx64.efi.  For secure boot, bootx64.efi should be a copy of the shimx64.efi file, and the signed version of grubx64.efi should be present in /EFI/Boot too.  The grub.cfg file should be in/EFI/ubuntu`, and that should automatically boot when the USB is present.\nNow, what you have may be a nvram entry in first place (after USB) in the bootorder pointing to the hard disk's /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi, trying to run a config file off the (non-present) USB.  That entry is just wrong - delete it!  efibootmgr on the Ubuntu side will allow that, or maybe a Windows program can do the same thing.  The first entry for the hard disk should be for Windows.  \nNow without the USB, Windows should just run.  With the USB, the USB's /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi should run and boot grub.\n", "Q: Extremely slow ACPI Event Propagation A follow up to my previous question here: Run a Script when Power Button is Pushed\nSo I am able to detect ACPI events and I intercept the power button press appropriately, however there is an indeterminate amount of time between the power button being pressed and the script actually running. In some cases, there is a minute-long delay between when I physically push the button and when the script gets run. In others, the script runs almost immediately after I press the button. \nWhat could cause such a delay in the event propagation?\n\nA: Running /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xfce4/notifyd/xfce4-notifyd fixed it for me.\nI had been getting this on Ubuntu 20.04.\nThe cause was the notification daemon not running.

For that, ESC at the beginning of the boot. After: e (to edit). At the end of the line which start by \"Linux...\", add nomodeset after \"quiet splash\". Then F10.\nNormally, you be be able to boot. If you want to keep nomodeset for the next boot, you need is to \"add nomodeset to the end of GRUB_LINUX_CMDLINE_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub and then run sudo update-grub\", as hal7df explained to you.\nBut maybe the best idea is to desinstall fglrx. I have also a AMD HD8670M in hybrid video card, on Ubuntu 14.04, without fglrx.

When the GUI comes up, open Files app> Other Locations >Computer> Boot> Grub, and look for the grub.cfg file. \nOpen a Terminal and type:\nsudo chmod 777\n\nThen drag the grub.cfg file into the terminal window. Press enter. This changes the file's permission to R/W.\nOpen the grub.cfg file, and look for the [menuentry 'ubuntu'] line. Below this is the [load_video] line. After this line, add\n   outb 0x728 1\n   outb 0x710 2\n   outb 0x740 2\n   outb 0x750 0\n\nA few lines below that is the Linux kernel line. After 'quiet splash' add\n i915.lvds_channel_mode=2 i915.modeset=1 i915.lvds_use_ssc=0\n\nWhich should give you something like this\nThis allows you to edit the grub to turn of the dGPU and switch into the iGPU.\nSave the file, and do this in Terminal:\nsudo chmod 444\n\nthen drag the grub file into the terminal window. If you haven't closed terminal yet, just issue the last sudo chmod command by pressing the up key and change 777 to 444, and this changes the file's permissions back to read-only. \nThis assumes you didn't reboot to test if it works.\nReboot the computer. Ideally, if you did things right, it should boot directly into Ubuntu, bypassing the grub entry altogether. You can still access the grub menu by pressing option/alt.\nIn my case, I did add [nomodeset] after quiet splash without adding the [outb] operands the first time around since I was basically shooting in the dark, trying everything I can just to be able to boot up into a desktop to install Ubuntu. The key (at least in this case) is editing the grub.cfg file of your install to include the outb and i915.lvds operands.\n", "Q: qBittorrent randomly shuts down?

Now that I have a few audio books, it would be a lot easier to automate the process explicitly with a bash script or any other solution.\nSimply doing a Ctrl-A and Ctrl-V results in different files being copied and pasted at different times to the music folder.

For instance for root:root I'd see:\nroot (root)\nBut on my new install I only see this in the owner column, when the files are owned by me:\n(group) (the actual group name in actuality)\nDoing ls -al in terminal in the same folders will show the correct user for the owner column.\nWhat could be the reason I'm only seeing the group name in parentheses now, in the owner column in Thunar? And how, if at all possible, can I fix this?\n\nA: The owner column in Thunar (in a fresh install in an up-to-date Arch Linux setup, as well as in Ubuntu 14.04) uses the Full Name (username) format, where the \"Full Name\" is taken from the GECOS data for the user. If the GECOS data is empty, it just shows (user). Most system/package-created users (like root, nobody, pulse, etc.) have something in the GECOS name field (root, nobody and PulseAudio daemon respectively). So system files will likely have a complete entry in the owner column.\n", "Q: is the hp business notebook 8510p adequate to run Ubuntu?

Problems may arise with DVD and TV support - those activities depends on GPU also, which is probably very weak in your case. It does not mean, that watching movies will be impossible, but stuttering may occur.\nYou can try one of the lightweight Ubuntu versions like Xbuntu or Lubuntu, but from my experience, they are slightly less user-friendly than default Gnome version, and don't not make significant difference in the performance.\n", "Q: When installing packages (particularly those with graphical UIs) how do you determine which is fitting for your distribution? I'm having a hard time understanding the dependencies of software on (the combination of) Ubuntu distributions, desktop environments, window managers, file managers and what have you.\nWhat I'm particularly worried about is that I might install software that doesn't play nice with any of the aforementioned processes and that it messes up those processes and/or uses different config files, spread in different locations, etc.\nCould you give a short overview of what elementary knowledge, about the architecture of linux systems, is needed to determine whether a software package is suitable for a particular set-up?\n\nA: Here's a quick overview of the Desktop Environments available:\nDE\n├── Enlightenment\n├── GNOME2 -> MATE\n├── GNOME3\n│   ├── Cinnamon\n│   │   └── Muffin\n│   ├── Gnome-Shell\n│   │   └── Mutter\n│   └── Unity\n│       └── compiz\n├── KDE\n├── LXDE\n├── MATE\n└── XFCE\n\nGnome (both the erstwhile GNOME2 [now MATE] and GNOME3) and KDE are comprehensive suites, with components tightly integrated with each other. They can include a lot of things, even office suites. Enlightenment, XFCE and LXDE considerably lighter and have fewer apps under their respective umbrellas. Some rules of thumb:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you install something from the heavyweight DEs, be prepared to have half the DE dragged in. This is very much component dependent - some lower-level components do not depend on a lot of things. For example: \n\n*\n\n*Gnome3 has three major shells that I know of - Unity, Gnome Shell and Cinnamon (developed by the friendly devs at Linux Mint) and two file explorers (Nautilus and Nemo). In the old days, Nemo used to depend on the Cinnamon shell itself, so you had to install it along with Nemo even if you didn't use it.\n\n*Installing yakuake (a drop-down terminal) one my Gnome3-based setup drags in about 60 packages (and 301 on a headless server). For comparison, Terminator (an independent terminal) needed 2 (and 144 on the same headless server).\n\n\n*The lighter DEs have a much sparser feature set. LXDE doesn't even have its own Window Manager that I am aware of (it uses OpenBox). \n\n*In general, GNOME apps are developed in GTK, and KDE apps in Qt. Enlightenment apps use the EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries).\n\n*In general, things should work even if you mix and match. Especially with XFCE and LXDE, you should have no problem using their components in the other DEs. \n\n*There might be themeing issues. These are the biggest headaches - every now and then you can see a question here asking how to get back the old look after installing kde-desktop on a standard Ubuntu. You can look around the answers to find out what goes where.\n\n\nA: You shouldn't worry about it. The packaging system will take care of dependencies. Some apps will integrate with your desktop better than others, and you may have extra config systems, but nothing should break.\n", "Q: How add a network printer with command line to Ubuntu 14.04 Description:\nIn MAAS i need a node with a network printer , so I need some command to add in JUJU install to add network printer .\nIf there is a solution let me know.\nThanks\n\nA: I found solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install  lpadmin\n\n*using lpadmin commands to add default printer \n\n*here are useful links:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/cups.html\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1423730\n\n\n*There is another solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://pdfbox.apache.org/\n", "Q: eth0 NO-CARRIER, ifconfig shows no IP address I left Ubuntu and came back after a while so I don't remember much.

I am now on Mint 13, which is better, but just had 2 crashes in 12 hours, one while the machine was locked.\nI am starting to think maybe the GPU is the problem, so i wanted to check the temp. I used inxi -F and found the idle temp at 47-48, so a bit high but not necessarily a problem.\nI was checking that regularly, because of all the crashes I have had recently, and later when I was using a lot of resources, I found the sensor no longer provides any feedback, I mean, in the readout, the gpu temp is now gone, doesn't appear.\nSo that worried me, so I used this: sudo service module-init-tools start.

am in a really bad condition right now.I am jotting down the steps I did to get myself into this situation.\nMy objective was to disable sudo on my machine.\nI am running Amazon Ec2 Ubuntu 12.04\n\n\n*\n\n*I used this command to create a root password.\nsudo passwd\n\nAt this moment I was 'ubuntu' user.\n\n*I edited my /etc/sudoers file using nano and did the following.\n#ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL----This enabled no password\nubuntu ALL=(ALL) ALL---this enables password\n\nSo my file looked like (before I exited)\n#ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n#ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL----This enabled no password\nubuntu ALL=(ALL) ALL---this enables password\n\nNow when I use the sudo command I get the following error which is obvious as I messed up the file:\nubuntu@ip-10-144-143-249:~$ sudo\nsudo: >>> /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloudimg-ubuntu: syntax error near line 4 <<<\nsudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloudimg-ubuntu near line 4\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\nsudo: unable to initialize policy plugin\n\nBut when I use these commands su ,su root, it asks me for password which I setup in Step 1.\nBut every time I put the password in I get an authentication failure message despite being 100% sure I am giving the correct password:\nubuntu@ip-10-144-143-249:~$ su\nPassword:\nsu: Authentication failure\n\nI don't know what to do know.I checked for few solutions over the web and one of the way suggested to detach and reattach the volume.This can be done but as this is a production environment a lot of problem would arise.\nIs there a way/hack which can be done so that I can get the sudo operations working??\n\nA: Rahul, first of all you should repair the sudoers file.\ncreate a sudoers file on desktop ans paste these lines into it:\n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults    env_reset\nDefaults    mail_badpass\nDefaults    secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nOK, now you have to replace your original sudoers file with the new file, use ctrl + F1 to switch to a tty, try to became root and type \nmv /home/RAHUL/Desktop/sudoers /etc/sudoers \n\nIF you can't become root user, then you have to boot from live Ubuntu and then follow above steps.\n\nA: Here is what I did To solve this Problem-\n\n\n*\n\n*Launched a same Hardware Like (the one that was messed up) instance.\n\n*Stop the messed uo instance.\n\n*ssh the complete ubuntu folder (Which had all the files needed).\n\n*Started the replica Server and ensured that everything worked fine.(We use Mongo ,Mysql,Tomcat and Java).\n\n*Once done I detached the elastic IP used for the messed up instance and attached to the replica instace.\n\n\nVoila Now you have a new running instance with the same config and IP.\nTime taken 30 mins.\n\nA: You are putting the wrong password. sudo passwd is changing the password of the root user, not the password required to sudo. In addition, the root account is usually locked in ubuntu, so you cannot become root via su or su root, see here.\nWhatever you did to 90-cloudimg-ubuntu is probably not related to the authentication failure. Are you sure that ubuntu ALL=(ALL) ALL---this enables password is syntactically correct? For a start, comments would begin with #.\nTo prevent any user from executing sudo, remove all users from the sudo group in /etc/group. Do you plan to log in as root afterwards?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Pulseaudio in HDMI sound crackling I've recently change my PC OS from MS to Ubuntu.\nUbuntu 14.04 can correctly find my HDMI audio but with terrible echo and crackling sound.\nI fix the echo issue by following the guide here: Sound problems in Ubuntu 14.04, and Static and crackling in my HDMI audio?.

I needed two PCs, one on Ubuntu and another on Arch, to sync files through Unison but ran into the same permission denied error. Just for the sake of those who are having the same problem as I was, here's what I did:\nFirst: Installed the same version of Unison on both PCs. This was a bit challenging as the one available on the software center was behind to what was readily available for Arch. So, I couldn't find a higher version for Ubuntu, so I replaced the one on Arch with a lower one instead. Found one here: http://zdia.de/downloads/unison-2.40.102-linux-x86_64. The same version is in the software center for Ubuntu.\nSecond: Followed the steps from here:\nhttps://www.howtoforge.com/setting-up-unison-file-synchronization-between-two-servers-on-debian-squeeze\n(Note: Arch was my server 1 and Ubuntu was my server 2.)\nI ran into a problem in step 3 as I tried to ssh-copy. But it was resolved by changing \"id_dsa.pub\" into \"id_rsa.pub\" in the \"ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.pub root@192.168.0.101\" line. Probably my fault, as I think I forgot to add \"-t dsa\". Anyway, try the original command first. IF you get an error, then change to rsa.\nAfter following the steps above, I found I still couldn't get Unison to connect to the other server, neither can I log in (without Unison) through ssh to the other server. Finally,after hours of google searching, I was led to this page, and the answer given my Muru sealed the deal.\nAfter applying it, I could now login via SSH to server 2.\nSo I ran Unison, and corrected the profile settings, and viola!\n\nA: TL;DR and like to code in sed to circumvent permission denied in ssh\nsed -i s/#\\(PermitRootLogin*\\).*/\\1 yes/ /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n\nA: I faced similar issue with qemu login.\nOne of the issues could be that authorized_keys on the remote machine does not match with the host machine's key from where you are trying to login.\nCopying the id_rsa.pub from host to authorized_keys of the remote PC should help.\n", "Q: Spell Check Error in LibreOffice - Ubuntu 12.04 Spell library package already installed in Ubuntu 12.04, even though LibreOffice is not able to find out Spelling errors in a file.\nHow can I fix this?

These were bogus  certificates. See this article on EFF:\n\nOn March 15th, an HTTPS/TLS Certificate Authority (CA) was tricked into issuing fraudulent certificates that posed a dire risk to Internet security. Based on currently available information, the incident got close to — but was not quite — an Internet-wide security meltdown. As this post will explain, these events show why we urgently need to start reinforcing the system that is currently used to authenticate and identify secure websites and email systems.\nThere is a post up on the Tor Project's blog by Jacob Appelbaum, analyzing the revocation of a number of HTTPS certificates last week. Patches to the major web browsers blacklisted a number of TLS certificates that were issued after hackers broke into a Certificate Authority. Appelbaum and others were able to cross-reference the blacklisted certificates' serial numbers against a comprehensive collection of Certificate Revocation Lists (these CRL URLs were obtained by querying EFF's SSL Observatory databases) to learn which CA had been affected.\nThe answer was the UserTrust \"UTN-USERFirst-Hardware\" certificate owned by Comodo, one of the largest CAs on the web. Comodo has now published a statement about the improperly issued certs, which were for extremely high-value domains including google.com, login.yahoo.com and addons.mozilla.org (this last domain could be used to trojan any system that was installing a new Firefox extension, though updates to previously installed extensions have a second layer of protection from XPI signatures). One cert was for \"global trustee\" — not a domain name. That was probably a malicious CA certificate that could be used to flawlessly impersonate any domain on the Web.\n\n", "Q: SDL app code arm linaro cannot find -lSDL I'm using gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.8-2014.04_linux to cross compile the following SDL code. usingubuntu-14.04\n#include \"SDL/SDL.h\" \n\n\n\n\nint main( int argc, char* args[] ) {\n//The images \nSDL_Surface* hello = NULL; \nSDL_Surface* screen = NULL;\n\n//Start SDL \nSDL_Init( SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING ); \n//Set up screen\nscreen = SDL_SetVideoMode( 640, 480, 32, SDL_SWSURFACE ); \n//Load image\nhello = SDL_LoadBMP( \"Canada-Flag.bmp\" );\n\n\n//Apply image to screen\nSDL_BlitSurface( hello, NULL, screen, NULL ); \n//Update Screen SDL_Flip( screen ); \n//Pause \nSDL_Delay( 2000 );\n\n\n\n\n//Free the loaded image \nSDL_FreeSurface( hello ); \n//Quit SDL \nSDL_Quit();\nreturn 0; \n} \n\nI'm compiling the code by using the following command.\narm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -o /home/samples/display1 /home/samples/display1.c -lSDL\n\nfollowing is the error whai i get it after that.\n/usr/lib/gcc-cross/arm-linux-gnueabihf/4.8/../../../../arm-linux-gnueabihf/bin/ld:  cannot find -lSDL collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nBut the same code if i compile it for the host computer with.\ngcc -o /home/samples/display1 /home/samples/display1.c -lSDL\n\nit gives no errors and works well.\nPlease can you suggest.\n\nA: You are missing the setup of the link path, like: -L/path/to/libswithsdl then -lSDL\nexample:\narm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc -I./thirdparty/sdl/include -L./thirdparty/sdl/lib ./src/main.c -o ./out/main\n\nthe lib folder must contain the .so files so you are just adding to the search path, this will be fine for linking.\nYou need to make sure to have the lib on the target, either push it with the executable, use rpath or set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include that search path\n", "Q: Fresh linux installed boot I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 via USB on a 500GB HDD and I also have an old HDD of 40GB.\nI erased everything and now I only have Ubuntu installed, but on the Loading Operating System windows it give me an error saying grub rescue.\nI searched for solutions but I am kind of a noob and I didn't solve this.\nNow I am on the USB trying linux because I can not enter the installed one.\n\nA: Boot from your USB drive and reinstall grub onto your boot device with\ngrub-install /dev/sda\n\n", "Q: Wireless mouse not working in 14.04 I have a HP X3500 Wireless mouse.

I found a theme that I wish to run, and it says that is is meant to run on Gnome 3.12. It says:\n\nImportant note: This theme is designed for Gnome 3.12. May or may not work with other versions of Gnome-shell and GTK.\n\nFirst of all, the difference between Gnome and GTK is fairly blurry to me still. From what I understand, GTK is the toolkit for which Gnome is built with. I also am not even sure that Ubuntu uses Gnome in any form. Doesn't Ubuntu use Unity instead of Gnome? Or does it use Unity AND some Gnome stuff? I do see some miscellaneous packages in Synaptic that look like Gnome-*.\nAnyway, I want to use this theme on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. My OS is up-to-date, and I have recently ran sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade which I believe upgrades all packages to their most recent version.\nHowever, the libgtk-3-0, libgtk-3-common and libgtk-3-bin packages says that I am running 3.10.8. Shouldn't the libgtk stuff be 3.12 since I ran the sudo apt-get upgrade command?\nHow do I update GTK and/or GNOME so that I can use this theme?\nTheme: Zukitwo on Gnome-Look.org\nPlease note I am using a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 LTS install (not Ubuntu GNOME). I have not installed any desktop environments, which means I am using Unity. Everything is up-to-date according to Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: The Gnome Team have a ppa which has Gnome 3.12 in it.\nPlease note last time I looked, a few months ago it was not ready for general use.\nTo install Gnome alongside Unity you need to run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-deskop\n\nYou will need to select and use the GDM desktop manager when asked to choose.\nEDIT: At least as of 2014-08-26, there is a version conflict in dependencies for gnome-control-center and ubuntu-control-center (for versions of gnome-settings-daemon).  They will not live side by side happily unless you install an older version of gnome.\n", "Q: How to disable automount of an harddrive? I am working on a project, and for this I need to disable the aumounting of hard-drives in Ubuntu both at startup and when I plug an hard-drive.\nI tried one solution with \"edit-conf\" disabling automount at org.gnome.desktop.media-handling but when I plug a hardrive ubuntu still mounts it an open a window even when I restart the computer in between.\nThere is also the fstab solution but the thing is I don't know in advance the UUID of the drive I don't want to mount automatically.\nFrom want I understand there is the solution of editing an udev rule, but i'm not a specialist of that.\n\nA: Run these two commands:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount 'false'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount-open 'false'\nOr you can try it with a udev rule:\nsudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/85-no-automount.rule\nPaste this line SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ENV{UDISKS_AUTO}=\"0\" and save the file.\nReboot the system.\n\nA: You can try to add the module to the blacklist:\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nadd:\n\nblacklist usb-storage\n\nor\necho \"blacklist usb-storage\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nEnabling it later should just be:\nsudo modprobe usb-storage\n\nA: As Pabi wrote in his answer, run this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount 'false'\n\nBUT: this will probably not be effective until the next reboot.\nLack of a reboot caused me to doubt the effectiveness of gsettings initially.  I found it when being very thorough in preparation for filing a bug, which I found I didn't need to do.  I've only tried this under sudo, however, so if you still have trouble, try doing it that way.  I want this effective system-wide and found this does the job.\nYou do not need to touch automount-open because it only applies when an automount happens, and you will have disabled that.\n", "Q: Double desktop problem in Ubuntu I am new to Ubuntu.

I tried to install lubuntu onto a xubuntu installation via the command line, using a sudo, as per an instruction I found somewhere on these forums by googling.\nAll went well for a while and then ended with failure because apparently I wasn't 'root'.\nIt asked the question 'are you root?'   I wasn't there to answer at the time. It seems to have timed out and finished the install process with a fail.\nHow to get this to install?\n\nA: The correct form of the last command that you ran in the terminal ( apt-get install lubuntu-desktop && apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop ) is as follows:\nsudo apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop && sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nThe first part of the command removes xubuntu-desktop and the second part of the command installs lubuntu-desktop if the first part of the command, removing xubuntu-desktop, was successful. Another way to do the same thing is to give yourself root privileges using sudo su and then use the following command instead:  \napt-get remove xubuntu-desktop && apt-get install lubuntu-desktop  \n\nYour main memu is showing you that you have the Lubuntu desktop installed.\nIt's not possible to know if the error message that you got was important without seeing the error message, however if you got a vital error message because of the wrong order of the two commands, then you could fix it by running this command:  \nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop  \n\n...which checks if lubuntu-desktop is completely installed and completes the installation of lubuntu-desktop if it is not completely installed, otherwise it does nothing and returns the following message:  \nlubuntu-desktop is already the newest version.  \n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.\n\n\nA: Try using root login in terminal using,\nsudo suThen enter your user password when prompted,  nothing should show thats OK\nThen run your command without sudo.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to Internet on a VM (NAT & Host only networks enabled) \n*\n\n*Host machine: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\n*Guest machine: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\n*Networking mode: NAT + Host Network only.\n\n\nSettings of my VM:\ncat /etc/network/interfaces:\n\nOutput:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n      address 10.0.0.4\n      netmask 255.255.255.0 \n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\n\nWhen I run : ping 8.8.8.8, I get: connect: network is unreachable.\nNote: I run the necessary things such as: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart and sudo service network-interface restart INTERFACE=eth0/eth1, and even sudo ifconfig eth0/eth1 down/up.\nI also edited the necessary files: /etc/hosts where I added my ip (10.0.0.4) and I added my dns namserver (that i also definied for eth0 - I just do not want to post it here) to /etc/resolv.conf.\n\nWhen I run route -n, I get this output:\n\nifconfig gives me this: \n\nHow could I connect to internet using a static address of my choice ?\n\nA: I resolved the problem this way:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n      address 10.0.0.4\n      netmask 255.255.255.0 \n\nand I run sudo ifconfig eth1 up\n\nA: You need to enable the \"Briged network\" mode in Virtual Box settings before starting the VM.

(These could be two interfaces on your router.)  These routes normally are sent by a radvd server.  Your router should be periodically advertizing it routes. \ndefault via fe80::2d0:ff:fefc:3000 dev eth0  proto ra  metric 1024  expires 1772sec\ndefault via fe80::2d0:ff:fefb:9000 dev eth0  proto ra  metric 1024  expires 1772sec\n\nTry running tcpdump to catch the router advertisements.  Identify the device which is advertising an incorrect route and stop it from advertising itself as a router.   If you aren't seeing advertisements, try to get your router configured to send them. \nYou may be able to temporarily restore connectivity with the command: \nip -6 route add default via 2001:xxxx:4300:xxxx::1 dev eth0 metric 1024 \n\nIf you are firewalling ICMP6 traffic, you may be blocking traffic required for IPv6 to work.  There is a long list of ICMP types that are required: at least 1-4, 130-137, 141-143, 148-148, and 151-153.  See RFC4890 for more information.\nCheck the contents of /etc/sysctl.conf and /etc/sysctl to see if you have disabled ipv6.autoconf on your interface. \n", "Q: Ubuntu Server Setup help: sda sdb have changed? How to know I'm making shared folders on the right drive? Please help, I will be forever grateful!\nI've built a system to use as a file server, with one 120GB SSD and one 4TB HDD. I've installed Ubuntu Server and I want to have the OS on the SSD and the files on the HDD. During the installation process the SSD was sda and the HDD was sdb. During install I created 3 new partitions. One 112GB partition on the 120GB SSD with mount point /, one 8GB swap area on the 120GB SSD and one 4TB partition on the 4TB HDD with mount point /home.\n(I installed grub boot loader on sda, which was the SSD)\nHow can I check that this is all set up correctly? When I type in sudo fdisk -l it says\n\"Disk /dev/sda: 4000GB\" (this was sdb during install?!?)\n\"/dev/sda1: Partition 1 does not start on a physical sector boundary. (I didn't create a 2nd partition on the HDD though??)\nAnd it also says\n\"/dev/sdb: 120GB (So my SSD has somehow changed from sda to sdb?)\nDisk /dev/mapper/cryptswap1: 8033MD \nDisk /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 doesnt contain a valid partition table\"\nSo does this mean the swap area I made didnt work? And my sda and sda have somehow swapped names? How can I confirm the OS is installed on the SSD and then create some directories like 'Movies' Music' 'Photos' etc on the HDD so I can them share them across my network.\nI've just installed openssh-server and samba and stuff and now the tutorial says to cd to root directory and then use mkdir to create my folders. But will this create them on the HDD like I want? Or on the SSD? So confused!\nIf someone could tell me the commands to type in to see which drive the OS is installed on and the commands to create directories on the HDD it would be much much appreciated.\nThank you\n\nA: You cannot rely on sdX to remain the same (it probably will, but no guarantees). You should use either labels or UUIDs. See the devices in /dev/disks/by-label and /dev/disk/by-UUID. You can check which drives have been used as currently by using the mount command (which will use sdX in the output). To fix your cryptswap, edit the file /etc/crypttab to use UUIDs.\nThe Ubuntu installer uses UUIDs by default in fstab and crypttab, so you shouldn't have to manually edit them. Applications like parted cannot identify encrypted swap, since the partition appears to be filled with garbage to them. (If they ever identify them successfully, there's something very wrong going on.) You can check usage of swap using the swapon -s command. \nThat a partition doesn't start on a physical boundary doesn't mean much these days. Today's disks don't really expose the real physical state.\n", "Q: How to change the DNS server across network interfaces? The only consistent solution for changing your DNS server is to change it in each individual network interface.

This is called root access.\nIn the future, avoid entering the password after opening a downloaded application if you don't trust the source.\n\nA: The bit that is tripping people up is the prompt isn't asking for Password: _____ as it usually might with a PolicyKit pkexec prompt, it's asking for Password for root: _____.\nAs the manpage sort of skirts around, this is actually asking for the root account password, not your account password. This explains why the latter doesn't work.\nWhy it's asking you for the root password is slightly harder to answer.

When you remove the phone from the dock the X session closes and you are back to the Android touch interface.\nAlthough this has not been discussed in the various videos released, there is no reference to a special behaviour when connecting the phone to a PC.

I'm trying to configure Dovecot, it seems to be used a lot and has server side mail filtering which I like.

Can't figure it out! \nI'm on a VPS that I control and have full root access to my chunk.

No more crashing in Android, the mail folders moved to be top level folders and not subfolders of Inbox.\nThe only problem came with Roundcube which had trouble seeing what mail folders were for what purpose.  I had to explicitly set them via the web app, but that is likely because I had been using the same roundcube installation for testing and it probably just got confused.\n", "Q: Removing \"user accounts\" from system settings I don't need user account management on my system settings for security reasons.

The errors I got taught me lots, I found how to deal with linker errors, I list some of them below:\nhow-can-i-guide-compiler-to-use-a-certain-library\nhow-to-fix-pkg-prog-pkg-config-command-not-found-error\npkg-config-modversion-glib-2-0-reports-older-version\nhow-to-fix-libgmodule-2-0-so-0-could-not-read-symbols-invalid-operation-erro\nmultiple-ffmpeg-library-paths-how-can-exclude-older-ffmpeg-installations\nhow-can-i-use-a-particular-library-while-compiling\nI come to such a point that even I can get errors while compiling native Ubuntu applications such as unity (I want to embed unity launcher into cairo dock unity launcher in cairo dock)\nHow can I fix those library conflicts? I lost manually  compiled application's directories so I have no chance to run make uninstall.\nI am fed up with adjusting library paths.\nWhat do you suggest me in this position?\n\nA: The main issue here was the existence of libraries and includes in /usr/local that were compiled in Precise (12.04). \nWhen searching for the development headers specified by #include, gcc and g++ have /usr/local/include higher on the list than /usr/include. Therefore, if you have a library's dev headers in  both /usr/local/include and /usr/include, then the one in /usr/local/include will be used, regardless of the version. While this may have been fine in Precise, since the libraries that were locally compiled were likely newer versions, this wouldn't be fine in Trusty, when the system version of the library would be of a equal or newer version of the library you installed. In addition, as system libraries changed, the SONAMEs would have changed, and locally-compiled libraries would have to be recompiled. Therefore, gcc/g++ would use the older version and may complain about missing symbols and/or linking errors.\nIf a library is present in the main repos, it is generally recommended to use that library instead of compiling it by yourself (unless you need a newer version of a library for either development or to fix a bug); that way, when you upgrade your system, that library is updated as well, and recompiled to link correctly with the other libraries.\n", "Q: Configure installation of dependency package in custom apt-get We are able to create a custom .deb package called geomonitor-v1.0.1.deb and then configured apt-get repository for it.

M91XX (rev 01)\nI'm not very experienced messing around with this particular area of Ubuntu and my shenanigans have already resulted in a clean install. Your guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: The Matrox readme file states that the driver works till Xorg 1.13 and works for Ubuntu 13.04. So the best bet for you would be to keep on Ubuntu 13.04 and urge Matrox support to provide updated drivers to work with Xorg 1.15 and Ubuntu 14.04.\nOther option could be downgrade Xorg server to 1.13 with Ubuntu 14.04. This can actually work by pinning xserver-xorg* packages to raring release (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto) and downgrading xserver-xorg* packages. However, I would not recommend that unless you are familiar with pinning and comfortable with package manipulations. If you are determined to do that I could provide precise steps to do that though there is no telling if it could cause something else to not work correctly.\n", "Q: How To Install Ubuntu 14.04 on HP Dynamic Smart Array b120i logical drive I've got some problems when trying to install ubuntu on hp proliant dl 160 gen8.

I did. However that only changed the problem; the booting got stuck on a different line. Basically instead of hanging up on the swap partition mounting, the boot hung up on my touch pad. When that happened the HDD LED turned off and the PC just sat there for several minutes before I had to restart it. After 3 back to back getting stuck in the same place I put the swap partition back. I took a picture of where it was getting stuck when the swap was gone:\n\n********************************Edit #3********************************************\nI made a mistake in the procedure I carried out in 'Edit#2'. After deleting the partition I never removed a line of code from /etc/fstub. so I repeated the process where I deleted the swap section, then I commented out the swap line in the /etc/fstub file. This did not fix my problem, but it did create different symptoms.

I set it as the first linked post suggested and kept it there as it has worked in the past for others.\n\n*For the sake of full disclosure there is another bug I thought to be unrelated, but since I made it this far, I want to get it off my chest: any time I try to adjust my screen brightness using a FN key and two brightness keys (HOME & END), the operating system freezes and does not unfreeze; requiring a PC restart by pressing the power button. This feature used to work in 12.04.\n\n\nAny ideas? I will carry out any suggestions.\n****************************************Edit #4*******************************\nHi guys thanks for your help!

I did report the problem.\n\n*I got the contents of the following logs:\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/log/kern.log   http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7819929/\n\n*/var/log/Xorg.0.log    http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7819982/\n\n*/var/log/gpu-manager.log   http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/7819987/\nI am off to work, when I get back I will post the results of all the other suggestions (memtest, etc..). Thanks for all your help. Keep telling me what to do and I will do it and make a write up on the results here.\n************The info below is complemetary to oldfred's answer*************\nIt seems that a solution has been found. 'oldfred' is the first to suggest a working solution. Thanks! I did a bunch of testing and ultimatly this is what you need to do if you have this happen to you:\n1) Using gparted I added back my swap partition. the swap partition is not related to this problem. As several people noted, the swap message was just the last line displayed on the screen when the O/S froze.\n2) To test if this solution works for you, when the purple grub screen appears press e to edit the entry. then add the following to the end of the line starting with linux:       \n\nacpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\n  \n\n3) If this works for you, then to make this change permenant open your /etc/default/grub as sudo (sudo gedit /etc/default/grub)\n4) change the string of \n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"no splash\"\n\nto \n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"no splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\n5) lastly get GRUB to load you new settings by typing \n\nsudo update-grub\n\nBingo, all works properly!! Thanks to everyone for your help. I appreciate it.\n\nA: I believe it still is a video issue. \nAnd boot parameter for grub is nomodeset with nVidia, but different parameters if booting with Intel. \nCan you set which video chip you boot with? \nSee this \nAfter using Boot-Repair I cannot change screen resolution\nYou test alternative boot parameters at grub menu using e and scroll to linux line. Replace quiet splash or add after those boot parmeter those settings you want to test. Once you get a combination that works edit /etc/default/grub\nBut you may also need acpi_osi=Linux and/or acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nsudo update-grub\n\nSo on this line add boot parameters that work.\nGRUB_CMD_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"no splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't show when restarting MacBook Pro I've had Ubuntu for a while now, almost two weeks.

Unfortunately, the native program doesn't convert on the fly,ando I was hoping to use Rhythmbox to pick and transcode what songs I want and then use the native app to transfer what I choose to the phone. I could work around it by simply using some removable drive (which is a hassle if I intend to transfer the music often) or an external app (which is a hassle because I like to pick songs as I listen to them), but I wonder if there is some better solution.)\n\nA: A) If you want to use any directory (network share) in Rythmbox\n1) Open rythmbox\n2) Click Edit, then Preferences\nYou will see something similar to this:\n\n3) Click Browse, choose the location that your network share is mounted.\n4) Make sure watch my library for new files is checked (as shown).\nB) Based on our chat, I believe that you have manged to use a pendrive with .is_audio_player. Edit that file and copy it to the root of your device. You will want to edit it to comply with the format discussed below. If you have a media player that requires a is_audio_player file, this means that it is not automatically recognized by Ubuntu and it is a bug (ie your drive does not appear in the list Readers automatically detected). So that other users like you are not obliged to define such a file and your drive is automatically recognized in future versions of Ubuntu, please report the bug by running the command: ubuntu-bug media-player-info.\nis_audio_player format\nHere is a practical example of properties that you can add to this file .is_audio_player (each is explained in more detail below).\nFor a complete list of all available properties, refer to the HAL standard\naudio_folders = Music /, Other folder / subfolder\n folder_depth = 8\n output_formats = audio / mpeg, application / ogg, audio / x-ms-wma\n input_formats = audio / mpeg \nParameter \"audio_folders\"\nList all folders that contain music. Other files will be ignored. \\ \\ The order is important because the music will transfer to the first folder in the list.\nIn the absence of this parameter, the music is sought throughout the volume and transfers are to the root.\nParameter \"folder_depth\"\nSpecifies the number of child folders in which music files can be found:\nThis parameter is relative to the folder containing music, as specified in <audio_folders>;\nAll audio files located in another child folder will not be seen;\nThe value 0 indicates that there is no depth limit subfolders. \n\nExamples:\nIf the player stores all the music with the tree / <audio_folders> / <Artiste> / <Album>, use the folder_depth parameter = 2;\nFor a compilation of Beatles containing two discs with the tree / <audio_folders> / Beatles/Compilation/Disque1 with the folder_depth parameter = 2, audio files located in Disk1 will not be seen. \n\nThis parameter is also used when importing new songs:\nfolder_depth = 0 places the files in the root folder specified in the first audio_folders as\n<audio_folders> / <artiste> - <album> - <PDISKID> piste> - name> morceau>;\nfolder_depth = 1: Place the files in a subfolder. This will be placed in the first indicated in the form audio_folders\n<audio_folders> / <artiste> - <album> / <PDISKID> piste> - name> morceau>;\nfolder_depth = 2 and more: places the files in two subfolders. These will be placed in the first audio_folders indicated in the form\n<audio_folders> / <artiste> / <album> / <PDISKID> piste> - name> morceau>. \n\nIn the absence of parameters, folder_depth = 0 is used by default.\nParameter \"output_formats\"\nIndicates the formats supported by the player in mime type. The first type is indicated that used for the automatic conversion when importing new songs.\nMime types most commonly used:\naudio / mpeg (mp3)\napplication / ogg (ogg)\naudio / x-ms-wma (wma). \n\nIn the absence of this parameter, the software used for the import will use the format specified in preferences.\nParameter \"input_formats\"\nIndicates formats that can record player with microphone or from a radio.\nMime types most commonly used:\naudio / mpeg (mp3)\napplication / ogg (ogg)\naudio / x-ms-wma (wma). \n\nIn the absence of this parameter, it is considered that the player can not record audio.\nSource (B):http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/is_audio_player&prev=/search%3Fq%3D.is_audio_player%26client%3Dubuntu%26hs%3D8v7%26channel%3Dfs\n", "Q: Terminal Emulator adds viewpoint I need to connect to a linux server running Rocket Software D3 multivalue database on our network from my ubuntu 14.04 desktop.

As title says, laptop was grinding to a halt after a period of time.  I have the system monitor running and it seems to show memory use getting higher and higher.  I had a look around and found this command:\nsudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3\n\nIt seems to stop my system from grinding to a halt.  Couple of questions though (I'm a Linux noob):\nWhat does the command do?\nWhy does it seem to help?\n\nA: The sysctl command allows you to read and/or write to your kernel parameters at runtime.  The -w switch indicates that you wish to write one of those parameters.  The list of parameters you can write to are stored as files under the /proc/sys directory tree.\nAs per ftp://ftp.alaska.edu/pub/sois/man/drop_caches.html, valid values for drop_caches are:\n0 # default\n1 # free pagecache\n2 # free dentries, inodes\n3 # free pagecache, dentries, inodes\n\nKernel documentation on the vm file states that writing to it:\n\nWriting to this will cause the kernel to drop clean caches, as well as\n  reclaimable slab objects like dentries and inodes.  Once dropped, their\n  memory becomes free.\nThis is a non-destructive operation and will not free any dirty\n  objects. To increase the number of objects freed by this operation,\n  the user may run `sync' prior to writing to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches. \n  This will minimize the number of dirty objects on the system and\n  create more candidates to be dropped.\n\nFurthermore, it provides a warning:\n\nUse of this file can cause performance problems.  Since it discards\n  cached objects, it may cost a significant amount of I/O and CPU to\n  recreate the dropped objects, especially if they were under heavy use.\n  Because of this, use outside of a testing or debugging environment is\n  not recommended.\n\nRunning this command appears to help because it frees-up your memory.  But this command won't solve your problem by itself.  The next time your system is grinding to a halt, open a terminal and try running the top command to see what is using your memory.\n", "Q: How to connect from MySQL to Web Application I have been trying to setup a local instance for a web application.\nI am new to MySQL and I can't understand how to actually connect this database to \nthe actual web application sitting in the /var/www folder in my computer.\nI have created a database in command line terminal:\nmysql> create database mydatabase\n-> ;\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)\nmysql> create user 'host'@'website.local' identified by 'hmypassword';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\nmysql> create user 'host'@'%' identified by 'mypassword';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\nmysql> grant all privileges on database.* to 'host'@'%';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\nmysql> flush privileges;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\nmysql> exit\nBye\nmysql -u host -h 127.0.0.1 -p\nEnter password:\nWelcome to the MySQL monitor.

You can define filters ( .LOL.HDTV ) and how ofter you want to refresh the rss (like qBittorrent.) And afaik this does not have the qBittorrent bug.\n 2. If you must stick to qBitTorrent, then taking a cue from the 2nd link above, you could \n a.) first setup FlexGet\nb.) List items you want to download into a configuration file.

This tutorial uses the same showrss site as you want. \nBasically, here you provide a folder where all .torrent files would be downloaded, e.g. ~/.torrent\nc.) the init the flexget flexget --initdb \nd.) In your qBittorrent settings, select automatically select torrents from ~/.torrent.\ne.) Schedule flexget to run every few minutes and along with it start the qbittorrent client. This can be done using Gnome-Schedule and a simple script file rss.sh. Put the below content in the rss.sh file:\n \n#!/bin/bash\n/usr/local/bin/flexget #start flexget to download all .torrent files from rss\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0 #required to run gui apps such as qBitTorrent\n/usr/bin/qbittorrent #run qb, which will pick up .torrent files from the ~/.torrent folder\n\nIn gnome-schedule, set the above script file.

I don't mean the \"in theory it should achieve speeds of...\" truth. I mean \"I tested this and all I got was this lousy T-shirt\". With this I mean that, one thing is what they tell you the SSD can achieve, another is what it actually achieves.\n\n*Not all SSD models from the same company achieve the same speeds. Or worse, maintain the same speeds for months.\n\n*Your favorite SSD company might actually be worse than that other new weirdly named company.\n\n*The motherboard can actually have a huge impact on the SSD's performance.\nBENCHMARK (Samsung vs Intel vs Kingston)\nHere is the information I gathered while I tested the following models (Noticed I changed the notation to BYTES, not BITS since we want the real world truth):\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel 520 Series 120GB SSD which mentions in theory a READ speed of 550 MB/s and a WRITE speed of 500 MB/s.\n\n*Kingston SSDNow V300 120GB which mentions in theory a READ speed of 525 MB/s and a WRITE speed of 500 MB/s.\n\n*Samsung PRO 256GB which mentions in theory a READ speed of 540MB/s and a WRITE speed of 520 MB/s.\nBENCHMARK (Results)\nI got the following results from 10 tests with the Disks benchmark tool and 3 more with hdparm:\n\n\n*\n\n*For the Intel, it showed an average of 465 MB/s (READ) & 329 MB/s (WRITE) with the Disks Benchmark. With hdparm I got an average of 398 MB/s (READ).\n\n*For Kingston which was the one I assumed would be the best of all 3 got an average of 404 MB/s (READ) & 298 MB/s (WRITE) with the Disks Benchmark. With hdparm I got 376 MB/s (READ).\n\n*For Samsung, the Disk Benchmark had a problem doing the Write test, so I could only do the READ test which gave me a 555MB/s. hdparm gave me 519MB/s (READ). Now, since I don't like to leave things half-baked, I did a normal test (10 times) of copying a file from one place to another on the same SSD. I first tried 1GB but it was too fast to test and find an average. I then tested 2GB, then 5GB and at last got to 10GB (Or 10.2GB to be exact) to test this. The average WRITE speed landed at 753MB/s.\nSo My first thought of seeing the Kingston as the fastest was wrong. Even my second thought of the Intel being the fastest was wrong. It was Samsung. Now I did the test right now again and got a speed of 716MB/s (WRITE). The drop might be X variable on the system but the speed nevertheless is very high.\nBENCHMARK (Changing Motherboards)\nHere are the impacts if I change motherboard (The previous test was done on an Asus Z87 PRO updated with the latest firmware). If I jump to an Intel DZ68DB which also advertises Sata3 (6.0Gb/s), all SSD drop between 40% to 60% of their speed with the Asus). This is how important the motherboard is. If you have a low cost motherboard with a high cost SSD, well, you just wasted your money on the SSD because of the limiting factor the motherboard will have on the SSD. To give you an idea, the Samsung was doing a 265MB/s READ speed and a 212MB/s WRITE on the DZ68DB. That's a huge drop.\nNow here is an update for the ASRock H61M/U3S3 & the Gigabyte GA-H77M-D3H.\nWith the ASRock using the Disk utility 10 times, the Intel SSD got 140MB/s (READ) & 110MB/s (WRITE). the Samsung SSD got 180MB/s (READ) & 123MB/s (WRITE). I don't have the Kingston right now but you can guess from the other two how it would go with it.\nWith the Gigabyte using the Disk utility 10 times, the Intel SSD got 241MB/s (READ) & 209MB/s (WRITE). the Samsung SSD got 312MB/s (READ) & 295MB/s (WRITE). Again I don't have the Kingston right now but you can guess from the other two how it would go with it.\nCONCLUSION\nOn all cases, hdparm, dmidecode, dmesg and any other HDD/SSD reading tool showed that I was \"capable\" of using Sata3, but the actual READ/WRITE speeds where not met to the speed one assumes to get from using Sata3 because it varies greatly between motherboards, SSD models and any other variable in between.\nWith all of this said and done, to answer your question: Is 400MB/s a Sata3 speed?\nYes, yes it is. Sata2 would really limit you from around 180Mb/s to 250MB/s in a real world scenario. Sata3 would push the boundaries well above the 300MB/s. But this is also affected by the motherboard, SSD model & SSD manufacturer.\nOn Hard Drive Benchmark which I always check to see which SSD to buy or recommend I found that your Crucial MX100 has 3 types of sizes, of which, only 2 appear in that list, the 512 & 256 versions. Each one with their scores. So here are the scores of the benchmarked SSDs I tested with the 3 types:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel 520 Series 120GB - 3699  \n\n*Kingston SSDNow V300 120GB - 2514 \n\n*Samsung PRO 256GB - 3536  \n\n*Crucial MX100 256GB - 2916  \n\n*Crucial MX100 256GB - 3729  (Model 2)  \n\n*Crucial MX100 512GB - 3480\nFrom the scores one would think the best is the Model 2 of Crucial, followed by Intel, but one would be wrong. Factors like motherboard, firmware version (For both, mobo and SSD), operating system and even BIOS/UEFI settings can change everything.\nFor my current case, enabling TRIM on the Samsung gave me a boost of about 150MB, which lands me in the 500+ Speeds. I actually did not know TRIM could change the speed until I enabled it. Another factor was updating the Asus firmware.\nSo yes, you are using Sata3, especially with a 365MB/s speed but something (Maybe motherboard, firmware, the actual SSD, the SSD cable, the geographical location, the altitude, Santa claus, some weird freaky alien electrical monster living inside your computer case, etc....) can have an effect on the actual performance. BTW, some motherboards when using old hardware connected to it, can somehow limit the performance of the rest. For example, having an old PATA CD-ROM or DVD-ROM connected can have a negative performance on the drive. Same goes for a 3.5 Floppy drive (I mean come on O.o).\nUpdating Ubuntu to a more recent version can have most of the time a positive impact on performance, especially if you read the performance improvements on the 3.14, 3.15 and 3.16 kernels.\n\nA: \n\nFor Kingston which was the one I assumed would be the best of all 3 got an     average of 404 MB/s (READ) & 298 MB/s (WRITE) with the Disks Benchmark. With     hdparm I got 376 MB/s (READ).\n\n\nThere is really no sure way to know what you are going to get with a V300 without detailed testing to figure which hardware Kingston provided to you.  They pulled a bait and switch with the NAND used in the build of materials.  Google the AnandTech article:\n'An Update to Kingston SSDNow V300: A Switch to Slower Micron NAND' \nfor details.\n\nA: Yes you do. When it says 6gbps it is just saying that that is what the maximum speed of the interface is. No drive has reached A gigabyte per second yet that I have heard of so everything is operating just fine and there is no need to worry. All that your system is saying is that the maximum interface speed is 6gbps and your volume is operating at 365.76mbps. When the manufacture says that the speed it 550mbps they are showing the results they got on THEIR system. The speed also depends on your mobo, bus speed, and interface.\n", "Q: Help with wifi hotspots please! I know I can make wifi hotspots on Ubuntu 14.04 wired -> wifi. BUT. Can I make a hotspot wifi -> wifi? If so, how?\nThanks in advance ;)\n\nA: No You Cannot, This sort of negates the purpose of the hotspot function. If you have a wifi connection on your PC, then that same wifi connection is available to other devices. If this is the case, why do you need ANOTHER hotspot? Besides, I think the hotspot needs the wifi radio to serve up the hotspot. I'm not sure, but I don't think it can do that and connect to another wifi connection at the same time. \n", "Q: LibreOffice Writer problem with format All of a sudden my LibreOffice Writer started acting up.

I later find out that my Internet isn't working on that laptop. So, I then notice that my wireless key was stuck in off mode, I first try going win to the BIOS and restoring to default settings, it didn't work. I also tried checking to see if I have any drivers to download, which apparently I had nothing. And, I cannot perform a fresh install as something happened after installing Ubuntu that locked me out of booting from CD/DVD.

If it says something about a hardware switch, you need to use your fn key switch to turn wifi back on. \nAlso, is wlan0 listed? If so run the following command:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\nIf not, run these commands instead. \nsudo modprobe rt2800pci\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\nsudo iwconfig\n\nNow, it should be listed and wifi should work.\nThere's no need to install the driver when the driver is included as a kernel module sudo modprobe rt2800pci calls on the driver \"rt2800pci\" and puts it in use. wlan0 is your wireless device and sudo ifconfig wlan0 up brings this device up. Please post any errors.\n\nA: I had the identical problem -- same model number for the laptop, etc.  (As a minor difference, I had to leave the classroom and students messed with my laptop in order to postpone a midterm.  BTW, I now have some wonderful screen savers if anyone hates their friends.)\nIn addition to the suggestions above, specifically, \n\nsudo modprobe rt2800pci\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\nsudo iwconfig\n\nI found it necessary to boot to a slightly older version of the kernel (where the module was available), and add these\n\nsudo rmmod -f hp-wmi\nsudo rfkill unblock all\nrfkill list all\n\nThen, and this is actually harder than it sounds, I had to wait a moment or so for the orange light to go off.

My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15R 5537.\nI followed a tutorial that had me disable fast start up, but keep Secure Boot and EFI boot enabled. Most of the install seems to go right, until the very end, where it claims that the installer failed because it was unable to install Grub2.\nIn all the videos I've seen, this never happens to anyone else, and after the successful install they are able boot from the live disc and fix Grub with Boot-Repair. However, when I try this it says to disable Secure Boot and try again. After doing so I retried Boot-Repair. It still gave me errors, and I could only boot to Windows 8.1. It gave me this link to explain what went wrong:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7797066/\nFortunately I was able to delete the unsuccessful install partition and swap partition and restore it to my C: space. I plan to create a new unallocated space for a fresh Ubuntu install. Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?\n\nA: GRUB can fail to install because of filesystem damage on the ESP. Another clue that this may be an issue is your Boot Repair output, which has generated multiple entries for certain files. This could be a Boot Repair bug, but it's also possible that it indicates damage to the underlying filesystem. You can check the filesystem on the EFI System Partition (ESP) with the dosfsck utility in Linux, as in sudo dosfsck /dev/sda1. This damage can occur if you did not disable Fast Startup in Windows. You mention disabling this feature, but it's not clear if you were referring to the Windows feature or to an EFI feature with a similar name. The Windows feature, if left enabled, can produce filesystem damage and problems installing an EFI boot loader, so it must be disabled. See this page (or others; a Web search should turn up lots of entries) for details.\nIf you continue to have GRUB problems, I recommend abandoning GRUB in favor of something else. Although Ubuntu's default boot loader is GRUB, it's a tricky program to fix when things go wrong -- it's just too big and complex to be properly managed by the average user. See this page of mine for information on GRUB alternatives. The easiest to try is likely to be my own rEFInd boot manager. You can download the version on USB flash drive or CD-R and boot to it. It should detect your Ubuntu installation and give you options to boot it. Provided you didn't use a separate /boot partition, this should work, and if you then install the Debian package in Ubuntu, it should boot from hard disk. Unfortunately, because you wiped the Ubuntu installation from your disk, you'll need to re-install to try this. Note, however, that the USB flash drive and CD-R versions of rEFInd require that Secure Boot be disabled. (You can use rEFInd with Secure Boot, but doing so requires jumping through some extra hoops.)\n\nA: YOU TRY THE INSTALL from w8? via wubi?\nmicrosoft is doing us wrong....\nit happens to me but w7 64, then i backup and try again, reinstall w7 from backup / restore and install again ubuntu 14.04 avoiding wubi... there is a problem when you run the install from cd...INSIDE WINDOWS via wubi and certain choices ones mde \n it writes MBR with grub from win and the grub can't be overwrited cause win problems, more or less, I also discover to avoid inserting SD or other unnecesary media -specially if they are placed during boot, cause booting virus can cause to be active and pass to the normal boot tainted- keeping you away of choosing the right device. even loaded the boot virus I THINK is harmless when it sees your computer SPEAKING LINUX GERMAN, JIJIJI   Better option is to install FROM alternative booting media DVD CD USB.

I found something like a screensaver but it does not include everything I need.\nSo I must ask that is there anything I missed about downloading this lighter interface? \nshould I download more stuff to be able to use every general ubuntu software and tools?\nif so, what are they?\n\nA: Well LXDE is very lightweight, to add start-up applications you put a .desktop file in the ~/.config/autostart folder.

It's designed for the development version of Ubuntu and nothing else. Remove it:\nsudo apt-add-repository -r ppa:kubuntu-ppa/next\n\nBy extension the kubuntu-plasma5-desktop package only lives in this PPA so you're not going to be able to install that yet.\nJust use the Neon version in ppa:neon/kf5 (which only works for Trusty). As the blog announcement for all this states:\n\nPackages will be installed to /opt/project-neon5 and will co-install with your normal environment and installs to 14.04\n\nOnce you've installed project-neon5-session, project-neon5-utils and project-neon5-konsole you should be able to choose Neon as a desktop session from the login screen.\nIf you're using 14.10 (per the original question)...\nThe neon/kf5 PPA is only intended for 14.04 Trusty. It doesn't have packages for Utopic. Remove it with:\nsudo apt-add-repository -r ppa:neon/kf5\n\nThe kubuntu-ppa/next PPA should work on 14.10:\n\n*\n\n*It has a Utopic build target.\n\n*Looking at the Packages file, it does have a kubuntu-plasma4-desktop file.\n\nIf it's not working, check the output of sudo apt-get update (use apt if you like) and see what that's saying.

You could test for this by examining your $PATH:\necho $PATH\n\nYou could adjust your $PATH variable so that /usr/local/bin has higher priority by running something like this, or adding this to your ~/.bashrc:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\n\nHowever, you should take a few things into consideration.  If you're installing this at a system level, then you should remove the apt-controlled package using apt-get remove git.  If you chose to do this, you should make sure that your git install is solid and has no issues.  Other things on your system rely on git.\nIf you chose to do this, you should omit --prefix flags from all compilation instructions, and instead run ./configure, and allow that to determine your prefix.  This means that different systems will know how to best install binaries, and you allow the system to come up with the details.\nAlternatively, you can install a binary for your user only, which is probably best practice, and a good idea until you become more familiar with compilation, binaries and packages.  In this case, you would want to set a --prefix of something like --prefix=/home/username/.local/ or --prefix=/home/username/ which will place the binary in the bin/ directory under your prefix.  Then, you just ensure that that is part of your $PATH by adding this to your ~/.bashrc:\nexport PATH=/home/username/.local/bin:$PATH\n\nRemember that anytime you edit your .bashrc or other source'd files, you need to re-source .bashrc or restart your terminal:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: Hide a particular account from user accounts How to hide a particular administrator account from user accounts in system settings? I need it for security reasons. Is it possible?\n\nA: The accounts shown in the user accounts dialog are those with a UID in the range UID_MIN to UID_MAX. System accounts are those with uids in the range SYS_UID_MIN to SYS_UID_MAX. These constants are defined in /etc/login.defs.\nIf you don't want an account to show up in the dialog, create it as a system account:\nadduser --system [...] username\n\nIf the user account already exists, you could reassign its uid to one in the system range:\nusermod --uid 999 username\n\nNote however, that hiding an account from the user accounts dialogue buys you no security whatsoever. The exact same information can be obtained using a simple cat /etc/passwd. Obscurity is not security.\n", "Q: How to install openstack in Ubuntu 14.04?

(I don't have experience with these packages)\n\nA: The error is related to the X server. It seems that your configuration was corrupted by your installation of the Android SDK. \nTry the following installation command instead:\nsudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential zip curl \\\nzlib1g-dev libc6-dev lib32ncurses5-dev lib32z1 x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev \\\nlib32readline-gplv2-dev lib32z-dev libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib mingw32 \\\ntofrodos python-markdown libxml2-utils xsltproc\n\nNote: some issues remained after that, related to linking of /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libGL.so.

I selected my router and cliked on \"Use as a hotspot\".\nThe hotspot was created indeed. \nNow I want to change the Network name and the security key but I cant find a way to do that . It seems that those inforations are like hardened and no settings button is offered.\nHow can I do that, using the GUI or command line, anything that works?\n\n EDIT 1\nWhen my wireless hotspot is created, there is not settings access to it. The SSID is my computer domain ( me@my_domain ). \nThe screen looks like:\n Network Name my_domain\n Security Type WEP\n Security key xxxxxxx\nNo configuation button is provided.\n\nA: Ok. I assume you mean you are connecting into Ubuntu via a network cable and then want to use your wireless card to serve internet to other devices, sounds like you dont have a wireless router. This can actually be done pretty easily, not sure about other versions, but definitely in 14.04 and 14.10.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable WIFI and plug in an internet cable to your laptop so that your Ubuntu is connect to a wired internet and wireless is disabled.\n\n*Go to Network Icon on top panel -> Edit Connections …, then click the Add button in the pop-up window.\n\n*Choose Wi-Fi from the drop-down menu when you’re asked to choose a connection type\nIn next window\n\n\n*Type in a connection name. The name will be used later. We will call it hotspot as example. \n\n*Type in a SSID \n\n*Select mode: Infrastructure \n\n*Device MAC address: select your wireless card from drop-down menu.\n\n*Go to Wi-Fi Security tab, select security type WPA & WPA2 Personal and set a password.\n\n*Go to IPv4 Settings tab, from Method drop-down box select Shared to other computers.\nWhen done, click the save button.\nAfter above steps, a configuration file was created under /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections directory. File name is same to the connection name you typed in step 4.\nNow press Ctrl+Alt+T on keyboard to open terminal. When it opens, paste the commands below and hit enter to edit the configuration file:\n nano /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/hotspot\n\nReplace hotspot with the connection name you actually used \nWhen the file opens, find the line \n mode=infrastructure\n\nand change it to \n mode=ap. \n\nFinally save the file.\nWhen everything’s done, enable WIFI from Network Manager icon on the panel. It should automatically connect to the hotspot you created. If not, select “Connect to Hidden Wi-Fi Network …” and select it from the drop-down box.\nYou can now connect any other device via wireless, but the Ubuntu machine will need to keep it's wired connection.\nEdit:I just seen you say your card does not support ap, so this probably will not work. \nWorks for me on my broadcom though \n\nA: bottom left corner of network windows have option button.\nwhere you can edit ssid, wireless security and more.\nIf stuck anywhere then visit this step by step tutorial.\nhttp://thenewbieblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/wifi-hotspot-setup-on-ubuntu/\n\nA: Me and my friend had trouble setting up wireless hotspot manually. We used ap-hotspot which was much easier to set up. You can get it from:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/how-to-set-up-wireless-hotspot-access.html\n\nA: Looking at the instruction from HERE\nthe explonation could be:\n\"Unfortunately, there are some limitations. Some devices may not support ad-hoc wireless networks and Ubuntu can only create wireless hotspots with weak WEP encryption, not strong WPA encryption.\"\nCheers\n\nA: I guess that you are using ubuntu-gnome.\nYou can change your Network Name,security key in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Hotspot.\nHere is what I did:\nsudo vim /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Hotspot\n\n//find options you want to change\n\n//change it(you should be clear about the option you changed\n\n:w!(force to save in vim command line)\n\n:q(quit the config file)\n\nrestart the hotspot and you can see the change you did in System settings > Network > Wireless\n\nA: I was trying to do the exact same thing as you (change my host name/security key for my hotspot) as there is no wifi in my home. Although you can't change the pre existing hotspot network information you can make a new one with your own info and a custom password (or no password). I'll be as detailed as possible for less experienced users reading this but it's rather simple and doesn't require a terminal (Only proven in 14.04 LTS\n\n\n*\n\n*From the desktop, click the power/settings icon in the top right corner and in the drop down click system settings. From there, click the network icon to bring you to your network settings. Here, you should see at least your wireless and wired connections available on the left hand side.\n\n*Click your wired connection and turn it on (if not already). Now go to your wireless tab and also click that one on (if not already).\nWhen you click into the wireless networks tab, you'll also see your wireless networks that are available. Basically, we are going to make a new entry to this list and use it as your hotspot.\n\n\n*Exit out of the network window and go back up to the upper right hand corner of the desktop and, this time, click the Internet connection icon. In the drop down, click the \"Create new Wi-Fi Network\" option.\n\n*A window will pop up where you can input your own info for the connection and your security preferences. For the connection type click hotspot and enter your desired info (if you don't want a Password, just click \"none\" under wifi security and leave the password area blank). Once finished, click create.\n\n*Now if you go back to your network connections, you'll see your wireless connection is the one you just created, is active, and is transmitting as a hotspot. Now on your other devices you should see your custom connection appear. Also, You no longer have to click the \"Use as Hotspot\" button because this network is an internal one and is by default a hotspot.\nI can verify that this worked at least for me because I wrote this on my iPod touch (hence the many edits) using the custom network I created. Hope this is what you were looking for!\n**Troubleshooting ;) **\nIF, for any reason you ever disconnect from your custom hotspot, just go back to the internet connections drop down in the upper right hand side of your desktop and, under wifi networks, it should be there for you to click and reconnect (it was created as a hotspot so that's all it can do). IF at any point the hotspot disappears from your wireless list, go to the same drop down and make sure both\" networking\" and \"enable Wi-Fi\" are enabled. Then go to \"Edit Connections\" to see if your custom network is on the list. If it is, it should still be there in the network settings window for you to click. If it is not, it was somehow deleted and you need to make a new one. However, upon repeating steps to create a hotspot, under \"connection type\", your info from your original hotspot should still be there under the same name. If not, simply re type and re create the hotspot. \n\nA: I just had same problem, I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 Gnome. Here is a alternative solution. Probably your OS has default Hotspot defined wireless.

To do this, boot into a live session using an installation DVD with a blank USB drive plugged into your computer as well. Open a terminal or press CTRL + ALT + F2 to sign into a text session and execute the following commands.\nFirst, locate your Ubuntu partition device number:\nsudo lsblk\n\nMy Ubuntu partition is at /dev/sda3 and I will be using this as an example for the following commands, however, your's may be /dev/sda2 or even /dev/sda5. Use the output of lsblk to determine what you should substitute.\nYou will also need to know the drive letters for the USB. I will use /dev/sdb as an example, however, again your's may be something else.\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sdb\nsudo mount /dev/sda3 /\nsudo chroot /\nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\nLeave the USB in when you want to boot into Ubuntu and the Grub menu will start from there.\nAs usual, make sure the USB drive is formatted to fat32.\nThis method bypasses the normal boot sequence if USB is set to boot before the hard drive in the bios settings.\n", "Q: Acroread can't edit annotations: Commenting Not Allowed I started annotating a pdf on a windows machine but then I wanted to make some changes on my Linux machine later.

GRUB can't switch between these two boot modes, so you'll need to either re-install one of your OSes so that they both use the same boot mode or find some other way to switch boot modes.\nFor re-installing, it's likely to be easier to re-install Ubuntu, but you'll need to be sure that the Ubuntu installer is booting in BIOS mode. You can usually select the boot mode of the installer by picking the correct option from your computer's built-in boot manager. There are usually two options for external media, one of which includes the string \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\" and the other doesn't. Pick the one that lacks the \"EFI\"/\"UEFI\" string to boot in BIOS mode. (In fact, you can get away with installing the BIOS-mode version of GRUB without re-installing all of Ubuntu, but this process is more difficult to explain than just re-installing all of Ubuntu.)\nIf you want to keep the mixed-mode booting, I know of only two ways to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use your firmware's built-in boot manager -- the same one you use to select which way to boot an external medium. You'll probably see an option called \"ubuntu\" to boot Ubuntu in EFI mode and another one that may be named after your hard disk that will boot Windows in BIOS mode. Details vary from one system to another, though, and some don't support switching boot modes at boot time.\n\n*My rEFInd boot manager can switch boot modes. Boot to Ubuntu and install the rEFInd Debian package, then edit the /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf file. Look for the scanfor line, uncomment it, and add hdbios to its list of options (leaving the existing ones intact). When you reboot, you should see an option for GRUB, at least one option for booting a Linux kernel directly, and at least one (probably two) options for booting in legacy mode. One of the legacy-mode options should boot Windows. This feature doesn't always work, but it should work on most new computers.\n\n", "Q: Unigine Heaven run directly from terminal?

You should be able to tell the MAAS machine to NAT your 10.0.* network, though. I would suggest getting that working manually as a test case, then trying with MAAS once the MAAS machine networking is right.

For an explanation, see https://serverfault.com/questions/36419/using-ssh-to-remotely-start-a-process.\n\nA: using option -t (terminal) in ssh command solves the problem too (better than redirecting stdout if command output is something usefull that we want to see):\nssh -t remoteip command \n\n\nA: Try using \"here document\" \nssh user@iphos << endexe\n   service asterisk restart\n   exit\nendexe\n\nThat should work.\n\nA: You could just background it as soon as it runs:\nssh user@iphost 'service asterisk restart &'\n\nI've got a similar issue with an xinit-based upstart service that hogs the stage and needs manually exiting (doesn't harm the Upstart job), but yeah, wang a & on the end and that should force it into the background.\nIf that gives you gyp, there are a number of other options like:\nssh user@iphost 'setsid service asterisk restart'\n\n\nA: You can use one of the following commands instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarts the service and then exits:\nssh user@iphost 'service asterisk restart; exit'\n\n\n*Restarts the service and then exits on success:\nssh root@iphost 'service asterisk restart && exit'\n\n", "Q: I want to know if I can have two music libraries Is there a way that I can have two media players like banshee with their own library,so that I can import new mp3's without affecting the music which is in my music library which is already sorted?\n\nA: Unless you tell your music players to sort them, they usually will leave the files' structure on the disk alone. So you can have multiple music players sharing the same library folder, or having different library folders, and so on.\n\nA: Generally music players will store their library information (which is different from the music file's location) under their own settings subdirectory in our HOME folder. Therefore each player will create an own different library, and libraries from different users will be different too.\nSome players (e.g. Guayadeque ) allow to create multiple different libraries.\nTo avoid updating a library on adding new mp3 files there may be a setting in your player where you can disable auto-updating of the library.\n", "Q: Moving away from ROOT user I've recently been asked to help out a friend with some server and website issues they have been having, nothing major really.\nHowever I found out that since the day they got their VPS everything, including uploading files, installing wordpress, all FTP, everything has been done through root.\nSo I am wondering what is the best way to fix everything to make it more secure? \nThe reason im asking is because im assuming its more than just make a new non-root user to use for day to day stuff? Due to how everything has been set up and ownerships already with every other file etc\n\nA: That is a bad mess. \n\n\n*\n\n*I think you should create three users: one for day-to-day use (lets call this user, one for the web server (usually one is created when you install Apache, usually called www-data) and one for the FTP server (call this ftp), all with accompanying groups of the same name. \n\n*Add user to both www-data and ftp groups. chown the web directory to be owned by user:www-data, and make it setgid and setuid (chmod ug+s). Do the same for the FTP upload directory, but with user:ftp. \n\n*If the FTP upload and Wordpress media directory are the same, make a third group with all three users in it (call it upload, and chown the directory user:upload.\n\n*The web server is usually running as www-data, unless they deliberately went and changed it. You will have to configure the FTP server (usually vsftpd) to run as the ftp user.\n\n*Make sure all the relevant directories are setgid so that they inherit group permissions. You can make the setuid as well. (Only the directories, note!)\n\n*Restrict day to day stuff to user. Make sure www-data does not have write permissions where it has no business having them.\n\n\nBeyond this, I am not really qualified to give security advice.\n", "Q: Lock screen automatically in Cinnamon How can I set computer to turn off my monitor and lock my screen after a minute in Cinnamon.

As far as I understand at shutdown the system switches to runlevel 0 and all scripts with K* are executed with the argument stop and all scripts with S* are executed with the argument start.\nNow looking at rc.0 I can see the following scripts:\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   16  1. Jan 2000  K20dhcpcd -> ../init.d/dhcpcd\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   20  1. Jan 2000  S35networking -> ../init.d/networking\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   14  5.

I cannot find any reference to this script as a kill script, so when does this happen?\n\nA: According to Ubuntu upstart cookbook:\n\nUbuntu currently employs a hybrid system where core services are\n  handled by Upstart, but additional services can be run in the legacy\n  SystemV mode. This may seem odd, but consider that there are thousands\n  of packages available in Ubuntu via the Universe and Multiverse\n  repositories and hundreds of services. To avoid having to change every\n  package to work with Upstart, Upstart allows packages to utilize their\n  existing SystemV (and thus Debian-compatible) scripts.\n\nSystemV use run level to manage system startup, shutdown and reboot.\nIn /etc/init.d are present scripts that handles service stop/start, this scripts follow /etc/init.d/skeleton and are executed by the system every time runlevel change.\nRun level are numbered from 0 to 6 and in /etc we found rcX.d folder, one for each level.\nIn these folders are present symbolic link to scripts in /etc/init.d, as you saw the name of this link are particular: they starts with S or K (S means start and K means Kill) followed by a number and the name of service.\nWhen a system command change the value of runlevel, the scripts in the rcX.d directory are called following the alphabetical order: K scripts with stop parameter, S script with start. This rule does not apply to two runlevels 0 (halt) and 6 (reboot). According to Debian Policy Manual Chapter 9 - The Operating System \n\nIn these runlevels, the links with an S prefix are still called after\n  those with a K prefix, but they too are called with the single\n  argument stop.\n\nSo that's why the system halt.\nThis topic is very broad, I hope this little explanation is sufficiently clear.\n", "Q: Left Mouse sometimes stops working after Sleep I have a laptop (HP EliteBook) with the latest Ubuntu (14.04 Desktop 64 bit) installed.

You need to have your pen drive plugged in during the installation of Ubuntu and you need to tell Ubuntu that you want to place the boot loader on this pen drive. Assuming that you have two hard drives /dev/sda and /dev/sdb the device for keeping new bootloader is /dev/sdc, which should be your pen drive.\nTo load Windows in your case you will need to select USB boot option in your BIOS. It is also needed to set Windows as default in GRUB menu configuration.\nBe aware, that without this pen drive you will not be able to run Ubuntu although you will have it installed on one of the drive. This is because you are going to keep new bootloader on a pendrive. So in the scenario you asked in the question the MBR existing on one of the drives is not going to be changed. \nSo you will be able to load Windows only without pen drive or both Windows and Ubuntu with pen drive plugged in.

It's easy to forget, but the resulting \"403\" can make you think its the config that's wrong not the file permissions.\n", "Q: virtualbox guestaddition version from VM client Sometimes Ubuntu behave weird, which might be because because it runs within Virtualbox as a client OS.\nI want to detect if Virtualbox guestaddition is installed, from within the VM client, and which version it is.\nOn the server it can be detected using the Virtualbox API, but I want to be able to detect it on the VM client itself. \nVirtualbox guest addition can be installed using statement how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-x11\n\nSo apt-get must \"know\" about the installation. apt-get does not have a search function so I tried :\ndpkg --list | grep virtualbox\n\nwith result :\nbernard@bernard-vbox2:~$ dpkg --list | grep virtualbox\nii  unity-scope-virtualbox                    0.1+13.10.20130723-0ubuntu1                       all          VirtualBox scope for Unity\nbernard@bernard-vbox2:~\n\nSometing about Virtualbox, but not about Vbox guest addition\nOn my system I presume ( info source ) VBox guest addition is installed in  \n/opt/[VboxAddonsFolder]\nThe folder does exist on my system but I can not find a (general) method to retrieve the VBox guestaddition version.\nOn Takkat advise I installed VBox guest addition.

I followed the instructions here (Ubuntu 14.04 System freezes on wakeup from suspended state) which lead me to the solution posted here (How do I install the Nvidia driver for a GeForce GT 630) to install an updated NVIDIA driver. I followed the steps there. This solved my problem, but a new one cropped up: a thick (1 inch) black border appeared around all of my windows, including popups. So, I decided I would get rid of NVIDIA--the old problem was less of an issue than the new one. I ran \"sudo nvidia-uninstall\" from the terminal, and then rebooted.\nUpon reboot, I attempted to sign in, but when I did nothing happened: neither the launcher nor the dash appeared. This seemed to describe the trouble I was having: Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears. So, I followed the most popular solution here, installing Compiz Settings Manager. I followed the instructions on that page to turn on Unity. And then I returned to the terminal and rebooted, as instructed.\nAt this point I still cannot sign in. When I return to the Compiz Settings Manager, the Unity Plugin is listed as turned on. \nFrom here, I tried resetting Unity by installing the Unity Tweak Tool, and followed the steps here: Ubuntu Desktop does not load. Everything installs fine. When I try to run the unity tweak tool, however, I get a repeating error message of \"dconf-WARNING **: failed to commit changes to dconf: Cannot autolaunch D-Bus without X11 $DISPLAY\". I then made sure that I had X11 installed, and followed the instructions here: How to install X11/xorg?. Still the problem persists.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I have no idea what to do to fix this, and really need my computer to be working.\n\nA: If you are not going to use the nvidia driver you probably need to re-install the nuouveau driver. You can do this by pressing CTRL + ALT + F2 after you power up your computer. From there, you can sign into a text session using your username and password.

This was solved using an external monitor to install Ubuntu and then install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers.\nWhen trying to install 14.04 LTS, this procedure doesn't work - all screens (VGA, Display-port and built in) remain black except for some funny coloured characters.\nI though I could install the old 13.04 and then perform an upgrade. This has also proven to be tricky as \"13.04 it is no longer supported\" and a lot of references to packages doesn’t seem to be valid any more. I get 13.04 installed but have not managed to get the NVIDIA driver working. (It works beautifully on my existing installation (other hdd)).\nAdvice appreciated\n\nA: I am going to answer my own question as nobody else did. What I didn't know then and what I know now is when installing Ubuntu there are a few fundamental settings, like keyboard layout, language (I knew that). There is also an option called \"nomodeset\" which will install Ubuntu using a generic graphic mode and driver which is supported by probably all graphical subsystems. Choosing this will make it possible to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (and other versions) and once installed it is easy to get the driver for the Nvidia graphics working. \n", "Q: How much slower will my computer be with Ubuntu (instead of Lubuntu)? So I was given an old computer which I'm going to use as a second desktop next to my main computer for minor tasks like checking my e-mails, listening to music etc.\nIt know has Lubuntu, but I'd prefer to use Ubuntu because it's fully supported and has a more appealing environment. Currently, Lubuntu uses about 400mb of my RAM, but how much more RAM will Ubuntu use? Do you suggest sticking to Lubuntu if I want speed or Ubuntu will work, too? Also, if I format the Hard Disk, will ubuntu automatically find the drivers or I'm going to have to download them manually?\nThis is its hardware:\nIntel Pentium 4 CPU 2.40GHz ‖ RAM 1508 MiB ‖ Gigabyte 8IG1000MK ‖ nVidia NV44A GeForce 6200\n\nA: Contrary to popular belief, difference in performance of Ubuntu, Lubuntu and Xubuntu is hardly noticeable.

You'll need to actual post the log file associated with the failed upgrade (it should be stored here: /var/log/dist-upgrade/) main.log, apt.log and term.log are the first ones to be looked at.\nDebugging Update Manager\n\nA: I always advise not to upgrade, but to do a fresh installation instead. Ubuntu installer is simple, reliable and well tested. Moreover, installation process doesn't take much time. In the other hand, upgrade can be real troublemaker, it is unreliable, almost always needs additional configuration actions after and sometimes before, and takes much more time.\nSo don't bother to fix upgrade problem - just avoid it by doing fresh installation.

The problem I am having is when the USB to serial adapter is connected, RTS and DTR are constantly on.  This is a problem for me since I am am using RTS and DTR to key a West Mountain Radio Rigblaster Plus, and this keeps it constantly keyed.  How can I disable RTS and DTR to be constantly on?\n\nA: stty -F /dev/ttySX crtscts (modify the /dev/ttySX to match your device). This enables RTS/CTS hardware flow control in the Linux device driver. Then when a DTE (such as a PC) wants to stop the flow into it, it negates RTS. Negated \"Request To Send\" (-12 volts) means \"request NOT to send to me\" (stop sending). When the PC is ready for more bytes it asserts RTS (+12 volts) and the flow of bytes to it resumes. Flow control signals are always sent in a direction opposite to the flow of bytes that is being controlled. DCE equipment (modems) works the same way but sends the stop signal out the CTS pin. Thus it's RTS/CTS flow control using 2 lines.\nNote that the crtscts command is not POSIX compliant. Depending on your implementation you may have better results with the clocal switch mentioned below.\nHere's some other useful control switches from the man page.\n   Control settings:\n   [-]clocal\n          disable modem control signals\n\n   [-]cread\n          allow input to be received\n\nSources: man stty\n", "Q: My .bashrc alias not run in .desktop file I've added the following line to the .bashrc file:\nalias midos=\"sh /home/erkanmdr/Belgeler/midos/midos.sh\"\n\nThis command works fine in the terminal and tty.\nBut not working in my .desktop shortcut file. \nmidos.desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MiDoS\nExec=midos\nIcon=/home/erkanmdr/Belgeler/midos-128.png\nTerminal=true\n\nHow do I execute my midos command in the .desktop shortcut file?\n\nA: I would be extremely surprised if the GUI has any idea about your shell.

Sort by \"installed\" to make it easy on yourself, then carefully remove all the packages for whichever kernel versions you want.  This is usually how I do it when I want to clean up my installed kernels.\n\nA: If you prefer GUI applications you can install Ubuntu Tweak which includes a system janitor section.

My router does not support port forwarding with an IPv6 address and my other computers within the network can't connect to my server because it lacks an IPv4 address. So in a nutshell I need to make my server assign itself an IPv4 address. My server will not show up in the connected devices of my router until I give it an IPv4 address, which creates a problem. Setting a static IP in /etc/network/interfaces doesn't work, it only makes my server think that it has an IPv4, but the network doesn't recognize it.\n\nA: The only way to completely disable IPv6 is by blacklisting the kernel module. Put the following line in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist:\nblacklist ipv6\n\nWarning: IPv6 is becoming more important each day and IPv6 support is assumed by more and more software these days, even if you don't use it (yet). Blacklisting the kernel module might break things.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use an NTFS drive that contains my games and is also external to my installation of steam installed viawinetricks? I am new to using this site, but not really that new to ubuntu. I decided to do my best to get the things I love to work on linux. I do understand that there are some pretty good games on steam that work natively for linux, unfortunately they aren't my desired games.\nFirst my setup. \nI have ubuntu 14.04 LTS,\nI have 6 hard drives. Each are separate based on the type of files (Games,Application, Movies, Videos, and Ubuntu, and Windows) The Ubuntu drive is only a 40GB hd, and the only ext4 partition. \nTargeted Game DCUO (DC Universe Online)\nI know the game actually worked on 12.04, but my problem exist before that. So I mentioned already that my Ubuntu drive is really low on drive space. I am aware I can just buy a new hard drive. But I would like to avoid that for now and get an understanding to my problem.\nI wanted to know if it is possible to use an NTFS drive that was normally dedicated for games as a steamapps folder for wine steam. I do not mind reinstalling/deleting/etc the current steamapps that has my windows games.I have a pretty nice upload/download speeds. I just wanted to know of a way to setup steam on wine to also use that ntfs steamapps folder. Or making a new steam apps folder somewhere on one of my drives that has a much bigger capacity because I play a lot of mmo's.\n\nA: That is perfectly workable and is in fact what I do for my Steam on Wine. The SteamApps folder is shared with the one for Steam on Windows. You can either create a symbolic link (which is how I first used it) or add it properly as a second library folder (which is how I use it now). I haven't had any problems with it. Games installed in Wine show up fine in Windows and vice versa, but you might have to go through the installing/preparing stage once again to get prerequisites.\n", "Q: Is it possible to \"lock\" Firefox in one state and run it from that state?

(Evidence: fdisk is saying that the acceptable ranges of end points are 499712-501757, default 501757, which is between those two partitions.) There simply isn't enough space there to do that. Instead, tell fdisk to begin the partition at 104855552 (or later) and give it the default end value (unless you want to save some space for some other purpose). This should give you a partition that uses the rest of the available disk space, minus a bit of wastage near the beginning.\nAlternatively, you could use cfdisk, GParted, or some other tool that provides a more visual approach to partitioning, which will make such an error less likely.\n\nA: Most of the disk is in an LVM partition already, which lvm calls a physical volume.  LVM then divides up the space from physical volumes into logical volumes.  You can use the pvs or pvdisplay commands to show stats on the physical volumes and lvs or lvdisplay to see information on all of the logical volumes.  You should see that there is plenty of free space in the physical volume.  You then can use lvresize to expand a logical volume to use more of the space, as in:\nsudo lvresize vg00/slash -L +10g\n\nThat will add 10 gb to the logical volume named slash in the volume group vg00, which is apparently your root volume.  After that, you need to expand the filesystem to use that space, which assuming you are using the default ext4 filesystem with:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/vg0-slash\n\n", "Q: Should I install Ubuntu as 32 bit or 64 bit since i have 3GB ram?

If I could create an image on my cloud service, it would be simple. Problem, these are both hosted on 2 different cloud service (firehost and azure).\nI did not create the production server in question, but I need to make sure I at least have all of the same packages installed. I have tried:\ndpkg --get-selections \n\nand did a diff between the dpkg's for both servers, but since this list include all dependencies installed, which is quite a large list and would take a while to sort through. \n2 questions I guess: \n1.) Am I going about this the proper way?\nIf yes, \n2.) Can I get a list of just the top level packages installed? \n\nA: If you wish to do a comparison between the two, and have a movable list you could do:\ndpkg --get-selections>new.txt\n\nThis will take your output and send it to a text file ('new.txt'). From there you can use grep to search through. For example:\ngrep '^linux*' new.txt\n\nOr if you just need the packages quick combine the two\ndpkg --get-selections|grep '^linux*'> new.txt\n\nThe single quote holds what you are looking for the carat (^) makes the search start with 'linux' the asterisk (*) is a wildcard (anything after linux is shown).\nSo linuxhappy.txt will show, but happylinux.txt will not. If you need an exact package name use a $ instead of an asterisk.\nI am unsure of what you mean by 'top-level' packages exactly. I assume you mean you want to just get a list of programs which you can install, and then have the dependencies be resolved using apt-get or aptitude or Synaptic.\nIn that case if you look at: How to list dependent packages (reverse dependencies)? You should be able to see all of the dependencies you have. If you really want to see EVERY dependency for every program apt-cache dump, but that is extremely long.\n", "Q: Re-install font Ubuntu 14.04 I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.

Whenever I login after having updated and restarted a few days ago the entire interface is missing. The only things I can see are the background picture and a folder for Blender 3D. Launching Blender causes it to appear then promptly minimize into oblivion. Trying to right click and change the background gives me an error with gnome (as I think it is called) and the desktop terminal (control-alt-T) does not work either.

From my previous 'nix experience, I was under the impression it should stay running.  What am I doing wrong?  How to keep the process alive even after terminal logs out?  \n\nA: Even if you start with &, the process is a child of your shell, e.g., bash. When you log out, bash terminates, together with its children. If you want to have it running after logout, a different process has to start it. For example, for processes started at runtime, try writing an rc script and put its call into /etc/rc.local\n\nA: For a simpler solution, if not wanting to use rc.scripts, just launch it from any shell script with \n#!/bin/bash \n\nas the first line.  this automatically causes it to start under separate process\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 - Network card not showing up My network card isn't showing up when I run ifconfig or iwconfig, but it shows up when I run\nlspci -nn | grep 0280\n\n\nA: ifconfig shows the configuration of the network interfaces. iwconfig does the same for wireless interfaces. lspci shows information about hardware connected to the PCI bus.

It can be that your USB stick is bad (e.g. there are some which lie about their size and corrupt the data at the end).  It can be that your image writing software is bad.  It seems (from various pages on the internet) that Universal USB installer can incorrectly write files to the USB stick so that was probably the explanation in this case.  What you should do is find different software for writing the image and never use Universal-USB-Installer again.  \nYou should never install from a corrupt image because it's completely possible for things to work now and then later you end up with data corruption or worse.  If it does work that's just luck.  \n", "Q: Mount single logical partition from image of entire disk (device) The method below works to mount a primary partition from the disk image, but fails trying to mount a logical partition under an extended partition.

I think i installed windows with UEFI but either way i want windows gone. I am currently using ubuntu 14.04 LTS from a live usb. When I try to boot in UEFI mode I get a black screen and when I hit \"try ubuntu\" it dosent do anything,but in legacy mode it works fine. is it safe to install ubuntu in legacy mode (I dont plan on dual booting, i want to fully replace windows with ubuntu,meaning ubuntu wiping the drive and installing itself in windows place) btw I have windows 8.1 if that helps. i tried to install and it says no other operating systems found.\nDoes it even matter what mode I do it in? it will just wipe the drive and install ubuntu right? I have 4 partitions all windows so should i get rid of the recovery partitons before i install ubuntu or should i just leave them? sorry if this is confusing im a complete ubuntu noob and i just want some answers please. Thank you for your time :)\n\nA: There are advantages to EFI mode (such as faster boot times and better access to firmware settings from the OS), but for a single-boot installation, either should work fine, and neither should pose any danger of physical damage to the computer. Note the shoulds, though. There is at least one known bug that can cause EFIs to brick themselves if too much data is written to the NVRAM. This particular problem can occur in EFI mode but not in BIOS mode, though, so the greater risk actually lies in EFI mode. (This problem was responsible for the infamous Samsung bricking problem that caused a big frenzy about a year ago.) The Linux kernel now includes checks to avoid this problem while Linux is booted. It's conceivable that there are other risks out there that might affect either mode, but I know of no specific threat at the moment, aside from the bricking issue I just noted.\n\nA: It doesn't really matter which you install it in. If you need to install Ubuntu in Legacy Mode, go right ahead. I would recommend though that you try to delete all partitions before running the installer.\n", "Q: Why does my wallpaper look slightly desaturated? Here's a screenshot of the original image overlaid on top of the same image set as wallpaper. The original is far more saturated. \nIs this a bug or is there a setting I can tweak to get my wallpaper to be as saturated as the original image?\n\n\nA: The picture in question has an embedded color profile which can only be displayed by certain programs; Nautilus, which draws the desktop background, cannot. To be able to use the image as a desktop background, it needs to be converted.\nThe easiest way is to use Image Viewer to save the file as a .png. Open the file, then go to File -> Save As... Then either manually change the file extension or click the pull down menu that says All files and select .png. \nNow set the new image as your background and the colors will look right.\nIf you want to keep it as a .jpg, you'll need to use GIMP.

For more information see the answers to this question: How to change the default GCC compiler in Ubuntu?.\n\nA: Makefiles often use implicit rules to compile things, rather than defining the compiler specifically. In this case, the convention (and default) is to use $(CC), which defaults to cc. So if you type cc --version, you'll see what Makefiles use by default.\nThe Makefile may override the definition of CC though, or not use $(CC) at all. But is the convention (as it is within autoconf for configure scripts, too).\nAlso see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2969222/make-gnu-make-use-a-different-compiler\n\nA: make only does whatever the Makefile tells it to do. Most Makefiles will use the default gcc command, so karel's answer applies in most cases, but you should be aware that there's nothing that forces make to use the default GCC. (And for that matter, make can be used for a lot of things besides compiling C, so it might not even use GCC at all.)\n", "Q: How to speed up Ubuntu 14.04 in VirtualBox 4.3.10 My virtualbox running ubuntu 14.04 but seep is very slow.\nVirtualbox: 4.3.10\nUbuntu: 14.04\nVirtualbox addon: 4.3.10\nI have tried suggestion from post: Why does a Ubuntu guest in VirtualBox run very, very slowly?\nBut doesn't work.\n\nA: If your Ubuntu uses Unity, then it is natural Ubuntu runs very slow in Virtualbox.

For instance, on Ubuntu 14.04 the virtualbox package is up to date:\n$ sudo apt-cache policy virtualbox\nvirtualbox:\n  Installed: 4.3.10-dfsg-1\n  Candidate: 4.3.10-dfsg-1\n  Version table:\n *** 4.3.10-dfsg-1 0\n        500 http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/multiverse amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\n\nA: The fix for 14.04 is indeed different, but not that different:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential dkms\nsudo apt-get remove --purge virtualbox-dkms\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-dkms\n\nThe install virtualbox-dkms command was actually failing applying the 13.10 fix. By fully purging the package things got back to normal.\nUpdate [17-01-2015]: In the latest iteration of this bug a restart to the system is required between the apt-get remove command and the second apt-get install.\nUpdate [07-02-2016]: This fix is reportedly functional on Ubuntu 15.10.\nUpdate [29-09-2016]: This fix is also functional on Ubuntu 16.04.\n", "Q: Why do I get internet connection without a defined interface? I have an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine. I set the NAT networking option to it.\nWithout any further changes, I can access to internet from my VM. When I run: cat /etc/network/interfaces I get this:\nubuntu14@ubuntu14:~$ cat /etc/network/interfaces\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nHow come I get internet connection without any interface defined for my NAT ?\n\nA: Interfaces are started automatically during the boot process. This is for for example eth0 for the first ethernet \nThe entries for lo (loopback) are generally required and may also when using the Network Manager can not be removed or other graphical configuration tool.\nGenerally, /etc/network/interfaces  contains   network   interface   configuration\ninformation  for the ifup and ifdown commands.  This is where you configure how your system is connected to the network.\nUnless you manually configured /etc/network/interfaces with\niface <Interface> <Protocoll> <Method>\nYour interface gets DHCP and connects you to the network.\nThese two entries:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nare fundamental components of Linux. If these entry's are gone, interfaces can no longer communicate with each other.\nRead More about network interface configuration. \nFinally, I guess your VM gets a bridge interface from your host. You can list all your interfaces running ifconfig -a and you can see which interface connecting you to the internet. \n\nA: /etc/network/interfaces is only used for manually configured networking. \nYour VM can access the internet because Ubuntu uses network-manager to configure the network. The configuration is stored in the directory /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ Try nmcli nm or nmcli d to see the current network status.\n", "Q: How to install Microsoft Office 2013 on Ubuntu 14.04? My system is running on Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit) and I have already installed wine-1.6.2, and when I go and double click on setup.exe icon, I get the following Setup Error dialog:\n\nSetup can't  find or validate an installation file.

The problem is that as this happens after logging in, Nautilus during the session start cannot find them and thus ignores them so they don't appear in the left panel.\nWorkaround #1: I can open the Nautilus' bookmarks editor, rearrange the bookmarks back and forth and Nautilus reloads their list in the left panel. However, it's annoying to do it manually all the time.\nWorkaround #2: I can kill Nautilus as suggested in another question and when I start it again, it shows all the bookmarks. Unfortunately this requires opening Nautilus because after killing it, all the desktop icons disappear.\nQUESTION: Is there some other way I can force this reload? Something I could incorporate into a bash script and make it happen automatically few minutes after the session start.\nNote: Please, don't suggest use of another file manager. I know that for example Nemo doesn't have this problem but this question is about finding solution for Nautilus.\n\nA: Restarting nautilus is fairly easy:\nnautilus -q\nnautilus -n &\ndisown\n\nUnfortunately sometimes this sequence of commands doesn't work, probably due to some race condition. And so we might have to do a pkill or killall.\nTo watch the mount point directory of the encrypted volume, you can poll a file within it:\nFILE=/path/to/some/file/in/encrypted/volume\nwhile sleep 10s; do\n    if [[ -f $FILE ]]; then\n        pkill nautilus # or nautilus -q\n        nautilus -n &\n        disown\n        exit\n    fi\ndone\n\nI mistakenly assumed that inotify could be used, but it can't since mounting is involved.\n", "Q: 404 not found - error while updating using aptitude W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring-security/restricted/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.88.153 80]\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring-security/universe/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.88.153 80]\n\n\nA: When you run it, apt-get is not able to find the directory in the server.  \nWith a browser you can try to follow the link http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/raring-security/restricted/binary-i386/Packages and you will find an error because it doesn't exist anymore the directory. \nIf you rise the path you will have the first non error page in  http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/.

The correct form of your commands will be:\nFirst command\nsudo sh -c \"echo export MSF_DATABASE_CONFIG=/opt/metasploit-framework/database.yml >> /etc/profile\"\n\nExplanation: this command does concatenation (text insertion) with the text \"export MSF_DATABASE_CONFIG=/opt/metasploit-framework/database.yml\" into your /etc/profile.

Also, just in case, the latest version of VirtualBox is actually 4.3.14, which you might consider upgrading to. \nBut more likely, if you only enabled USB 2.0 after having installed Windows, you might have to remove and re-add the USB controller from the Windows Device Manager, as it may have originally detected and selected a driver which isn't actually appropriate. Of course, the Hail-Mary option is outright reinstalling Windows (perhaps to a new VM or at least a new snapshot) since sometimes that's faster than fiddling around with getting Windows to re-detect its hardware properly.\n", "Q: Realtek RTL8187B stopped working I have Ubuntu 13.10 Server running 3.11 kernel\nI had RTL8187B working out of the box but after installing Atheros driver (for another adapter) my RealTek stopped working, I used BackPorts to install the Atheros driver\nI looked at /lib/modules/ and the module wasn't recently modified but when I try modprobe rtl8187 I get ERROR: could not insert 'rtl8187': Invalid argument\nThis is the output of  dmesg | tail\n\n[ 3097.162711] rtl8187: disagrees about version of symbol wiphy_rfkill_start_polling\n[ 3097.162716] rtl8187: Unknown symbol wiphy_rfkill_start_polling (err -22)\n[ 3097.162739] rtl8187: disagrees about version of symbol ieee80211_unregister_hw\n[ 3097.162744] rtl8187: Unknown symbol ieee80211_unregister_hw (err -22)\n[ 3097.162757] rtl8187: disagrees about version of symbol ieee80211_beacon_get_tim\n[ 3097.162761] rtl8187: Unknown symbol ieee80211_beacon_get_tim (err -22)\n[ 3097.162800] rtl8187: disagrees about version of symbol ieee80211_rx_irqsafe\n[ 3097.162805] rtl8187: Unknown symbol ieee80211_rx_irqsafe (err -22)\n[ 3097.162828] rtl8187: disagrees about version of symbol ieee80211_rts_duration\n[ 3097.162833] rtl8187: Unknown symbol ieee80211_rts_duration (err -22)\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: You can get both ath9k and rtl8187 in backports-3.15 with:\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-3.15.1-1  <--or wherever you extracted it\nmake clean\nmake defconfig-wifi\nmake -j4\nsudo make install\n\nBackports currently won't compile on the latest Ubuntu kernels so I suggest that, for now, you stick with 13.10. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1342703\nYou will have compiled the drivers for your currently running kernel only.

To install it, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install ntp\n\n\n\nA: Usually, ntp.ubuntu.com. This is supported by example preseed files and the value used by the server and network installation methods (for which, the debug output shows ntp.ubuntu.com as the value for the NTP server). To check the server status and time, you can run ntpdate in debug mode (to see if there are other problems), or in query mode (to just see the time):\nntpdate -d ntp.ubuntu.com # Debug mode\nntpdate -q ntp.ubuntu.com # Query mode\n\n\nA: ntpdate is deprecated. You can use this command to get the status and see which server is being used:\nsystemctl status systemd-timesyncd\n\n\nA: As already pointed out in SaTa's answer, this is now managed by systemd, with the systemd-timesyncd service.\nThe configuration is in /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.\nUse the timedatectl command and it's variations with arguments to see all the info.

A better way would be to use a feature called \"chroot\".\n\"chroot\", short for \"change root\", just does that: It changes the root of the directory tree the (FTP) user can acccess to what the admin wants it to be. Sometimes the same feature is referred to as \"jailing\" the user in their home directory.\nMost FTP servers support chroot (with the exception of some very small, bare-bone ones). I'm not really familiar with vsftpd, but according to this how-to on Cybercity you need to set the config directive chroot_local_user to 1.\n\nA: As the owner/root, execute:\nchmod 700 -r [directory]\n\n700 means that only the owner has full access, -r means to apply the rules to subfolders.

It is a bug and should be corrected on the package level.\nHowever, if you want to correct your setup right away, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install poedit:\nsudo apt install poedit\n\n\n*Backup the existing file:\ncd /usr/share/locale-langpack/tr/LC_MESSAGES\nsudo cp gnome-screenshot.mo gnome-screenshot-backup.mo\n\n\n*Download a recent .po file with Turkish translations. I found one here, modified today: https://l10n.gnome.org/vertimus/gnome-screenshot/master/po/tr. It already contains the correction suggested in @aquaherd's answer.\n\n*Open the downloaded file with poedit, and \"compile\" the file to /usr/share/locale-langpack/tr/LC_MESSAGES/gnome-screenshot.mo. A .po file is a human-readable text file. A .mofile is just a compressed, binary format of the .po file.\nThe next time you use the screenshot utility, it will use the correct filename format.\n", "Q: Ubuntu hardware requirements and best version \n*\n\n*Processor Intel Celeron D \n\n*RAM 780 mb \n\n*Hard disk 500gb updated sata  \n\n*Lg cd/DVD writer \n\n\nI don't know software programming. Can install a CD, so I need simple instructions.\n\nA: The main branch of Ubuntu will run in the hardware you have listed.\nHowever it will feel rather slow.\nMy suggestion is to run Lubuntu or Xubuntu, these two variants of Ubuntu requires less resources, and you'll have a better experience.\nDetailed info:\nThe main branch of Ubuntu 14.04 by default comes with Unity user interface (optionally you can get it with the Gnome user interface), both of these will work in your old machine, but it will feel very slow, not recommended.\nXubuntu 14.04 is the same as Ubuntu, but running XFCE user interface (like WinXP), it's less fancy looking than Unity, but it does the job well, still very customizable, Xubuntu is a good medium ground between fancy Ubuntu and dry Lubuntu, it should run smooth enough on that old hardware.\nLubuntu 14.04 uses the LXDE user interface (like Win95) is even leaner and lighter than Xubuntu, it works well even on 486 machines, so if Xubuntu feel slow for you, you can try Lubuntu. \nI usually salvage old machines to donate them for people that needs it, and I put Xubuntu on Pentium 2 to early generation of Pentium 4 machines, Lubuntu on 486 and Pentium 1 machines, any AMD/Intel machine built after Pentium 4 generation tends to runs well on the main branch of Ubuntu.\nMake sure to get the i386 version of the CD ISO instead of the AMD64.\n", "Q: Access to different directories I have recently moved to Ubuntu 12.04 and noticed that in some directories I can't even create a  directory or file (e.g:/var/lib). I know about the command chmod, but is it appropriate to use it in order to modify the access to these sort of directories?\nFor example I wanted to install something from the command line but gave me an error because it didn't have access and I thought that for security reasons I shouldn't change it.\n\nA: No, you shouldn't mess with those directories: there's a good reason why you cannot modify them by default.\nYou use the Ubuntu Software Center or the command apt-get (in a terminal) to install new software on Ubuntu. While you have not learned the basics of Linux, it's not recommended you modify these directories by hand.\nFor example, to install the Chromium browser via the terminal you run:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-browser\n\nOr graphically,\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Dash (tapping the Windows/Super key)\n\n*Type software center and select Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Search for chromium web browser on the software center\n\n*Install the search result (you can read a description of the app, too).\n\n", "Q: How do I stop the screen from fading out and powering off, on lock-screen?

While this is beneficial if I am gone for longer periods (thus it kicks in via timeout) it is tedious, to have to wait for the screens to power back up, when I am only away for a short period.\nSo, is it possible to disable the immediate screen power-off, when I do a lock - while still keeping the timeout power-off that comes when the computer is idle?\n\nA: Depending on the flavor of screensaver you use, there are power settings for the screensaver.

It is working fine, the only issue is that I don't know how to manage these clients.\nFor example if a client has not payed to use Internet, I need to be able to disconnect him/her and reconnect him/her once the payment has been done. The only way that I know is to edit the /etc/freeradius/users file and comment the Framed-IP-Address line which is not easy to do every time. Also, I fear that I might accidentally damage the file if I continue accessing it everyday and modifying it.\nI would like to know if there is any other way to do this (preferably through a web client). I found one called Dialupadmin web interface, but I don't know if I have to install Freeradius from scratch to be able to use the web interface or if I can just install this and use the existing Freeradius without re-installation.\n\nA: You can simply use any web management interface like radiusdesk, dialup-admin or dalo-radius.\nThose are web management interfaces that allow you to store, delete or update your Freeradius users profiles.\nReferences:-\nDaloradius: here\nDialup-admin: here\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu support UPS out of the box?

All UPS continue to work without the USB/serial connection.\nDepending on what model UPS you have, you may have to run different software. e.g. the powstatd package provides software for what it calls \"dumb\" UPS. gunpower and upsd are other packages which do similar things. You may have to figure out which works best for your needs.\n\nA: I know that APC UPS works straight out of the box without additional software,\nUbuntu since 10.04 (perhaps even earlier) to the latest 14.04 will detect the UPS automatically if it's connected by the USB cable.\nNot sure if other brands are detected automatically.\n", "Q: lxsession-default tasks broken Using Lubuntu.\nWhen I hit Ctrl-Alt-Del, it logs me out to the login screen.

Perhaps U can help me ?\n\nA: There are two parts to this answer only one of which I can help you with:  The first part is that you need to make sure that your printer is connecting to your wireless network. You can consult the owners manual for doing this.\nFor the second part:\nOn your computer, open a terminal window  - press ctrl+alt+t  Enter the command\nhp-setup\nThis opens the HP Device Manager setup window.

I use 5 physical machines HP compaq 6000 Pro. When I turn on one of these machines, it correctly does PXE boot from the MAAS cluster controller and in the MAAS console it is shown as \"declared\". There is a warning icon next to the hostname with error:\nThis node does not have a power type set and MAAS will be unable to control it.

Again, if I try to start the, it wont do anything, but if I power it on manually, it works just fine.\nEDIT:\nIt seems that the problem is related to having two NICs - the magic packet is only sent over the eth1 (even though the cluster is correctly configured indicating p1p1 as the managed interface) which is incorrect (sudo tcpdump -i eth1 port 9 -vvvv -s0 -n).

I run another system ( I used this with LMDE, kernel 3.11, now I'm on Debian (see above)), however the solution I have linked was tried with the following setups:\n\n\n* \n  \n*Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS, linux kernel 3.13.0.49, gcc 4.8.2 \n  \n*Ubuntu 15.04, linux kernel 3.19.0-15, gcc 4.9.2\n\n\nSo there might be a good chance, that this will work for you.\nThe author(s) simply modified the MT7610U linux driver from the MediaTek homepage to compile for your device as well as a couple of other ones based on the same chipset.\nIf you feel like it, you can probably run some command to diff the linked source and the one from MediaTek since directory trees and source file are probably no different from the MediaTek source.\nUPDATE: There is another site that may be helpful, if you want to go into fixing the original source yourself instead of following the above instructions:\nhttp://hprath.com/2014/06/cisco-linksys-ae6000-ac580-media-tek-mt7610u-mt7630u-mt7650u-linux-x64-driver-patch/ \n\nA: There is now a linux driver for this device on the TP-LINK website: http://www.tp-link.com/lb/download/Archer-T2U_V1.html#Driver\n\nA: This device currently does not work with linux.\nThe MediaTek MT7610 USB driver is the closest match for this device, however as of version 3.0.0.4_20130913 it does not directly support the T2U. I added the USB ID of the T2U to the driver, which allowed me to find networks but not to connect to any one of them. It looks like receiving of packets works, but sending or some part of network association fails.\nUnfortunately, I had no success with ndiswrapper either. The suggested method is to get ndiswrapper installed, add the XP driver, and use that:\napt-get install ndiswrapper-source ndisgtk\ndkms autoinstall ndiswrapper\nndiswrapper -i Driver\\ Files/Windows\\ XP\\ 64bit/RT2870.inf\nmodprobe ndiswrapper\n\nHowever, both the driver supplied on CD-ROM and the official 140523 download fails to load with ndiswrapper on a 64-bit machine:\nndiswrapper (import:232): unknown symbol: ntoskrnl.exe:'ExEventObjectType'\nndiswrapper (import:232): unknown symbol: ntoskrnl.exe:'__chkstk'\nndiswrapper (load_sys_files:200): couldn't prepare driver 'rt2870'\nndiswrapper (load_wrap_driver:103): couldn't load driver rt2870; check system log for messages from 'loadndisdriver'\n\nThis approach might work for you on 32-bit Linux, or maybe not.\n\nA: I have a HP Pavilion 360 notebook.

Then I selected installation from the grub menu that offered no boot other than DVD.\nDuring installation, the installer claimed there was no operating system. (It did\nnot see Windows/8.)  It said that it was reformatting.\nAfter installation the system would not boot at all from hard drive.  It said to insert a bootable device and reboot (words not exact).\nI found info online about \"Boot-Repair\".\nI went through the Boot-Repair procedure.  During the installation of boot-repair there was a message \"/usr/share/boot-sav/gui-g2slaunch.sh line 29 5850 segmentation fault ...\"\nBut boot-repair was installed, so I ran it.  It said \"EFI detected. Please check options.\" There was no clue what options or what to check.  But I clicked OK.  I then ran bootinfo summary.  That seemed to go ok.  So I re-ran boot-repair for the repair action.  The commands it asked me to paste and run seemed to go ok.  After the repair the URL is paste.ubuntu.com/7807769.  The machine will not boot anything from the hard drive.  While booted from DVD it looked as if ubuntu was on sda2 and that sda1 was vfat.\nQuestions re bios:  (1) do I want \"secure boot\"?  (2) do I want UEFI?\nShould I try to install again?  Or are there possible repairs while booted from DVD?\nWhat should I do?\nThanks.\n\nA: Secure Boot is usually OK, but can sometimes cause problems, so it's best to disable it during troubleshooting. Ideally, it will provide some added protection against pre-boot malware (which usually targets Windows but can theoretically affect any OS), so it's worth having -- IF it doesn't cause any other problems. It's possible that Secure Boot is causing your problems, but I suspect a defective firmware.\nYour Boot Repair output indicates that Ubuntu should be booting; however, some EFIs have known problems that prevent the system from booting anything but the Windows boot loader (or a program with the same name as the Windows boot loader). There are a number of ways you can overcome this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look for an updated firmware from your computer's manufacturer. (They'll probably call it a \"BIOS update\" or words to that effect, although it's technically not a BIOS.) After doing this, you may need to re-install a boot manager (see below).\n\n*Using Boot Repair, click the Advanced item and select the option to back up and replace the Windows boot loader. (I don't recall the precise phrasing of this option.) Once this is done, GRUB should theoretically come up.\n\n*Download the CD-R or USB flash drive image of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare an image with it. If that image starts, it should boot Ubuntu just fine. If that works, you can either continue booting with rEFInd on the external medium or install the Debian package in Ubuntu. If that works as-is, then great. If rEFInd also fails to start from hard disk, then you can boot to Ubuntu using the USB drive or CD-R, open a Terminal window, and type mvrefind.sh /boot/efi/EFI/refind /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT. (Note the doubling-up of efi, once in lowercase and once in uppercase.) This mvrefind.sh command essentially does what the Boot Repair option to replace the Windows boot loader does, but with rEFInd rather than GRUB.\n\n*Since the computer is new, return it to the store and buy another model. Make it clear (in a letter to Toshiba, if nothing else) why you're returning it. Manufacturers have had more than enough time to fix these problems in their firmware, and yet they keep delivering garbage. They do this because few people complained about the garbage in the first couple generations of EFI firmware, and they'll continue delivering it for years more if people keep accepting it.\n\n*Enter the firmware setup utility and find whatever options exist to control the boot mode. Set the computer to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and to disable (if possible) EFI/UEFI mode. You can then re-install Ubuntu in BIOS mode, which should set up a BIOS-mode version of GRUB; or run Boot Repair in BIOS mode to do the same without actually re-installing anything.\n\n", "Q: How to reset a VM to a previous snapshot?

Why approximately in before I can use 3D and now can not?\n\n*How to get back my Ubuntu 3D session?\n\n\nA: Problem\nThe actual problem was Ubuntu switched to use wrong driver. In this case, NVIDIA Noveau llvmpipe. \nSolution\nSwitch Ubuntu to use the correct driver. In this case, Mesa DRI Intel(R) Sandybridge Mobile x86/MMX/SSE2.\nWalkthrough\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2234888\nConclusion\nThis problem was solved. \n", "Q: Is there any reason to use 'kill' instead of 'killall'/'pkill'? Starting my adventure with Linux a couple of years back, most tutorials and older, more experienced colleagues suggested using the command 'kill', sort of like a replacement for the Process Manager from Windows for a convert. But I also got (not sure if correctly) a sense of pro smugness about this command.\nHowever, based on my own inquires I soon stared to use the 'killall' function, as I always had a problem with PIDs. However I just now learned that there is also a command 'pkill', which basically does the same thing. Also I learned that the proper way to use 'kill' is to use 'ps -A | grep ...'.\nBut isn't this procedure exactly the same thing as just using 'pkill', or 'killall'? (I've read What's the difference between 'killall' and 'pkill'?, so I know that those 2 are a little different.)\nWhy use kill at all, when we still have to do the identification: name of the\nprocess -> PID in order to use 'kill'?\n\nA: kill is an important part of Unix because it can kill a specific process even if another process has the same name. A Unix/Linux system will have kill but it may not have pkill or killall: in general, all Linux/Unix applications will always behave like kill exists on the system. Every admin should know how to use kill as it calls directly the system's inner process killing function and is less likely to have a bug, because it is simple.Do not remove kill from your system or it will stop working.\nkill is used very often in the system itself: the applications can ignore the name of a process and use the PID which is different for every process; also, if an application needs to memorize a huge number of processes it is always better to memorize them as PIDs, because a number eats less memory than a string. Of course there are may other secondary implications that should be discussed on a specialized programming forum.\nIn your daily routine, you can use killall or pkill without fear. :-)\nPlease, feel free to comment under here if you have more questions and don't forget to press the left UP arrow and mark as favorite if I'm of any help.\n", "Q: is there any calculator in software centre which could solve quadratic equations?

It seems you're trying to install the juju client on a machine, provisioned by MAAS. If you want to use juju to deploy services on MAAS, you'll need to install juju on your machine and configure your $HOME/.juju/environments.yaml with credentials for your MAAS (see the MAAS documentation for details - http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs/juju-quick-start.html). Then, you can use juju bootstrap from your machine to create an environment and later juju deploy to deploy some services.\n", "Q: SLAPd - TLS not working / apparmor Errors I've been trying to get LDAP working and set up for a few days now.  The real head scratcher is that everything went fine until I got to the point of setting up TLS.  I was using this guide from the official Ubuntu documentation site.\nDoing this produced a really high number of errors that resulted in slapd not being able to restart.\nMost of the errors had to do with apparmor not allowing permissions to parts of the computer, but one error in particular kept coming back around.\n\nTLS init def ctx failed: -1\n\nCompletely stumped!\n\nA: The answer turned out to be that the instructions given in the guide I was following did not produce a usable TLS certificate.  I tested this by trying to use the generated certificate on other services (dovecot and postfix) which made them fail too.\nI ended up using this guide, also from the official Ubuntu documentation to configure a self-signed CA (as suggested in the OpenLDAP documentation).  The keys/certs this creates work perfectly and I'm even able to use the same cert/key for all of my TLS/SSL enabled services.  Since this is for internal use, they are all self signed but gives me the option to make more easily.\nThe apparmor problem was very strange as well.  I was getting a lot of errors to do with p11-kit and pkcs11.  Doing some research I found that these seem to be tools ralted to certificates.  I added the following lines to my /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.slapd file.\n/usr/share/p11-kit/modules/ r,\n/usr/share/p11-kit/modules/* r,\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/ m,\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/* m,\n\nNow the sldap server starts without a problem with TLS ready for use.\nI hope this helps someone.\n\nA: I just encountered the same error, but ended up fixing it by ensuring that slapd had read permission on the private key file used for TLS\nsudo usermod -a -G ssl-cert openldap\n\nI messed around with the apparmor stuff mentioned by the OP in his answer for a while, but even after getting all the apparmor errors to go away, slapd wasn't starting.\n", "Q: server time drift not fixed by ntp.conf This question was asked a lot in the past, but since ntpdate has been depricated, I'm having issues finding answers that work via ntp.conf.

It wasn't actually a problem with the machine itself, but with hyper-v.  Apparently Hyper-v is a terrible choice for linux virtualization.

My first recommendation is to install Synaptic (sudo apt-get install synaptic) and just use Synaptic instead of Ubuntu Software Center (USC). You can do anything USC can do with Synaptic. You don't have to use Terminal anymore if you have Synaptic. You can configure your PPA in Synaptic plus so many features USC doesn't have yet, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Proxy auth settings.\n\n*KB/s information when downloading\n\n*Create download script for offline installation.\n\n*and many more. \n\n\n\n", "Q: Unable to create working installation media for Ubuntu I have tried to burn versions 12.4 LTS, and version 14.04 LTS to a DVD and the last time it said the disk was verified, but when I open the discs there is nothing burned on them. The image for 14.04 LTS is too big to burn on a 700Mb CD data disc, and I can't seem to get it into a DVD.\nI have the 12.04.1 LTS disc that I had burned 2 years ago, it worked fine on several desktops, but it doesn't work on my laptop.  It installs but with errors and the programs won't start right. For some reason none of the ISO file downloads will work or burn on any of my laptops or desktops now. I have tried it on 5 altogether. \nAny ideas how to solve this issue? \n\nA: As a general recommendations, check md5sum - you need to compare both: first, the md5sum of a downloaded file first. \nSecond, the md5sum of a CD/DVD after you burn it. Both must match the original one, taken from Ubuntu hashes:\nIf you run Linux currently and want to check this ISO without having CD/DVD ot USB, you can run it as LIVE from you hardrive. It will cover all the compliance, because my the time it has started, Kernel, modules, drivers, apps and most subsytems(audio, video, network) are running, which is the same for your machine after installation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Place your ISO file to /live:\n\n\nsudo mkdit /live\nsudo cp somelinux.iso /live\n\n\n*\n\n*Add new menu entry to the grub.cfg\nsudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nmenuentry 'ISO Ubuntu 14.04 2014 Live' --class os --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --group group_main {\n                set isofile=\"/live/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso\"\n\n         insmod ext2\n         insmod loopback\n         insmod iso9660      \n                loopback loop (hd0,msdos5)$isofile      \n\n                linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz.efi  file=(loop)/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed noprompt boot=casper persistent iso-scan/filename=/$isofile quiet splash --\n                initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz\n\n\n}\n\nTO DO: \n\n\n*\n\n*change in the menu entry above the code name for your partition, holding /live/somelinux.iso, in my case it's hd0,msdos5 because it is on /dev/sda5/\n\n*change the file name from somelinux.iso to yours, in my case I have: ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n\n\n*\n\n*update GRUB\n\n\n\nsudo update-grub\n\n\n*\n\n*reboot\n\n", "Q: xdg-open opens chrome but does not load the URL \"xdg-open http://www.google.ca\" in a command line opens my default browser(google-chrome) but does not load the URL.\nIf I change my default browser to Firefox the URL loads just fine.\nAny ideas?\nI'm running 14.04.\n\nA: It's because the .desktop file that Chrome installs in your home (in ~/.local/share/applications) is bad. Either add a %U to the end of the Exec= line, like so:\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/chrome %U\n\nor remove it and let your system pick up the one Chrome itself ships in /usr/share.\n", "Q: Black screen after installing hardware support I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS on my VMware Player. Update Manager popped up this morning with a bunch of updates and I installed them and restarted the OS - I didn't face any problems at all. But I remembered that the Update Manager said \"New hardware support is available\" on the top, and had a button to install the \"hardware support\". So I started Update Manager again and saw the same message and button. I clicked on that button and after it installed, I restarted the OS using the \"Restart Now\" button. Upon restart, the login screen showed up, and after I logged in by entering my password, the screen became completely BLACK. I waited for several minutes, but nothing happened.\nAfter a bit of searching the Internet, I came to know that I can access the terminal from the login screen itself, so I restarted Ubuntu by resetting VMware Player and when the login screen came up, I clicked CTRL + ALT + F1 and a terminal program came up on the screen. I am unsure as to what I should do now. Please help.\nBy the way, I just remembered - when I clicked on the Install button for the hardware support, I saw a message that said that some graphics thing is no longer going to be maintained starting 8/7/2014 and a new graphics driver or something is the new hardware support.\n\n\nA: Install the driver package using the command:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-radeon\n\nIf it is already installed, then purge and reinstall: \nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove xserver-xorg-video-radeon \\\n&& sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-radeon\n\nYou might need to reboot your system for the changes to take effect. (You can reboot from the command line issuing sudo reboot.)\n\nA: I'm having the same issue after doing the Hardware Update.  If I select \"Ubuntu 2D\" I can login without getting a black screen.  However, the normal \"Ubuntu\" login gets a black screen.  It did not update me to 14.04 like Sanapci said, lsb_release -a still shows Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS\".\nIf I wait a while the lock screen displays, but as soon as I enter my password at the lock screen, it goes back to a black screen.\nI can get back to the login screen from the black screen by using Cntrl-alt-F1, logging in, and doing a \"service lightdm restart\".\nI have an nVidia graphics card, but this is a VM running VMware unlike the original poster.\nI tried downgrading the kernel back to 3.5.0 from 3.13.  I tried reinstalling the VMware tools.  I tried renaming the .config directory.  I tried doing a \"unity --reset\" while logged into \"Ubuntu 2D.\"\n/var/log/syslog fills up with errors like the following when I try to log in:\nJul 18 14:54:50 ubu kernel: [  688.305188] CPU: 1 PID: 13929 Comm: compiz Tainted: GFO 3.13.0-32-generic #57~precise1-Ubuntu\nJul 18 14:54:50 ubu kernel: [  688.305190] Hardware name: VMware, Inc.

I need to setup password for GRUB2 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS amd64. The setup I am trying to reach is to have [e]dit and [c]onsole options protected by password, but booting of operating system entries (Ubuntu, Windows) unprotected.\nI have studied Grub2/Passwords (it is outdated, quite chaotic and hardly readable by the way) and it seems that I need to set up the superuser password and add --unrestricted option to menu entries. OK, but where exactly do I have add this --unrestricted option?\nIf in the /boot/grub/grub.cfg then it is not the most clever idea, because this file is overwritten each time grub-update is run. So this is not an option for me, because - let's assume that - I like to change GRUB background image twice a week. Moreover, /boot/grub/grub.cfg readability is far from perfect; it is still not obvious where to put the --unrestricted option.\nIf in the menu entry files in the/etc/grub.d/*, then it is even worse than editing /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Those files are quite a mess in the terms of readability so editing them is all the more difficult.\nIs there any clean and easy method of setting GRUB2 password up as I described? Maybe some brilliant documentation other than the one I linked in this post?\n\nA: According to the section on protecting entries:\n\nThere is currently no automated method of adding users or designating menu items to be protected. The user must manually edit the GRUB 2 scripts. The GRUB 2 menu is a compilation of the inputs of several scripts. The /etc/grub.d/10_linux file is responsible for adding the default Ubuntu OS to the GRUB 2 menu. [...] The majority of these sections are devoted to editing the default scripts located in the /etc/grub.d/ folder.\n\nAnd in the next section:\n\nThe GRUB 2 menu includes selections for operating systems other than the default Ubuntu OS via the /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober script. [...] This would include other Ubuntu and Linux installations, Windows, etc.\nThe 30_os-prober script looks for specific types of operating systems. The user can make the changes for all of the OS's via a single command, or individually by OS type as documented below.\n\nSo, it seems you will have to edit the files in /etc/grub.d/. At least for adding a superuser, you needn't edit one of those files, but can create a new file:\n\nThe superuser/user information and password do not have to be contained in the /etc/grub.d/00_header file. The information can be placed in any /etc/grub.d file as long as that file is incorporated into grub.cfg. The user may prefer to enter this data into a custom file, such as /etc/grub.d/40_custom so it is not overwritten should the Grub package be updated. If placing the information in a custom file, do not include the \"cat << EOF\" and \"EOF\" lines as the content is automatically added from these files.\n\nThese paragraphs remain relevant until the official GRUB documentation says otherwise:\n\nThe grub-mkconfig program does not yet have built-in support for generating configuration files with authentication.\n\n(Whatever that's supposed to mean.)\n\nUp to Ubuntu 12.04\nHere are the outdated instructions for protecting menu entries:\n\nIn /etc/grub.d/10_linux, find the following line:\nprintf \"menuentry '${title}' ${CLASS} {\\n\" \"${os}\" \"${version}\"\n\nAdd --users '' :\nprintf \"menuentry '${title}' ${CLASS} --users '' {\\n\" \"${os}\" \"${version}\"\n\n\nFor all the entries in 30_os-prober:\nsudo sed 's/--class os /--class os --users /' -i /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober\n\nUbuntu Packages doesn't list Ubuntu 12.10, so I am not sure if 12.10 uses the old method or the new one.\nUbuntu 13.04 and later\nNow, the 10_linux file uses echo instead of printf:\necho \"menuentry '$(echo \"$title\" | grub_quote)' ${CLASS} \\$menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-$version-$type-$boot_device_id' {\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\n\nAnd the 30_os-prober file uses cat and heredocs:\n# The minix entry\ncat << EOF\nmenuentry \"${LONGNAME} (on ${DEVICE}, Multiboot)\" {\nEOF\n# The hurd entry\ncat << EOF\nmenuentry '$(echo \"${LONGNAME} $onstr\" | grub_quote)' --class hurd --class gnu --class os \\$menuentry_id_option 'osprober-gnuhurd-/boot/gnumach.gz-false-$(grub_get_device_id \"${DEVICE}\")' {\nEOF\n\nSo you can stick the --user \"\" part somewhere before the menuentry ends (before the brace opens).\nRemember to backup any files you modify, and run update-grub after modification.\n\nA: Configure superusers. To do this, for example, add the following lines to /etc/grub.d/00_header:\n# Support user protection on entries\ncat << EOF\nset superusers=\"admin\"\npassword_pbkdf2 admin grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.8E51188BE7DF732DDF102C918DEC152087558E04DA843B4A74C3EA8374BAB1ECA493399D62E3F2779F55C5BE2E8B65B8636113A99C09BFB892DB64626337904C.3016474FE6B420DBE6371B41D9BE8471B135CDF4BE674AC1265D3BA123CD9E459E960AEC199AB8C7C1C1A6BAF45314C64591E85E404AB54F4777E032A50CC731\nEOF\n\nUpdate the encrypted password using the output of grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command. In our example, what you need to change is the following information:\ngrub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.8E51188BE7DF732DDF102C918DEC152087558E04DA843B4A74C3EA8374BAB1ECA493399D62E3F2779F55C5BE2E8B65B8636113A99C09BFB892DB64626337904C.3016474FE6B420DBE6371B41D9BE8471B135CDF4BE674AC1265D3BA123CD9E459E960AEC199AB8C7C1C1A6BAF45314C64591E85E404AB54F4777E032A50CC731\n\nEdit the /etc/grub.d/10_linux file and look for line 129 (in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS). In its pristine form, it should look like the following:\necho \"menuentry '$(echo \"$os\" | grub_quote)' ${CLASS} \\$menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-simple-$boot_device_id'     {\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\n\nHere, add the --unrestricted option after the CLASS variable to complete the configuration line:\necho \"menuentry '$(echo \"$os\" | grub_quote)' ${CLASS} --unrestricted \\$menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-simple-$boot_device_id' {\" | sed \"s/^/$submenu_indentation/\"\n\nRebuild /boot/grub/grub.cfg. To do this you run the sudo update-grub command.\nReboot the system and try. \nNow you should have a configuration where: \n\n\n*\n\n*The main Ubuntu operating system entry will boot up normally but no one except the superusers will be able to edit the related entry in the list.\n\n*Only the superusers will be able to boot and edit all other entries in the list.\n\nSee also:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sec-GRUB_2_Password_Protection.html\n", "Q: Can I donate less than $1 to Ubuntu?

Is that possible? \n\nA: Yes You can do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Help shape the future of Ubuntu...\n\n*Set all input value to 0\n\n*But in last input do this steps:\nAt first, Right click on the last input and select inspect element And then set the value to 0.5 (exp.)\n\nthen click on Pay with PayPal\nAnd you will see this:\n\n\nA: Regular donation?\nYou cannot give less than 1$ to ubuntu via the standard contribution page.\nThere is probably a practical reason for this: receiving payments also costs money. If payments are small (here < 1$) it will cost more money to accept the payment/contribution than the money that Ubuntu will make with the contribution. This could be exploited and hence the form on the contribution page does not allow it.\nAlternatives?\nIf there is a particular reason why you want to donate this amount, you could contact canonical. If not, you could try to do something good for the community (ask questions here, for instance) instead of paying something for ubuntu.\nAs you know Ubuntu is opensource. Here is what you could do if you really want to give your amount.\n\n*\n\n*Choose a core dev (maybe someone who maintains a package you like). Check https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev for instance\n\n*Check whether s/he has a https://gratipay.com/ account.\n\n*If so, you can donate very small amounts (-1$) to that person or to a number of people. This might be on a weekly basis, but I guess you could drop out quite soon.\n\n\nA: No, not through a donation: The website where the donation page is shown when you download Ubuntu accepts decimals in the input but it does not accept it after you confirm and will change it to a whole dollar minimum. Simple reason: it probably will cost more to accept the amount than the amount itself.\nBut there is a way. Sort of. The closest you get to 0.50 is through the Ubuntu shop: Kubuntu Ballpoint Pen White/Blue at the moment costs 0.63 USD (normal price is 1.11 USD). So if you consider the 0.50 USD a donation, the pen would cost you 0.13 USD.

This command is provided by a number of different MTAs, such as postfix, or classic sendmail itself.\nIf you have a minimal Ubuntu installation you may not have an MTA installed at all.  Otherwise, you may have one, but it may not be configured to be able to send outgoing mail.\nOr, your computer may not have port 25 access to the internet.  It is common for consumer-level connections to block outgoing connecitons on port 25 which effectively stops these computers sending outgoing email.\n\nIf you don't want to set up a full mail server (MTA) locally on your server or your ISP's policy prohibits you from doing so, you can relay mail through another server (such as your ISP's). \nTo do this you need to install a local MTA but configure it only to relay all outgoing mail through another server instead of trying to deliver it directly.\nThere are various lightweight MTAs which only exist to bridge the gap between a local sendmail function and a remote SMTP server, but it's probably better to install an MTA with proper queuing functionality like postfix, even though you will not be using most of postfix's features.\nIf you install postfix it's relatively easy to do this because Ubuntu gives you a menu when installing (if you missed the menu, you can use sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix to do it again later, though that'll ask you even more questions).  You probably want what Ubuntu calls a \"satellite host\", and you want to be final destination for no mail (eg nothing under \"mydestination\" or \"relay_domains\" in postfix's configuration, and use \"relayhost\" to refer to the external SMTP server).\n", "Q: How to set usb Drive with executable permission I have Steam on my Chromebook (Acer c710) With Saucy, Unity.\nI was just about to download Dota 2 when I didn't have enough space on my device, so I had a spare usb Flash Drive(Sandisk Cruzer Faucet) and I tried to download it directly to there.\nEverything would have went fine, except I ran into an error:\"Your file system must have executable permission\".\nI want to know how I could mount my USB Drive with executable permission.\nThank you.\n\nA: If the partition is NTFS or FAT, you'll have to mount it with the correct permissions for files to be executable.\nUse the lsblk command to identify your USB drive (let's call it /dev/sdb1).

Running the same command on the computer with the broken install yields:\n    /usr/lib/mime/packages/inkscape\n    /usr/share/menu/inkscape\n    /usr/share/doc/inkscape\n\nThis suggests to me that apt-get thinks that Inkscape is installed, but then for some reason only installs some of the files.

The config files found /boot are provided by linux-image-* packages:\n$ dpkg -S /boot/config-3.13.0-26-generic \nlinux-image-3.13.0-26-generic: /boot/config-3.13.0-26-generic\n\nNote how the config files' names all follow the pattern config-$(uname -r). uname -r is the kernel release, and looks like 3.13.0-26-generic. Since dpkg stores information on which currently installed packages added which files, as long as those packages are present, even deleted files can be look up. So you can do:\ndpkg -S /boot/config-$(uname -r)\n\nwhich will likely show that the file is owned by linux-image-$(uname -r).\nAnd then either reinstall that kernel package:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\nOr download the package and extract it manually:\napt-get download linux-image-$(uname -r)\nar x linux-image-$(uname -r)*.deb\ntar -xf data.tar.* ./boot/config-$(uname -r)\n\nNow the config file will be in boot/ in the directory where you extracted it.\n\nA: I think that the config file does not any affect the system now.\nIt is used only build a kernel image and modules.\nPerhaps, when you build new kernel module, The config file can be referred.\nDue to read the config file, you can look the modules the kernel includes or dynamic loads or unused.\nFor example, At the config file, \nCONFIG_EXT3_FS=y\n\nThe ext3fs module is embedded in the kernel image.\nCONFIG_EXT3_FS=m\n\nThe ext3fs module is not embedded in the kernel image, but have runtime module loading.\nCONFIG_EXT3_FS=n\n\nThe ext3fs module is not used in the kernel.\n", "Q: Can't see partitions and there is no windows 8 in grub I had windows 8.1 on my laptop.

Observed it many times on many Ubuntu versions. If you type wrong password either in UI mode or in terminal, it takes little more time before it declares incorrect password.\nCorrect password check is almost instantaneous, but incorrect password takes slightly longer. Its not lot of time, but still lot more than correct password. \nWhy is it so?\n\nA: As Marc already mentioned, this mechanism should slow down automated password guesses.\nLinux normally uses pam_unix as module to check passwords of local users. The default of this (and many other authentication modules) is to\n\n[...] request a delay-on-failure of the order of two second.\n\nas described in the man page of pam_unix (see parameter nodelay)\nConsequently, an attacker is considerably slowed down (no more than 30 guesses per minute). Some implementations also increase the delay until the correct password is entered).\n\nA: It's a security feature to prevent, or at least slow down, brute force or dictionary attempts to crack the password.\nThe difference in the delay between accepting a password and not accepting it may seam small if you are typing those passwords by hand.

Why?\n\nA: The IP address 127.0.0.1 means localhost, i.e. it refers to your computer. The DNS response is coming from your computer.\nThe host program, like all other programs on the system, knows which DNS server to query by looking in the file /etc/resolv.conf.\nThe reason your computer is sending the DNS response is that it is running a DNS cache. The DNS cache software remembers requests, so that if you access the same site multiple times in quick succession (for example, to display a web page with embedded images, Javascript, frames, etc., or display several pages from the same site), only the first request needs to wait for a reply from a distant server, and subsequent requests get a very quick reply from the local machine.\nUbuntu runs dnsmasq as a DNS cache by default. Dnsmasq itself queries a DNS server provided by your ISP; this configuration is normally done dynamically (through resolvconf: the DNS server is added to the configuration when the corresponding network interface goes up and removed when the interface goes down. Available DNS servers for Dnsmasq are recorded in /etc/resolvconf/run/interface/*.\nNote that I provide file names for curiosity purposes only. There are very few circumstances where you would want to edit them.\n", "Q: Problem to write .csv file using R in 14.04 I just installed,I have done some mathematical calculation successfully with R.\nThen I try the following,\n> var1 <- 1:5\n> var2 <- (1:5) / 10\n> var3 <- c(\"R\", \"and\", \"Data Mining\", \"Examples\", \"Case Studies\")\n> df1 <- data.frame(var1, var2, var3)\n> names(df1) <- c(\"VariableInt\", \"VariableReal\", \"VariableChar\") \n\nAfter created data frame I tried to write into sampleData.csv for that I do the following,\n> write.csv(df1, \"./data/sampleData.csv\",row.names = FALSE)\n\nI got [ERROR]response as,\nError in file(file, ifelse(append, \"a\", \"w\")) : \ncannot open the connection\nIn addition: Warning message:\nIn file(file, ifelse(append, \"a\", \"w\")) :\ncannot open file './data/samplData.csv': No such file or directory\n>\n\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04, and I run this code in terminal. \nProblem cause in directory. \nwhen I do,\n> getwd()\n\ngot response as,\n[1] \"/home/arul\"  \n\nBut in that directory there is no r package. \nI cant find where my R is placed, I used apt-get install -y r-base, so how do I set path as installed R ? \nEDIT 1 \nI create folder data in current directory /home/arul as taken by R and then I tried to write csv,\n> write.csv(df1, \"./data/sampleData.csv\",row.names = FALSE)\n\nNow I got permission problem,\nError in file(file, ifelse(append, \"a\", \"w\")) : \ncannot open the connection\nIn addition: Warning message:\nIn file(file, ifelse(append, \"a\", \"w\")) :\ncannot open file './data/dummyData.csv': Permission denied\n\nHow to I solve it ?\nEDIT 2\nroot@arul-PC:/home/arul# stat data\nFile: ‘data’\nSize: 4096          Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 809h/2057d  Inode: 3147229     Links: 2\nAccess: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nAccess: 2014-07-18 12:42:00.057099167 +0530\nModify: 2014-07-18 12:41:59.041099204 +0530\nChange: 2014-07-18 12:41:59.041099204 +0530\nBirth: -\n\nEDIT 3\n> system('whoami', intern=TRUE)\n[1] \"arul\"\n\n\nA: What seems most likely is that ~/data/ doesn't exist.

Thanks.\n\nA: \nDoes Ubuntu store this data (in cache, or somewhere else)\n\nNo. \nBesides what is in memory because of usage on that system (and not synched data) there are no other locations where this is stored. And the \"in memory\" is lost when saved to disk or when rebooted. Basically this is active when you have software open with one of your files. \nCome to think of it: there is 1 thing you need to keep an eye on: \"activity journal\". It is zeitgeist component that keeps an eye on files openened to help you find your files better. \nThere are also some other things to consider that leave traces of files: \n\n\n*\n\n*gedit has a setting to save a backup (same filename ending in ~). Other software you use can have similar settings. \n\n*online storage can pick up your file if you store it on a system where that specific directory is linked to online storage. Technically someone could set a system up such that USB sticks are synched on connection. \n\n*data may also end up in the swap file. After the program is closed, the space that the data takes up in the swap file may be reused, but the contents won't be actively overwritten.\n\n\nA: Aside from the Zeitgeist logs Rinzwind mentioned you also have to worry about two files:\n1.) recently-used.xbel. This is GNOME's old logging system. The file should be located somewhere around ~/.local/share\n2.) Thumbnails. Ubuntu stores thumbnails of images and other formats by default. These thumbs are located at ~/.local/share/thumbnails or ~/.thumbnails on older releases\nOf course there's also a lot of apps that have their own logs and histories (e.g. VLC, etc.).\nIn the end you have to realize that if you handle sensitive data on a machine you better make sure that the machine itself is also secure.\n", "Q: 3D Stereoscopic with nVidia I have a 3D compatible tv (over HDMI) and a nVidia GTX660 (should be 3D compatible and has a HDMI port).

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 \"LTS\" on a Lenovo W530 (Nvidia Optimus architecture) and updated the kernel to 3.13.0-32-generic as the version of the kernel I was running was going out of support, 3.5.0-52-generic. I was getting the following warning;\n\n\"Your current Hardware Enablement Stack (HWE) is going out of support\non 08/07/14. After this date security updates for critical parts\n(kernel and graphics stack) of you system will no longer be available.\"\n\nI went through some pain to get a second monitor working with this machine in the past and after the update to the new kernel all that work went away. The screen resolution went to 800x600 and the secondary monitor no longer worked. My machine is a work laptop and I thought LTS was a safe bet but obviously not...\nI did some investigation on the problem and tried the following;\nPurged the nvidia drivers, reinstalled nvidia current and restart;\nsudo apt-get purge 'nvidia*'\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nsudo reboot\n\nTried to install the latest version of the nvidia drivers in the repo;\nsudo apt-get purge 'nvidia*'\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331\nsudo reboot\n\nConfigured nvidia xconfig, load the drivers and restart the UI;\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo modprobe nvidia\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nThis lead me to an error in dmesg thrown by trying to load the Nvidia driver with modprobe.

I thought this was a LTS...\nIs there any information around an official fix for this before August. Or if anyone knows how I can update to 3.13.0 without breaking Nvidia graphics driver?\n\nA: This is a bug and I expect them to fix this so it will work out of the box soon, but if you want to use the new kernel you can do the update and do the following afterwards after booting to get it working again.\nOpen a terminal (hold in CTRL and ALT while pressing T)\nAdd xorg-edgers PPA and update\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nYou'll have to supply your password when prompted.

To confirm that you are indeed using Nvidia drivers you may open System settings in the menu on top right and choose Additional Drivers from the Hardware section. It takes some time for it to start up but when it's there it will tell you if you are using Nvidia driver. It might be that you could in fact activate your driver from this view after sudo add-get update but I didn't do that so I'm not 100% sure.

If anyone has any other idea, please tell.\n\nA: I'm only guessing but it may be a bug with the drivers. I had similar driver problems with my networked Epson XP-200 and the problems seemed to disappear over time (and updates), but also seemed to be computer dependent - some ubuntu 12.04 machines did fine while others failed sometimes, only difference being the computer hardware.\nLooking at this page your printer seems to have full Debian support, which would mean it would work under Ubuntu. Maybe reinstall the driver manually? There is a .deb file listed there that Ubuntu Software Center would take, probably an installer for the PPD file.\nI would think that if the PPD file doesn't work that the print test wouldn't work.\nHave fun fidiling around. Just thought I'd add some input.\n\nA: I see a fellow *nix user with a similar issue, although mine is blank pages and pages with images only.\nI have been advised that Epson do have Linux drivers, I have a cheap n cheerful D92.\nMaybe a walk over to Epson might be in order.\n", "Q: black screen on Ubuntu 14.04 Install I am trying to install Ubuntu from a 4gb flash drive to another 16gb flash drive, both fat32 format.

However at home I have Ubuntu 14.04 x64 bit running on my laptop. Few days back, I got a opportunity to work from home. To do this, my friends (using Windows 8) access company webpage and then navigate to \"RD Web Access\" page and launch office softwares as RemoteApp. \nIf I try that from my laptop, the RD Web Access page does not come up right and also does not let me launch RemoteApps (my company software).\nNOTE: To workaround that problem, I can install a Windows VM in virtualbox but that is something I want to do at the last. In my friend circle I always encourage others to use Ubuntu, please help me to not use a Windows VM.\nThanks.\n\nA: I faced something similar in recent past in my office.\nThe IT Admin of my office tried something called WinConn (RemoteApp Manager).

I see:\n...\nAccess: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\n...\n\nBy the looks of it, that won't ring true for you but not entirely sure what you've done. If the owner isn't root or the permissions are anything but 0644, we can fix that quickly:\nchown root: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\nchmod 0644 /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\n\nIf that permissions/ownership is the only problem, that should fix it. Just run reboot to boot back into Ubuntu-proper.\nIf you nuked /usr completely (with a chmod -r ... /usr, for example), you need to restore ownerships to a lot more files. Thankfully, /usr is fairly rooty. You can restore the bulk of permissions with:\nchown -r root /usr\nchown daemon /usr/bin/at\nchown libuuid /usr/sbin/uuidd\n\nIf you want to know how I got those two stragglers, I ran sudo find /usr -exec stat -c '%U %n' {} + | grep -v root on a cleanish system.

I have tried seeing if there was a delete option when selecting a file, but it doesn't show.\n\nA: Open Nautilus, the default file manager for Ubuntu (I assume that you are using that since you are fairly new to AskUbuntu)\nBy default \"Move To Trash\" option provided in nautilus (by right clicking on file) as follows:\n\n\nGo to the menus at the top and click Edit->Preferences\nIn the window that appears, choose the Behavior tab, then click the button to include a Delete Command as shown in the image below. \nFollowing that you should be able to delete a file directly from the  File Manager:\n\nNow you can see \"Delete\" option (after right-clicking) as follows:\n\n\nHowever you can delete files/directories by Delete and Shift+Delete.\nIn case you don't have write permission for a file or directory Move to Trash or Delete will not work and will be greyed out. This usually is the case for all files outside of your home directory /home/<username>.\nOnly if you are in desperate need to delete such files from the graphical file manager it is possible to run nautilus as root by sudo -i nautilus but this is not recommended. With a wrong command or accidental mouse move you risk to damage your whole system to a state where it can not even boot.\n\nPlease make yourself familiar with the Ubuntu concept of sudo, the Debian File System Hierarchy, and most importantly permissions before you do anything as root with Nautilus.\n\n\nA: Assuming that the file is inside your home folder or an external disk, you can delete file by:\n\n\n*\n\n*right clicking the file and selecting \"delete\"\n\n*selecting the file and pressing the delete key on your keyboard\n\n*clicking and dragging the file to your trash, which is in the launcher (left pane of Ubuntu) and in the list of locations on the left of your file browser\n\n*in the terminal, performing rm /path/to/file\n\n\nIf the file is not yours (belongs to another user or to the system), you can use sudo nautilus, replacing nautilus with rm /path/to/file or another file browser. Be warned, deleting system files may make your copy of Ubuntu, other operating systems on your computer, or even your computer itself unusable!\n\nA: press ctrl + alt + T this opens the terminal then run this command \nsudo nautilus \n\nthen simply locate your file and now after finding your file you can modify or create it if you have any permission to modify or delete them\n\nA: Assuming you are using the Files file manager, the Move to Trash option when you right click a file is a delete option in practice, but you have the option to restore files in the trash can would you change your mind.\nIf you really want to delete files irrevocably, the answer provided by Charles Green shows you how.\n\nA: choose the file and press the \"delete\" button. If you want to delete directly bypassing the trash then press \"shift+delete\".\n", "Q: How to make transmission work for all users I tried opening a magnet link from a different (standard) user I created and it didn't work.

I was following this: How to open terminal on Xubuntu and some other sources.\nWhy isn't it working? How do I make it work?\n\nA: I solved this by adding the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T for the command gnome-terminal, using XFCE and TigerVNC. Go to the XFCE settings or run xfce4-settings-manager, then Keyboard, Application Shortcuts.

[Edit] oh \"export DISPLAY=:0\" does just that, but you noted that the answers in the linked question didn't help, so starting to doubt if this answer will.\nIIRC, from the desktop launched Gnome Terminal do:\nunity-reset\n\n\nA: In unix systems, application settings are stored as hidden files in your home directory. Hidden files are files whose name start with \".\". You can see those files by pressing Ctrl-H in the file manager or \"ls -a\" in the terminal.\nWhen you mess something with your settings, the simplest solution is to remove the settings to have it reset to factory default. To do so for compiz/unity, open a terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) then type the following command:\nfind .[^.]* -name \\*.unity\\* -o -name \\*compiz\\* -exec rm -R \\{\\} \\;\n\nThis will remove any file or folder whose name contain either unity or compiz from any hidden file in the current directory. When you open a terminal, the current directory should be your home directory.\n", "Q: VLC: Unattended video playback of sporadic UDP video source? I want to make a kiosk-type setup that simply plays back video from a remote UDP source. The command line below does the trick and shows the video OK when there's an incoming signal to begin with. I set it up to execute as a startup app of a desktop user with auto-login:\nvlc -f udp://@:PortNumber\n\nBut if there's no video when the machine starts, it shows the VLC screen with its window decorations and dashboard. Worse, it shows the Unity taskbar. I would like it to always show a black screen (or as close to featureless as possible), and I need the black screen to remain when there's no signal coming, and the video to come up when the signal comes back.\nI'm kind of lost in VLC's infinitely many command-line options. Any help would be highly appreciated. I'm open to using a different video player if it will do the job better.\n\nA: If you want to make a kiosk, make a kiosk. Simply put, stop loading Unity and all that and just load VLC. I've been over this quite recently with another user. That should get you into a clean environment. Obviously they're loading a script as a user called thomas, but it shouldn't take too much imagination to customise that to your usage:\nexec su -c \"startx /etc/X11/Xsession /usr/bin/vlc -f udp://@:PortNumber --\" jccyc\n\nOr you could have a separate script that launched VLC and call that from the Upstart job. Either way, not a tough thing to do and aside from Unity being able to bother you, it also means it's a lighter, faster to load desktop.\nAs for the background cone, go to Tools → Preferences → All → Interface → Main interfaces → Qt and scroll right to the bottom and uncheck \"Display background code or art\". That should leave you with a blank screen.

This will limit the memory of your graphics card to being used only by the game itself. I'm not sure if that will help with the other issues you are having but it may help.\n", "Q: Transmission download doesn't work when on other user Transmission doesn't work when logged in as a normal user. Same magnet link, from the same website downloads when I use the computer as administrator, and doesn't work when I use it from a different user account. All trackers say 'connection failed'. How can I fix that?\n\nA: See the Ubuntu wiki Transmission HowTo\n\nConfigure Users and Permissions\nIt is recommended that Transmission runs under its own username for\nsecurity reasons. This creates a few issues with file and folder\naccess by Transmission as well as your account.\n\nTo fix it, add your user to the group debian-transmission by running this\ncommand while logged in as the user you want to give access to, or\nreplace $USER with their username\nsudo usermod -a -G debian-transmission $USER\n\nFor the change to take effect, you must log out and back in.\n\nA: I actually figured it out myself and I want to post the answer. I made it work by switching the second user account from being 'Standard' to 'Administrator'\n", "Q: How do i Reboot into Bootmenu from terminal My Laptop has this Fast boot function that i cant turn off and it just starts booting into Ubuntu instantly from a fresh start.\nSo im wondering is there a terminal command to reboot into the bootmenu? Thanks\n\nA: What is the make/model of your laptop?  From there, use Google to determine what the keypress is to enter BIOS.  After that there should be a setting to turn off the Fast Boot or at least show some information/diagnostic screen on boot.\n", "Q: Can I run this on a usb hard drive on my desktop that is currently running windows xp I do not have enough space to partition my drive? Can I run this on a usb hard drive on my desktop that is currently running windows xp I do not have enough space to partition my drive ?\n\nA: You can run as a live USB, some applications even allow persistence so that you can keep files. It is always recommended to install to a HDD however as you will receive crucial security updates.\n", "Q: Terminal shortcut to go to beginning of command? For example, forgetting to put sudo and having to go back to the beginning of the command.\n\nA: Home. Plus you may want to know about sudo !!, which repeats the previous command, but with sudo in front of it.\n\nA: CTRL + a\n(tends not to work if you using SCREEN though since screen uses Ctrl-A as a control switch.)\n", "Q: Workaround for the xfce indicator plugin The xfce \"indicator plugin\" keeps crashing with almost all apps. However I need it. I just want it to keep trying to restart itself automatically (preferably every 10 seconds) instead of displaying this annoying message Plugin \"Indicator Plugin\" unexpectedly left the panel, do you want to restart it? Does anyone have an idea about how to do this?\n\nA: You could always remove the indicator and use the native XFCE notification area... I've found the indicator plugin under XFCE to be a pain to work with.\n\nA: I had a similar problem and found a bug report with a workaround that seems to do the trick. The workaround is as follows. I modified it a little so that you don't need to actually right click the active indicator panel, which could be tricky if it keeps crashing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the panel and select Panel -> Panel Preferences\n\n*Select the Items tab and add Indicator Panel if it's not already there\n\n*Select Indicator Panel and click the edit button (spanner over a page)\n\n*Click the Hidden checkbox next to Application Menus (Global Menu)\n\n*Restart the panel: xfce4-panel -r\n\n\nThe screenshot below shows how what these menus should look like.\n\n\nA: I spent a few hours on pages like this as I've had a problem with it instantly getting the 'unexpectedly left the panel' error as I try to execute the Indicator Plugin, with no way of accessing the settings.\nI had compiled gtk3.12 earlier, which seemed to be the root of the problem. Luckily I hadn't nuked the folder from my trash, and restoring it and running sudo make uninstall from the gtk3.12 compile folder fixed it. On the off chance someone did the same or similarly, I might save a few hours of headaches and frustration.\n", "Q: How can I connect my Nokia Lumia 520 with Ubuntu 14.04? I cannot seem find a way to connect a Nokia Lumia 520 to Ubuntu 14.04. I tried several solutions posted on the Internet, but I could not find the right one. Has someone achieved this?\n\nA: The author of this project: Android File Transfer For Linux luckily for me agreed to add WP8 support and now this is the only solution that reliable works, afaik.\nNow it's able to connect my Lumia 1020 WP8.1 Denim and Kubuntu 15.04 via \nusb.   \nOf course, device shall be unlocked with correct PIN beforehand.  \nThe project is a library and has simple GUI which is mostly for library demonstration and testing purposes, so don't blame it for UX.\n\nA: How to connect Lumia 520 Windows Phone (WP) (Windows 8.0 - Amber) to computer (Ubuntu 14.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Pocket File Manager (PFM) to WP from Store. PFM has a free version so no need to buy the full version within the app.\n\n*Turn on computer - do not enter password yet \n\n*Turn on phone - turn on pocket file manager\n\n*Connect phone to computer via USB\n\n*Enter computer password - computer is now fully on\n\n*Click phone icon launcher on computer\n\n*The phone and SD card will be displayed and file operations can be used in the normal way\n\n*Once tasks completed, keep the phone attached via USB and shut down the computer - Do NOT turn off computer file manager\n\n*Once the computer has shut down, remove phone USB\n\n\nNotes:  \n\n\n*\n\n*If you do not use a password to open Ubuntu because you automatically  start the computer then turn on the phone, open PFM and connect the phone via USB before switching on the computer  \n\n*Please note that the Cyan update (Windows 8.1) is imminent apparently. Cyan will have it's own file manager so PFM may not be necessary. Possibly the new file manager will mean that the current work around is superfluous too.\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth works too as already mentioned.\n\n\n\nA: To transfer files between your computer and phone you can run a server and access it via the phone browser. I have started a project on github- clouder-lite, give it a try!\nPS: Python3 is available on Ubuntu14+ by default.\n\nA: Alternatively to what nigel said, you may want virtualize windows in virtual machine if you have no access to the OS.\nIn fact this is quite a useful option to run programs like microsoft office, autocad and itunes; microsoft even made windows freely downloadable.\nTo do this you have to download virtualbox from the software center and then follow this tutorial: http://pclosmag.com/html/issues/201309/page15.html\nPay attention however to the fact that the license lasts only 90 days and then you have to restore the virtual machine from a snapshot or a backup.\n", "Q: How do I display google chrome's menus in xubuntu? I can't find them I can't file the \"File Edit View...\" menus in google chrome in xfce (xubuntu)! How do I display them or where are they? ...I'm surprised I'm asking such a question XD\n\nA: I don't believe there are any menus for Chrome outside of the button on the top right, the \"hamburger\" button as they call it. As far as I recall you get to everything from there.\n", "Q: Unable to access or mount iPod touch [Ubuntu 14.04] On attaching the iPod touch Ubuntu throws a message \"Unable to mount [name]'s iPod touch\" with a sub message: \"Unable to connect.\" I have been unable to pinpoint any specific troubleshooting or workarounds for this. (If it helps - the device has recently been reset/erased and then re-setup, it worked before the reset)\n\nA: I have the same problem, though my ipod touch has NOT been recently reset (that I know, I bought it second hand). \nHave you installed libimobiledevice from the ubuntu software centre? That has allowed ubuntu 14.04 to see my ipod touch device (it appears as an icon in the left hand side vertical menu and in the file manager), but NOT to see the files yet. More work to do.\nIt is surprising that there is no feedback at all for libimobiledevice in the ubuntu software centre...\n", "Q: Ubuntu server - Will it Run Oracle instant client?

Of course you have to replace the 11.2 version numbers with the 10.2.0.5.0 version numbers.\nI installed the Oracle Instant Client 10.2.0.5.0 in a VM running Ubuntu 14.04, and it works. Installing the php-oci8 module also works, but you have to use the oci8-2.0.11 version for PHP5 (see the output of pecl remote-info oci8):\nsudo apt-get install php-pear php5-dev\nsudo pecl install oci8-2.0.11\n  # enter instantclient,/usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0.5/client64/lib \ncd /etc/php5/mods-available\necho 'extension=oci8.so' | sudo tee oci8.ini\nsudo php5enmod oci8\n\nIf you are using PHP7, this should work:\nsudo apt-get install php-pear php-dev\nsudo pecl install oci8\n  # enter instantclient,/usr/lib/oracle/10.2.0.5/client64/lib \ncd /etc/php/7.0/mods-available\necho 'extension=oci8.so' | sudo tee oci8.ini\nsudo phpenmod oci8\n\n", "Q: new windows very slow to launch This problem shows up a day or two after rebooting. Launching any new window will be very slow. It comes up first with either just a transparent overlay or with the window grayed out and the rest of the system stalled. After maybe 30s to a minute the window will eventually show up fully. At that point everything works fine with no noticeable performance problems, until i need to launch another window. Also whenever I hit this problem, I also can't do anything within the system tray. The clock in the tray even stops updating. The system tray stays frozen whether i'm stuck launching a window or not. I don't see anything helpful or even recent in dmesg. Top doesn't show anything too unusual in cpu or mem usage, although I don't think its display is updating while the system is frozen waiting for a window to open.\nReboot and everything's back to normal.\nAlso this problem shows up suddenly. By that I mean everything is normal and then I try to open a window and its very slow to load. Its not like opening windows gradually gets slower over time.\nThis is on 14.04, nvidia 331 driver, unity.\n\nA: Your issue may be caused by this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-greeter/+bug/1292467\nTwo suggested workarounds are:\n * Plug in external monitor after login\n * Boot with \"video=LVDS-1:d\"\n\nRelated:\nVery slow graphics performance after upgrade 12.04 => 14.04\n", "Q: [Errno 30]Read-only file system: '/target/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic' I am fairly new to Ubuntu and I am trying to install 14.04 on my laptop. The laptop wasn't really working and only boots with Ubuntu CD. I don't care for any files or anything on the computer, I just want to get a working system installed on my computer. When trying to install Ubuntu I get:\nThe installer encoutered an error copying files to the hard disk:\n[Errno 30]Read-only file system: '/target/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic'\nThis is often due to a faulty hard disk. It may help to check whether the hard disk is old and in need of replacement, or to move the system to a cooler environment.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: If you are sure the hard drive is fine (no problems in the past, taken good care of) it is likely because you had an error burning the disk or downloading the image. Redownload the installation ISO and burn it to a fresh disk and try again\n", "Q: How can I get a music player to watch a folder for new files? I am using youtube-dl to download a series of short audio files. How can I set up a common music player [1] to monitor a given folder for new files and add them to the current playlist?\n[1] Rhythmbox, Totem, VLC, or anything available in the 14.04 repos and usable in Unity.\n\nA: You can do this with Rhythmbox using an \"Automatic Playlist\" and using the path variable.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory named \"youtube-dl\" in ~/Music for youtube-dl to output files into. (in my testing, Rhythmbox wouldn't add files outside ~/Music for some reason).\n\n*Open Rhythmbox and create a new Automatic Playlist by clicking the \"+\" at bottom left below the playlists.\n\n*For the playlist variables set \"Path\", \"contains\", and \"youtube-dl\",\nthen click \"New\" to finish.\n\n\nNow Rhythmbox will add and remove audio tracks from this directory automatically.\n", "Q: Which version of Ubuntu should I install under VirtualBox in OS X 10.9? I'm planning to install Ubuntu in a VirtualBox virtual machine.  The host operating system is OS X 10.9 Mavericks running on a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro.\nThe download page instructs me to choose between the flavours \"64-bit\" and \"64-bit Mac (AMD64)\".\nWhat is the difference between these two versions?\nWhich of these versions is appropriate for my planned installation?\n\nA: This answer to a related question explains that the difference between these disk images is that the \"64-bit Mac (AMD64)\" version forces BIOS-mode (rather than UEFI) booting to avoid lack of support for multi-catalog CDs in the EFI boot mode of Mac machines.\nSo it sounds like I should be able to use either version, since the boot-time pseudo-firmware is entirely an aspect of the VM and not related to the underlying hardware.\n\nA: You are installing in virtual box so any of the above version is fine.but i suggest 64-bit mac because you are using mavericks.have fun with ubuntu\n\nA: VirtualBox has very limited support for Mac guests, so I would suggest the AMD-64 version to prevent the possibility that some odd hardware emulation causes problems.\n", "Q: Tomb Raider 2013 Steam Wine - How to compile Wine Patch? I wanted to install Tomb Raider 2013 over Steam with Wine 1.7.22. The problem is, that the game stops after the profile loader. This problem is well known:\nhttps://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=27776&sAllBugs\nThe solution is to patch the wine source code and compile then. i tried to patch the source code with patch -p1 < patch.diff.

Each time when I want to close terminal there is a popup with question \"Close this terminal?\" because some process is running in terminal. I don't care about this process. How to prevent terminal from showing this popup?\n\nA: You will have to install gconf-editor first. Just open the terminal using Ctrl+Alt+T and type the following command:\nsudo apt-get install gconf-editor\n\nAfter that, hit Alt+F2 or open the Dash and type gconf-editor and the configuration editor window will appear. Then you go to Apps→Gnome-terminal→global and uncheck the option confirm_window_close.\nSource\n\nA: In 16.04 you'll find that choice in dconf-editor. You can install it, if necessary, with \nsudo apt install dconf-editor\n\nThen go to \norg -> gnome -> terminal -> legacy\n\nand uncheck confirm-close. \n\nA: Just press Ctrl + C to cancel any background process that may be running and then you can close the terminal without the popup showing up.\n\nNote:\nYou can affect your system by closing the terminal with background processes running. A good example is if there is an update or upgrade running, the apt command can get locked up and you may start getting these errors:\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/) is another process using it?\n\nLuckily, they have been solved in this question.\nThat is just an example of what may happen if you close the terminal when a background process is running.
