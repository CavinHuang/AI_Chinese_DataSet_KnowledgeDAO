["Q: Unable to close apps from mission control, Mavericks OS X Unable to close apps from mission control, Mavericks OS X.\nI do not get an \"X\" to close, and after downloading BetterTouchTool and attempting the close window with cursor over window (which says is suppose to work in mission control) I still have no luck. After reading some reviews I am going to wait downloading Yosemite and become comfortable with Mavericks. New Mac user as of 2/16/15.\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, you don't close apps from Mission Control.\nYou use it to bring an app to the front, change Spaces, add or remove Spaces - it doesn't act directly on the apps themselves.\nSee Mac Basics: Use Mission Control to switch between apps or spaces\n", "Q: Where are the sample books stored in the iBooks for Mac OS X? I'm doing an accessibility stuff and I need to access the source file (.epub file) of the sample books in iBooks for Mac OS X. I did look for one at ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks but that only stored bought books. Does anyone know?\n(My OS is the newest version of Yosemite.)\n\nA: Here you can find the iBooks source files:\nGo to Library > Containers > com.apple.BKAgentService > Data > Documents > iBooks\nOr simply type 'iBooks' in the searcher of Finder and click on the folder named iBooks.\n\nA: Just to complete the answers, many other files actually sit in the icloud drive but hidden.  That is on top of the directory mention mentioned for some files as stated above.  In particular, all PDFs are stored hiddend. \nThese days you can send things to icloud drive under different apps but Apple not telling you where it is.\nIf you do not want to go through terminal (and use ls -al etc.) try this: \n\n\n*\n\n*copy a named pdf say \"a=pdf.pdf\" to ibook\n\n*search for a=pdf.pdf\n\n*if there is no such second copy, \ntry this further\nadd pdf as a kind into the search field (whatever the search is)\nsearch for \"a\"  instead of \"a=pdf.pdf\" (or any other possible filename)\njust a\nyour file would appear (as the original copy)\nclick the open the enclosing folder\nIt works in El Captain just a moment ago.\n", "Q: Listing only Mobile Accounts in terminal I have a way to list all the accounts in Mac via terminal using the dscacheutil command.

I did a clean install of yosemite on my MacBook Pro. I have not partitioned my hard drive and have left everything by default. \nI would however like to use the recommended schematic for Linux systems (Partition for the OS (root directory), Partition for /Home and one for my data).\nIs there a way to do this with mac? I am not aware that i could have done this during the installation process especially choosing a partition for the OS. Furthermore I wonder if it would be possible to partition the HD after the installation and move all the data later. I'm looking for some kind of guidance how I can do that clean.\n\nA: As mentioned by the other comments, Apple's default partition scheme is to have everything on ONE partition.  While not recommended (potentially due to not being easy to do), it is possible to move a home folder to a different partition.\nHere is how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a partition to use for the home folder (Disk Utility is the built-in choice to do so)\n\n*enable the root user\n\n*\n\n*open System Preferences\n\n*click on Users & Groups\n\n*click on Login Options\n\n*open the padlock on the lower left-hand corner\n\n*click on \"Join\" next to Network Account Server\n\n*click on \"Directory Utility\"\n\n*from the menu \"Edit\" click \"Enable Root Account\" and supply a password for that account\n\n\n*log out of the current to-be-moved user\n\n*choose \"Other\" at the login screen\n\n*type in root into the username field and supply the password you just gave it\n\n*navigate to your other partition and create a base home folder (to use Apple's naming convention, create a folder named \"Users\")\n\n*navigate to the system's Users folder and copy the user's home folder over to the other partition.\n\n*open System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*open the padlock on the lower left-hand corner\n\n*right-click (or Ctrl+click) the user you want to move and choose \"Advanced Options\"\n\n*for the field \"Home directory\", either click the button \"Choose\" (if it is there) and select the new path or type in the new path.\n\n*\n\n*If you type it in, the path starts with /Volumes/<volume_name>\n\n*Important: Use the proper capitalization as depicted on your system or you may run into problems\n\n*Do NOT change anything else on that form (e.g. user ID) or you may end up not be able to log in or use the system with the other user\n\n\n*click on \"OK\"\n\n*restart your computer holding down the Alt key until you see boot options on the screen\n\n*choose the recovery option (e.g. \"Recovery HD-10.10\")\n\n*choose the language when asked\n\n*from the menu \"Utilities\" choose Terminal\n\n*type in resetpassword and hit Enter\n\n*choose the hard drive you normally use to boot from\n\n*choose your user\n\n*Click on \"Reset\" at the bottom of that window to reset permissions\n\n*reboot your system normally and try to log in to your user\n\n\nIf this is working for you as expected, here is the clean-up:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove your user account folder from the system drive (to save disk space on your system drive)\n\n*disable the root user again to improve system security (follow the same steps as outlined above and choose \"Disable Root User\") this time\n\n\nIn case it is not working (though I would understand that it will), you can use root to log in and move the home directory back to where it was using System Preferences > Users & Groups > Advanced Options (right-click on that user).\nI hope this guide helps.\n", "Q: Is there any way of limiting the space devoted to log files? Is there any way of limiting the space devoted to log files?\nI was running a little short of disk space and checked where it was used (if anyone is interested the following shows directories > 1GB) sudo du -hxd1 ~/Library/Developer | grep 'G\\t'\nI discovered ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter was using almost 2GB (much of this seems to have been migrated from a Mavericks installation - even less than useless). Manually pruning this seems to be inordinately time consuming. I would like to automatically limit this to a reasonable size. \n\nThe vast bulk of the logs are in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice either mobileassetd or JetsamEvent and refer to an iPhone or iPad, and seem to be of little value on the Mac.\n\nA: Since we are talking about the result of application crashes, if such files keep on building up, I would pursue the reason of why this happens in the first place.  Once fixed, just dump the files manually and move on.\nOn a stable system, the folder ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter should be empty.  Having almost 2 GB of crash dumps means that there is (or was) something wrong.\nAs you probably know, log files and crash dumps can be used to diagnose issues on your computer in order to repair said issues.  Blindly removing them, will get you some disk space back, but the original issue will still be there and you will not be happy on the long run.\nDue to the reason mentioned above (second paragraph of this answer), there is no automated task to limit the space for those files.  You could, if you are into scripting or Automator (or both), write a script or Automator Folder Action workflow (or a combination of both) and watch that folder's size and when reaching a threshold removing the oldest entries.\n", "Q: Using Earpods on PC with TRRS to 2xTRS splitter I just purchased a 4-pin to 2x3-pin audio adapter to use my earpods on a PC.

On the version of the Safari web browser that's included with Mac OS Yosemite, trying to go to any web site whose hostname ends in \".local\" will cause the browser to sit there forever waiting for a response, never timing out. For example, \"http://foobar.local\" or \"https://baz.qux.local\". Same thing happens when running Safari in the iOS Simulator on a Mac (but on a real iOS device, the request properly times out).\nI'm just curious - why is this? Is it likely to be a Safari bug, or a networking thing in Yosemite that I could fix by editing some config file?\nI'm working on a web site that uses different URLs for media, and when running the site locally (for development) we use .local hostnames for the media sites, which used to work fine as long as /etc/hosts points these hostnames to 127.0.0.1. But now under Yosemite it's causing these requests to hang. Before I update the URLs in our code and tell all our dev to update their hosts file with new hostnames, I wanted to see if there might be a simpler fix.\n\nA: I suppose it's because looking up a .local hostname is basically a browsing request for Bonjour services; devices & services register themselves through multicast, so since foobar.local points to no IP (unless you create it), Safari probably never reaches the stage of testing a site's reachability.\nIn your situation I'd rather a) setup a simple DNS server to reroute requests or b) announce your services through dns-sd:\ndns-sd -P Webservice _http._tcp local 80 foobar.local 127.0.0.1 path=/webservicename\n\nThis should announce a proxy website within your network with name \"Webservice\" for the hostname foobar.local to be reached at http://127.0.0.1/webservicename\n", "Q: Combining CharacterViewer with FontBook in Yosemite I used a OS X 10.5.8 system for several years and now I am using a new laptop with\nthe latest Yosemite.\n I find some features of the older system are much more powerful than the newest one.\n For example, the Character Palette of my old computer is like a combination of \nstrengthened versions of today's CharacterViewer and FontBook.\nThe CharacterPalette of old could display all the characters (with their Unicode\ninfo) of a given font in a FontBook manner and still fully interact with any text editor.\nToday’s CharacterViewer has practically no interaction with font information.\n  It is not possible to give CharacterViewer a font and ask it to display all the available\ncharacters in that font. CharacterViewer can only display all characters (without consideration\nof any font) in their order according to Unicode (and a few other encodings, but I'm interested in fonts not encodings). Also, when CharacterViewer displays the font variants of a given character it only\ndisplays the shapes and not the font names. The user has to click each shape drawing\nindividually to see what is the name of the font it corresponds to. The older interface\nwhich automatically displayed the font name next to the glyph was much simpler and\nuser-friendly.\nI found those now-disappeared features incredibly useful as I wrote articles on ancient texts\ninvolving many unusual characters. \n  Is there any reasonable chance to restore those features on a Yosemite system ?\nUPDATE 18:16 : In answer to a comment below, here is a sample of characters that I often use :\n\nNote that my problem cannot be solved by simply gathering \"all the characters I need\" in the favorites Section of CharacterViewer. To exaggerate slightly, every epigraph has its own characters and I need to update my set of characters periodically. The typical character I need is often in the \"Private Area\" of the Unicode standard. The most comprehensive font I found so far is ALPHABETUM, and with the old Character Palette I regularly discovered new characters from ALPHABETUM.\n\nA: The problem you mention has existed since OS X 10.7 was released nearly 4 years ago, so it has been discussed a lot in various places.  I think the best fix is probably to use the 3rd party alternative palette, Ultra Character Map.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ultra-character-map/id520265986?mt=12\nHowever if I remember right it cannot handle glyphs with no unicode codepoint assigned (i.e glyph variants).\n\nA: Here is what I would do, since I do not know a way to integrate the some of the character viewer symbols in to a font.\nYour input method is your keyboard.\nYour Font is a choice of a font as main language alphanumeric) for lets say Latin) and sub version (Italic, Bold ect) as stile of the font.\nAs you are writing in main language (let say English) you need to occasionally use a special character from another alphanumeric language (modern or ancient).\nFor quick access of special variations of a letter one can use the click and hold to get a pop up of choices, and one can add new symbols to the keyboard key you pressed, in this example the letter \"a\".\n\nTo add your frequently used special characters, you need to do one off action, which is bit cumbersome initially, but easy to use afterwards. You can keep adding new characters any time.\nThe process:\nOpen a file in /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources now find the Input (keyboard) language you normally use and open it.\nHere is a sample from my German keyboard for the letter \"A\"\n\nNow you just add a special letter from the character viewer that you wan to be assigned to the keyboard key \"A\" so when you \"Press and Hold it will appear as choice.\n", "Q: Secure iCloud storage for years in advance Apple are very quick to downgrade paid iCloud storage accounts when billing fails. Data are then deleted indiscriminately within 15 days of payment failure. \nThe monthly fees for upgraded iCloud accounts are nominal, yet Apple only accept payment one month at a time by credit card. I would gladly pay five hundred dollars right now to secure my data for the better part of a decade. However as far as I know, this is no way to prepay.\nHow can I hedge my bets against losing my iCloud data without relying upon recurring credit card payments?\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you are worried that a rejected payment will cause you to lose all of your iCloud-stored data within 15 days.\nInstead of prepaying for something whose price drops on a regular basis (which might not even be possible), I would advise you to purchase iTunes gift cards. If you search around, you can find some deals on them from time to time (eg. $5 off a $50 card). That way, you protect your iCloud data against rejected payments, while keeping the ability to take advantage of the occasional cloud-storage price drop.\nYour iTunes balance will always be used before your credit card (at least in the US). Load up your account with $150, and you’ve got yourself a year of prepaid 1TB storage on iCloud, with enough leftover for an iTunes Match subscription.\nThe risk, of course, is you might start spending more on iTunes and apps since you’ve got a balance there, but that is entirely up to you.\nNote: App Store cards are equivalent to iTunes cards, but NOT Apple Store cards. Apple Store cards can ONLY be used at an Apple Store or the Apple Online Store.\nA good way to think about it is: iTunes/App Store cards = software & services, whereas Apple Store cards = physical goods.\n\nA: For most people and most data classes- data syncs to iOS or macOS so you can back that up locally or to a second cloud provider.\nJust like RAID storage allows one drive to fail and you not lose access to your data, you could back up your data twice. Then if iCloud fails you - you would be covered as long as the second mechanism didn't fail at the same time.\nThus far, prices for storage have gone down, so prepaying might have you over paying but you can load a balance on your account and have the monthly amounts deduct from the balance you carry over, but I'd probably start with a shorter period than 5 years or set up sync to a different vendor if you needed that sort of time frame to enter into a service contract.\n\nA: Since iCloud is wholly controlled by Apple, the only two things you can do (other than relying on monthly credit card payments) is asking Apple if a pre-payment is possible (I, however, doubt that they would say yes, but it does not hurt asking them) or use a different storage (different cloud or local portable storage).\nWhile the following is just speculation, I have reasons to doubt that even Apple knows where it stands (or how MobileMe/iCloud/future_name_here will change) in ten years.\nConsidering that we are talking about a company, which frequently pioneers with new technology and services, I am not sure if making such an advance payment is a good idea anyway for a specific service, which may look entirely different in just two or five years.\n", "Q: Error code -65541 This error code pops up in a dialog on my MBP with 10.10.2 and doesn't go away until I restart. I tried quitting all open applications but it still didn't go away.

I was having the same exact issue. Same error with a dialogue box that gave me no indication where it was coming from.

The Error finally went away.\nI haven't looked into the Synergy logs or anything, so I can't exactly tell you what in Synergy caused the error, I just know Synergy is the culprit.\nJust for reference, I'm using a MacBook Air running 10.10.3\n\nA: It may also be caused by barrier. Killing the processes with the Activity Monitor also solved it for me.\n", "Q: Help find what causes MBP reboot in 10.10.2 I have a Mac Book Pro from 2011.

However, as with many applications, especially those promoting sharing, you may find an option to add or remove contents from within iTunes.\niTunes on the computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*open iTunes\n\n*connect your iPhone 6\n\n*click on the device inside iTunes and navigate to the Apps section\n\n*on the right-hand side (where you see the iPhone screens with your apps placed), scroll down (there is a file sharing section)\n\n*check if \"Share It!\" is on the left hand side and if it is, click it\n\n*the songs should then be on the right-hand side and you can either simply remove them (hitting Backspace (Mac) or Delete (Windows) should take care of that) or export/import them to your computer\n\n\nIn-App:\nYou can also check, if you can remove the songs from within the app.  A lot of apps capable of receiving or creating user content have options to remove such items from within the app itself.  Check if you have an \"Edit\" option or similar when displaying the songs inside \"Share It!\" and once in that mode, see if you can select and remove songs.  If no such option is there, try swiping a song from right-to left and see, if a red \"Delete\" option reveals itself.\nIn case all of the above options fail, you can always remove the app entirely and then re-install it from the App Store free of charge.  Every time you remove an app, it will remove its settings and contents with it.  Therefore, this can be used as a last resort any time.\n\nA: Open shareit app and on the home screen you will see an option “My files”. (Just below the ‘receive’ option.)\nThere you will find files that you received through shareit arranged in different folders based on their file type.\n\nA: Just need to go at share it app at bottom you will find two options select the second one named FILES just open it select the folder you want to delete by tapping+holding for coiple of seconds a popup for deleting will appear if not then open desired folder and repeat the process to delete one by one.\n", "Q: Sudo giving dyld problem.

I am looking into iCloud backups of iPad. \nHow many backups are kept in iCloud ? For how long ?\n\nA: How Many/how long would appear to be a bit vague - possibly until you run out of space, but you can choose which backup to restore to from the ones on offer…\nFrom How to restore an iCloud backup that’s older than the most recent one\n\n\n  \n*\n  \n*First, check out this article on how to restore an iCloud backup to an iPad (too much to précis here) —and yes, the process is the same on the iPhone or iPod Touch as it is on an iPad.\n  \n*When you reach step six, your iPhone will ask you to choose an iCloud backup to restore—either the most recent one, or an earlier backup. Each of your older iCloud backups will be stamped with dates and times, so pick a backup that’s dated just before the time you accidentally deleted that one contact from your address book. (Note: If you have multiple iPads and iPhones synced to the same iCloud account, make sure to pick the right backup for your particular device.)\n  \n*Once you tap the blue “Restore” button, the iCloud backup restoration process will begin—and remember, it could take several hours, depending on how many apps, photos, music, and other media you had loaded on your iPhone. For more details, be sure to read this entire iCloud backup how-to. same link as above\n\n", "Q: How not to have click twice to pause youtube videos Im a complete new Mac user. \nWhen I have a youtube video playing in safari window, and I'm typing an email in a different safari window, I have to click twice to pause the youtube video, once to focus the window, and once again to actually pause the video. But if I double click the video it will switch to full screen! I have to click twice with a pause... \nIs there any configuration I can change so that I only have to click once?\nI Googled the problem and I see a lot about \"focus follows mouse\" plugins, but I'm not sure if that's what I need, I just want the click to go through, instead of a \"dedicated focus click\", because that doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nA: You can ⌘ CMD+Click on pause button. By default ⌘ CMD+Click does not activate window under the click.\n\nA: It is standard Mac behaviour - the first click activates the window, next click acts on the clicked object.\nSince Yosemite, one or two aspects of the OS now seem to accept a first click - close boxes on unfocussed windows etc, but it's still not global.\n\nA: With some inspiration from Mateusz Szlosek answer, I downloaded MagicPrefs to hook up Two Finger Click to ⌘ CMD+Left Click. It does pretty much exactly what I want, the fact that I don't lose focus is actually pretty useful to.\nEdit: already switched it to Three Finger Click because Two finger click gives to many false positives :) \n", "Q: iPhone 4 issues with updating whats app My whats app is requesting me to update in the App Store, when I agree, it takes me to a screen which requests my password, but the id is not mine, so I cannot update it. This only happens with whats app, and not with any other apps.\nI had no problem with previous Whats app updates.\nPlease advise.\nThanks\n\nA: It is difficult to know the answer as to why this happened now and not before.  Fact is that the WhatsApp app you have installed right now had been downloaded with the Apple ID displayed to you.  What I would do is to uninstall, then re-install the app from the App Store using YOUR Apple ID.\nSpeculation is that you installed the app using iTunes from a different computer or someone (maybe a friend of yours?) logged themselves in with their Apple ID on the device to do so.\nIMPORTANT: Any app you uninstall will also remove its settings and contents.  So, if the messages you have inside are not stored elsewhere (e.g. iCloud or on WhatsApp's servers, in case they store such items there), you will lose them.\n", "Q: Place document styles on the right of the document in Microsoft Word for Mac On my PC, I can place (or doc) the MS Word styles to the right of the document/screen.

Is there a pen or pencil tool that lets you draw lines in a freehand way?\n(I'm using Preview version 7.0 (826.4) in OS X Mavericks 10.9.5)\n\n\n\nA: Yes, Preview in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) has a freehand tool.  Access it within Preview from the \"Markup Toolbar\" icon of the .JPG or .PDF file you have open.\n\n\n\nWhen you click on that icon, the Markup toolbar appears, and the freehand \"sketch\" tool is the 3rd icon from the left, in blue in the image below.\n\n\n\nand it offers a smoothing option as well as a freehand mode.\n", "Q: How to re-open a Messages conversation? So I can close a conversation in Messages on my Mac and it handily disappears.  I can't seem to figure out how to re-open that conversation manually (as opposed to getting a new message in that conversation, that is).\nClosing means on the left panel of Messages. Hover over a person. An X appears in the middle of their \"card\" on the right. Click it. This closes the conversation and does not delete it.\n\nDoes anyone know if reopening these conversations is possible?\n\nA: This is all dependant on you having \"Save history when conversations are closed\" checked in Messages prefs - otherwise you can find the conversation, but not rejoin it to your main chat window.\nThe procedure is different if \"Messages in Cloud\" is enabled, which unchecks & disables the \"Save History…\" pref.\nBoth versions below [edited heavily over time].\n\nI have retested this Jun 2022, with \"Messages in Cloud\" enabled…\n\n*\n\n*Switch your phone off.\n\n\n*Log out of Messages on the Mac then quit the app\n\n\n*Navigate to ~/Library/Messages/\n\n\n*Enter Time Machine & navigate back in time until before your error.\n\n\n*Select the chat.db file & restore\n[alternatively grab this file from any other backup, Backblaze etc.]\n\n\n*Reboot, open Messages & check messages are restored.\n\n\n*Boot the phone\nIf you're lucky, you should be back to sanity.\n\nWithout \"Messages in Cloud enabled…\nYou cannot directly re-open the last conversation you had from the app itself, if you already closed it by hitting the x.\nYou need to dig in history, it's located at ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ichat/Data/Library/Messages\nConversations are stored by date. You only need to find any one instance of the conversation you are looking for.\nDouble-clicking that file will reopen it in a separate window in Messages.\nKeep that window open, or the next step fails.\nTo persuade it to reattach to the main window…\nScroll down your conversations list - it will have reappeared in last place.\nSelect it, it will appear to be empty, but will fill as soon as you click it.\nYou can now close the extra window.\n\nA: Easier still: just compose a new message to the person with whom you deleted the conversation, and as you hit enter to auto-complete the name, \"poof!\", the whole conversation reappears.  You don't need to send them any message.\nThis depends, of course, on having 'Messages in iCloud' enabled in your Messages preferences.\n\nA: What worked for me..\n\n\n*\n\n*Compose a new message to the closed chat. Leave it open, don't Send.\n\n*Using Finder Go to ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ichat/Data/Library/Messages\n\n*Find you latest closed chat. (as noted, chats are stored by date)\n\n*Drag and drop your closed chat to the same person chat open in step 1.\n\n\nIn my case, the entire chat re-appeared. No new message was sent in the process. Everything work as if I hadn't closed the chat. \n", "Q: Does app review rejection list all issues? Our app was rejected recently with reason Google+ signin, which we understood is not according to Apple policy and need to fix.\nWhile discussing about this issue we came across an interesting question with Apple review process, does Apple review team list all issues (if more than one exists) while rejecting app (or) would they stop reviewing other areas as soon as they found an issue (in our case Google+ signin)?\n\nA: There is no guarantee all reasons for rejection will be listed in your initial rejection response although like the previous poster I have had multiple reasons listed in the \"App Submission Feedback\" email which tells you of the rejection. But the rejection points were related. If one point for rejection was a HIG violation and another was around In App Purchase I wouldn't be so sure both would be included. \nWe have also experienced multiple/sequential rejections as we tried to submit the same target version to the store and we've learned a little bit more with each submission.\nWe have also tried to open up a conversation and get more detail and ask for guidance on how we may have interpreted something differently when we saw some ambiguity. This process is slow and every time we have re-submitted according to the original guideline. Don't pursue this option thinking you might change the policy or get a special exception especially if there is any kind of time sensitivity to your release. I say this especially in relation to this question because even if you were approved for that one item there is no guarantee something else would not be found on your re-submission.\nJust as another point of context, most of our rejections have come around In Application Purchase and specific interpretations of the product types.\n\nA: I have had an app rejected for two reasons before, and once these were resolved, the app was approved. I presume all rejection reasons will be provided, but I can't be certain, and the app may be rejected for another reason if it is reviewed by a different person than it was reviewed by the first time.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable Safari extensions when using Private browsing? I recently switched from Chrome to Safari for a few choice web applications, and I found that I couldn't disable extensions like Lastpass when browsing privately, at least not apparently, like I could in Chrome (which disables extensions by default in Incognito).\nIs there any way to do this from the Safari UI? I have an Applescript snippet I'm using to disable extensions, and toggle them back on when I'm done, but it's sort of a hassle, and I'd like to make this a default for Private browsing.\n\nA: EDIT: Making my answer better by offering a keyboard shortcut method since my question found a solution back in the day. for even quicker safari extension disabling in or out of private mode.\nORIGINAL: A much easier way to perform this action is to enable the Develop Menu in Safari Preferences -> Advanced -> At the bottom you can check this to have a Develop menu in your menu bar for safari. Here you can select from the dropdown \"Disable Extensions\" which will disable them completely for both private and non-private windows but the activation and disabling of the add-ons is extremely quick and hassle free.\nMaking private window/tabs default to having extensions disable isn't an option in any Safari settings sadly. However this is an easy one click solution to your problem.\nAgain, the steps are as follows:\nSafari -> Preferences -> Advanced Tab -> check \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\"\n\nNow you can click the Develop dropdown and click \"Disable Extensions\" as well as other options such as javascript, images, styles, and more!\nThis works with Safari 9.0 - 11.0\n\nA: Well, the most simple way would be to use Automator to create a service which first \"does\" your Applescript snippet and second \"calls\" Safari's menu item \"New private window\" for you.\nUse Automator's action \"record my actions\" and click \"Safari's > File > New private window\".\nBut you'd get a rather more compact result by adding this code to your existing script snippet:\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\ntell process \"Safari\" to click menu item \"Neues privates Fenster\" of ¬\n     (menu of menu bar item \"Ablage\" of menu bar 1)\n\n--   (Insert localized strings for my menu names: \"Files\" \"New ...\"\n\nThis done, either select \"Safari > Services > yourService\" or even give \"yourService\"  a shortcut via: \"System Preferences > keyboard > shortcuts > services\".\n\nA: This is another way to achieve your aim without using Safari. For your private browsing, download and use the web browser Opera.  It has built in VPN which will much improve your private browsing experience.

Or if that isnt possible, have both OS's.\nHow can I get Mac OS installed on this machine again?\n\nA: The easiest way is probably to use OS X internet recovery: \n\n\n*\n\n*Press cmd+alt+R at startup\n\n*Open the disk utility from the opening menu\n\n*Reformat the disk to HFS+ Journaled\n\n*Close disk utility and go to install OS X\n\n\nThis procedure will delete all your data and Windows completely.\n", "Q: How to stop some devices from receiving my iMessages? I want to receive iMessages with my iPhone and iPad. I have one small issue being that my iCloud account is shared with my family.\nHow do I make sure my relatives don't see all of my iMessages appearing on their devices? Is there a way I can select only my iPhone and iPad to receive the messages?\n\nA: The only way you can do what you want is to turn off iMessage in each device that uses the same AppleID, where you do not wish it to receive iMessages associated with the AppleID.\nI too share my AppleID  with my family, but I share it so that there is a singular iTunes account where all devices can access the apps and music purchased on the shared account. (Family share does not work well).\nThe trick is have multiple AppleIDs.  Dedicate one to iTunes, but then provide one for each user for iCloud.  I don't want messages, photos, and other iCloud connected items to be shared, so the shared AppleID is used ONLY for iTunes. For iCloud uses, each person has their own AppleID, that they use for iCloud purposes.  These family members do not use their own iCloud accounts for iTunes.\niTunes AppleID: all devices log into iTunes using this AppleID\nPersonal AppleID: each device is logged into iCloud using a personal AppleID.\n", "Q: Applescript to update MP3 Spotlight tag from iTunes tag Here is my situation.

I would like an applescript that can recursively for all tracks selected read the iTunes \"Year\" track and embed it into the file's \"Year Recorded\" metadata so Finder/Spotlight will then see that information.  I saw this: Applescript to update year tag for audio files but it is not what I need.  Any help on this would be highly appreciated!\n\nA: I don't know if one exists specifically for that case, but as a general rule of thumb, if it can be done, it will be on Doug's Applescripts\n", "Q: Start time in Calendar I have OS X 10.9.5, and my Calendar (version 7.0) will not let me change the \"Days start at:\" and \"Days end at:\" in Calendar general preferences. It will allow me to change the times inside the actual preference box (in the scroll menu), and it will stay to the specifications I set it at. However, it does not change on the actual calendar: every day in the weekly view starts at 1am and ends at midnight, no matter which time it is set to. \nThe \"Show: ... hours at a time\" option works still; it's only the \"Days start at:\" and \"Days end at:\" options that don't work. \n\nA: There appears to be a misunderstanding about what the \"Day starts at\" and \"Day ends at\" settings do in Mavericks. The underlying idea is that these are your work hours.\nBack when it was still called iCal, this caused portions of days outside that range to be shaded, to show they were off-hours. Now, however, the only effect these settings have (from what I have been able to find) is that they are used to determine which address is the starting location, for estimating travel time to an event. During work hours, your \"work\" address is used, and during other hours, your \"home\" address is used.\nThis is overridden by Calendar if there is an event (with a location) within the three hours prior to an event's start time, in which case the starting location is assumed to be the prior event's location. If you don't have work and/or home addresses set in your contact card in Contacts, Calendar will use your computer's current location (if available).\nRegardless of the \"Day starts at\" and \"Day ends at\" settings (and even prior to Mavericks), the entire day will always be shown.\n", "Q: Computer Keeps Crashing After Replacing RAM Recently I replaced my RAM in my Mid 2009 iMac.

I have a MacBook Pro and use an Apple Magic Mouse. I want to pair a wireless headset but have not been able, I cannot even see where to start.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Bluetooth and make sure bluetooth is on (select Turn Bluetooth On if it isn't). Also make sure your headset is turned on. Wait for your headset to appear on the list on the right, select it and click Pair. \nThe actual pairing process might differ depending on the headset, e.g. whether it requires a PIN code or not. The possible PIN required should be found from the headset's user guide.\n", "Q: Add a word count feature that determines pay (for freelancer paid per word) I am a freelance writer and I frequently use Pages to draft my articles. I appreciate having the word count on the bottom of the document because I am often paid by the word. Periodically, I'll see how many words I've written, break out my calculator, and see how much money I've made for a bit of motivation.\nHowever, I think it'd be really nice to have a little box next to word count that said how much money I've made so far. The function would get the current word count, I would pass it the constant of 'rate of pay per word,' and it would calculate how much I've made as I type. \nI want to set the rate of pay per word in a drop-down or something and have the \"money made\" display next to the word count box.\nI have some programming experience but I've never used Applescript or Automator. Can someone get me started with this? Thanks!\n\nA: Update: I originally had this using a Table. But have now changed it to a Text Object.\n\nHere is you start then.\nSave this Applescript as a Stay Open Application.\non idle\n    tell application \"Pages\"\n        set ActualCount to count words of body text of document 1\n\n        set calculation to ActualCount * 0.02\n\n        set object text of text item 1 of document 1 to (ActualCount & \" words  = £\" & calculation as string)\n\n    end tell\n    return 5 -- runs every n# seconds\n\nend idle\n\n\n\n\nNow in your document add a Text Object.\n\nIn the Text Object Arrange tab in the Format inspector.\nSet the Object Placement to Move with text.\nAnd *Text Wrap to Above and Below\nThis will save the need to manually move the Text Object down the document as you go.\n\n\nNow run the App. Start typing.\nThe one thing you will notice is that the real word count sees the word in the table. 329 That is why I have included the word count in the text objects results.  326 words  = £6.5\n\n\n\n", "Q: Color picker as app in Yosemite As of upgrading to yosemite the apple script choose color no longer works.

After a couple of forced reboots, the internal HDD failed and would no longer start up. I had replaced it with a 1TB several years ago, so it was not the original. At the same time, however, the Seagate 2TB External Firewire HDD with Time Machine backups failed. When I booted from Snow Leopard, Disk Utility could not \"Repair\" either volume. A different drive connected via USB is OK. The biggest problem was that Time Machine never worked correctly, claiming some issue with the backup, so that I frequently had to wipe the TM volume and start again, so I had not run it in a while. How likely is  it that both drives would fail? I am concerned about a virus or malware, though none was detected. It's terrible that both the backup and main drive would fail at the same time. My iMac and drives are on a UPS, so a power surge seemed out of the question, but maybe not? Since the iMac tends to run hot, I even have a Zippi fan on it, 24 hours a day. \n\nA: Viruses or malware do not (generally) cause hard drives to fail.\nThis was asked some time ago - so did you solve the problem in the end and if so, how?\nFor the record:\nSave the Console log files if this happens again. Using these files it is possible to limit the source of the problem to software or hardware issues. It is rather unlikely that two disks fail simultaneously due to independant reasons. Are you working in a hot or humid environment? Do your devices have surge protectors between them and the power outlet?\n", "Q: Transfer PDF from iPad to Mac without Internet No internet access here except iPhone.  Therefore, I can't download an iPad file explorer, nor email a PDF to myself.  Is there another way to \"reverse sync\" a PDF?\n(Backup will NOT do it).\nI did actually send by email, thinking sync would let me pull it from the Drafts (unsent) in Mail.  Alas, Apple has decided there's no longer any value in syncing Mail.\nI do already have two such explorer apps, but one announces it is not compatible with IOS 8, and the other does nothing when I select \"mount device.\"\n\nA: Depending on the type of Mac and iPad you are using, AirDrop could be a solution. The iOS device would need iOS 7 installed and be at least one of the models below.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5 or later\n\n*iPad (4th generation or later)\n\n*iPad mini\n\n*iPod touch (5th generation)\n\n\nThe Mac would need to be a 2012 or later model with OS X Yosemite installed.\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth need to be enabled on both devices, but no network infrastructure is necessary as AirDrop uses a direct Wi-Fi connection.\nAs long as you have the option to share the PDF using the standard iOS share button, you should be able to AirDrop the file. Your Mac will show up in the top section of the share sheet, but may take several seconds to be discovered so be patient.\n\nA: Long shot—maybe I can set up a mail server on the Mac and then email through the WiFi router.  Not sure that is worth the effort.\n", "Q: How to get rid of a standard user in my accounts on Mac? I added another user to my Mac and then didn't know how to fill out all the technical questions. The problem is I cannot use my trackpad when the computer starts. I have to use a mouse.\nI would like to get rid of this standard user, or somehow figure out the answers to my questions on filling out the standard user form in hopes the trackpad problem will go away. Or have I somehow lost my trackpad functionality in the opening screen of the computer forever?\n\nA: System Preferences > Users & Groups\nselect the user in the list on the left.  Click the minus sign at the bottom of the list.\nIf the preference pane is locked (see lock icon and text in lower left corner) you will need to unlock the pane before you can make changes.\n", "Q: Completely remove an application and its data on iOS 8 I have an application that is not working properly (I always get an error). I know other people who have the same app and for them no errors appears.\nI thought that maybe there are temporary data stored and getting rid of them would solve the problem.\nAs suggested in this answer I tried to remove the app. I tried to delete it in two ways:\n* By holding my finger on the icon and pressing the x.\n* And from the menu Settings -> General -> Storage -> Manage Storage. \nNone of them fixed the problem and I believe that some app data are not removed. I think so because when I remove the app and reinstall it, as soon as I open it I'm already logged in.\nIs there a different way of getting rid of app data? \n\nA: No, there is no other ways of erasing app data. As a developer you can't save data out of your bundle, and when you delete an app on your device, all bundle content is deleted.\nRegarding the logged issue, one posible answer may be that the app is identifying your device and saving your configuration on internet. To ensure that is your case, you can delete and reinstall the app, turn off wifi and celular data just after install and without open the app. Then open up and check if your info is there.\n", "Q: Complete list of App Store review rejection reasons I am iOS Developer. I have seen and had very bad experiences with App Store approval process.\nWe have developed an app according to Apple standards which are defined on Apple's official site. Despite this, our app was rejected 2-3 times for different reasons.\nWhy does Apple not give all reasons for an app rejection?\nWhere can I find more information about the app review process?\n\nA: You really don't give us much to go on, like what the reasons where and such. BUT, when it comes to Apple, a lot has to come down to the App Reviewer and if they had a good day or not. I have had one rejected, and submitted it again, changing a font and color, and it was then successfully accepted into the App Store.\nAt the end of the day though, they are professionals, and if there is a reason they have given, fix it and move on. It could be something as simple as UI Design ?\nYou say they have given you 3 different reasons, but then say why are they not giving you all the reason ?? \nApple ~ App Review Guidlines\n\nA: *\n\n*Watch the video The Ingredients of Great Apps to understand the basics of great apps.\n\n*Watch the video iPhone and iPad User Interface Design for practical design tips.\n\n*Watch iOS Development Videos to learn about programming and design tips.\n\n*Review the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and ensure that your app's interface and design adhere to these guidelines.\n\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite permanent environement variables Since I upgraded to OS X Yosemite I do have massive problems with environment variables that I really, really NEED for development of some projects.\nThe Problems is:\nEvery time I install some kind of update from the app store and my macbook restarts in order to install it, it will delete all, but really all of my environment variables which then costs me nearly an hour to set it up again.\nI've tried so many different solutions until now (I don't want to start listing them up here, I really searched the www for some hours...) and nothing has worked as permanent/persistent environment variable.\nWhat I need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*System wide environment variables that are NEVER reset without my action. They have to be persistent/permanent!\n\n*Environment variables have to be readable by shell as well as GUI applications\n\n\nI feel helpless and somehow stupid.\nIt's so easy on all linux distros I know and also in the Windows world. Why does it seem to be so hard for OS X?\n\nA: have you tried adding them to your .bash_profile? \nassuming you know how to use the vi editor:\n\n\n*\n\n*open terminal\n\n*enter vi ~/.bash_profile\n\n*add one line like the following for each environment variable you need to persist\n\n\n*\n\n*export PS1='\\[\\033[34m\\]\\w\\[\\e[m\\]   '\n\n\n*Save the file. \n\n*Restart your computer. \n\n\nThe only other thing would be to consider backing up your .bash_profile in case somehow you lose or corrupt it.\n", "Q: How do I change the color in Terminal indicating the use of a dead key? A dead key (a key that does not generate a complete character by itself but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after) is indicated with a yellow background to previous the final character.\n\nIt's perfect when you write black on white, but not when you write white on black, like in some Terminal configurations.\n\nMy question is: Where can I change that color?\n\nA: This isn't a clean fix, but here's a work around:\nKeep the Terminal as Black on White but then go to:\nSystem Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Invert Colors\n\nDoing this will change your Terminal (and everything else) to White on Black, but also change the yellow dead key to blue.\n\n\nYou can also turn Invert Colors on and off using a keyboard shortcut if you turn it on in the keyboard preferences:\n\n\nA: \nold: I don't know how to fix the dead keys, but there's a better solution (in my opinion), which avoids dead keys altogether. Check out my answer to the question: Accent popup in Terminal.app?.\nIf you don't like that approach, you might try to dig around in the file Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist and see if you can find anything there that might be useful.\n\nedit: Reading some of the comments on the original question, I see that this solution will not work for the OP, but I will still keep it as an answer in case anyone else might have this question and find the information useful.\n", "Q: Data recovery after interrupted partitioning My MacBook Pro was working fine until my friend stopped the Disk Utility from partitioning and force quit the application. Ever since it seems that the problem has grown larger and larger as I used it.\nNow it boots until the half of the loading bar, stays there, and shuts down after an hour or so. I tried looking at what was happening by doing a Verbose Boot and it was fine until it said it was repairing the disk and said it failed. I tried Command-R, it also said the disk could not be repaired, I tried the command-R boot again, now it says that it couldn't connect to the Apple support and stops.\nAny suggestions on booting/retrieving the data? Should I make a bootable external drive for my laptop? If so, how?\n\nA: You will need to create an installable USB drive which you can boot from, follow these steps carefully to achieve that: \n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Mac OS (Yosemite) from the App Store\n\n*Format a USB in Disk Utility and name it Untitled (very Important) You should format your USB to Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) \n\n*Launch Terminal and execute this command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app —nointeraction\n\n", "Q: Killing an application I try to kill a buggy application without success.\nI tried the Force Quit… feature in the Apple menu but it doesn't work.\nIn order to find the PID I tried the following command from the Terminal but it doesn't match anything:\nps aux | grep -i MyApplicationName\n\nThe only way to effectively kill it is to restart the system.

I want to start over on PlunderNauts because I bought something with in game money that really wasted my antimatter. I want a way to revert the purchase or reset game. I would much prefer reset game. \nP.S I'm not a complete noob when it comes to technology. \n\nA: The easiest way to reset an app if it does not support removal of user content is to remove and then re-install the app.\nAny purchase through the App Store can be re-downloaded for free.\nIn case the download is huge and you do not want to re-download it from the Internet, or in the event that the app is no longer offered on the App Store, you can also transfer the purchases to the computer you use to sync the iPad with and then delete the app from the iPad.  Use iTunes thereafter to re-install it.\n", "Q: Installing Xcode command line tools error: The package “DeveloperToolsCLI.pkg” is untrusted When I try to install the Xcode Command Line Tools I get the error message: \"The package “DeveloperToolsCLI.pkg” is untrusted.\" I can't seem to find the answer to this problem anywhere, how do you fix this?\n\nA: Probably the certificate is outdated. To circumvent this the following procedure should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"System Preferences\"\n\n*Hit \"Security & Privacy\"\n\n*Hit the tab \"General\"\n\n*Click the lock and enter your admin password\n\n*at \"Allow applications from anywhere\" mark the radio button \"Anywhere\"\n\n*then click the button \"Allow from anywhere\"\n\n\n\nor like indicated in the screenshot above control-click individual apps/installer-apps and select \"Open\". This probably doesn't work for the DeveloperToolsCLI.pkg but for other apps.\n\nA: Funnily Enough I had the exact same issue as you did about 10 minutes ago and stumbled across here via google. \nI still had issues after relaxing the code signing checks on OSX also. \nI logged into https://developer.apple.com/downloads and downloaded the CLI package from there (then installed them directly. ) \n\nA: I fixed this by changing the date, klanomath's answer didn't work for me.\nSeems like the problem is trusting the certs, so being Sept 2015, I started to download the tools and only after the download had started changed the date to Sept 2013 in the Date & Time dialog of the System Preferences.\nYou cannot change the date before the download starts, otherwise it will say the source is not trusted.\n", "Q: How to retrieve a PDF file from an iOS device?

I restart my Mac (for various reasons) often, about once a day. Recently I found about the key shortcut to do this: Cmd + Ctrl + Power. I really like this because it's fast and avoids that annoying prompt about \"reopening windows when coming back\".\nMy question: is using key shortcut Cmd + Ctrl + Power forceful, aggressive or potentially damaging in any way (like losing recent data)? Or, it is the same thing as doing it by clicking the menu options ( -> Restart... -> Restart).\n\nA: Command + Control + Power button will force a restart without any intervention from the system. Applications will not be closed in a proper way and everything that is not yet written to disk will be lost.\nIt is definitely not safe.\nYou could use Command + Option + Control + Power button to shutdown and then Power button to start.\n\nQuit all apps (after giving you a chance to save changes to open documents), then shut down the computer\n\n\nA: If you want to be able to Restart without the dialog, by key-command…\nan alternative, which is not truly intuitive, is to set up a key combo from\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts.\nFor example, you add Restart… as a combo\n…which irritatingly then puts another Restart into the  menu (it also does the same for Shutdown.)\nSo, the fix is then to add a second shortcut for Restart itself - which must be different to the first one, of course.\nGiving you something like this\n the 'Force Quit System Prefs' in the  menu is generated by the key command to take the picture\n\n", "Q: How to remotely push \"defaults write\" settings to OS X server clients I have some Mac OSX machines that i'm managing with an OS X server, clients are authenticated using Active Directory (golden triangle) and i'd like to disable version control for Pages/Numbers/Keynote as it doesn't work well with user profiles stored on an SMB share,\nThe commands that achieve this are as follows:\ndefaults write com.apple.iWork.Pages ApplePersistence -bool no\ndefaults write com.apple.iWork.Numbers ApplePersistence -bool no\ndefaults write com.apple.iWork.Keynote ApplePersistence -bool no\n\nThis setting appears to be per-user\nI tried to save these into a logon script file with .sh extension, I chmod+x the file to allow me to import it into OS X server but it doesn't work :(\nThere's a section in OSX server under preferences which has a load of .plist files in there but I couldnt find any good documentation on how to use it ... and I can't locate the plist file for Pages itself..\nSorry for the poor description, i'm new to OS X administration in this environment\nThanks in advance\n(This query is actually solved now but just FYI it was OX Mavericks 10.9.5 client and a Mac Mini running 10.9.5 with Server 3.1.2)\n\nA: The plists for the iWork suite are stored here:\n/Users/accountname/Library/Containers/com.apple.iWork.AppName/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iWork.AppName.plist  \n\nwith AppName: Pages, Numbers or Keynote.\nNote: If you browse the folder \"Containers\" with the Finder the \"directories\" com.apple.iWork.pages and com.apple.iWork.numbers look like files but are indeed folders with file extensions like valid Pages or Numbers files (which are packages itself).

I get feedback as to text returned by the commands.\n1 - You do have to setup each Mac for Remote Desktop, instructions for that should be available either with the software or on Apple's website.

About 2 weeks ago, I was trying to place an order for an Macbook Air on Apple and right when it comes to pay, they refused my debit card stating that they don't accept international cards. I then tried to order the product on amazon and they refused the payment. Called the bank and they said I just made a purchase of about a thousand dollars from apple. Told them that apple declined the card so that didn't make any sense. They asked for an email of cancellation for the fund to be available again. I got on the phone with apple and they said they have no record of my debit card number within their system. I thought maybe they were some mistake in the number or something so I tried the live chat for more accuracy (since english is not my first language) but they said live chat wasn't available to my location (Haiti).\nI see no way to contact apple other than by phone and it's expensive and ineffective for me. The bank told me it could take as long as 3 months for the fund to be available again and I can't wait that much to get the computer since I need it for work.\nWhat to do? How can I get an apple representative to follow through with me or at least get that cancellation email the bank is asking for? Or least have an email address where I can address the issue?\n\nA: Debit card holds are notoriously hard to deal with.\nContacting your bank is really the only way to release a hold. Even if a reputable vendor releases a hold, the banking system is designed to not act quickly to rescind the transaction as they time out once the several week period elapses.\nHopefully you have a good relation with your bank as they can immediately release your funds to you based on your relationship.\nYou can always reach an Apple representative via phone or email via the web site at which you made the order.

It has a recovery partition that offers such a reinstall. I do not want all the content back onto my computer after the reinstall, but I want to keep my time machine backup in case I forgot some important files.\nIs there an option so that I some time in the future could be able to get files from an old TM backup?\n\nA: Time Machine won't delete old backups until it thinks it needs more space to store a new backup. However, you do not get a warning before the deletion happens - only after the deletion deed is done, does the warning pop up.\nYou could trust this in the short term, however starting a backup of a cleanly reinstalled Mac is one way to have the system estimate it needs 100% of the side of the drive to start the next backup.\nI would not connect that drive to the restored Mac until you can turn off Time Machine and then copy using Finder one of the old backup intervals you wish to save. You could just set the old drive on the shelf or get a new drive to store the \"long term\" snapshot.\nBasically, you don't get notified before the deletion happens, so if you want to keep files, you need to take action now if you are not 100% certain that there is enough space to prevent automatic deletion.\n\nA: If you reinstall and keep using the same Time Machine backup disk, OS X will notice and start a new backup history - i.e. your original backup will remain untouched.\nHowever, in your case I would simply start a new Time Machine (TM) backup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Archive your current TM (e.g. to a disk image, using Disk Utility)\n\n*Test if your Backup is accessible & functional (you can select external TM disks by altclicking the TM symbol in the menubar)\n\n*Reinstall and restore data\n\n*Delete the current backups / wipe TM disk\n\n*Start new backup \n\n", "Q: What this ifconfig output telling me?

All seemed well on download, and the laptop re-booted to complete the install. The installation screen with OSX logo appears, and progress got to over 90% complete, with \"2 minutes remaining\" displayed. It remained like that for around 2 hours, before I decided something was likely wrong.\nI have started the machine a few times, and by default it boots back to try the install again, and stops in the exact same place.\nI have also started the recovery disk ( cmd-R ), checked for and repaired some permissions errors (that looked unrelated), and have also run a full install of Yosemite from the menu, which apparently succeeded. However, the machine still boots to same attempt to complete the install - I'm assuming this is the original upgrade that still expects to be completed.\nI have not been in this position with a Mac before, and am not sure what my next steps are:\n1) Is there any safe way out of the installation loop?\n2) If not, is there any way I could connect a USB drive in recovery mode, so I can retrieve some local files before wiping the disk for a complete re-install?\n\nA: This was a problem solved by simple patience.\nI left the machine with \"2 minutes remaining\" on overnight. After some period of time (presumably greater than 2 hours), the Yosemite install got over whatever was blocking it and completed.\nI do not know what the fault was. I am assuming some simple but non-critical I/O was timing out, perhaps repeatedly in a re-try loop. Whatever it was, the predicted time was not updated to reflect the problem, making it look like the upgrade had hung.\nThat does make this a rather uninteresting fault in terms of Q&A, but I am leaving this here in case anyone else ends up with a similar long-running upgrade and wonders how long to wait.\nAccording to comment by klanomath, many developers (with a large number of project files/ruby/etc) experienced the same problem upgrading to Yosemite.

I am learning shell from tutorialspoint today:http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-shell-loops.htm\nAnd I copied this code block to a loop.sh file:\n#!/bin/sh\n\na=0\nwhile [ \"$a\" -lt 10 ]    # this is loop1\ndo\n   b=\"$a\"\n   while [ \"$b\" -ge 0 ]  # this is loop2\n   do\n      echo -n \"$b \"\n      b=`expr $b - 1`\n   done\n   echo\n   a=`expr $a + 1`\ndone\n\nBut when excute it, I got things like:\n...\n-n 4\n-n 3\n-n 2\n-n 1\n-n 0\n...\n\nApparently, the -n flag doesn't work in echo -n \"$b \".\nThen I move the same file to my Ubuntu virtual system. Runs it.\nI got ：\n0\n1 0\n2 1 0\n3 2 1 0\n4 3 2 1 0\n5 4 3 2 1 0\n6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n\nI'm confused, though Ubuntu use dash as its default sh, but OSX use official bourne shell as its sh, why the script failed here? How to fix it?\n\nA: Echo is both a binary program (/bin/echo) as well as builtin command in some shells such as bash and sh.  As man echo states, \n\n Some shells may provide a builtin echo command which is similar or iden-\n tical to this utility.  Most notably, the builtin echo in sh(1) does not\n accept the -n option.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n\n\nIn order to fix this, you can change your script to use bash by setting the first line to \n#!/bin/bash\n\nOr change your invocation of echo to\n/bin/echo -n \"$b \"\n\n\nA: Appending '\\c' as per \"man echo\" documentation seemed to do this for me. So ... on line 9 the change would like below\n#!/bin/sh\n\na=0\nwhile [ \"$a\" -lt 10 ]    # this is loop1\ndo\n   b=\"$a\"\n   while [ \"$b\" -ge 0 ]  # this is loop2\n   do\n      echo \"$b \\c\"\n      b=`expr $b - 1`\n   done\n   echo\n   a=`expr $a + 1`\ndone\n\n\nA: echo is not portable as you experienced. I would suggest to use the POSIX alternative printf:\nprintf \"$b \"\n\nNote that in the general case, if you don't know in advance what contains $b, you should use instead:\nprintf \"%s \" \"$b\"\n\n\nA: The builtin echo for /bin/sh on macOS does not support the -n option. You can use the following alternatives:\nbash\nUsing /bin/bash works. But I don't like using it for scripts because it is not available by default for example on FreeBSD. On Linux it is available.\nbuiltin echo and tr\nIf you want to use the builtin echo (e.g. when you are echoing a password and do not want to appear in ps) and want to have it more portable, you can use:\necho hello | tr -d '\\n'\n\nprintf or /bin/echo\nOtherwise printf or /bin/echo -n are good options, too.\nJust be aware that printf takes a formatted string, so if you are including a variable in the string that might include a % or \\ character, it might break things. For example:\n$ w=%world ; printf \"hello $w\"\nprintf: %w: invalid directive\nhello %\n\nIn such case you can use %s as format string.\n$ w=%world ; printf %s \"hello $w\"\nhello %world\n\n\\c suffix\nAnother option is appending \\c to the end of the string when using echo (see man echo on macOS). It works fine on macOS but it's not very portable. \n", "Q: Install Xcode without admin Is there any way to use Xcode on a computer that I don't have admin permissions for?\nIs there a way to at least use command line tools like git and gcc?\n\nA: There's an answer to this over on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1837889/authorize-a-non-admin-developer-in-xcode-mac-os\n\nYou need to add your OS X user name to the _developer group.

Like if they blocked you number or deleted all messages before opening it. things along those lines?\n\nA: Other than they didn't actually open it yet - reading on the lock screen doesn't tag it as read - most likely is they switched off Read Receipts for some paranoid reason.\n\nEither that or you're blocked - there's no way to tell that, unless you ring them & get bounced straight to voicemail every time… though their phone could be off.  \nBlocked messages are sent & arrive at the receiver's phone, but are just never shown to them, so as far as the system & carrier is concerned, everything went as planned.\nVoice calls might ring once, then go to voicemail; depends how quickly the phone reacts to the block. Again, as far as the system & carrier is concerned, everything happened as it should.\nLast option, they sold their iPhone, bought a droid, & forgot to switch off iMessage. [long shot]\n\nA: To add to these answers, if the individual receives the message and has read receipts on, it will show as read.  If they delete the individual message (or the entire chat/conversation) in iMessage, it will change the final Read to a delivered.\nThis is the reason why a Read will turn into a Delivered after the fact.

I've already tried rebuilding every mailbox, as well as closing Mail, clearing its entry under ~/Library/Containers (to force it to rebuild its cache) and relaunching.

As my SSD is limited in size, I'm unable to host all of my VMs on it, and constantly moving VMs between the external disk and the SSD is quite time-consuming.\nHere's a screenshot of test using the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test software on the USB drive:\n\nTherefore, I was looking at external SSD disks, specifically for running my virtual machines. AFAIK, I have the option between using a flash disk (such as the VisionTek 120GB USB 3.0 Pocket SSD Drive) or buying an internal SSD drive and sticking it in a USB enclosure (e.g. the Inateck USB3 HDD Enclosure with UASP). Other interfaces are not really an option: the MacBook does not have eSATA and anything with a Thunderbolt connector is prohibitively expensive.\nFrom what I've read, the USB controller does not support TRIM, which is less than ideal. However, TRIM should be supported when using the USB Attached SCSI (UASP) protocol instead of the Bulk-Only-Transport (BOT) protocol.\nHere's what I'd like to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it true that UASP offers TRIM support? If so, what do you need to do to enable it (if anything)? E.g. do you need to run something like Chameleon SSD Optimizer to enable TRIM on the external disk?\n\n*How can I determine if UASP is supported on my MacBook Pro? I've read the instructions here, but this means I would need a UASP enabled device first in order to check if it is recognised as such. I'd prefer knowing if it'll work before ordering the hardware.\n\n\nIn closing: two screenshots from the USB and Extensions section from the System Information app:\n\n\n\nA: USB 3.0 supports UASP which allows for TRIM\nRe: enclosures - If you're using an external enclosure, the chipset must be able to pass through TRIM commands to the drive.  So without that, everything is a moot point.  And when connected in this manner, I would venture the drive would probably not even be recognized by the system as an SSD.\nQuestion - can't you just upgrade your internal SSD to a larger capacity?\n\nA: I've got a Samsung 840 Pro with the Inateck USB 3.0 enclosure with UASP support.  Runs great.  Make sure you get the enclosure with DC power in.  Some says it's not needed, but I do notice a slight difference with the DC power in.\n\nA: I run two virtual machines off an external Firewire800 with two SSD (mirrored) connected to a mac mini server (quad i7) which is running mirrored 500gb 7.5k spinners with a third VM (not very critical) running on it, so three Vm total. It runs great for server side software and basic database needs for a small business (ski resort). I know that's pretty vague and it doesn't address i/o, data size, connections...but it works well. Nobody that supports us or the software wants us todo this but my proof of concept was enough for me to implement it several years ago.

I would like to be able to connect to my cars dashcam via wifi while in the car but still be able to use my iPhone's cellular connection.  \nThe way the dashcam works, it appears as a wifi access point so the phone tries to connect to the Internet through it.

The problem of having the connection to my Wi-Fi back-up camera blocking my internet use over the cell towers has driven me crazy.  The solution is so easy it is embarassing.\nThese folks are right.  Just follow these easy steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to the Wi-Fi for your backup camera.\n\n*Go to SETTINGS and select Wi-Fi then select the blue INFO icon to the right of the name of your back-up camera Wi-Fi\n\n*Make note of both the IP address and the Subnet Mask address\n\n*Select the STATIC option and enter only the IP and Subnet Mask addresses from Step 3 -- (Leave everything else blank)\nYour iPhone will be connected to your back-up camera Wi-Fi and also to the LTE signal at the same time.

Select \"Static\" as the type of IP address, and then enter the following IP address and Subnet Mask :\nIP Address : 10.0.1.4 (for example)\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.0.0\nMake sure you leave Router, DNS, and Search Domains blank! This tells the iPhone that it should use its cellular network to route internet traffic rather than trying to do it via WiFi.\n\nA: If you're asking if you can make calls or receive texts while connected to the hotspot, then yes, you can!\nHowever, if you're asking if you can use cellular internet, then I'm afraid that is not possible.\n(Mildly technical explanation ahead!) The reason is that, when connected to WiFi, the iPhone funnels all requests through that Wifi connection to the dashcam's built-in server. Now, some apps are programmed to switch to cellular if the connection times out, but this takes a not-insignificant amount of time and is contingent on how the dashcam responds to these requests sent by these other apps (e.g. 404 error vs. DNS lookup failure).

Therefore the mapping can be done from the command line as follows:\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[\n    {\n        \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\": 0x700000065,\n        \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\": 0x7000000E7\n    }\n]}'\n\nThe mapping won't survive reboots, but can be made persistent using a launchd agent by placing a property list such as the following in the appropriate launch agent directory (for instance ~/Library/LaunchAgents for your user):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.local.KeyRemapping</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/hidutil</string>\n        <string>property</string>\n        <string>--set</string>\n        <string>{\"UserKeyMapping\":[\n            {\n                \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\": 0x700000065,\n                \"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\": 0x7000000E7\n            }\n        ]}</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: Doing @Steph's answer but with Karabiner:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Karabiner from here\n\n*In \"Simple Modifications\" tab, select your keyboard (mine was this \"Microsoft..\" one)\n\n*Press on \"Add item\" to make those 4 modifications in the screenshot below \n\n\n\nThis will map your keys to be as follows:\n\n\nA: Karabiner doesn't seem to support OS Sierra yet but Karabiner Elements does. Installing it takes a bit of work but once you've done that you can map \"application\" to e.g. \"right_command\" to make it work like you described.\n\nA: Repurposing \"menu\" button on a notebook's Windows keyboard in MacOS 10.12+\nThere is a new version of Karabiner (\"Karabiner Elements 12.1\" to be used with MacOS 10.12+) that imho justifies adding a separate answer to this topic, though I posted s.th. similar here before.\n[ As I did upgrade to MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra) I had to use ApplePS2SmartTouchPad.kext to be able to re-map the \"menu\" button, which is now seen as scan_previous_track. ]\nWith Karabiner Elements you have to edit its ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json file, somewhat differently** to the above code …  \nFirst find out \"menu\" button's name on your keyboard via Karabiner EventViewer:\njust press it once. [Mine is: scan_previous_track, yours' probably different … ]\nHere is some code analogue to parts of what I posted above, opening & closing \"Information\":  \n{\"description\": \"Finder: 'menu' key to æ-I / æ-W by pressing or holding\",\n    \"manipulators\": [\n        { \"conditions\": [{ \"bundle_identifiers\": [\"^com.apple.finder\"],\n                                         \"type\": \"frontmost_application_if\" }\n                        ],\n                \"from\": { \"consumer_key_code\": \"scan_previous_track\" },\n          \"parameters\": { \"basic.to_if_alone_timeout_milliseconds\": 200,\n                          \"basic.to_if_held_down_threshold_milliseconds\": 500\n                        },\n         \"to_if_alone\": [{ \"key_code\": \"i\",\n                           \"modifiers\": [\"right_command\"]\n                        }],\n     \"to_if_held_down\": [{ \"key_code\": \"w\",\n                           \"modifiers\": [\"right_command\"],\n                           \"repeat\": false\n                        }],\n        \"type\": \"basic\"\n        }\n                    ]\n}\n\n  (If pressed briefly Cmd-I is triggered, after holding the button for half a second: Cmd-W) \n– from, to… and type are mandatory expressions for re-mapping\n– conditions, parameters define exclusively affected app(s) and time thresholds for events**\n– \"repeat\": false keeps this code from unintentionally closing more than one window\n– This code would be inserted between \"rules\": [ ]'s brackets (possibly with \",\" added)\n     (I made shortcuts for my browser's history-back and -forward function with press & hold, too)\n– Have a look into Karabiner Elements json Reference Manual …\n(** KE no longer supports conditional selection by uielementrole, but a few other conditions.)\n\nA: I use MacOSX 10.11.6 El Capitan (from a broken Mac mini) on an hp-2570p EliteBook, so the Windows menu-key isn't recognized as \"PC_APPLICATION\" but simply as \"FN\" = function key.\nUnfortunately this key blocks secondary keys so I had to do some more elaborate twitching to get where I wanted:\nUsing Karabiner (with integrated EventViewer for information on keys/names/windownames) I reused the key to:\n – mimic æ-i in Finder (repeat for closing)\n – mimix æ-i in VLC ( – \" – )\n – do history-back in Safari\nFurther I made other non-menu-key changes:\n – redefined some keys that aren't labeled correctly on my German keyboard\n – made access to pageUp/Down \"one-handed\" on my keyboard (not shown)  \nI'll probably find some more simplifications in other applications over time ...\nI used this \"individual\" code in \"private.xml\" (details: see post by antoine):\n<!-- 1st item redefines <,>,^,° for my keyboard (effective for further items !!!)\n<item>  \n    <name>Switch_specialKeys_^_°</name>\n    <identifier>private.Switch_specialKeys_^_°</identifier>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L, KeyCode::GERMAN_U_UMLAUT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, KeyCode::6, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::DANISH_DOLLAR, KeyCode::BACKQUOTE</autogen>\n        <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, KeyCode::DANISH_DOLLAR, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L</autogen>\n</item>\n\n<!-- Next 2 items differentiate \"Cmd-i/-w\" via (not-)AXWindow for dual use -->\n<item>\n    <name>WinR-FNDR æ-I</name>\n    <identifier>private.WinMenu_to_Cmd-I</identifier>\n    <uielementrole_not>AXWindow</uielementrole_not>\n    <only>FINDER</only>\n        <autogen>\n          __KeyToKey__ KeyCode::FN, KeyCode::I, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L\n        </autogen>\n</item>\n<item>\n    <name>WinR-FNDR æ-W</name>\n    <identifier>private.WinMenu_to_Cmd-W</identifier>\n    <only>FINDER</only>\n    <uielementrole_only>AXWindow</uielementrole_only>\n        <autogen>\n          __KeyToKey__ KeyCode::FN, KeyCode::W, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L\n        </autogen>\n</item>\n\n<!-- For VLC the <uielementrole_only> elements are \"AXWindow\" for the main\n     window and \"AXRadioButton\" for its information window. -->\n\n<!-- My shortcut for Safari's \"history-back\" consists of this definition:\n     <autogen>\n        __KeyToKey__ KeyCode::FN, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L\n    </autogen>      -->\n\nFor PC applications running under CrossOver the application names aren't recognized by Karabiner, so I used <appdef> to (re)define their names and <windownamedef> to address a particular window; these definitions were then available in <only> and <windowname_only> tags.\n", "Q: Does iPhone have a Wi-Fi & Bluetooth toggle widget in Notification Center? I've just recently bought an iPhone with iOS8 last month. I noticed that although iphone has a control center when locked, it doesn't have any way to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth from the notification center, that's available via apps/default in android phones.\nIs there any free app with a widget in iOS8 that can let me toggle these settings via notification center? I searched online, but couldn't find any app.\nI don't intend to jailbreak my iphone, although I found some web-blogs suggesting to jailbreak and use Cydia...\n\nA: You can toggle directly by swiping up from the very bottom of the screen… \n...from the lock screen, home screen or in most apps [in some apps it's difficult to get the swipe to be recognised if the app uses the same part of the screen for a function.]  \n\n\nA: It's not possible for a store-approved app to add a Notification Center widget as there are no public APIs for controlling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth power.\nThere might be private ones you could access with an app signed for enterprise or developer use, but using control center is a better idea for this.\n\nA: I found this question by searching \"iPhone Notification Center Wi-Fi\" on Google. In case anyone is looking, I ended up finding an app called Wi-Fi Widget (https://getwifiwidget.com). It doesn't let you turn off the wi-fi from Notification Center, but it does let you jump directly into Wi-Fi settings, where you can do that. It also has some other nifty features like showing connection status.\nI am not affiliated with this app.\n", "Q: iTunes doesn't allow me to create playlists and playlist folders anymore I'm a bit stumped.

Click \"Install Mac OS X,\" be sure to select your new internal HDD, and follow the prompts. \nIf you did not see a Recovery Partition, proceed to the next step. \nIf you did not see a Recovery Partition, you will need a USB thumb drive of at least 2 GB for an Internet Recovery install, and or 16 GB for direct install. Select your old HDD to continue booting.\nFrom there, you will be able to follow this tutorial on how to create a USB Recovery Drive: \nhttp://osxdaily.com/2014/10/16/make-os-x-yosemite-boot-install-drive/\nInstall OS X should format automatically, but to be sure you get a good, clean install: Go to Disk Utility, and select the new HDD from the left field. It should be labeled \"Untitled\". Click the \"Erase\" tab, and for \"Format:\" select \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled). For \"Name:\" use anything you like. \nClick the \"Erase\" button, and the disk will be formatted. Exit Disk Utilities, which will bring you back to \"Install Mac OS X,\" or \"Reinstall OS X New Copy\". Click and follow the prompts. Now all you have to do is wait!\nSome notes:\nRestore from Time Machine only works if you have a Time Machine set up, Disk First Aid is for repairing an already formatted drive, and Get Help explains the features available.\nRemember you can restart into Recovery Mode and run Disk Utilities, as this will save you time in the future if your Mac starts acting erratically. \n\nA: OSXDaily has a wonderful guide to creating a bootable USB drive for Yosemite, the most recent version of OS X.

Hopefully I diagnosed a bad hard drive correctly (I'll provide my method) and I hope this helps someone out there. This is probably overkill on instructions, but there are PC people out there who may try to help out the  (much more) rare critical Mac issue. I did most of this from memory, so I may have messed up a label here or there. Please use Common sense if I did this and look around the screen for something that looks like what I'm talking about.\nNOTE: This process only worked because the hard drive was still able to access recovery mode by holding Command+R on startup. If your Mac is unable to access that feature, this may not work for you, but I included some other handy stuff, like recovering files from the drive.\nInitial Symptom: My husband's Mac had been randomly shutting down for some time, but we were limping it along. Finally, on startup one day, he saw a progress bar that would complete and then the device would shut down. Here is the process I followed:\nThings you'll need:\n\n*\n\n*SATA/IDE to USB Adapter (Mine was Vantec USB 2.0, but it shouldn't matter. Be sure to get one with external power source. I've had little to no success with USB powered devices.\n\n*Mac running OSX Lion or later (prior versions didn't have the recovery partition)\n\n*New Hard drive that is compatible with Mac.\n\n*T8 Mini Torx screw driver\n\n*Small phillips screwdriver\n\n*Recommend: A cold beer and a lot of patience\n\n*Just in case you pull off the rubber coating, you'll need a case removal tool like you use to replace a cell phone screen. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XVPDSG/ref=tsm_1_fb_lk\nStep 1: Troubleshoot the Device\n\n*\n\n*Power off the Device\n\n*Hold down the Command+R keys as you start the device. Continue holding the keys until the Recovery Utility prompts you to select a language (Grey Screen) **NOTE:**You may have to hold the keys for up to two minutes.\n\n*After you've selected a language preference, Select the Disk Utility item in the list of utilities.\n\n*Select your drive on the left navigation panel (It's probably already selected)\n\n*Click the Verify Disk button in the Disk Utilities. It will probably show some erros. Click the Repair Disk button that will only appear after you click Verify. Do this until there are no errors or (like me) you receive a message saying that the disc couldn't be repaired.\n\n*Click the Verify Disk Permissions button. If this completes successfully, click Repair Disk Permissions\nNOTE This may solve your problem. If you didn't receive a nasty message on step 5 saying the Disk was corrupt, to back up your files and such, good on ya! Try some Canadian troubleshooting -- When in doot (doubt) Reboot!\n\nStep 2: Removing the Hard Drive from the Mac\nHere's a great visual guide to the steps below: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2010+Hard+Drive+Replacement/4305\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the MacBook.\n\n*Remove the hard drive from the device by removing the 8 screws from the bottom of the MacBook and pulling off the bottom cover, being careful not to pull at the edges as it will pull off the rubber coating. If you accidentally do this, tip to follow. To pull the cover, put your fingers at the hinge of the MacBook screen (from the bottom), and lift from the metal part under the rubber cover.\n\n*You will see a small black bar held down with two screws right next to the hard drive. This must be removed before the hard drive is pulled out.\n\n*If your hard drive is OEM, there should be a plastic tab that you gently pull on to lift the hard drive, being cautious of the SATA cable\n\n*Pull gently at the cable connector seated in the end of the hard drive facing the exterior of the case to disconnect the hard drive.\n\nIf you messed up and pulled off the rubber coating:\n\n*\n\n*After you have finished removing the bottom cover, get out the case removal tool from the list of things you'll need that you diligently ordered with your new hard drive for just $1 or so\n\n*Hold the rubber coating on the metal case with the metal part (inside of the cover) facing you.\n\n*GENTLY slip the edge of the case removal tool under the edges of the rubber coating with the edge of the tool facing towards you and lift the edge back over the edge of the metal backing.\n\n*Slowly glide the tool around the edge, lifting the rubber back into place, being extra cautious around the corners.\n\n*Put the back plate down and don't breathe on it or the rubber stuff will come off again.\n\nStep 3: Using a PC and HFS Explorer to Recover Files\n\n*\n\n*Download HFS Explorer and install it on your PC (http://www.catacombae.org/hfsexplorer/)\n\n*Plug the removed hard drive into the SATA/IDE to USB device. There will be two cables to plug in and they are directional. The smaller plug is the data cable that goes into the rectangular USB connector. The other goes to the power cable. If you bought the same one I did, there is a connector that adapts the standard power supply connector to SATA. There is a power switch on this cable.\n\n*Plug the USB cable into your PC and turn on the power switch on the cable (if you haven't already).\n\n*You should hear the device chime in Windows, or you can verify that the device driver was recognized and installed in Device Manager. Note: You will not see it show up as a hard drive as the Mac drive format is not diurectly compatible as a disk drive with Windows.\n\n*Open HFS Explorer and click File > Load File System From Device\n\n*I was not able to use the AutoDetect Button successfully, but you can try. I selected the Select a Device radio button and in the Detected Devices drop-down and click Load\n\n*Select the files and folders you wish to back up in the tree to the left just like you would any Explorer (or Finder for you Mac peeps) tree, then click Extract. My husband's files were in the second partition under the Users > [Username] folder.\n\n*Follow the prompts to extract the files to the desired location. You will have to babysit it because there are a lot of Mac file names that are not OK on Windows. I used the \"Auto-Rename\" feature and it worked swimmingly.\n\nStep 4: Installing OSX on the New Hard Drive\nIf you're still with me, crack open another beer, because you've probably finished the first one. This was the most frustrating part to research. When you Google, \" How do I load OSX on a new hard drive using a PC \", you end up with some great suggestions to use VM Virtual Box, which means you have to get a copy of your OSX load. Well, mine happened to be on this one very broken Mac hard drive, and you can only make a Mac bootable with a Mac. Grr...So, I gave this a shot. I hope it works for you.\n\n*\n\n*Install the NEW hard drive back into Mac. Before you do this, there are a couple of screw-in pins that are in the sides of the old hard drive that you will need to hold your new hard drive in place. Use the T8 mini Torx screwdriver to remove them and place them into the sides of the new drive. These will hold your new drive in place. Put a couple of screws on opposite corners of the bottom plate to hold it in place and protect all the precious bits in there. Do not turn on the Mac yet\n\n*Connect the OLD device to the SATA/IDE connector, connect the USB to the Mac and turn on the power to the new hard drive\n\n*Hold down the Option key and turn on the device to choose which device to boot to.\n\n*Select the OLD hard drive (Probably called Recovery_[something]) when prompted to choose a boot device.\n\n*The boot sequence will take you into the Mac Recovery Utilities menu\n\n*Select the Disk Utilities option from the menu\n\n*Select the NEW Drive in the list to the left and click Verify Disk. This should come out clean\n\n*Click the Erase option in the Disk Utility and complete a format of the hard drive using the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) option\n\n*If you like, partition the drive using the Partition option and set the number and size of partitions to the desired size.\n\n*Exit the Disk Utility tools using the menu in the upper-left\n\n*In the recovery menu, click the Reinstall OSX option\n\n*If you are prompted to connect to a wireless network, you can either connect it to an ethernet cable to speed things along, or click the Wireless icon in the upper-right of the top toolbar to search for an SSID to connect to. This will permit you to use the online recovery options to download the operating system.\n\n*Follow the prompts and enter your iTunes login info\n\n*When prompted to select a disk for installation, select the disk (or partition) you would like to install OSX on on the NEW hard drive and follow the prompts to initiate the installation.\n\n*IMPORTANT When the reboot after download occurs, if the installation gets stuck on Verifying Disks or shows symptoms of pixelation on the progress bar and corresponding status text, hold down the power button on the Mac to shut it down. CONGRATULATIONS! You successfully diagnosed that the old hard drive is bad. ;-) If this occurs and your installation doesn't go through, pull the USB cable from the SATA/IDE to USB adapter from the USB port, hold down the Control key and turn the Mac on. Select the Install OS X drive as the boot device.\n\n*Wait for an eternity...have a couple more beers...Voila.\n\n\nA: The easiest way, with the least steps, and with no thumb drive nor cloning (nor etc., etc.): web install.\nWith your Mac near a trusted Wifi access point or plugged into ethernet...\n\n\n*\n\n*While booting up, hold down command + r until you see the image of a globe. You will see a message below: 'Starting internet recovery. This may take a while.'\n\n*If on Wifi, select the network and enter a password. It may seem like your password was rejected for a second - wait a bit.\n\n*Web install begins!!! You will see a status bar count down with the image of a Globe above.\n\n*Select your language.\n\n*OS X Utilities will appear.\n\n*Select 'Disk Utility' - it will gather info on your system.\n\n*Select your new hard drive from the sidebar.\n\n*Select the 'Erase' tab.\n\n*Select the format and give it a name.\n\n*Click 'erase'\n\n*The hard disk is reformatted - a new disk with the name you have it will appear in the sidebar.\n\n*Close 'Disk Utility'; you'll be brought back to OS X Utilities automagically.\n\n*Select 'Reinstall OS X'\n\n*Select 'continue' and 'agree' to the various screen until you are prompted to select which disk you want to install OS X.\n\n*Select your newly minted hard drive and hit 'install'\n\n*The download of OS X will begin! You're home free!\n\nA: I just installed a new 500GB SSD on my MacBook Pro 17\" (early 2011) and used Carbon Copy Cloner to clone the contents of my current hard drive to the new one. This works well if you have a working hard drive already in your Mac; and you should clone the drive before installing the new hard drive. You can connect the hard drive externally to your MacBook Pro using an adapter. Cloning is easily done, and testing the install is accomplished by rebooting the Mac and holding down the \"Option\" key. Select the new hard drive from the list, and you'll know pretty quickly if it was successfully cloned or not.\nIf you need a clean install of OS X, you'll have to use a bootable USB drive. This tutorial describes how to do so. \n\nA: Quick and easy: Find and dedust the system DVDs, bring the optical drive back to live by removing the crumbs inside and install Mac OS X 10.5.5 (Leopard).\n;-)\n\nA: On Power start, Hold Command + Option + R and your system will be started in recovery mode.\nAfter that you need to reformat the HD to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) via Disk Utility option & then install new OS via Reinstall OS X option.\nReally impressed by this.\n\nA: My MacBook late 2009 didn't start properly and it turned out that the old hard drive had some I/O errors. I bought a new Kingston SSD hard drive, then switched it with the old Toshiba. I then plugged the old Toshiba to the computer using a USB interface cable and started the computer in Recovery mode (Command+R pressed while powering on).\nUsing the utilities I erased the new hard drive using the default options and made a new OSX install using my WiFi.\nAfter the OSX was installed it automatically suggested to import applications, settings etc from the old hard drive still connected via USB.\nEverything now works like a charm. No timemachine or cloning needed. I'm using the latest OSX version available for the late 2009 MacBook. Hope this helps!\n\nA: You are doing it the hard way and lots of people will not be able to see the third drop down menu to set it correctly.

You would imagine that if it is designed to do that Mac would make an Adapter for that very application. Any one have any suggestions? \nI am using a Mac Pro if that helps at all.\nMy ultimate problem is that I am using two thunderbolts to power two identical projectors with VGA and each projector is stuck in different resolutions. The Projector company suggested I try using a thunderbolt to Dual VGA adapter.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge a 'Thunderbolt to twin VGA' adapter does not exist.\nI think what The Projector Company are suggesting are the Matrox DualHead2Go adapter boxes. The premise of these adapters is they connect to two displays (or projectors) and present a single connection to the computer. They present the two displays as a single super-wide display to the computer. e.g. if you have two 1024x768 projectors connected the computer will treat them as a single 2048x768 display (this can be very useful sometimes!).\nAs far as I can see Matrox do not offer a Displayport -> Dual VGA version. But you could get the DualHead2Go Analog and use a Thunderbolt-VGA adapter to connect it to the MacPro. This would probably work. But…\nThe original problem; the two projectors. I see no reason why the Matrox box should be able to get different resolutions for the projectors than the Mac Pro can. I think you should be able to fix this problem without the Matrox box. I have fought many a projector in my time.\nAre you connecting both projectors with the same series of cables and adapters? In my experience projectors often present different resolution options over VGA than DVI, so both should be connected in the same way if they are to behave the same.\nDo the projectors both display a list of resolutions in System Preferences > Displays? If one projectors doesn't display a list at all and only allows a single resolution option (800x600 for example), then the cabling to that projector is probably bad.\nIf you swap over the display cables at the projector end, do the 'stuck' resolutions swap (do the resolutions follow the cable or the projector?).\nIf you are using VGA cabling to the projectors, can you switch to DVI cabling? This may be costly, depending on cable length, but the picture quality is often significantly better (and hopefully it'd fix the resolutions!)\nTry SwitchResX, see if that offers more resolutions options for the projectors.\nIf none of those things help, look for any factory reset setting on the projector.\n", "Q: Dual hard drive setup in early 2011 MacBook Pro 17\" (replacing optical drive with HDD) I have an early-2011 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.10.2 (also Windows 7 Professional on a Boot Camp partition), and recently upgraded my hard drive to a 500GB SSD (Crucial MX100). The speed is amazing, but I don't want to load too much data onto the drive since TRIM cannot be enabled in Yosemite without disabling kext signatures (I'm utilizing the disk garbage collection and do not wish to enable TRIM; the more disk space available, the better the garbage collection firmware works on the SSD).\nThat being said, I am considering swapping out my SuperDrive for a second hard drive - keeping the OS and programs installed and running from the SSD, and saving documents and files on the HDD. However, I am aware that in some 2011 MacBook Pros, the optical bay can use either a SATA II or SATA III connection. I checked in System Profiler, and it shows that the optical drive's link speed at 6 gigabits, with negotiated link speed at 1.5 gigabits; therefore I'm guessing it's a SATA III capable connection that's simply throttled to the speed of the optical drive. However, reading here would suggest that the 17-inch early-2011 MacBook Pro may not support a 6.0 gigabit connection.\nAm I wrong anywhere here? And is there a maximum capacity HDD that is supported in my model MBP as a second hard drive?\n\nA: UPDATE: I purchased a dual hard drive adapter for swapping with the optical bay, and installed it in my machine with the original 500GB SATA III that Apple shipped with the laptop. So far everything is working just fine, and I have two working hard drives in the machine (triple booting Lion, Yosemite, and Windows 7 via Boot Camp). The second HDD is displaying 6.0 Gb/s link speed, with a 3.0 Gb/s negotiated link speed. I understand that even though the HDD is SATA III, it's dropping down to SATA II speed; but so far there aren't any problems with the disk running, and I can boot Lion from it without any issues.

If you choose MAC address, click Continue and enter the MAC address and specific IP address.\n  \n\nIt would be unwise to have the actual ranges overlapping. Set one to e.g. 1.92.168.1.2-10 & the other to .11-20\n& don't have 2 devices both trying to do NAT, leave that to the main router.\nAlso, make sure the main router is only handing out addresses for wired devices & the TC for wireless, or they'll fight.\n", "Q: unwanted notification from email address I keep getting notification of missed facetime from an email address, they come 2 notfications at the time.  I've tried blocking the caller, but it's not a caller it's an email.  how can I stop this\n\nA: Have a look at How to Block an Email Address on iPhone as the information might be helpful.\n", "Q: Should I install iOS 8 on my iPhone 4s? What are the drawbacks of updating my iPhone 4s to the latest iOS? What are the advantages? With my phone plan, I cannot get the newest iPhone yet.\n\nA: Advantages: \n\n\n*\n\n*more security\n\n*more features: quick reply, continuity (if you have Mac &\nYosemite )\nDisadvantages:\n\n*it will run slowly\n\n*you won't get a lot of the features that 5S and above have\n\n*could decrease battery life\n\n\nIf you have experience with ssh and jailbreaking, I would say go ahead but make sure you can downgrade using ssh just in case you don't like it. \nHowever, if you don't even know what that is, I wouldn't recommend upgrading because there is no way to downgrade if you don't think you'll like it because apple already stopped signing ios7 and below.\n", "Q: Xcode - how to \"export\" app solution I am very new to coding, especially to using an IDE like Xcode. \nI have a finished app that I'm done compiling and testing it within Xcode itself. I wish to create a file that the user would double-click to run.\nHow do I get my program out of Xcode as a self-standing application?\n\nA: Use Product → Archive to create a binary of your app. Then go to the Organizer window and optionally validate it. Lastly, export the app to your desktop so you can distribute it as you wish.\n", "Q: Change download location of Safari PDF download button I would like the following behaviour of the Safari PDF Download button: \nOn clicking the PDF download button by moving the pointer to the bottom of a pdf/ps, the file is downloaded to the Downloads/ folder. Instead, I would like that to work as a \"Save As\" button so that I can save the pdf by a different name and in a location I prefer. \nI know there is Cmd-S but I would like to use this as an opportunity to learn about Apple Scripts if that kind of idea can be used to solve this problem.\n\nA: AppleScript on its own can't be used to 'hook' into other actions such as clicking certain things. There are tools available to run AppleScript on keyboard shortcuts, however you might as well use ⌘S in this case, or remap this shortcut with System Preferences → Keyboard. One cannot change the download location of the button in Safari preferences.\n\nA: You will not be able to intercept the clicking action of a button using Applescript.\nThere are a couple of approaches you can use to achieve your goal.\n1, Create an Automator Folder action to watch for pdfs file in the downloads folder. And Ask you where you want to move them.\n2, Write an applescript that runs from the Applescript Menu or a Automator Service ...\nUsing the Applescript Approach I would get the url of the front window of Safari.\nAnd then have my applescript ask me to choose where to save it.\nFor the downloading  you may have to use some shell scripting like Curl in aApplescript Do shell script command.\nLook at the Safari Scripting Library for details on accessing the url.\nYou can find out more about applescript and how to use it by looking at the  Introduction to AppleScript Language Guide\n\nA: Instead of using apple Script (that might not work for this) one can use the Automator.\nIt is rather simple Automator function.\nAll you do is reversing your steps.\nYou will still download using Safari defaults, but then the Automator will move the .PDF to a folder of your choice.\nHere is a sample, just replace the .dmg to .pdf and choose the destination folder with the Move Finder Items's option to Show this action when the workflow runs\n\n", "Q: How to go back to \"All Artists\" in iTunes In iTunes, in Artists view, after I've used Command+L to go to the track currently playing, how do I exit and go back to showing All Artists? I currently have to scroll to the top of the Artists list (on the sidebar) and click \"All Artists\" every time. Is there an easier way?\n\nA: The only way I know short of scrolling with the mouse is, after having pressed Command-L, you can press the following key sequence to get to All Artists: Tab, Tab, A, ↑, ↑\nThis assumes you have an artist's name starting with the letter A. If not, then substitute A with the first character of the artist's name that's directly under Compilations in the sidebar.\nIn other words, after having pressed Command-L, pressing Tab twice sets focus to the now playing artist in the sidebar. If it's not the artist directly under Compilations then pressing the appropriate key to get there plus ↑ twice takes you back to All Artists.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 keyboard help lost emoji's I installed a new keyboard then deleted it now I've lost all my emoji off my standered keyboard just got a-z 0-9 #+= \nSomeone help please?\n\nA: You can go to Settings > General > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard ... and select \"Emoji\" from the list. Then, in order to access the emojis on your keyboard, tab this \"globe\" icon:\n\n\n\nA: iPhone 6 iOS 10.2 - Emoji keyboard wouldn't load until I deleted a load of foreign keyboards I didn't require.

When I go to full screen mode, the tab and navigation bar are still showing. Those toolbars are annoying when I try to watch a movie, etc.\nThis is the shot of the top of the screen:\nEDIT: I realized this may apply to other browsers such as Safari\n\nA: 2022 update\nThis answer is no longer correct due to native integration of this feature into Firefox. Look to other answers for better options.\nOriginal answer\nBy default there's no way to do this in native Firefox, but there is an extension called Toolbar Autohide that should do exactly that! It allows you to use your mouse to make it appear again by hovering at the top of the screen where the toolbar would normally be.\nSimply install the extension at that link and restart Firefox when it prompts you to do so. After Firefox restarts, right-click the toolbar and select Maximized Autohide; you should then be ready to go!\nI would recommend changing an option for the add-on in the add-on manager (command + shift + a), though: under General, change Transition Type to Slide-in to make it a little prettier.\nLastly, keep in mind that hovering your mouse at the top of the screen can make the OS X bar appear as well, which can be mildly annoying (which would happen for almost any extension that does this type of thing). To get around this, make good use of key commands!\n\n*\n\n*command + l brings up the address bar so you can immediately start typing in a new URL\n\n*command + k brings up the Firefox menu so you can select your print options, preferences, etc.\n\n*command + t creates a new tab and focuses on it\n\n*control + tab and control + shift + tab allows you to cycle through tabs just like command + tab and command + shift + tab allows you to cycle through windows in OS X\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I solved this by using Automator to create an Application that makes use of an Action > Utilities > Run Shell Script:\nopen -a Firefox\nsleep 1\nlsappinfo setinfo -app Firefox ApplicationType=UIElement\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Firefox\" to set value of attribute \"AXFullScreen\" of first window to true'\nsleep 0.5\nfor f in \"$@\"; do open -a Firefox \"$f\"; done\n\nI set the shell script Shell: to /bin/sh and Pass input: to as arguments, save it as \"Firefox Full Screen\" in /Applications, change its icon as explained here and add it as an exception in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab > Accessibility.\nI then can click the application icon or run any of the following and it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*open -a \"Firefox Full Screen\"\n\n*open -a \"Firefox Full Screen\" --args \"https://google.com\"\n\n*open -a \"Firefox Full Screen\" --args \"https://google.com\" \"https://twitter.com\"\nI'm using this coupled with the following userChrome.css to both evade a well known issue with the macOS menu bar on full screen applications and another long standing address bar and tab auto-hide bug that Firefox have with macOS native full screen.\nuserChrome.css\n#navigator-toolbox[inFullscreen] {\n    position: relative;\n    z-index: 1;\n    height: 3px;\n    margin-bottom: -3px;\n    opacity: 0;\n    overflow: hidden;\n}\n\n#navigator-toolbox[inFullscreen]:hover {\n    height: auto;\n    margin-bottom: 0px;\n    opacity: 1;\n    overflow: show;\n}\n\n#content-deck[inFullscreen]{\n    position:relative;\n    z-index: 0;\n}\n\nFor a generic approach, check my other answer.\nTIP\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox, by default, does not have any issue on Linux or Windows to auto-hide address bar and tabs in full screen as expected. With that said, I grabbed this userChrome.css from my ArchLinux setup. I use it on i3 and sway tiling window managers, with all the [inFullscreen] removed, to get address bar and tabs to auto-hide in normal bordless windows.\n\n\nA: One way to do this is by using JavaScript. For Firefox, execute this code:\ndocument.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].mozRequestFullScreen()\n\nOn Safari, put this in a button href attribute:\njavascript:if(!document.webkitFullscreenElement){document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].webkitRequestFullscreen();} else{document.webkitExitFullscreen()}\n\nObviously, this isn't very graceful unless in an extension or bookmarklet.\n\nA: On about:config, set browser.fullscreen.autohide to true 1.\nBonus: also set ui.prefersReducedMotion to 1 and you'll have a slightly faster animation on macOS (or a hugely faster animation on Windows or Linux).\n\nA: I'm on MacOS, January 2022.  To accomplish what we want:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Firefox \"full screen\" mode as normal (e.g. Ctrl-Cmd-F)\n\n\n*On upper right of the screen is the \"hamburger menu\" (three horizontal lines); right-click it, then select \"Hide Toolbars\".\nNo Firefox extension needed.\n\n\nA: On the about:config page search for the following key\nfull-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only\nand set it to false\nThen you can create a bookmark 'link' with the following 'location':\njavascript:document.documentElement.requestFullscreen()\nEdit: new FF supports shorter syntax, thanks @trss for suggestion\n\nA: One way to do this that is handier than a bookmarklet and does not require fiddling with userChrome.css is to install Tampermonkey, then create an user-script with these contents:\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name         Fullscreen\n// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/\n// @version      0.1\n// @description  Add fullscreen to every website!\n// @author       You\n// @match        *://*/*\n// @icon         data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\n// @grant        none\n// ==/UserScript==\n\n(function() {\n    'use strict';\n    document.addEventListener(\"keydown\", (e) => { if (e.ctrlKey && e.key == \"F\") {\n        let button = document.createElement(\"button\");\n        button.innerHTML = \"Switch to full screen\";\n        button.style.position = \"fixed\"\n        button.style['z-index'] = \"9999\";\n        button.style.left = \"50%\";\n        button.style.top = \"50%\";\n        button.style.width = \"50%\";\n        button.style.height = \"50%\";\n        button.style.transform = \"translate(-50%, -50%)\"\n        button.style.background = \"yellow\";\n        button.style.color = \"black\";\n        button.style.border = \"solid 10px green\";\n        button.onclick = (e) => {\n            document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();\n            button.remove()\n        };\n        document.documentElement.appendChild(button)\n    }}, true);\n})();\n\nThen, Control+Shift+F will display a big button that you can click to make any page fullscreen.\nThe \"button\" step is needed because otherwise Firefox will refuse to switch to fullscreen as it believes the fullscreen request was not triggered by an user's action.\n\nA: The only way I was able to get this working on FF Developer Edition v80 was the combination of:\n\n*\n\n*Installing the plugin @Paul mentioned: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen_plus/\n\n\n*Setting full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only: false in about:config\n\nA: The Firefox add-on recommended by pat-s\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen-any-site/\ndoesn't work for me as of this date--it doesn't do anything.\nI found a workaround to get a full screen with no search bar and related stuff at the top, suitable for those websites that don't have a full-screen button. Click the PIP button on the right side of the screen, and then double click the PIP screen, and it will make it a full screen without any search bar or bookmark toolbar. It has its own stop and start button, but it is not suitable for websites that have their own full screen button because, although it works for that, you lose the native controls of the websites full screen. To get out of it, click the X in the upper left corner and then click the PIP button on the right of the screen and you will be back to the original screen.\n\nA: The extension Fullscreen Plus (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen_plus/) worked for me, for making full-screen of any website (note extensions do NOT function on mozilla extension web site, so you have to go to a different page).  CTRL-SHIFT-F full screens the current web site, including making the URL bar, tabs bar, and menu bar go away.\nI did set full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only to false and full-screen-api.macos-native-full-screen to true.  I don't think either of those were required.\n\nA: For me, this addon currently works: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen-any-site/\nCurrently fixed to command + shift + o but maybe custom hotkeys are supported in future versions.\n", "Q: How to make Safari open all PDFs in-browser? For the majority of PDFs I view in Safari, they are opened in-line, which is what I want. For example, these all open in Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*MSP430F665x Data Sheet\n\n*MCP1700 Data Sheet\n\n*BAT54 /A /C /S Data Sheet\nHowever, some PDFs, for reasons I have not been able to determine, are instead downloaded. For example, when I click on each of the following links, a PDF is immediately downloaded, instead of being displayed in-browser.\n\n\n*\n\n*1825910 Drawing\n\n*OS Series Data Sheet\nI suspect that the servers for the last two links are doing something like what is described in the StackOverflow question \"force a pdf download automatically\", but I'm not sure. I have already removed the last vestiges of Adobe's PDF reader, which I regret ever installing, including the internet plugin in the /Library/Internet Plugins directory.\nHow can I make sure that whenever Safari encounters a PDF, it is opened in the browser, and not downloaded?\n\nA: As pointed out, the first three examples are direct links to the PDF files in question while the other two are controlled by a server script in the background.\nThere is nothing what you can do about it on your side since the server fully controls the distribution of documents in the two last example links you provided.\n\nA: Recently I was not able to open any pdf inside safari-12 on Mojave, I tried a lot of things and spent lot of time with apple support. After two days the support was able to resolve my issue, here is what they did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Safari\n\n*Go to ~/Library/Containers\n\n*Delete com.apple.safari\n\n\nReopen safari. This fixed the issue for me.

So I cannot re-set it.\nI need to get the pictures downloaded from that old iCloud account and add them to my new iCloud account. But I can't log in to get that done.\nHoping someone can help.\n\nA: While I can assume that you ask due to having forgotten the password, it is not clear from your question.\nIn case you still know the password, you can log on to the iCloud account at appleid.apple.com, change the e-mail address and make it the primary e-mail address.\nNOTE: Obviously, you cannot use an e-mail address you already associated with an Apple ID in a different account.\n\nA: I recommend you to re-create the same email and use it to recover the iCloud password on your account.\n", "Q: MacBook Air Help Please I have a MacBook Air and random advertisements and tabs have been popping up, I wanted to know if I take it to my nearest apple store can they figure out a way to help me fix this for free or at least at a low price?\n\nA: Oh dear, it sounds like you have adware!\nHowever, you can clean this up yourself very easily for free. There is a tool call AdwareMedic (which you can download from this website); download it from the website, install it, and run it.

Is there a way to do the same on Mac OS X?\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean for sure, but take a look under System Preferences → Notifications as you might find your answer here.\n\n\nA: To clarify on what @Macmaniman posted, you'll want to change a setting with your notifications. To do this, go to your Settings app > Notifications (upper right corner) > Messages (in the left-hand column). Uncheck Show message preview, which will hide the message previews (or subject fields, as you refer to them).\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I actually think he means the actual subject line above the actual message (it splits the input text area in two, see screenshot).\nI haven't found this option in iMessage anywhere on Yosemite though...\n\n", "Q: What is the latest iOS version for iPhone 4?

I uninstalled Google chrome by deleting it from the Applications folder and I also deleted the associated profile data from ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome.\nBut I have failed to remove all the Chrome apps icons from launchpad.\nI would greatly appreciate it if you can point to the location where google is keeping those app launchers. I have looked for them in the hidden folders as well as Google folders in ~/Library but I have had no luck.\n\nA: How to delete an app, removing it from Finder, Launchpad and Dock Menu:\nKeep in mind that this permanently deletes the apps in question from your Mac. \n\n\n*\n\n*Drag the app from launchpad and add it to the dock menu\n\n*Right click app on the dock menu, choose 'Options' then 'Open in finder'\n\n*Once in Finder, right click on the app and choose 'Move to trash'.  \n\n*Finally, just grab the app from the dock and let it go in the middle of the desktop.

You apparently can't just share one. In Facebook this is possible. In android this is beautiful. Why iOS has to be like this?\n\nA: \nWhy there is no way to share a photo to whatsapp or evernote?\n\nThere is a way to share a picture to Evernote with an Extension which has to be turned on first. WhatsAppDevs haven't implementet that yet.\n\nThis is only possible if you give the app access to ALL of your photos. You just want to share one.\n\nPrivacy is so constructed in iOS you can get Access to Photos or don't. All or nothing.

This would be very similar to how assistive devices function when using an Automator extension such as the \"Watch Me Do\" function. The reason why this comes up is because it is attempting to either read or write to the screen on behalf of the user. \nThis is an assumption, but it is based on working technical experience with the underlying software sets involved. \n", "Q: Poor sluggish performance after upgrading to Yosemite I am facing very sluggish performance in my MacBook Pro after I upgraded it to Yosemite.

The new one did FileVault2 just fine.  \nEveryone should do it exactly this way. As soon as you buy it, turn it on. Before you attempt to transfer any media/stuff to it or install apps. If it doesn't work, take it back to the Apple Store and ask for a replacement or a refund.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. After several back and forth my hard drive was replaced by Apple. \nProblems with FileVault could be a warning sign that you drive is dieing. \n", "Q: Bug? Scheduled reminder won't dismiss When I put a scheduled reminder with a daily repeat mode, it won't dismiss.\nIt keeps on showing and just changes the date to the next day.\nIs this a bug or a feature?\n\nA: It will do this until you mark it as completed. Think of it this way: unlike recurring Calendar events, a new Reminder is created for every recurrence. They are all \"nested\" into each other, though, so that effect is not obvious. \nFor example, if I create a reminder that re-occurs every day called \"water plants\" it will appear normal the first day. On day two, though, unless I mark day one as \"completed\", it still thinks I haven't watered the flowers on Day 1, so it continues telling me that I need to water the plants on Day 1. As soon as I check Day 1, it will be marked as completed until Day 2. \n", "Q: How to remove space character (whitespace) from end of filenames and foldernames? Problem with mac is that it allows space character at end of file or folder.\nIf this file or folder with space character in end is beeing copied to FTP using Filezilla or Dropbox then mac makes folders with \"Foldername_WhiteSpaceConflict\"\nTo get rid of this problem all files and folders with space character needs to be renamed without space character.\nWhat solution could be the best using terminal or some program?\n\nA: Here's the script to find and remove trailing space from files and dirs:\n#!/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\nIFS=$'\\n'\nfor file in $(find -d . -name \"* \")\ndo\n  target_name=$(echo \"$file\" | sed 's/[ \\t]*$//')\n  if [ \"$file\" != \"$target_name\" ]; then\n      if [ -e \"$target_name\" ]; then\n          echo \"WARNING: $target_name already exists, file not renamed\"\n      else\n          echo \"Move $file to $target_name\"\n          mv \"$file\" \"$target_name\"\n      fi\n  fi\ndone\n\n\nA: I had to fix the script a bit more.

Your key problem is the available space on your internal disk.\n30 GB out 500 GB isn't enough for your kernel to breath.

I am using the iCloud Drive, and sometimes the name of an app folder is too clumsy and too long to own a place on the Finder sidebar. Per the previous attempts by others, the Finder sidebar uses only the original folder name, but ignore the alias name for all its items. So using alias isn't a viable approach to workaround the name of app containers.\nAs known from the iCloud Programming Guide, the name of the app containers is actually specified by a key in the app-provided plist. The file hierarchy of the iCloud Drive does prove this, but the plist doesn't seem storing together with the Documents folder for each app. Is there a way to change it?\n\nA: After doing some searches in the Library folder, the plists and the app icons of the app containers are located in:\n~/Library/Application Support/CloudDocs/session/containers/\n\nChange the BRContainerName property in the plist of an app container, and restart the Mac. The iCloud Drive in the Finder will then display the changed name. As shown in the following screenshot, the app folder \"Documents\" was supposed to have a longer name \"Documents by Readdle\".\n\nWithout locking the plist, the name still hasn't been reverted after a restart. So it is still unknown in what circumstance the plist will be reverted back to the original version by the bird daemon. But given the fact that the plist specifies the corresponding app version, it will probably be reverted on an version update to the container-owner app.\nP.S.

I have a 2013 MacBook Pro Retina which had a cup of tea spilled on it.  The machine works perfectly except for the 3 key which is not responding.  I've taken it in to an Apple Authorised Repair Centre who said they needed to replace the keyboard, battery etc to fix it at a cost of £600.\nIs there any other way to get this single key working for less than £600?\n\nA: This is still the top answer here for replacement keyboard, so I figured I'd offer my recent experience in repairing my keyboard after spilling soda on it.  \nThere are three options to fix a key that is stuck due to a spill. I list them in order of ease.\nKeep in mind that all of this is likely to void any warranty. Some of it may damage your computer more than it already is. \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the top of the key and clean under it.\nUsing a toothpick or other small prying device like a guitar pick, a plastic spudge, you can pry from the sides and pop the key cap off. There is a metal clip holding the key top down to a surface with a rubber membrane that actuates the key switch.  If done carefully, you can remove enough of this to clean the mechanical workings of the single key.  This may not be practical if you have many problem keys. \n\n\n*Replace the keyboard.\nThe keyboard is not simple to get to.  Officially, as mentioned in other answers, you must replace the whole assembly which includes the keyboard, backlight, trackpad, and batteries.  \nIf you are willing to spend nearly a full day doing the work yourself, or happen to be a computer repair person and can do it faster, this is a reasonable option. \nYou will need the right screwdrivers and an anti-static work surface. Pentalobe, hex, and a tiny philips are all needed.  See other guides for sizing, but most computer repair kits these days come with the needed sizes. You will also benefit from a fine pointed plastic pick, and a strong plastic spudger for flipping open cable connectors and moving tiny wires into place. \nFollow the teardown guides you can find on the net. \nWhen you get to the keyboard, you will see it's secured with what look like rivets. It's necessary to rip the keyboard out of those 100+ holes, trying to get all the rivets out of the case in the process.  From what I've seen, this works fairly well, but you may have to pull some that got left behind with tiny pliers or drill them out. \nThe new keyboard can be purchased online in various places for not too much money.  You will also need the pack of 100+ tiny screws, ph000 I think.\nThe keyboard can now be screwed in place using the holes left by the rivets.  The screws should self thread into the aluminum. \nPut everything back together and see how it works. \n\n\n*Give the keyboard a bath.\nThis is the option I chose because I didn't like the idea of ripping the keyboard out and didn't know how much of a complete pain it would be to remove the batteries. None the less, it seems to have worked out since I'm using that laptop right now to compose this. \nIt's necessary to completely disassemble the laptop as before, but also remove the battery and trackpad. \nRemoving the battery is ridiculously difficult, and in most places on the net it's written off as simply impractical to attempt.  Even Apple techs are instructed to replace the whole assembly when replacing a battery.  \nYou risk puncturing the battery cells in this process.  That's double plus not good. These batteries can quickly turn into a smoking jet of flame if damaged in the right way.\nBut if you are willing to try anyway, here's how.\nGet a strong pry tool that can slide under the battery packs and cut through the thick double sided tape in the process, without bending up and into the battery cells.  I used relatively thick plastic pry tools made for door panel removal on cars.  But I think a thin metal pry tool as sold for working on computers would have worked better. Work one pack at a time until you have them all loose.\nThe two center batteries on the 15\" are taped to a strong piece of spring steel that is then taped to the case to cover the trackpad.  I'm not sure which is easier to remove, but it seems that the steel plate will go with the case or the two cells depending on which tape seal you break.  The steel curves over the side edges and won't be possible to get under from the sides, but can be gotten to from the center of the laptop side if you can get past the cables that are in the way.  \nI used some 70% isopropyl alcohol in a syringe to try to make removing the tape easier.  Others suggest applying heat to the case for the same reason.  I found the alcohol did remove the stickyness of the tape at the edges, but the tape is about half an inch wide and the alcohol did not do well at penetrating.  Also, I'm not sure if the plastic covering the batteries was keeping the alcohol out of the batteries since they formed pucker lines under the tape in prying. \nBe careful to not deform the batteries when working them out.  They are like a very hard clay inside a plastic cover. And definitely don't puncture the plastic!\nI can't really say for sure if heat or solvent is very helpful.  But I can say that removing the batteries was just about the most frustrating thing I've ever done in computer repair. \nAssuming you manage to get the batteries off the case, the trackpad under the steel plate is fairly easy to replace. There is a screw over a switch on the underside of the trackpad. It's designed to be an adjustment for the clicking action on the trackpad.  If you screw it back in too tight, your trackpad won't click.  Too loose and the pad will rattle\nOnce everything else other than the keyboard is removed you can clean the whole keyboard.\nDepending on what you spilled in it, choose your cleaner.  If it's something fatty like coffee with cream, you may need to use alcohol or similar solvent.  If it's just sugars, distilled water will do. Ideally, find Deionized water as it's even cleaner than distilled. I couldn't find deionized locally so I used cheap distilled and it's working fine.  \nUsing a clean plastic tub to avoid any new contaminants getting dissolved, simply submerge the body and keyboard in your solvent and swish it around. Brush the keyboard with a toothbrush while submerged.  Be careful to not leave behind any bristles if you brush the underside. Actuate all the keys over and over to work loose any dirt or stuck on residue. \nWhen you think it's fairly clean, repeat the process with a fresh batch of cleaner. \nThen repeat with distilled or deionized water, and once more with a clean batch.  \nDry it very well \nAfter it was clean, I shook out the water, dried it with a microfiber towel, and then with a hair dryer set to low heat.  Then I let it sit overnight in front of a dehumidifier with the dry air blowing over it all night. Since distilled and deionized water contain very little mineral content of any sort, it should dry with no water spots at all, and nothing left inside the components.\nReassemble\nReassembly is easy except for knowing which screws go where if you didn't organize them well.  I recommend taking a photo of the layout as you go along, and possibly printing out the photo and placing the screws on it as you take them out.  It's not that hard to figure out which length to use where, but if you get it wrong you might go too deep and strip out the socket trying to get to tight. \nAlso be mindful of which parts go on in which order.  Best to take notes on disassembly since there are times when things have to go under other things, or partially under them. I found myself having to take up the main logic board several times to fit things back right. \nBatteries may rattle\nThe biggest issue I had with the reassembly was the batteries again.  With the tape all malformed and not sticky anymore, it's pretty useless at holding the batteries firm.  They rattle in the case now.  \nI plan to resolve this by using some foam tape to reduce the gap. But I won't be using double sided adhesive.  \nPrior Mac laptops had removable battery packs and didn't have a need for heat sink. But I suspect these batteries may be using that tape as a heat sink connecting to the case with a lot of surface area.  The palm rests have always gotten warm with use. So I'm thinking of options to restore that heat transfer capability without resorting to similar tape. It's probably not really an issue.  But I'd like to at least stop the rattling of the batteries in the cavity.\nNew Info: \nI found thermal padding that can be cut into shapes to stick to the batteries and thereby remove the gap while giving them a thermal bridge to the case as the tape was likely doing. These pads are tacky, but it's not so much an adhesive and they stay in place, but can peel off easily if needed. \nI found it necessary to put them on front and back of the batteries unlike how Apple had the tape only on the hidden side. Since the pads aren't super sticky, this keeps the batteries from falling the sub-mm distance to the case bottom when it's sitting normally.  \nPersonal Note\nI hope this guide is useful for at least knowing how much of a pain the process can be. \nI personally find Apple's use of rivets and adhesive on a \"Pro\" product that would normally have a useful life of up to 10 years (multiple owners likely) to be a huge detraction from the quality of the product, and a big ding on my feeling of Apple's brand superiority in hardware. \n\nA: Pending your specific model the following might vary.\nThe MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Early 2013 packs the battery, keyboard, trackpad, and upper case into one assembly. \nIf any of these components fail, the entire assembly must be replaced. \n\nA: The keyboard can be replaced, however it is a job and Apple officially discourages and will only replace the entire top case (costing over $800). Check videos on Youtube to see it done by third parties, and there are a few places where you can mail yours in and they'll do it for you. \n\nA: I had a similar problem with a keyboard that had a broken ']' key and I used Karabiner and Seil to first remap my caps lock to a \"hyper\" key (Command-Shift-Option-Control) and then mapped hyper and another key to do the broken key.\nYou could also do something with System Preferences→Keyboard→Text where, for example ',,' becomes '3' and '$$' becomes '#'.\nThis allowed me to go for another 12 months before I replaced the Macbook. It's not a hardware fix but it's amazing how fast you adapt. :)\n", "Q: Control iPhone from Windows 8 Is there any software out there that will allow me to remotely control my phone from a windows 8 computer?  Either through Bluetooth, WiFi or direct cable connection?\nSomething like AirPlay but with the ability to actually use the phone from the computer, make calls, use applications, play music and so on. \n\nA: No, there is no general purpose remote control on iOS. I don't follow the jailbreak community closely, but you might get some other capabilities there.\nFrom a non-jailbroken scheme, you have these small elements of what you ask:\n\n\n*\n\n*Air Parrot type software to AirPlay a PC but no capability to remote control\n\n*MDM tools like Casper Focus to remotely place an iOS device into guided access mode or automate the opening of one URL.\n\n\nAgain, the MDM profile isn't anything that hooks into VNC or accessibility (software switches or accessibility features like voiceover) - it just simulates one action to launch an app.\n", "Q: Can I make a call from iPhone 5s via WiFi?

If so, I can use the opacity action on the objects, but when I tried to use an opacity action, on transition, with duration 0, it didn't work.  Having a short (0.1s) duration causes kind of a jarring flicker.\nI also thought about using multiple slides with magic-move handling the opacity changes, but I didn't see a way to change the opacity of a group.  \nI'm running Keynote 6.5.2 on Yosemite (the most recent releases of both I believe).\n\nA: I've built a small demo Keynote file (v5.1, on Mac OS 10.6.8, hope you can open it) -- this does what you're trying to achieve.

However, you do not need to worry about this; Apple has built in multiple levels of protection to prevent you from messing up your computer. \nThere are two larger protections:\n\n\n*\n\n*The App store automatically makes sure that the file you downloaded is what you were supposed to download and fixes anything it sees wrong.\n\n*When installing, the Yosemite installer double checks that the installation files are all in order and stops the installation if not.\n\n\nTherefore, you should be okay to just go for it and upgrade.\n", "Q: Placing finger twice on Finger Scanner on iPhone 6 plus changes view I was fooling around with iPhone 6 plus and found that when you place finger twice on finger scanner or rotate your finger on the scanner the currently running app or the menu views move down to half for the screen.\n \nI'm not worried of this behavior but I am curious why such thing is happening.\n\nA: This is called \"Reachability\" and is Apple's way accommodating allow for one handed use where the thumb can reach the top of the screen. \nIt exists on the iPhone 6 line where few people have hands large enough to reach the top of the screen when holding the device from the bottom.

When I plugged it in my PC motherboard recognized it, I chose to boot from the USB but it takes to me a blank screen.\nTo troubleshoot, I tried it on my Asus laptop running Debian. I selected the usb to boot and it just boots up Debian. So something is not working with the USB. Any suggestions? Is it possible that making a bootable USB with boot camp won't work on PC?\n\nA: It is my understanding what the Windows flash drive installer created using Boot Camp can only be used on select Mac computers. The flash drive can not be used on PC's. This post Will bootable usb created by bootcamp on mac work with PC? describes the same problems you are having. (Look for Technicallity's solution.)\nThe iso file you have can be setup in one of three ways. First, is a legacy BIOS boot which usually assumes the use the MBR disk partitioning scheme. Second, is a UEFI boot which assumes the use of a GPT disk partitioning scheme. Third is both types where you are prompted to select your choice when booting. If you need to changing the boot setup, that I can help with. For example see here.\nIt would be easiest to have another Windows machine available to create the bootable flash drive. I assume you don't have one? \nBased on the limited information you have provided, here is how I would proceed. (Don't feel bad, no one ever gives me enough information.) This is a rough outline.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a machine running Windows to assist you. That you already have.\nIt called your Apple. Assuming you do not have a Fusion drive, it is\nrelatively easy to install and later remove Windows from any Mac\ncomputer. For your Apple, I do not have enough information to say\nhow easy.  I would install but not activate Windows. This will give\nyou 30 days of free use. You will then be able to use the same\nWindows 7 to install and activate on your new PC.\n\n*Get and use the official Microsoft tool for creating Window 7\ninstallation flash drives. The tool can be found at Windows USB/DVD\nDownload Tool. Don't let the name fool you. The tool does not\ndownload software. It is used to create bootable install media after\nyou have downloaded Widows 7.\n\n*Determine whether you are going to use a legacy BIOS or UEFI boot\nmethod. From my understanding, if the UEFI option is available, you\nhave to configure the boot setup to select it. (I have never seen an\nEFI boot. I have always used the legacy method.)\n\n*Determine if your iso has to be modified using the Microsoft\noscdmg.exe tool. This tool is used to change the install boot\nmethod.\n\n*Create the bootable flash drive and install Windows on your new\ncomputer.\n\n\nAnyway, I figure I am right only 10% of the time. Most likely someone else will have your solution.

I noticed Mavericks prefers the DNS server to /etc/hosts (scutil --dns). There used to be a good 'ol \"order hosts,bind\". Is there anything equivalent for Mavericks so my hosts file is consulted before reaching out to the DNS server? Thanks.\n\nA: (Cross-posting my Reddit answer here.) In my experience, it's more of an additional priority issue: IPv6. It hit me in Mavericks, but probably dates back to Lion. I develop on my local machine using /etc/hosts aliases to route requests through nginx, but on slow Wifi with slow DNS, it will often hit a 5-second timeout before bailing out on IPv6 and trying IPv4, realizing that there's a relevant /etc/hosts entry, and resolving that way. Not very convenient to have +5s tacked onto my recode-reload cycle.\nAdding a ::1 example.com line to go along with my 127.0.0.1 example.com lines resolved the issue for me.\n\nA: I've noticed this dns authority priority inversion in 10.10.2 (Yosemite) but not back in Mavericks. \nI just started this thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/2y22sj/yosemite_ignoring_localhost_etchosts_redirects/\n", "Q: What do I really lose if I backup my iPhone to iTunes without transferring purchases? I don't want to waste tens of gigabytes of space on my laptop to store apps that I can just as easily download from the App Store.\nAssuming I would have to recover an iPhone backup from iTunes to a brand new replacement iPhone, what will I lose if I don't agree to transfer purchases when making the backup?\n\nA: I understand the apprehension!\nIn reality, though, you do not stand to lose anything. The only reason to transfer those purchases to your computer would be to save bandwidth and time by not re-downloading everything. You will still lose associated app data (e.g. login information, cache, etc.), but that would happen even if you did back up those apps to your computer.\nIn short, you will be fine without transferring purchases.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You'll only lose something if you had a purchased medium (music, app, ...) on the device that was taken down from the iTunes Store in the meantime. For example, if a developer deletes their account, all their apps will disappear from the store and they won't be available through your Purchases section ever again, so if you don't have the .ipa, you can't install it again.\n\nA: The transfer purchases part should be your least worry. This only backs up the purchased apps and music (occasionally people also have videos - I don't).\nAll this extra information backed up in general takes up much less space on your PC than the app contents (think spotify) and camera roll photos which are backed up by default by iTunes to your C drive and may take up GBs upon GBs alone.\n", "Q: How to fix a Macbook Pro (late 2013 model) with liquid damage? I bought a refurbished 13\" Macbook Pro (late 2013 model retina) from the Apple store website in Sept 2014. It worked great till last month, when I had some water leak out in backpack and get through the ports in the Macbook. \nI believe it has affected the logic board which connects the power port to the battery. When the system is plugged into the power adaptor, it works normal. But, as soon as the power adaptor is unplugged, the laptop shuts down as battery charge can't get going. The diagnostics are showing that the battery should be replaced. \nI took the laptop to the Genius Bar and was told that there is a flat fee for liquid damage repair - $795. I bought this refurbished laptop for $1300 and paying $795 seems quite expensive. I can continue to use it with the power plugged in, but it reduces its usability considerably. Also, once in a while the power cable gets disconnected shutting down the system unexpectedly. \nI called my renters insurance as well, but they did not cover the claim. I may have to just bite the bullet and get it repaired, but I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on if there are any other options that I have to fix this? \n\nA: I would say that you would need to go ahead and use the Genius Bar option to repair your computer.\nMy reasoning is that water damage can cause errors in strange ways that, upon first glance, seem to be straight forward, but are in fact impossible to properly diagnose without professional diagnostic equipment. For example, in your case, I doubt that the problem actually lies in the battery. Rather, the water damage may have caused a part somewhere along the battery-charge monitoring path to fail rather than the entire battery, but that is simply conjecture.\nFor that $800, a trained technician will take apart the entire Mac and inspect each piece for corrosion and/or liquid damage. Each will be repaired and replaced and then the computer re-assembled and tested and a warranty will be issued for the work. Typically 90 days or the remainder of the existing warranty if any. Local regulations might extend these as well. The only reason this doesn't cost much more than the new Mac is that the parts are not all scrapped and some have repair / reuse value to Apple and they can pass the savings on to you.\nDefinitely not what you wanted to hear, but I hope this helps.\nCaveat: if you can pinpoint that the battery - and only the battery - is the issue without a shadow of doubt, replace it yourself; it will be much, much cheaper.\n\nA: Considering you're likely out of warranty anyway, depending on where you live, you could use a third-party repair shop.  I've had mixed results with repair shops, but I have found one where I live which I would now trust to repair my MBP.\nIn my case, this is a place that only deals in refurbished equipment.  Unlike another 3rd party Mac shop whose main business is to sell new gear, which is fine, and has a totally incompetent repair department which is less fine.\nPoint is, a place that is competent (once you find one, look it up on Yelp or the like) to refurbish equipment should be pretty good at replacing what should be a fairly limited subset of your Mac's guts from your description.  $795 seems very high in this case.\n\nA: You're lucky to have gotten off so lightly. Apple will quote high prices for water damaged items as they can't predict the severity of the damage. Replace the battery and your MacBook should be fine. I did a battery replacement a couple of years back for a friend who'd spilled whiskey over his trackpad. The whiskey had penetrated the battery causing the same issue as yours. After a minor clean up and a battery swap all was fine again. \n\nA: If you have any warranty from Apple on the MB you should know that once your computer is \"marked\" with water damage the warranty voids. They even have a white thingy inside all the MB's that gets yellow when it touches any liquid - if they open the laptop and it's yellow - there goes your warranty.\nI would say the best way is to get a new battery and install it yourself/in a non-Apple lab, and while you get you MB open - try to gently clean that small thingy to get to be white again...\nIf you don't have a warranty - I would still go for the non-Apple lab just for the lower price...\n\nA: I recently fixed a water damaged (actually it was baby saliva) smartphone that had stopped charging when plugged in.  Just like you, I was quoted a significant fraction of the original purchase price to even look at it, so figured there had to be a better way.  So a squirt of contact lubricant (WD40 in my case) went in the USB port.  That was a few months ago and it's still working fine.\nIn the case of a MacBook I'd probably invest in some purpose-made contact lubricant, rather than use WD40.  It shouldn't make things any worse, and it might fix the problem.\nBTW, I live in New Zealand where people can fix most things with number 8 wire.\n", "Q: Fonts on my iMac randomly become blurry (badly anti-aliased) until restart I have a late-2009 iMac with Yosemite 10.10.2.\nRecently, I've noticed that some system fonts randomly become blurry, as though there's a problem with the anti-aliasing.

Also, look for a local cocoa heads or developer group. Someone might be willing to swap testing with you. Also, stack overflow iOS developer group might be a good place to ask for an assist.\n\nA: Try asking in Stackexchange sites for programmers and application development.

The weird thing is that if my mouse isn't plugged in (Razer Naga) when I turn on my Macbook Pro the issue doesn't occur and if I restart my Macbook Pro, even with the mouse plugged in, then everything works as expected. Anytime the Mac is restarted in the keyboard works as expected on the login screen but when powering the Mac on it doesn't.\nI have done an SMC reset to no avail. I never had this problem in any previous versions of OS X.\nUPDATE:\nI started plugging my Razer mouse into a monitor stand with a built-in USB hub and now the problem almost never happens... it still does occur, but probably only 10-20% of the time as opposed to 100% when the mouse was plugged in directly to the Macbook on startup.\n\nA: The fact that the keyboard works at the boot screen before user level code runs is curious.\nI wonder if one of the kernel extensions or control panels that customize that keyboard are causing issues. As I don't have that hardware, it's hard to poke and see what files might be causing the issue.\nYou can try several things to corner this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a new user account and turn off auto log in in the Users preference pane\n\n*You could hold shift down when booting to rebuild all kernel extensions and then log in safely without most third party apps running\n\n*You could uninstall any drivers and/or open a support ticket with the vendor\n\n\nIn each of the above cases, you can test logging in to the new account / safe boot system and see which are broken and which are working.

What features of Yosemite require an Apple ID?  Will the system still be usable if I decline to accept the terms?\n\nA: You can complete the setup of any Mac with Yosemite installed on it without needing an Apple ID.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't use the Mac App Store for anything but core OS updates (printers, safari, etc...)\n\n*You can't use the iOS App store for music or books or podcasts, but streaming internet radio does work without an Apple ID.\n\n*You can't update the iLife apps that come with a new Mac\n\n*You can't use iCloud or FaceTime or Messages or continuity (aka handoff and instant hotspot)\n\n\nOther than that, the computer doesn't really care that you haven't chosen to enter a valid Apple ID and password (or any Apple ID at all). I'm not sure how you'll download the Yosemite installer without using an Apple ID, but perhaps that is something you don't mind doing once before installing the upgrade.\nAs part of the installation you do have to agree to the licensing terms or the installer will not run. If you decide to hack that, it's not clear if there are any ramifications, but that item would be off-topic so if you decline the terms, the upgrade won't run out of the box. You don't need an Apple ID to accept or decline the EULA dialog so those really are separate issues IMO.\n", "Q: Join-merge-consolidate many audio book CDs into one or a few albums in iTunes 12 / PC? You have an audio book consisting of multiple CDs. In addition to joining the tracks on each CD, you want to merge the CDs. If it's a small book of only a few CDs, then you might want to merge all CDs into one CD. If it's a big book, then you might want to merge (for example) the first 10 CDs into \"Part 1\"; the next 10 CDs into \"Part 2\"; and so on.\nHow do you do it in iTunes 12 on a PC?\n\nA: High-Level Steps to Merge Multiple Audio Book CDs\n\n\n*\n\n*Read the \"Meta Data Tips\" below (it could save you some time).  \n\n*Load CD 1.  \n\n*Sort the tracks into the right order.

[ Click CD Info ]   \n\n*Import the CD [ Import CD > AAC Encoder + Spoken Podcast + Use Error Correction ].   \n\n*Wait for import to finish. \n\n*Go to View Music and find the imported CD (to assure yourself it is there).  \n\n*Repeat Steps 1-7 until all CDs have been imported.  \n\n*Change each CD from \"Music\" to \"Audiobook\" and set the playback and shuffle properties.\n[ Right-click > Get Info > Options > media kind = Audiobook ] \n\n*\n\n*[ Check-in Remember playback position and Skip when shuffling ] + [Click OK].\n\n\n\nNotes:\n(a) The CD will disappear from your Music library and reappear in your Audiobooks.\n(b) Don't be alarmed if iTunes moves all or a subset of your books at once instead of one-at-a-time. Sometimes it happens; sometimes not. I haven't figured out why. I am, however, grateful when multiples are (correctly) moved all at once. \n\n\n*Find the CDs in your Audio Books. [ View > Audiobooks ]  \n\n*For each CD that you want to include in a particular merge, retitle (rename) that CD so that it has exactly the same title as all other CDs in that merge. \n[Right-click > Get Info > change the Title ]. \nExample: My book has 5 CDs (Superbook Disc 1, Superbook Disc 2, etc. I want them all in one merge.

You should see an expanded list of the CDs contained in that merge.\n\n\nMeta Data Tips\n\n\n*\n\n*You can get to meta data fields by clicking on the \"CD Info\" icon or by right-clicking and selecting \"Get Info.\" And there may be other ways. Do it one way and you might see a subset of the fields available to you via the other way.\n\n*When asked \"Are you sure want to edit multiple items?\" then, yes, of course you do!\n\n*Be sure the Disc N of N data is correct.\n\n*While working with your first CD, take notes (or a screenshot) of your Author, Composer, etc. meta data so that you can repeat it exactly for each subsequent CD.\n\n*Keep your meta data simple. Be sure to fill in the fields that will help you when searching and sorting in iTunes. And to fill in those fields exactly alike.\n\n\nYou need to be careful about your meta data entries because iTunes is very picky about matching and sorting. Any differences (spelling, spacing, capitalization, punctuation) will likely cause you difficulty in subsequent steps.\nFor example, mis-matched meta data could cause your imported (and as yet non-merged) CDs to be scattered instead of appearing next to / near each other in different viewing modes.\nCredits\nI pulled the above together over several years (from iTunes 8 until now with iTunes 12).

How do you delete all inbox mail messages in iPad iOS 8.1.3? It doesn't support prior move tricks many have posted as a method since it is unresponsive to the Trash target mailbox if you use the 'move all' trick.\n\nA: Since you can't perform this trick... if you're that desperate, you can update to iOS 9 Public Beta and this feature will become present.\nAlternatively, you can jailbreak your iPad and get a tweak named All Mail Actions from the BigBoss repository in Cydia.\nIf you're not willing to do any of these, you're going to have to delete each and every email individually. There's no other way.\n\nA: I don't think it is possible to move all of you email messages in your inbox to your mail trash at once with the built in iOS mail app.\nIs that what you want to do or do you want to remove all email accounts from your iPad?\n", "Q: Mac mini (Late 2009) + Yosemite: cannot read CDs/DVDs Hardware: Mac mini (Late 2009)\nOS: Yosemite 10.10.2\nProblem: cannot read CDs/DVDs, either by internal drive or external drive.\n...\nWhen you insert any type of CD or DVD, ISO, UDF, HFS, original media or not, the Mac mini tries to read for a few seconds, between 15 and 30, and then ejects the media. Only the blank media remain on the drive, so the Finder when Disk Utility can identify them, but when you try to write something, the disc is ejected.\nI've tried several tips found on blogs, but nothing can make the Mac mini read the disks.\nI've tried also my external drive, an external USB case with DVD-RW from LG, IDE bus, which works perfectly on my PC with Windows 8.1 and Linux OpenSUSE 13.2, and also works perfectly on my old war buddy, a PowerBook G4.\nMy Mac mini simply refuses to read discs, either by internal as well as external drive by! Yosemite's fault?\nDoes anyone have a solution or something that could help me find a way to understand and solve this problem?\n\n\nA: Mine did the same, however after purchasing an LG external drive Mac/PC from Best Buy, I am now successful in reading disks. I use the cable that came with it on the back of my Mac Mini USB port. This is the cheaper one, and has flimsy  CD tray, but works.\n\nA: Everyone's solution seems to \"clean the stupid dvd tray\" or \"buy another external stupid drive\".  The realitiy is that it is a problem with the OS updates.  How would you explain that the drive works fine in bootcamp on the Windows side and it doesn't on the Mac side ?  Pretty annoying and Apple support is null.  \n", "Q: Microsoft Office 2011 no longer working with Yosemite 10.10.2? When trying to open either Word or Excel, I get an error saying\n\nMicrosoft Word (or Excel) cannot be opened because of a problem. Check with the developer to make sure Microsoft Word works with this version of OS X. You may need to reinstall the application. Be sure to install any available updates for the application and OS X.\n\nI believe the two applications update in the background occasionally, but they were working fine until mid-last week.\n\nA: I've tried myself and can confirm that Office 2011 works for OS X 10.10.2. I would recommend that you uninstall Office and then install it from your installation disc or redownloading it from Microsoft if you bought it as an online download.\n\nA: I'm not sure what your exact problem is but I would try reinstalling just to omit that possibility from the list.\nMy copy of Microsoft regularly updates itself too and so far they're working perfectly. Although there WAS this one time back when I upgraded to Mavericks that a reinstall was necessary but it doesn't seem to be the case for me now.\nJust for the sake of clarification, Have you tried contacting microsoft about the issue? Also which version did you purchase? Office for Mac Home & Student or Office for Mac Home & Business?\n\nA: Office 2011 is working fine for me too in MAC OS X 10.10.2. \nAs Dempa said, reinstall Office 2011 and make sure that you install all the updates as with the release of Yosemite Microsoft made 2 updates in a row of the software.\n\nA: I had the same problem with the brand new Outlook 2011.\nSomething within the update to 10.10.2 broke the SQLite library functions, so an older database cannot be read properly.\nYou may need to recreate the primary office identity using the app \"Microsoft Database Utility\". \n(Note: I run the german version, so you need to adapt the names.)\nClose all applications and make a backup of your current ID:\nHome ▸ Documents ▸ Microsoft (User Data) ▸ Office 2011 Identities\n\nand copy your identies there by duplicating them.\nGo to and open\n Applications ▸ Microsoft Office 2011 ▸ Office ▸ Microsoft Database Utility\n\nSelect ID to rebuild and hit the \"Rebuild\" button. That takes a while...\nLogout and login again and fire up Outlook and afterwards Expel, Prowlerpoint and/or WOT. :-)\n\nA: Reinstalling MS Office 2011 for Mac will not solve your problem if you are using an Office 365 subscription. I spoke with Microsoft tech support yesterday and according to her, \"the 2011 software is not compatible with such a new system and have been causing issues with customer's Office software.\" Office 2011 for Mac is not compatible with Yosemite and Microsoft's answer is to wait for the 2016 version, which \"they are working on releasing by the end of the year.\"\nThis is odd as I have 2 other Macs in my household that are running Office on Yosemite. It seems to be an issue with the sign in / registration process. I am not sure if having a license key would bypass this issue...\n", "Q: Using lining numerals/text figures Given a font that is advertised as having multiple styles of numerals (text figures and lining numerals), presumably via OpenType, is there a way to use the alternative numeral styles in Mac OS X in general, or maybe within an app like Pages specifically?\n\nA: Typographic features like this can normally only be used in a word processing app.  You go to Format > Font > Show Fonts and click on the gear wheel and then select the Typography pane.  There should be boxes to check for different styles of numerals, which will be applied to selected text in the app, as long as the app supports it.

In order to do this, I read I need to be able to go into recovery mode as I boot my system up. To do this, I am supposed to press ⌘ Command R at startup. This is not working.\nFirst, I realized that there isn't any startup chimes when I restart my MBP. I followed this thread \nto reset the NVRAM, and it seemed to work as I did get two chimes during this process. Now when I restart, I hear the chime. However, after pressing ⌘ Command R as I load my system, I still cannot get into recovery mode. Instead, as before, I am going directly to my logon screen. \nWhat can be wrong?\n\nA: Your MacBook is too old to use Internet Recovery. You will need to reinstall from the restore discs that shipped with your Mac, a retail copy of a 10.6 DVD or a Mavericks USB installer (created on another Mac).\nIf you still have access to the drive that was replaced you could put it in a USB enclosure and boot from that, then go through the Mavericks install routine, selecting your new SSD as the destination.\nTo build a USB installer from the Mavericks/Yosemite installer application you can use 3rd-party utilities or follow this procedure...\nDownload the Mavericks/Yosemite installer but quit it when it tries to run.\nTake an 8GB USB stick and name it Untitled.\nThen run this command in Terminal (replace both instances of Mavericks to Yosemite if using 10.10 install application)...\n/Applications/\"Install OS X Mavericks.app\"/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/\"Install OS X Mavericks.app\" --nointeraction\n\n\nA: Summarizing some info I got from ifixit while I was trying to solve the same problem for my early 2008 15\" Core 2 Duo Macbook Pro (MacbookPro4,1):\n\n\n*\n\n*Check hard drive cable connection, possibly replace it (can be purchased from ebay, amazon, ifixit store)\n\n*Sometimes the SATA connection is not secure. Place a thin layer of masking tape on the SATA connector (opposite side of the pins) to get a more secure connection to the cable\n\n*Drive could be bad/damaged, try replacing it with a known good drive (remember to format it as Mac OS Journaled first)\n\n*SMC reset, NVRAM reset\n\n\nUltimately, I was able to get my drive to be detected in recovery mode by plugging it into an external USB SATA dock. This suggests I had some problem with the physical connection to the drive or logic board.\nYou also might try booting while holding Option instead of ⌘ Command+R. According to Apple's documentation this will bring you into the Startup Manager which should allow you to view the available disks.\n", "Q: Activate the frontmost Safari and run Javascript I'm trying to run Javascript on the Safari, whose frontmost is true. \ntell (application \"Safari\" whose frontmost is true) to do JavaScript theScript in current tab of first window\n\nBut I get an error like this:\nexecution error: Can’t get application \"System Events\" whose frontmost of it = true.

Then you can use Dysoft's Download Manager, it has a buit-in ftp/http server you can locally connect to.\nIt also supports transferring files through iTunes, using the Apps tab (Device > Apps > Bottom of the page: \"file transfer\").\nThere are probably a lot of other apps that can do this, but I use this one and never had any trouble.\n\nA: You could transfer it through iTunes, add it to the iBooks tab..sync..\nThen you can open it through the iBooks app on your iPhone\n", "Q: Port forwarding Yosemite I have a server running on my iMac (port 8000) and I want my iPad to be able to visit it through the local network so I set this rule using pf anchors (hence ipfw is gone).\nIt doesn't work, what am I missing?\nfile: /etc/pf.anchors/com.test\nrdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to 192.168.2.2 port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8000\nrdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to 127.0.0.1 port 8000 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8000\n\nenable the command:\npfctl -ef /etc/pf.anchors/com.test\n\nVisiting my iMac's IP-address from the iPad 192.168.1.1 gives me an unreachable message (Safari)\nFrom my iMac all seems OK:\n# nc -v 192.168.2.2 80\nfound 0 associations\nfound 1 connections:\n     1: flags=82<CONNECTED,PREFERRED>\n    outif lo0\n    src 127.0.0.1 port 52342\n    dst 127.0.0.1 port 5001\n    rank info not available\n    TCP aux info available\n\nConnection to 192.168.2.2 port 80 [tcp/http] succeeded!\n\n# curl -I 192.168.2.2\nHTTP/1.0 302 FOUND\nDate: Wed, 25 Feb 2015 10:39:47 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.7.6\nVary: Cookie\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nLocation: http://192.168.2.2/\n\n\nA: Try using this command:\necho \"rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8000\" | sudo pfctl -ef -\n\nThat command should forward your port 80 to port 8000.

As I sort through thousands of MP3 files in iTunes, I notice that I have many files that are DRM and \"Purchased By\" another Apple ID (that I have no access to).  How would you locate those MP3 files, searching for the name in the Purchased By field?\n\nA: In Itunes, create a Smart Playlist and name it purchases.  (File Menu, New Playlist... Smart Playlist)\nIn the search parameters of the smart playlist, Choose 'Purchased' and 'IS True'. That's the closes you'll get to sorting out your purchased items, but it doesn't allow you to sort by apple ID. \n\nSince iTunes doesn't allow you to search the 'Purchased by' field in filters, you can accomplish this using Tracksift, by dougscripts.com.\nI tried, and using applescript doesn't easily lend itself to reveal the 'purchased by' property, from what I can find.  \nhttp://dougscripts.com/apps/tracksift2app.php\nThis app allows you to Sort tracks into playlists by Apple ID. \n", "Q: Connect 27\" display to Apple Thunderbolt Display I was about to buy a Thunderbolt Display thinking that I'll be able to connect my existing Dell 2713hm to it, so that when I connect the Thunderbolt to my rMBP, everything would just work.\nBut as I recently discovered, based on this document, where it says:\n\nThis Thunderbolt port is not compatible with DVI,\n  VGA, or DisplayPort displays or adapters.\n\nprobably means that it's not gonna be possible.\nDo you know whether there still is a way to get a multi display setup working, by means of a single thunderbolt connection? (not trashing my Dell 2713)\n\nA: What you need is a Displayport/DVI/VGA port and a displayport/thunderbolt port and since it seems you don't have a Mac with a second Thunderbolt port you will need to get something that will give you two Thunderbolt ports.\nOnce the question is framed that way (?) then it seems to me that the choice is one of the Thunderbolt \"docks\" that are often sold as a way of connecting a MacBook to numerous ports all at once via Thunderbolt.\nThere are numerous examples of such devices out there but you may end up with a lot of ports you don't need (USB, Ethernet, Audio, SATA, etc.) depending on which one you decide on.\nI am not aware of any devices that are the Thunderbolt equivalent of a USB hub but perhaps other folks might know of something.\n", "Q: How to open different emacs version from the shell? I have two versions of emacs on my machine. One came preinstalled and I have just installed a newer version with homebrew. \n\nIf I type emacs in the terminal, the old version runs. If I type emacs-24.4 then the new version runs. What do I have to do to ensure typing just emacs runs the 24.4 version and not the older version?\n\nA: To do this for just Emacs, use\nalias emacs=/usr/local/bin/emacs\n\nin your shell startup file which will make Emacs always run Homebrew emacs instead of whatever is first in your $PATH.\nBut the better way to do this is to make your shell always look for Homebrew versions of commands first, by putting /usr/local/bin first, or at least early, in your $PATH.\nSo if your $PATH is set like this:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/local/bin\"\n\nchange it to this:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\n/usr/local/bin is a directory containing symlinks to all Homebrew-installed commands, Emacs included, and your shell starts at the beginning of the $PATH to figure out what executable to use, so putting it first will in effect choose the Homebrew emacs first.\nOne last thing - please remove /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.4/bin from your $PATH. It's going to break when the next version of Emacs comes out.

I need to make a cheatsheet/crib sheet for the participants ala http://www.cheatography.com/ in Pages, but I am struggling with getting the boxes to work.\nWhat I need to make is something like a bordered Text Box, with the first line being a title section that has a background color, followed by some text in the body of the Text Box that is simply white background.  Basically it should look like a little \"window\", with a colored title at the top and contents under it.\nI can get the Text Box inserted, and I have a 1px border setup no problem, but I can't figure out how to get the title section to work.  In fact, I can't even find where to set the background color of the text.  I don't use Pages very often so I am struggling a lot to figure out where things are.\nOnce I get the Text Box working, I then need to be able to quickly replicate the Text Boxes for the various sections of the cheatsheet.  I am hoping I can simply copy/paste more of them into the document and resize them as needed.\nFor the curious:  The reason I am trying to do this in Pages is because my sons' school is an Apple Distinguished School.  All the computers at the school are Macs, and all the students have iPads.  Doing it in Pages allows them to park the digital copy somewhere the students can get to it to view/edit/print as necessary.  I don't want to use http://www.cheatography.com/ because some of the details I need to include in the cheatsheet would not be appropriate to share outside of the school.  My fallback will be to simply do this using HTML, but I'd rather this be in Pages.\n\nA: I would use Numbers.app and it's tables.\nYou get better control over tables in Numbers. With simple things like resizing and not having to change setting to make the table stick in place like tables in Pages.\nFor this example I simply pasted the info from the site you provided straight into a blank sheet because they use tables. Which means the data will past as a Numbers table.\nI then added a row for the title header.\nI could easily make the table from scratch and also coping a whole table is as easy as selecting the table, copy, paste.\n\n", "Q: Removing camera button on iPhone lock screen How to remove the camera button on the iPhone lock screen without removing the camera from the springboard\nI don't want to allow people without access to take pictures using my phone (pictures are shared automatically by iCloud)\nBut in the same time, I want to be able to use the camera from the springboard.\nI'm searching for a native solution under iOS 8.x or later\n\nA: The only way this can be done is by using Settings > General > Restrictions to disable the use of the camera completely. A side effect is that FaceTime is also disabled.\nThere is no other mechanism built-in to do what you want.\n\nA: There is no native solution for what you want. But to answer your problem of automatically sharing pictures to icloud, you can disable the feature of sharing automatically. \nSettings -> icloud -> photos -> turn off photo sharing\n\nThis may not be a complete solution, but can reduce the risk of sharing everything. Hope it helps. \n\nA: You can just disable access to any functions from the lock screen by going to \"Settings\" > \"Control Center\" and then turn off access from lock screen.\n\nA: There is no native solution for what you want. But to answer your problem of automatically sharing pictures to icloud, you can disable the feature of sharing automatically. \n\nA: Sorry, but the answer is no. There is no native solution to this. You can always turn off the camera settings though\n", "Q: How to deter full screen mode moving window to a new display? If I use that green button to maximize a window\n\nit will enter full screen mode and move my window to a new \"virtual\" display to the right (those which you can switch by swiping with three fingers on the touchpad). If I click the green button again, it will leave fullscreen mode and move back to the initial display.\nI'm wondering if there's a way to make the fullscreen application stay on the same display it used to be before maximizing (or even better to disable multiple displays per monitor at all).\nThe reason I would like to do that is that if I e.g. watch a video with the VLC media player I usually do so in fullscreen mode. Then I close the program with CMD+Q and it switches back to the first screen. After opening another video it will start playing the audio only but the video is being displayed on a different screen which is rather confusing, because I have three physical monitors attached and each of it got multiple virtual displays.\n\nA: If you hold the 'option/alt' key the green button functionality will be changed to fullscreen.\n", "Q: Yosemite black screen with cursor after log in Running the Macbook6,1 with Yosemite installed.

All of a sudden, about two weeks ago, I've stopped getting replies from people.\nTurns out that my emails—including responses to an already-ongoing thread—are ending up in people’s SPAM and Junk folders. \nWhy is this happening and how can I stop it? It's a huge problem.\n\nA: There's nothing you can do, except use a different email address.\nWhat happened, most likely, is that some nitwit spammed from his/her me.com address (or spoofed it), and one of the commonly used spam blacklists added the entire domain. The other people will need to catch this and add your email to their personal whitelist, the details of which will depend entirely on their email provider and/or email software (depending on which one's actually doing the filtering).\n", "Q: How to add hidden user How do I add a hidden administrator user to my Mac if possible?\nI don't want it to show up on the login screen.\n\nA: Try this hint from Apple Support. There are distinct differences between Yosemite and all earlier OS X versions.\nI'll copy/paste the Yosemite commands here so as not to offend the 'no solitary links in answers' demigods.\nQuoth Apple Support:\nHide a user account in OS X Yosemite\nYou can prevent a user account from appearing in the login window in OS X Yosemite by using these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in as an admin user.\n\n*Use this Terminal command, substituting the short account name name of the user you wish to hide for “hiddenuser”:\nsudo dscl . create /Users/hiddenuser IsHidden 1\n\nIf you later want to show the hidden user, set the user’s IsHidden attribute to 0 like this:\nsudo dscl . create /Users/hiddenuser IsHidden 0\n\nAdditional Options\nYou can also move the hidden user's home directory to a place not visible from the Finder, and remove the hidden user's Public Folder share point.\nThe following command moves the home directory of \"hiddenuser\" to /var, a hidden directory:\nsudo mv /Users/hiddenuser /var/hiddenuser\n\nThe following command updates the user record of \"hiddenuser\" with the new home directory path in /var:\nsudo dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser NFSHomeDirectory /var/hiddenuser\n\nThe following command removes the Public Folder share point for the user with the long name \"Hidden User”:\nsudo dscl . -delete \"/SharePoints/Hidden User's Public Folder\"\n\nLogging in to this hidden account\nTo access this hidden admin account from the login screen, press the down arrow to select any user (make sure the password entry box is not open), then press Opt-Return.\nThis will bring up the blank name and password fields, allowing you to sign into to the hidden admin account.\nDisplay all users (including hidden)\nRemember that a hidden user can still be found, do not use this as a security measure. To show a list of all possible users, use dscacheutil\ndscacheutil -q user\n\nor to display all users in the 'Users' group (5**)\ndscacheutil -q user | grep -A 3 -B 2 -e uid:\\ 5'[0-9][0-9]'\n\n", "Q: Determine and Use Resolution as a Variable in UNIX script on Mac I'm deploying a NetRestore image to multiple kinds of Macs: MacBooks, MacBook Pros, Mac Pros, iMacs and Mac Minis. I have several custom designed login screens that I'd like to use but everything before 10.10 requires that you know the monitor resolution otherwise the login background won't show correctly.\nIs there a way to use the output of this code as a variable for a series of IF/THEN statements?\nsystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType |grep Resolution\n\nThe normal output shows like this\n  Resolution: 2560 x 1440\n  Resolution: 1920 x 1200\n  Resolution: 1920 x 1200\n\n(This is if you have three monitors...I'd prefer to use the first result). \nMy intention is for the script to run when binding the Mac to Active Directory (which has to be done manually), so the resolution should already be available. It would select the correct resolution image and then copy it into the required location. \nOr by chance does anyone have any good idea on how to create custom login window backgrounds and user backgrounds to work on any type of Mac with any resolution? (Just like the OS does when you select \"Fit to Screen\" in System Preferences)\nThanks!\n\nA: If you are looking for something to put into a shell script, you can run something like\nif [[ $(system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType |\n             grep Resolution |\n             head -1 |\n             tr -d ' ') == 'Resolution:2560x1440' ]]; then\n    # do whatever is needed to do for 2560x1440\nend if\n\nYou could also use a case statement to handle several resolutions\ncase  $(system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType |\n            grep Resolution |\n            head -1 |\n            tr -d ' ') in\n    Resolution:2560x1440)\n        # handle 2560x1440\n        ...\n        ;;\n    Resolution:1920x1200)\n        # handle 1920x1200\n        ...\n        ;;\nesac\n\n", "Q: What takes so much space in my external disk? My external disk (LaCie) is full! When I look at the individual folders within my disk, I see that only little space is occupied by visible documents. So I displayed the hidden files and found small files and directories that all seem to take very little memory. Looks like about 400GB is occupied by some unknown stuff. However there is a directory called .trashes.\n\nWhen I click on GetInfo, here is what I see\n\nAnd I can wait for a long time but never get an estimate of the size of this directory. I tried to estimate its size via the Terminal:\n$ du .Trashes\ndu: .Trashes: Permission denied\n\nI tried to delete .Trashes but I get this window popping up\n\nHow can I free space on my external disk?\nI am on OSX Yosemite, Version 10.10.2.\n\nA: The default permission on .Trashes do not allow for reading.  Use sudo du -ch .Trashes as this will give you both the total and in \"Human-readable\" output vs. used sectors which you'd then have to convert.\nAlso you should not delete .Trashes, just empty your Trash.\nIf you want to take a graphical look at the contents of the disk use Disk Inventory X, you might find it interesting and can do some cleanup from within the App too.\n", "Q: What is the use of Background App Refresh? I never realised any advantage of having that feature turned on, nor turned off.\nHow can educate myself about what it does so that I can choose whether to turn it on or off either for the entire system or for specific applications?\n\nA: Some apps like Facebook keep getting new feed posts in the background when you are not using the app. This gives the impression when you launch the app that it is really fast and everything is already there and your main UI isn't filled with blank spots for image placeholders and things of that sort. \nThe biggest impact I've seen on it is that is uses a TON of cellular data when my wife checks her Facebook on lunch break, then it keeps refreshing for the next 4 hours until she gets home to wifi. \nI try to turn off background app refresh for most apps. A good hypothetical use for it would be some app that tracks tour mileage and plots it on a map. You may be on a long trip and you don't need to be looking at a phone while driving, so this would be a good use for background app refresh so the app can continue to measure your distance even when you have your phone locked or are on the phone itself.\n\nA: Background refresh and location services are two different things. Most navigation apps like Waze do not use background refresh to provide routing or directions. They use Core Location, which uses a combination of GPS and Wi-Fi to get your exact location, even in the background.\nWaze does use Background Refresh, but who knows exactly what for, or how much this would hinder its functionality. Background Refresh will launch your app in the background, and give it a bit of time to perform some action.  How often this occurs is totally opaque to the user or developer. It's up to the operating system.\n\nA: Background Refresh is a feature whose name describes exactly what it does.\nIt allows apps to automatically refresh their content in the background.\nThis means that whenever you open the app you'll always have new content.\nFor example: Waze is a navigating app that needs Background Refresh to constantly get your location and give you directions even if the app isn't open and is running in the background.\nTurning it off would hinder apps from doing things like this.\nI recommend you to go through the list and turn off ones that you don't think will need to refresh/get new content when the app is closed.\nIf you do this you might see an increase in battery life.\n", "Q: How can I prevent shift selection from expanding? On Yosemite in current Chrome (and random other places, but let's try to just solve it in Chrome), if i selection some text (say the \"sk differ\" in \"ask different\"), then hold shift and press right arrow, it will expand the selection to include the next character to the right (selection becomes \"sk differe\"). If i then press left arrow, i'd like the selection to (again) become \"sk differ\". Instead, in some apps (at least Chrome), it becomes \"ask differe\". So it seems that it will only expand the selection, so pressing either arrow key only grows the corresponding end of the selection. \nHow can i make it so that it selects from a caret position that is at either end of the selection (NOT both)?\n\nA: I have to agree with the comment that it is working as you state you want it to work, at least for me in Chrome 41.0.2272.64 beta on OS X 10.10.2.\nThat said - there are two ways of creating selections in OS X, from a programmer's point of view: anchored and unanchored. (There is also a third that seems to be employed by Apple applications, mentioned in the Betalogue article as a \"smart unanchored\" selection.) The way you describe it currently working for you would be an unanchored selection, whereas your desired behavior is an anchored selection. You can read more on the difference and programming implications on Daring Fireball (from 2006) and a slightly more recent 2009 article on Betalogue.\nMore specifically to your question, it is up to the developer of the program you are using to determine how it operates in that program. I don't have Chrome v40 to test it on but the commenter did and states it works as I am seeing it work in v41 beta. What version of Chrome are you using?\n\nI wrote the below before I realized what you were actually stating is occurring. Hopefully it is useful for somebody else, so I am leaving it here.\nThe difference is how you created the selection.\nIf you select text by dragging the cursor from left-to-right, Shift plus arrow keys will expand or shrink the selection on the right edge of the selection. Conversely, if you select by dragging right-to-left, the keyboard shortcut will affect the selection starting from the left edge.\nI've confirmed this to be the case in both an Apple-created app (Dictionary) and Chrome 41.0.2272.64 beta.\n", "Q: iMac display RGB values Why does the iMac display show non-zero values for blue and green pixels for a .png image whose blue and green color planes are zero?  I used the digital color meter to show the non-zero values for the blue and green pixels and I confirmed that the .png file has zero values in the blue and green color planes by using python scripts to inspect the array values.\n\nA: You might check the iMac's monitor calibration settings.\n\nSystem Preferences > Displays > Color > Calibrate...\n\nor choose one of the other Display profiles. Which Digital Colour Meter are you using?  It probably must be also calibrated in sync with the above setting...\n", "Q: Is there some way to make Mailbox for Mac access my Mac \"Contacts\" for recipients?

It's going to log far more data than you need, but it will show memory maps of why exactly the memory allocation has gotten to the place where it is.\nThen, if you set up two test accounts on each Mac with nothing in them - set both to be the auto-log-in user and reboot both.\nGrab a third and fourth sysdiagnose from the cleanly rebooted systems. You should find a stable, reproducable kernel memory allocation when freshly booted and no apps started. Not that both systems will have the same initial kernel allocations - just that they should be stable across reboots.\nInside the tar.gz files sysdiagnose generates, start with comparing the footprint-all.txt files and see which processes are causing the largest Kernel Memory allocations. The last few lines of that file are also helpful in seeing the balance between kernel allocations and user memory allocations/classes.\nYou could probably just use the footprint tool, but I'm lazy and let sysdiagnose get me all the logs and then pick/choose the parts I need for a specific task. I also use heap and vmmap often on daemons and user processes, but using it on kernel_task might not be as useful.\n\nA: Use zprint -t (Lion) or sudo zprint -t (Mountain Lion and later) (man zprint) to show information about kernel zones\nExample (i skipped about 160 lines):\nzprint -t\n                   elem      cur         max       cur       max       cur alloc alloc          \nzone name          size     size        size     #elts     #elts     inuse  size count        Total Allocs\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nzones               544      93K        102K       176       192       167    8K    15                  88K\nvm.objects          224   62134K      66430K    284043    303680    283180   16K    73   C         2702161K\nvm.object.hash.en$   40    9941K      13122K    254490    335923    238354    4K   102   C          130659K\nmaps                232      43K         40K       192       176       180    8K    35               27576K\n....\n....\nVM.map.entries       80    6100K       7776K     78080     99532     76888   20K   256   C         1141452K\nkernel_stacks     16384    2448K       3200K       153       200       139   16K     1   C           52144K\npage_tables        4096  138280K 4293389860K     34570    654217     34570    4K     1   C          595852K\nkalloc.large      72308   31705K      32310K       449       457       449   70K     1            13005729K\nTOTAL SIZE   = 920734440\nTOTAL USED   = 895302860\nTOTAL ALLOCS = 310758214530\n\n", "Q: Any downside to using multiple mail and calendar apps on iOS? I am wondering if there is a downside to using multiple mail and calendar apps on my iOS device?  Specifically the iOS devices come with apple provide apps for both, but I have found 3rd party apps that work better for me.  If I have both (Apple's app as well as the 3rd party app) configured, am I doubling the amount of data & memory I am using on the iOS device?\n\nA: Yes, you definitely will double the data sent, if one uses two apps for the same account.\nHowever, using different programs may be useful.  For example, if you want to separate your professional Exchange E-mail from your personal accounts.  This way, there is a logical separation, and you run less risk of accidentally sending out a personal mail on a business acount, and vice versa.  Some mail apps even have password or PIN protection (for example, Divide), which will keep your E-mail accounts safe, even if someone swipes your phone when you are using it.\n\nA: If you use two mail apps for the same account you will be downloading the same information from the mail server twice. Which will result in around double data traffic. Emails isn't usually so much data per email but that depends of course on what you receive and how many emails that is going to be downloaded.\nIf you want you can check how much data that your email app used under Usage in iOS settings. \n", "Q: How to select text on Google Search, when using Chrome for iOS7?

(I think it's documented somewhere that it can do conversions \"like\" calculator, but the standard calculator doesn't have a conversion for bytes, so this feature seems to be undocumented).\nBut the strange thing is that now the preview on the right pane of the spotlight window is fixed to the last conversion I did.

For Munki to function properly, /usr/local/munki and contents must have a user of root, group of wheel, and not allow writes to everyone.

When releasing to the App Store after using iTunes Connect Testflight beta testing, what's a good way to ensure that external testers get cleanly upgraded to the official App Store version? Specifically:\n\n*\n\n*Will external testers get a notification on the device that a new app version is\navailable?  Will this be a regular iOS notification, a notification\nfrom the Testflight app, or both?\n\n*On the home screen, will the beta app's icon show any indication that\nit's been superseded by a non-beta app?\n\n*If the user has automatic app updates enabled, will the app store app\ndownload and install automatically, replacing the beta app?  Or will\nthe user have to upgrade manually even if auto-upgrades are enabled?\n\n*If the user opens the Apple Testflight app, will they see any\nindication that the build they were testing has been superseded by a\nreleased build?\n\n*[worst case scenario] If auto-update isn't enabled or doesn't work for beta apps, then what happens when the user tries to open the app after our app store release? Will the app simply crash with no indication to the user what's happened or how to fix it?\n\nIf the answers to some of the above questions are \"maybe\" then what configuration or settings should we use to ensure that app updates work as expected? (where \"expected\" means that when we release the app to the app store, then all testers should be updated with that new version of the app).\nGoogling on this topic hasn't been very helpful, perhaps because Apple's TestFlight support is only a few months old so Google is dominated by non-technical news links instead of technical blogs and other places that may offer more details. I've been unable to find any programmer blogs which talk about the \"upgrade from external tester to app store version\" workflow.\nApple's documentation is clear about what happens from the perspective of the iTunes Connect web application (see excerpts below, coalesced for clarity) but not very clear about the external testers' user experience, which is what I'm trying to figure out.  Here's excerpts from Apple's Docs illustrating this:\n\nFinish Testing an App. To stop testing a prerelease version of an app that is actively being\ntested in TestFlight beta testing, set the Testing switch into the Off\n(white) position.\nSubmit to the App Store When you are done using TestFlight beta testing, you can submit the\napp for final review. Before you submit it, make sure you no longer\nwant to test it or any builds you uploaded earlier than it. When the\napp becomes Ready for Sale in the App Store, testing automatically\nstops on earlier builds, and you will be unable to view or test them.\nSee When builds become unavailable for more details. If you want to\nresume testing of an earlier build, you can upload it as a new build\nassociated with a new prerelease version.\nWhen builds become unavailable\nBefore your app becomes Ready for Sale, the Prerelease pane lists all builds for all prerelease versions\nyou have uploaded. After the app becomes Ready for Sale, some of the\nbuilds will be removed from the pane:\nThe build used in the app is removed from Prerelease, as are all other\nbuilds in the same prerelease version. All builds in earlier\nprerelease versions are also removed from Prerelease. On the\nPrerelease page, the sections for those prerelease versions will be\nremoved.\n\nBTW, I previously asked this question on Stack Overflow where it was deleted for lack of answers, and it looks like a better home for this may be Ask Different where iTunes Connect questions are apparently encouraged.\n\nA: The pragmatic way to ensure all testers are off the app is to wait the 30 days for the build to expire and have them manually grab the store version.\nYou could also upload a new beta build instructing them to do the same. That way they get an email from Apple with the news you want to convey to them and a limited duration to get them all off that build.\n\nA: As far as I can see there is no support for this requirement. I think it is up to you to let Beta testers know that there is a store version averrable. The betas all run out after a month anyway so it being only a temporarily available version is the point of the system. You have their email addresses.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get a list of all currently running program's window titles with AppleScript? I'm looking to write a script which outputs a list of all the window titles of all the currently running programs. Is there any way to do this with AppleScript? I tried running the following code:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with theProcess in (every process)\n        if background only of theProcess is false then\n            say (name of theProcess) as string\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nI put it in a file called lawl.scpt and then ran the following in the Terminal:\n$ osascirpt lawl.scpt\n\nHowever, it just pauses for a few seconds, then exits without outputting anything.\n\nA: \nI'm looking to write a script which outputs a list of all the window titles of all the currently running programs.\n\nThe easy, one-liner method of achieving this in AppleScript is:\n    tell application \"System Events\" to get the name of every window of ¬\n        (every process whose background only is false)\n\nAnnoyingly, this returns a nested lists, which you'll either have to loop through in a repeat with block, or flatten the nest into a simple list (which isn't too hard).\nRunning AppleScript from the command line has the advantage that the returned data are in text format, which can be manipulated quite easily.  You can even make use of the command line from within AppleScript to get the benefits of each:\n    do shell script \"osascript -e \\\" ¬\n        set text item delimiters to tab\n        tell app \\\\\\\"system events\\\\\\\" to get name of every window of ¬\n            (every process whose background only is false)\n        return the result as text \\\" | egrep -oi -e '[^\\t]+'\"\n\n    return paragraphs of result\n\nwhich returns a nice, straight forward, text list of window titles.\nFinally, here's a formal AppleScript to get the job done properly, in a way that allows you to retain the ability to reference the window object if you need to get other properties or manipuoate it:\n    use application \"System Events\"\n\n    property R : {WindowTitle:missing value, AttachedToProcess:missing value}\n\n    set WindowList to {}\n\n    set P to a reference to (every process whose background only is false)\n\n    repeat with proc in P\n        set [proc] to proc\n        set W to (a reference to every window of proc)\n\n        repeat with _w in W\n            set [_w] to _w\n\n            copy R to end of WindowList\n            tell last item of WindowList\n                set its WindowTitle to title of _w\n                set its AttachedToProcess to name of proc\n            end tell\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\n\n    return WindowList\n\nThe resulting list is a list of records that have the structure of property R.  Each record represents a single window, which contains the window's title and the name of the process it belongs to, e.g. {WindowTitle:\"Downloads\", AttachedToProcess:\"Finder\"}.  This way, it's easy to do things with the window, such as:\n    set TheWindow to item 2 of WindowList --> {WindowTitle:\"...\", AttachedToProcess:\"...\"}\n\n    tell process named (TheWindow's ProcName) to ¬\n        tell window named (TheWindow's WindowTitle) to ¬\n            set [focused, position, size] to [true, {0, 0}, {400, 777}]\n\n", "Q: Sharing a bank of contacts Is it possible to share multiple contacts in a similar fashion to the way that you would share a single contact from contacts.app?

Theres no menuoption for it, but you can rigthclick on the group and select Export vCard-group…\nOr you can select desired contacts to export, File -> Export… -> Export vCard-card…\nThis will give you one vCard-file containing one or more contacts.\nThen you can share the vCard file as you wish.\n", "Q: What does the blue point before app name in lauchpad mean? \nAs the arrows point, the little blue points before Evernote and MS OneNote.\n\nA: The recommendation system of stackexchange really helps, I got this when I asked the question.\nIt turns out the little blue point shows I haven't opened the app since the app's last update.\n", "Q: How to start SQL Developer with the correct Java Version?

I'm looking for an app suite of iOS and Mac apps for editing RTF files (originally created with TextEdit) and which allow sharing the files through iCloud.\nI considered getting the WriteToGo suite of apps. This seems to do pretty much what I want. But I noticed in iTunes that these apps were released in 2013 and haven't been updated since. I'm hesitant to pour money into what seems like old apps with little developer support. So I was wondering whether someone can recommend this(*), or recommend another app suite?\nThere's a related question on finding an “editor for both iOS and Mac OS X designed for writers” but, as far as I can tell, the options mentioned there don't use RTF as their native file format (being able to convert from/to RTF and the app suite's native file format is not what I'm looking for).\n(*) If anyone is using the WriteToGo suite, I was also wondering what the difference is between the two different Mac apps “WriteToGo knapsack” and “WriteToGo pro”?\n\nA: I'm the developer of an app called RTF Write which does exactly what you're looking for -- it also supports iCloud Drive and iCloud HandOff.  It's free for iOS, the OS X version is $2.99.\nhttp://machsoftwaredesign.com/rtfwrite.html\n", "Q: Bigger keyboard keys on iPhone 6 with iOS 8 I want a default keyboard with bigger keys. That's it. \nNo Swype, no SwiftKey, nothing fancy, no other customizations—I just want… bigger… keys. I have thick fingers and I dont want to use auto correct or prediction. \nI know it's possible, because one of the apps I use (CamScanner Pro) has a bigger keyboard (taller) which types significantly better. I am desperate to get that keyboard by default everywhere, or any other third party option or fix that will make my keyboard keys bigger. \nHow do I achieve this?\nMinuum and Thick Buttons rely on auto predict and dynamically enlarge keys… way too fancy for me: simple, default bigger keyboard, bigger keys. I am happy to sacrifice screen area for bigger keyboard.\n[edit - now many months later, I still experience this problem. Over time I have used several apps that offer a keyboard with bigger keys within the app. I don't know how these apps can offer such a keyboard while it is unavailable anywhere else...]\n\nA: Set your view to zoomed, and change your text size to whatever size you want.

I tested them in Keynote and they're working, however when I export to PDF they're simply not there anymore.\nNote that used Export to > PDF and not print as PDF and I also looked in the export settings and saw nothing related to links..\n\nA: I had the same problem. I put the link to a slide on items that were grouped together. If I ungrouped the items (I had text inside a circle) and just selected the text and added the link to that, then when I exported to PDF the links worked.\n\nA: I had a similar problem running on Keynote 6.6.2 with links to websites not working when exported to PDF. The above answer worked: you have to ungroup assets in Keynote for the links to work in PDF. \nI used keyboard shortcuts to do about 30 in 20 minutes time:\n• Click grouped/linked asset: press ⌘ K to open Hyperlink option \n•   Cut the link from the URL bar with ⌘ K • Press Enter to leave the\n    command \n• The group should still be selected; ungroup with\n    ⌘OptionShiftG keyboard shortcut \n• The ungrouped assets should be\n    individual now; with them still selected do the Hyperlink shortcut\n    again: ⌘ K\n• Press the down arrow to select webpage to link to, vs\n    the slide number (in my case, or select whichever you were linking\n    to) press enter to select. \n• Finally, press ⌘ V to paste in the\n    previous linked URL. \n• Re-export as PDF from the File>Export option.\n    Every link should work now :)\nTa da! You just flew through the whole thing with the power of keyboard shortcuts!\n\nA: Another useful way is to create a shape with 0% opacity and place on top of the objects that you want to link.\nI did this because I wanted to have a broader area, not just the text or circle.\n", "Q: Syntax error: No operation specified when trying to resize Ubuntu VM I'm trying to expand the hard drive of my Ubuntu VM in VirtualBox from my Macbook Air terminal.

I need to add a dash after between the two blocks of text like this \"ABC - 123456\".

Selecting the files, can be done by some external utilities, for example by the find command.\nThe main benefits of the find are:\n\n\n*\n\n*it can search files recursively in the sub directories too\n\n*is possible more precisely select the right files, e.g. exclude directories, select files by time or size and so on. (check from the terminal man find.)\n\n\nAd \"prepare the new name\". This can be done by external programs,\nlike sed or awk or any program what can manipulate text in shell\nscripts, or it can be done (in some simple cases such this) withing\nthe bash itself - and is possible to save one expensive command execution.\n(for hunderts of thousand files it makes a difference).\nThe following:\n${file/ /-}\n\nsubstitutes (replaces) one space (the / / part) with the dash (/-). So it is possible to write\nmv \"$file\" \"${file/ /-}\"\n\nand save the sed execution.\nSo one of the alternative solutions could be, for example the following:\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' filename\ndo\n    newfilename=\"${filename/ /-}\"\n    [[ \"$filename\" != \"$newfilename\" ]] && echo mv -i \"$filename\" \"$newfilename\"\ndone < <(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname \"* *.jpg\" -print0)\n\nThe abobe is for the DRY RUN - it only will show, what will be done, for the real execution remove the echo.\nDecomposition:\n\n\n*\n\n*selecting the right files for the rename: the find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname \"* *.jpg\" -print0 will find all\n\n\n*\n\n*what are only in the current directory (-maxdepth 1)\n\n*and they're plain files (-type f)\n\n*and their name matches (anything)(space)(anything).jpg case insensitively - e.g. the name must contains a space\n\n*supply the filenames as null terminated, so their name can safely contain newline character too. (-print0)\n\n\n*the cycle while IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' filename; do ... done < <( )\n\n\n*\n\n*reads the output from the above find command\n\n*where the filenames are null terminated (-d $'\\0')\n\n*ignore any escaped characters (-r) /advanced topic - not needed to explained here/\n\n*the IFS=  prevents trimming of leading and trailing whitespace from the filename (also, a bit advanced topic)\n\n\n*preparing the new filename newfilename=\"${filename/ /-}\"\n\n\n*\n\n*is done by bash internally (without executing an external command).\n\n*if want preserve the trailing space after the dash use ${filename/ /- }\n\n\n*the actual renaming is done by the mv command (see man mv from the terminal), where\n\n\n*\n\n*the -i what will ask the user if here are already a file with the new filename (don't override it)\n\n\n*and the mv is executed only when the newfilename is different from the filename [[ \"$filename\" != \"$newfilename\" ]]\nThe above solution is mostly error-prone, but it still isn't very effective,\nbecause for hundreds of thousand files will execute hundreds of\nthousand times the mv command.\nThe solution can be: using some\nutility, what can read the filenames and do the renaming without\nexecuting the mv command N-times.\nFor example, the \"big gun\" of system admins the \"perl\", as:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname \"*.jpg\" -print0 |\\\n    perl -0nle '$n=$_; $n=~s/ /-/; rename $_,$n unless($_ eq $n || -e $n)'\n\nwhat will rename all files what outputs the find in one execution - e.g. much faster as thousands of mv executions.\nTor testing (DRY RUN) use the following:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname \"*.jpg\" -print0 |\\\n    perl -0nle '$n=$_; $n=~s/ /-/; print qq{old:$_ new:$n\\n} unless($_ eq $n || -e $n)' #print instead of the rename\n\nPs: the perl is powerful enough to handle everything itself, eg. the find command too, but it is more advanced topic...\nPs2: my English is much worse as my bash, so someone could kindly edit this post for adding/correcting things.. ;)\n\nA: If your file names are \"ABC 123456\" with single space between the first 3 and the following, then you are trying to replace the space with a character (or dash or something), so to look like ABC-123456.\nI found this article that explains how to do that.\nExample:\nNote that the following command will only replace spaces with hyphens. If you need a different substitution you’ll have to modify the command accordingly\nfor i in *.JPG; do mv \"$i\" \"`echo $i | sed -e 's, ,-,g'`\"; done\n\nOthers:\nIf you wanted underscores or any other character instead of a hyphen, you’d simply switch the s, ,-,g part of the above command to s, ,_,g. \nFor how to see this article.\nHere is a Test on my MBA 10.9.5 (I used a ABC 123456.png file) and placed it in a new folder.

Recently I bought a MacBook Pro with 128 GB flash storage but without HDD. The use of the laptop will be only for work and for surfing in the internet. Any multimedia will be stored on a external disc but all the stuff from work I want to be stored in the flash storage. Except of Android Studio, I also use some other tools-frameworks like MAMP, Postgres, gimp etc. \nWill be a problem for the laptop and its flash drive if I will not use any external HDD and all the job will be stored in the flash storage?\n\nA: For all intents and purposes, you can use the flash SSD inside your MacBook exactly like you would use an internal HDD. The noticeable differences are that it is smaller capacity that a typical HDD, but also much, much faster and more power-efficient.\nThe only thing you should avoid are actions that intentionally stress the drive, like read/write speed tests. Running heavy-duty applications and servers should be no problem (provided you only need 128 GB of space).\n", "Q: How can you pause text to speech so that it restarts from where you left off? I have a 40 page Pages document which is a transcript from a hand written diary.  I wish to use Text to Speech to read passages from my Pages document so that I can check the text against the original version.  This works well except that when highlighting a portion of text in the document and I wish to stop (pause) the Text to Speech it only starts at the beginning of the highlighted text and not restarting from the point of being paused.\nIf I use the start/stop keyboard shortcut in Text to Speech system preferences the situation is worse.  No matter if you have a highlighted portion of text it will restart from the beginning of the document!!\nSo the question is How to pause the text to speech process rather than stopping it?\n\nA: This is a feature people wanted for a long time but it never came. An alternative is to use voice over but it doesn't really allow you to read out loud the highlighted text, it has to be the entire document. To activate it the default shortcut is command F5. You have to enable it in setting, just search for voice over.\nThere is one other way. You can save the entire document as txt file and open it with any browser of yours, tested on chrome or safari.

I was reading a post about using Bittorrent Sync on OS X that includes a launchd plist that's supposed to keep the app running in the event that it crashes. It doesn't seem to work, though, since I've had the app crash and not relaunch. I'm looking for help fixing the plist.\nThe plist looks like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Crashed</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>sync.com.tjluoma.bittorrentsync</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/open</string>\n        <string>-W</string>\n        <string>-a</string>\n        <string>BitTorrent Sync</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe \"clever\" bit is using /usr/bin/open to launch the app, with -W to make sure that open waits for the app to exit. But I think that's also why it doesn't actually work. If I'm reading this right, the app will only relaunch if /usr/bin/open crashes, not if Bittorrent Sync crashes. For the above approach to work, open would need to return error status if the app it opened had crashed (and this does not happen).\nI know I could fix this by dropping open and instead hard coding the path to the executable as /Applications/BitTorrent Sync.app/Contents/MacOS/BitTorrent Sync. But is there an alternative that doesn't require hard-coding the full path? Using open would be elegant, if it worked.\n\nA: It was as I expected. The version in the question doesn't re-launch the app, because /usr/bin/open doesn't return an error status when the app crashes. I wasn't able to find a better way than hard-coding the path to the executable, so I'm now using the following.\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>KeepAlive</key>\n        <dict>\n                <key>Crashed</key>\n                <true/>\n                <key>SuccessfulExit</key>\n                <false/>\n        </dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.getsync.bittorrentsync</string>\n        <key>Program</key>\n        <string>/Applications/BitTorrent Sync.app/Contents/MacOS/BitTorrent Sync</string>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI've verified that this does successfully re-launch the app if it crashes.\nA more easily downloadable version of this can be found at https://gist.github.com/atomicbird/ff2de46a594cdb5c8e69\n", "Q: Want Preview to default to Thumbnail view in Sidebar I want to have Preview default to Thumbnail view in the Sidebar.

I enjoy using the Sublime Text 3 editor—especially the multiple cursors feature. \nI constantly find myself in need of the multiple cursor functionality in other OS X apps like Finder or Outlook. Does anyone know if this is possible and how to go about doing this?\n\nA: Multiple cursors isn't a feature supported by Mac OS X by default. Some apps have it and if you want it in the rest of the system you will need too find an third part plugin.\nI think it would be hard to make that work even with a plugin. But if you haven't already I would recommend giving Google a try in finding one.\nHere is a link to an similar discussion on Super User: Link\n\nA: Even though it theoretically could be hacked into the OS, most third party apps wouldn't work.

I had approximately 40 GB of a 120 GB hard drive free and I set Bootcamp to create a 20 GB partition for Windows. Halfway through the process, the computer completely froze for hours and I had to restart. When I reinspected my Mac partition, the total capacity was only 100 GB and the 20 GB Bootcamp partition was nowhere to be seen. \nI've tried verifying using Disk Utility and it says I need to repair the drive after restarting into Disk Utility (via cmd + R on boot). When I do this however it says that everything is okay and there is no damage! \nI have absolutely no clue as to what I should do and I really need the space. Could anyone please help out?\n\nA: First, I would check the command-line diskutil list to see what the partitions look like.  The command-line also shows hidden partitions like your Recovery partition, so there are chances that other non-visible or damaged partitions are shown there as well.\nThen, depending on what you see, you can try to either expand the internal partition, merge two (or more) partitions or clone the current partition onto an external hard drive (if you have one available, or at least the disk space), then reformat the internal drive and put the clone back.  The latter two options have a high chance of you losing the local Recovery partition.  While 2011 and later models of computers do have the ability to directly boot from the Internet, some may want to keep a local version as well.  So, use it at your own risk.\nTo expand the volume, try the following command:\ndiskutil resizeVolume <disk_slice> 120G\n<disk_slice> is the disk you see on the same line of the name of the disk in the list output (e.g. disk0s2).\nAfter you ran this command, you need to visit System Preferences > Startup Disk to make this volume the boot drive again.\nTo merge partitions, you can use the following command (as stated before, this can result in losing your recovery partition, if it is in the range of to-be-merged partitions):\ndiskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ Macintosh\\ HD <1st_disk_slice> <last_disk_slice>\nIf you have spaces or other non-alphanumeric characters in the name of your partition, escape them using the backslash (\"\\\") character as shown above for Macintosh HD.\nFor any of those commands, you can get help by typing just the first part(s) in: diskutil (showing the valid \"verbs\"), diskutil resizeVolume (showing help on how to resize) and diskutil mergePartitions (showing help how to merge).\nFinally, if you have a Mac OS Extended-formatted external hard drive (not in use or at least with sufficient disk space) available, you can see about cloning the internal drive over, then re-partition the entire drive and clone it back.  This will, with almost 100% certainty, remove the Recovery partition.  So, again: Use at your own risk.\nHere is how:\n\n\n*\n\n*start Internet Recovery (Cmd+Alt+R at boot)\n\n*open Disk Utility\n\n*choose the volume (by default named Macintosh HD)\n\n*click on New Image at the top of the window and choose the external hard drive as a destination\n\n*once done, choose the disk above (not the volume), choose Format from the right-side tabs, provide a name (Apple-default is \"Macintosh HD\"), then format the drive\n\n*choose the volume again (it should now be again 120 GB in size) and choose Restore from the right-side tabs\n\n*click on Image and choose the image from the external hard drive\n\n*select the image on the left side navigation bar (it should be placed in there now) and choose menu \"Images\" > \"Scan Image for Restore\" (this can take some time)\n\n*once finished, drag the disk image into the \"Source\" box to the right and the \"Macintosh HD\" into the \"Destination\" box\n\n*Double-check that you have it this way and not the other way around\n\n*click on Restore and confirm it (I recommend reading that confirmation dialog as well, so that you are sure you do the right thing).\n\n*Restart the computer once done\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to boot from an encrypted external hard drive? If I have an external hard drive with a bootable cloned backup (via SuperDuper) - if I encrypt it with the Finder will I still be able to boot from it if necessary?\nAre there any solutions to enable my backup to be both encrypted and also bootable? I currently use FileVault 2 to encrypt my main SSD, and if I try booting from that (i.e. just booting up my computer) it asks for my password. If I try to boot from a bootable external disk (which happens to be encrypted) will it just ask for the disk password on boot [that is, after I select that as the boot disk], similarly to how I would be asked to enter a password to unlock the SSD encrypted with FileVault 2?\n\nA: It should work, but if you use SuperDuper! a workaround is necessary:\nI backed up my main system volume (hereinafter referred to as \"System\") to the unencrypted! backup volume (hereinafter referred to as \"SystemBackup\"). After rebooting to SystemBackup i tried to encrypt the volume SystemBackup, which wasn't successful, because the Recovery HD on the backup disk is missing. SuperDuper! only creates a copy of the system volume.\n\n\n*\n\n*To get around this you first have to install a working system on the backup disk or use another way to create a Recovery HD volume on the backup disk and then erase the main backup volume again.\n\n*Backup your main system volume to the backup volume.\n\n*Boot to your (bootable) backup volume SystemBackup\n\n*Enable File Vault 2 in the system preferences.\n\n*Reboot to SystemBackup like advised and continue encrypting.\n\n*After encryption has finished boot to your main volume again\n\n*Now backup your main volume as usual using SuperDuper!\n\n\nIn my second/third attempt i used CarbonCopyCloner. In contrary to SuperDuper! CCC creates a backup, which usually includes the Recovery HD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your main system volume to the unencrypted! backup volume. You might have to initiate the backup of the Recovery HD manually. In my first attempt it was backed up automatically and in a second attempt i had to initiate it manually.\n\n*Boot to your (bootable) backup volume SystemBackup\n\n*Enable File Vault 2 in the system preferences.\n\n*Reboot to SystemBackup like advised and continue encrypting.\n\n*After encryption has finished boot to your main volume again.\n\n*Now backup your main volume as usual using CarbonCopyCloner.\n\n\nEven after completely deleting my main disk (File Vault volume & Recovery HD) to simulate a disk failure, i have been able to boot to my system backup volume.\nDon't encrypt the backup volume in the Finder (e.g. control-click on the the volume) before or after backing up your main volume!\nAn important note from the CCC knowledge base:\nMac firmware cannot \"see\" FileVault-protected volumes larger than 2.2 TB when the disk is attached via USB. If attaching the disk to your Mac via Firewire or Thunderbolt is not an option, create a 2TB partition at the beginning of the external disk to work around this limitation.\n\nA: In my opinion this should work. To play safe: If you are able to create a bootable USB stick with a full blown OS installation, try it. :)\nThe only thing I am currently thinking about is, when you started from your harddisk and encrypt an external drive, the keys for the drive (if it is bootable) need to be on the drive you are encrypting. Otherwise on boot the keys are looked up, but they are on another drive.\nTo play around with that I would do as I honestly do not know it exactly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open DiskUtility and prepare a 32GB USB stick for Mac OS X installation (if necessary).\n\n*Download the Yosemite installer from AppStore.\n\n*Install Yosemite onto the USB stick.\n\n*Either way: encrypt USB stick and try to boot from - OR - boot from USB stick and start encryption there (you need PLENTY of time for that)...\n\n\nIf that works, you do the same procedure with your external harddisk.\n\nA: When you encrypt a disk with filevault 2, your mac will start up from the recovery disk to load your OS. At the login screen you enter your password to decrypt the disk. It means that it will take some more time to log you in. \nI think it will work as log as you have a recovery partition.\nBut if you do not really need filevault on the external drive, i would suggest not using it due to performance/speed.\n\nA: I made a bootable encrypted clone using SuperDuper on OS X 10.11.\nAll I had to do was to reformat my Samsung External T3 SSD with Disk Utility to be Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility for Mac: Protect a disk with a password using Disk Utility\nThen I cloned my system drive with SuperDuper from my Macbook Pro onto the external SSD.\nThat's all I had to do. After that I could boot off the external device and everything was fine. And everything was encrypted by Disk Utility and passwords were prompted for and accepted at the appropriate times.\n", "Q: Gmail tab in Safari Consumes high band width I have figured a process called 'Safari networking' (I think it's the process of safari browser) consumes lots of bandwidth. It's about 1 GB in 1 hour, but I didn't download anything. I have also found that it eats bandwidth only when gmail is opened in a safari tab. If you close gmail tab, bandwidth usage  is normal.Any idea why this is happening ?\nOSX Yosmite 10.10.2\nSafari 8.0.3 \n\nA: I have a similar problem. Last month, on one particular day, 80GB was downloaded (and another day, almost 40GB). This was definitely not something I was downloading - I don't even have 40GB of spare disk on any computer at home! \n\nAfter resetting router passwords (in case someone was hacking my wifi), and monitoring all my home computers, I also narrowed it down to gmail, but only on my wife's and daughters accounts. One particular email from Pintrest caused 1GB to download in a few minutes before I switched tabs and it stopped. I reopened the email, but it didn't happen a second time. Also forwarded the email to my account but the problem didn't reoccur, so I'm not sure it was related to that particular email.\nIt's happened about 3 times in the last month, every time in Safari (I think, but I'm not 100% sure).\nHas anyone else seen this, or does anyone have any ideas as to its cause?\n(All my home computers are Macs, with the latest updates applied.)\n", "Q: Difference between flash drive and hard drive? I know it sounds like a silly question but my girlfriend is buying a new Mac Book Pro soon and we found that the flash drive mac's have less memory when it's a flash drive but more expensive whilst the hard drive mac has more memory but it's less expensive. Is this like a new and better version to pick the flash drive memory I guess? What's the difference? We need the best one because we recently lost all of our old files on our blog which really sucks so we are willing to get the best one so we avoid this issue in the future.\nI'd appreciate any of your help, thanks a lot.\n\nA: The primary difference between a flash drive and a hard drive is the speed at which the computer can read stuff off them. Flash drives are faster than hard drives, because of the way they work, so if you buy one of those your computer will boot up quicker when you turn it on and you'll likely find your apps load quicker, too. So, on that basis, the flash drive is good and will make for a better MacBook Pro.\nHowever, if the main reason you're asking is because you don't want to lose files when your drive fails, then what you want to do is buy an external drive. Get one that's twice as big as the drive in the MacBook Pro that you're buying, and use Time Machine with that drive. That will help protect you against data loss. If you don't know where to start looking for external drives, two popular manufacturers are Western Digital or Seagate. The reason I'm recommending this is because neither the flash drive or the hard drive you're asking about are impervious to data loss.\nSo, to summarise: if you have the money, get a flash drive and an external drive. If you don't, get a hard drive and an external drive. But you should definitely get an external drive.\n", "Q: Was F5 function key assigned to widgets view in old OS X?

I currently run XBMC/Kodi which runs in fullscreen so OS X notifications do not display on top. When the application is in windowed mode, notifications display as normal. I have looked through the settings and their seems to be no way to change this behavior. \nIs anyone aware of a script/plugin/hack that will achieve my goal?\n\nA: For anyone still having this issue:\nPress the | key (that's the pipe key, it typically shares a key with \\) to exit Kodi's full-screen mode. Then, use macOS' full-screen button (the green one) to enter native full-screen. You should now see notifications in full-screen.\n", "Q: Can't download Google Chrome on my Mac!

As I have limited storage on my iPhone, can I delete photos from my iPhone and they will still remain on the iCloud? Or can they be accessed on my iPad which has more storage?\nI think when I have deleted a picture on any device, they delete from the iPad as well (presumably through the iCloud).\n\nA: As detailed in Apple's support article, you can disable iCloud Photo Library on your iOS device by tapping Settings > iCloud, and turning off \"Photos\".\nYour photos will still remain in iCloud Photo Library but will be removed from your device.\n\nA: You start your question by saying you have limited storage so I have taken the liberty of proposing a solution that doesn't delete, but instead stores smaller versions of your photos.\nLook at this Apple doc iCloud Photo Library FAQ, if the goal is simply to save space there are approaches that will help you in the \nQuoting rather liberally from that article just in case Apple changes it when iOS 10 comes out:\nCan I use iCloud Photo Library to save space on my device?\n\niCloud Photo Library automatically keeps all your photos and videos in\n  the original, high-resolution version. Follow these steps to choose\n  how you store your photos and videos on your device:\nOn your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, tap Settings > iCloud > Photos or\n  Settings > Photos & Camera, then select a storage setting. On your\n  Mac, click Photos > Preferences > iCloud, then select a storage\n  setting.\nIf you turn on Optimize [device] Storage, iCloud Photo Library will\n  automatically manage the size of your library on your device, so you\n  can make the most of your device's storage and access more photos than\n  ever. All of your original, full-resolution photos and videos are\n  stored in iCloud while device-size versions are kept on your device.\n  You can download the original photos and videos over Wi-Fi or cellular\n  when you need them.\n\nI worked the phones for Applecare during the iOS 6, 7 and 8 releases. We were mushrooms, we were kept in the dark until a day or two before the release, then all this new training would hit. I am not sure who is more frustrated by Apple's constant changes in Photo Stream / iCloud Drive / iCloud Photo library, the employees or the customers! I hope Apple can settle into something their users can understand for the long term. Hope this helps.\n\nA: The best place to store your photos long-term is your computer. \nCloud storage can be capricious, it's not worth the risk. \niPhoto or Image Capture on Mac, Photo Gallery [part of MS Essentials] on Windows, would be the safest.\n", "Q: Numbers - date cell set to last day of the month I have a Numbers sheet that I use to forecast the monthly interest payments on my mortgage and it's working well. The only issue is that the date cells auto-sets to the first day of the month.\nIs there any way that I can make a cell automatically set to the last day in the month? \n\nA: Might EOMONTH work for you?\nThe EOMONTH function returns a date that is the last day of the month some number of months before or after a given date.\nExample: =EOMONTH(\"2/01/2015\", 0) returns: Feb 28, 2015\n\nA: Let us say the current date is in cell A192 and is 21 January 2017. You can  insert the eomonth date in another cell with\neomonth(A192,0)\n\n\nA: I know this is old but the answer to have a single field always show the last day of the month for me is\n=EOMONTH(TODAY, 0)\n\n", "Q: How to save files on Mac with extension I want? I need to create a .css file on my Mac. I created it with TextEdit. How do I now save it with a .css extension? It seems that very single File Format it offers will give it a different extension (rtf, html, odf, docx, xml, doc)?!\n\nA: It sounds like you are in rich text mode, so the editor is trying to save the file in non-plain text format. In general for css/html/code you want just plain text.\nIn the \"Format\" menu, choose \"Make Plain Text\" then when you do a \"Save As...\" you should be able to just type whatever extension you need.\nEDIT -- As Tetsujin mentions, you do should uncheck the 'if no extension, set as .txt' in the save menu so it doesn't try to append .txt as an extension.\n\nA: Rename it and add the extension.\n", "Q: Where does a pkg installer install things? I created a *.pkg installer for a command line tool following this guide: Packaging a daemon for OS X.\nAfter running the installer, and selecting \"Install for all users\", I can't find where my installed files are.\nThe installer says the setup will take 57.9MB and the copying section takes quite some seconds, so I assume files are actually being copied and there is not an issue with my installer.\nWhere did those files go? A find / didn't reveal anything.\n\nA: You can check it from Terminal. Navigate to the folder where You have Your pkg file. Enter this:\nmkdir Foo\ncd Foo\nxar -xf ../NAME_OF_YOUR.pkg\nlsbom Bom\n\nThis will list files/paths which are included in this pkg.\n", "Q: How to record a screen film of an iPad? I would like to record a screen film of my iPad. If possible, I would like to include my spoken comments.\nHow can I do that ?\n\nA: Starting with iOS 11, screen recording is a built-in feature. It also includes an option to turn the microphone on during the session, by long-pressing or hard-pressing the screen recording button.\n\niOS 11 is still in beta but it's now in public beta which means you don't need to be a developer to enroll and test it.\n\nA: You connect your iPad to a mac, open up iTunes and quicktime. in quicktime, go to file-new movie recording.\nthere will be a little down arrow next to the record button, click the down arrow and choose your iPad.  then hit the record button.\nI don't know if this works with 30 pin iPads. i know it works with lightning ones.  if you don't have a mac, i think you're out of luck unless you jailbreak.\n\nA: If you have an iPad with a lightning connector and iOS 8 you can open QuickTime on your Yosemite Mac and make a recording. If you don't have a Mac or a iPad with lightning connector you could use Reflector which is using Airplay. Link to Reflector application\n", "Q: How do I create a symlink to MacVim configuration files? I want to store my configuration files in source control and symlink them so they will be used by MacVim.  Looking at :scriptnames I see vimrc and gvimrc being used in:  \n/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/vimrc\nMy source controlled vim files are located in:\n~/Programming/Personal (both gvim and vimrc are here)\nHow do I setup the symlink?  Is\nln -nfs ~/Programming/Personal/vimrc /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim\nand\nln -nfs ~/Programming/Personal/gvimrc /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim\nthe right way to do it?\n\nA: You are misunderstanding the way (Mac)Vim processes its configuration. Simplifying slightly, there are three layers to it on OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*the vimrc and gvirmc files in $VIMRUNTIME are the runtime defaults for the Vim install. For MacVim, this is set to point inside the application bundle – the files you found. These will be overwritten each time you update MacVim.\n\n*the vimrc and gvimrc files in $VIM are the system wide settings. This is meant to provide a system administrator with a way to set defaults. When not expressly set, $VIM is equal to $VIMRUNTIME.\n\n*finally, the ~/.vimrc and ~/.gvirmc files are your personal configuration. These are the files you, as the individual Vim user, are meant to customise.\n\n\nThese configuration files are sourced in the above order, from top to bottom. To use your personal configuration from another directory (e.g. for version control), just symlink their location to the canonical personal configuration files, i.e.\nln -s /your/configuration/dir/vimrc ~/.vimrc\nln -s /your/configuration/dir/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc\n\n", "Q: Would adding RAM to 2009 imac improve performance Since I upgraded to Mavericks from Snow Leopard, my 24 inch 2009 2.93 Ghz imac has been quite slow. It's slow to open up programs and slow in general. \nCurrently the imac only has the 4Gb of RAM that came as standard. Would upgrading to 8Gb be worth it? I can't afford a new machine at the moment.\nThanks for any advice - it's much appreciated.\nPS. I regret (in some ways) not remaining on SL but I needed 10.9 to use an application.\n\nA: To answer this question accurately, you will need to get some statistics on how much RAM you are currently using. But in general, more RAM is going to improve things, especially if you're still on 4GB.\nOn the other hand, the 2009 iMac is really reaching EoL at this point -- according to Mactracker, the support status for that machine is currently \"Vintage\". The biggest factor for this machine's performance in my opinion is the processor architecture -- Core 2 Duo had a good run, but the Core ix architectures are really in another class.\nTo put it another way -- one of my machines is a 2010 iMac 3.6 Ghz Core i5 with 16 GB of RAM, and it's still completely usable at this point. Despite it being only one year off from your model, the processor architecture difference is what's allowing my machine to stay usable while yours is showing its age. (I'm sure the 16GB RAM is helping too, but I think the processor architecture comparison is more relevant.)\nMight be time for an upgrade! 6-year lifespan is nothing to sneeze at; I'd call that getting your money's worth.\n\nA: Short answer: yes. Get the most memory you can afford.\nLong answer: my wife upgraded her 2009 macbook from SL to Mav just before yosemite came out.  She also had only 4Gb and was running quite comfortably on SL.  Mavericks was not.  Quick inspection revealed lots of swapping.\nInstalled two new 4Gb sticks (max'ing out the machine at 8Gb).  Memory pressure relieved, and wife much happier.  Still slower than a new machine, but $100 for new memory is much cheaper.  An SSD would also speed things up, but we're not there yet.\n", "Q: Course of action to clean up RAM on sluggish MBP running Yosemite Below is an EtreCheck report on my system. My problem is that I have <3 GB or 2.5 GB even after a reboot, with relatively few menu bar applications starting up. (This drops to 20-300 MB once Chrome is running!) I know I could try a clean install, maybe that would take me less time than a cleanup. Still, if I'd start a cleanup, which seem the more important things to start with?

As others have mentioned the operating system will keep recently used files in caches to improve performance, but it frees up that memory very quickly as soon as something else needs it. Low free RAM isn't necessarily a cause for concern.\nIf you want to confirm whether lack of RAM is a problem, then try to run your system for a typical day of use and then run EtreCheck. Check the Page-Outs values at the bottom of the report. If Page-Outs is high (measured in GBs) then you likely need more RAM for whatever you are doing on your Mac.\nAside from that you do have a lot of extensions, agents, daemons, etc though. You are right to be focussing on them. There are none listed that stand out to me as particularly problematic, so I'd recommend starting by removing the ones you don't need. Things that you installed to try out but then forgot about after trying them once or twice, or things that are remnants of old software you no longer use (for example I think the \"Open in Internet Explorer\" Safari extension is installed by Parallels; if you no longer use Parallels then remove the extension). Then focus on the ones that say \"running\" or \"loaded\" as they are actually using resources on your machine.\n", "Q: Why don't images in iCloud appear as available in iMovie on IOS?

If you are only attempting to access it within the network, this port doesn't need unblocking externally.\n", "Q: Does iPhone 5 charger work for iPhone 6 I need to test an app i'm developing for iPhone 6 device. Can I use an iPhone 5c charger to connect the charger to my MacBook Pro and the iPhone 6? Would the iPhone 5c charger work for iPhone 6 or does iPhone 6 have a completely different charger?                         \n\nA: There are only 2 types of connector for iPhones/Pads; the old-style 30-pin & the new-style Lightning connector. The change to Lightning, for phones, is at iPhone 5; prior to that they were 30-pin.\nThe output of a phone/pad charger has only 2 variations, 1A for phones, 2A for pads. Any device needing 2A or less will work on a 2A charger, a 2A device on a 1A charger will charge, but very slowly.\nAny recent Apple computer is capable of charging either a pad or phone directly over USB, using the detachable cable from a mains charger, as Apple incorporated a non-standard 2A capability into the ports. Older machines can charge phones easily, but pads only more slowly, as they don't have the full 2A capability.\nHowever, there is no compatibility between a phone/pad charger & a laptop charger, without 3rd party hardware. Examples - https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/plugbug or http://www.supercompressor.com/tech/cabin-charges-your-iphone-with-a-macbook-charger\nA phone charger cannot be pressed into service for a laptop, as it's not powerful enough.\nSo…\nTL:DR is yes, it will work, so long as you're charging the phone from the laptop over USB, or directly from a phone/pad charger.\nAs you'd need to have the phone connected to the laptop over USB for connectivity, just using the USB->Lightning connector is sufficient.\nIf it fits, it works.\n\nA: iPhone 5, 5S, 5C, 6, and 6+ all have the same ports and wires. I'm a bit confused what you're talking about, all the wires that come with the devices just plug in.\n\nA: Yes, The iPhone 5c and iPhone 6 both use Lightning cables to charge and/or sync. \n", "Q: What are page up/ page down keys on Macbook for TextMate?

At the bottom of the pane choose the Rebuild option. If you have a large mailbox, you can expect the process to take a few hours.\n  \n*You must repeat this step for each one of your Mailboxes.\n  \n*While the process takes place, you may experience system performance lag, as it can consume a lot of system resources and memory.\n  \n  \n  Another caveat, if you use IMAP or Exchange with any of the accounts, the process will redownload every message from the server, so you'll use a lot of bandwidth.\nNow that you've completed these steps, work with Mail a little longer. If you are still having issues, or Mail fails to launch, you should try a manual reindex.\nStep 2: Re-index\nManual reindexing of Mail messages is the only way to go if the  application has become so unresponsive it barely works at all, search is not functioning correctly or the app won't launch.\nMail will automatically attempt to reindex your messages if it detects problems with the mailboxes, but sometimes a manual reindex is the best option. If you are still having problems with Mail after following step one, try manual reindexing.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Quit Mail if it’s open.\n  To get to your home Library folder, hold down the Option key, then in the Finder choose Go > Library.  \n  \n*In ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData, delete any file that begins with “Envelope Index,” such as Envelope Index or Envelope Index-shm. (Before you actually delete the files, it makes sense to copy them to a folder on your desktop.)\n  \n*Launch Mail and the app will build new Envelope Index files -- this can take a long time if there are numerous messages to go through.\n  \n*If everything seems to be working correctly, you can now delete the copies of the \"Envelope Index\" files from your desktop.\n  \n  \n  In most cases, these two tips should solve most Mail problems\n\n\nA: My was crashing when I added Google Accounts, and the reason was, in one of the Google Accounts, I had created Mail Labels with slashes in their names i.e \"/label_name/\" and this was confusing the the Mail App to think it is a file path on the file system. I renamed my email labels, removing the slashes, and it stopped crashing!\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but it helped me.  Here is the cure.\nI started getting repeated Mail crashes when we changed from the old style Exchange email server to the Office365 service.  I found that if I open the Mac address book app, and before it has a chance to crash, you open the preferences and delete the Exchange account it fixes the problems.\n\nA: The re-index worked for me, but the difference from the original post is on my MacOS version (Sierra 10.12.3), I had to go to the library located in V4 not V2.\n~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData\n\nA: Exactly same symptom EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT).

I forgot my password for iPhone backup. How can I recover the password so I can turn off the backups?\n\nA: If you have a password encrypted backup you can't restore it without the password. If you could it would be no use of encrypting the backup.\n\nA: Recently I published a tutorial like guideline to recover the iTunes backup password on windows. That password is safeguarded by the iPhone. So iTunes gets the encryption setting info from the phone, not from windows. There are many brute force tools out there. They did not work for me given the length of my passwords in general.\nThe guideline worked for me. Looking at the recovered PW, I am convinced that I did set that password myself and it was not some kind of auto-set by IOS, as some suggest in this 30 page long post Lost Password to iPhone Backup\nRoughly the recovery is possible by the taking the following steps (tried on IOS 9.02). But there are many detailed steps to take or the recovery will fail and you will loose your current content on the phone.  \nAs soon as jailbreaking is possible with an enabled PC-backup encryption option, many detailed steps of the lengthy procedure are not needed any more. But the safeguarding of your PC backup is still applicable as is the keychain dumper part. \n\n\n*\n\n*Set your iPhone & iTunes so backups include passwords: set IOS/iCloud pass codes (passwords) and set never auto-lock\n\n*Backup your iPhone on both iCloud and on your PC. Save your PC backup files manually. iCloud backup will be used for the recovery, PC backup to restore the iPhone to 'as it was'\n\n*Clean install IOS and jailbreak your iPhone, otherwise you cannot execute next steps\n\n*Restore your original iPhone content from iCloud, but prepare it through Cydia. The iPhone will remain jailbreaked. An unprepared restore through IOS reset cannot be used.\n\n*Install SSH, terminal and keychain dumper on the iPhone\n\n*Your phone is now open for hackers, protect it: change the passwords for the existing root and user (user=mobile) accounts\n\n*Run keychain dumper on the phone through PC terminal and copy the decoded keychain in clear text to your PC\n\n*Restore the phone if wished: DFU mode and restore from PC through iTunes using the manually saved PC backup copy\n\n\nThe detailed steps are at https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3pdg34/tutorial_how_to_recover_a_lost_itunes_backup/ \n\nA: If you're using a Mac, it may be saved in Keychain.\nPer Apple's support article:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes Preferences and select the Devices tab. Note the time of the device’s backup.\n\n*Right-click the desired backup and choose \"Show in Finder\".\n\n*Finder should now be open, showing the backup selected. Click the Edit menu and choose Copy.\n\n*Open Keychain Access from /Applications/Utilities/.\n\n*Paste the backup folder's name into the search box in the top-right corner of Keychain Access.\n\n*If there is a password for the backup, you should see it in Keychain Access.\n\n*Double-click the backup in Keychain Access.\n\n*Click the button “Show password”.\n\n*You may be asked to enter your login keychain password. After doing so, click Allow. You should see your backup password.\n\n*Use this password to restore from your backup.\n\n\nIf it's not in Keychain, and you are the administrator of the device (meaning it was set up for by your workplace or other administrator) the support article indicates the password is not recoverable.\n", "Q: Can't a Macbook Pro work properly on integrated GPU only? For a couple of weeks, I've been having kernel panics in my MacBook Pro (Early 2011, Yosemite), mostly doing zoom operations using QuickView and Preview.\nA couple of times, it had problems rebooting, until finally it only rebooted to a grey screen.\nI installed gfxCardStatus to prevent it to switching to the discrete GPU at any time, and things seemed to go smoothly for a couple of days. But one day it had a kernel panic when waking up from sleep.\nBooting in verbose mode showed no indications of what the problem could be, but I suspected it was a video card issue. I've known that this model of MBP had problems with defective AMD Radeon discrete GPUs. I know Apples is repairing eligible machines, but I live in a country where perhaps that wouldn't be possible.\nI decided to prevent the laptop from using the AMD GPU and use the integrated intel chip instead, I moved this drivers out of the /System/Library/Extensions/folder:\nAMD2400Controller.kext\nAMD2600Controller.kext\nAMD3800Controller.kext\nAMD4600Controller.kext\nAMD4800Controller.kext\nAMD5000Controller.kext\nAMD6000Controller.kext\nAMD7000Controller.kext\nAMD8000Controller.kext\nAMD9000Controller.kext\nAMDFramebuffer.kext\nAMDRadeonVADriver.bundle\nAMDRadeonX3000.kext\nAMDRadeonX3000GLDriver.bundle\nAMDRadeonX4000.kext\nAMDRadeonX4000GLDriver.bundle\nAMDSupport.kext\nATIRadeonX2000.kext\nATIRadeonX2000GA.plugin\nATIRadeonX2000GLDriver.bundle\nATIRadeonX2000VADriver.bundle\n\nIt wouldn't boot up after that either, so I moved this ones also:\nGeForce.kext\nGeForceGA.plugin\nGeForceGLDriver.bundle\nGeForceTesla.kext\nGeForceTeslaGLDriver.bundle\nGeForceTeslaVADriver.bundle\nGeForceVADriver.bundle\n\nAfter that it did boot up, but the screen shows thin horizontal blue stripes all over as well as some other glitches and overall sluggishness.\nDetail of stripes (there's some unavoidable Moire pattern in the photo, but the thin blue lines can be appreciated in the darker parts):\n\nI just want my Mac to use the integrated Intel GPU and forget the discrete ADM Radeon card altogether. Other machines, including Apple machines, don't have a discrete GPU, just an integrated one, and they work fine for day-to-day, non-graphic-intensive tasks\nMy question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is possible for this machine to work normally using only the integrated Intel GPU? \n\n*If so, how?\n\n*Are both my discrete GPU and my integrated GPU damaged?**\n\n\nA: Just moving kext files won't disable your discrete graphics card, it will just make it work in a very basic mode.\nYou can achieve that modifying certain EFI variable. I answered this other question with the full procedure to permanently disable discrete graphics card on startup and have a fully functional machine.\n\nA: That seems not to be going well.\nFirst check this out: http://www.apple.com/ca/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nNext I would suggest:\nput all ATI/AMD drivers back to /System/Library/Extensions/\n\n\n*\n\n*remove only and specifically the driver files that were being used for the specific GPU. In your case:\nsudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/ATIRadeonX3000*\n\n*sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions\n\n*reboot\n", "Q: Wifi Direct Support on iOS Devices I am getting a lot of conflicting information to this simple question.\nBasically I need to understand which devices will support WiFi direct. Is this device specific or is this iOS specific?\nCan I run a Wifi Direct App on say a iPhone 4s with iOS 7?\nHow about a iPad Mini and iOS 8?\n\nA: Theoretically the device list is as follows, running iOS 7 or later:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5 or later\n\n*iPad (4th generation or later)\n\n*iPad mini\n\n*iPod touch (5th generation)\n\n\nThat said, this is the compatibility list for AirDrop which uses WiFi Direct as of iOS 7. Your mileage may vary with apps that are not utilizing AirDrop for the WiFi Direct functionality.\n", "Q: How do I run a binary program without showing the gear icon? I created a automator workflow, add a Run Shell Script part and put these lines in: \n\n/Users/xxx/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android avd\n\nI saved it as an app and it works.\nBut I will always see a gear icon on the menu bar.\nI tried to put a & or nohup, if so the program won't start.\nAny ideas? The android I'm trying to execute is a shell script\n\nA: You will always see the gear in the menu bar if you are using Automator. If you want it to exit quickly, create a wrapper that forks off your android script into another process, and exits.\nFor example, you could run \n\necho \"/Users/xxx/Library/Android/sdk/tools/android avd\" | /usr/bin/at now\n\n(source for script is from this Apple Discussions page near the bottom)\n", "Q: Make alias take icon of the .app it points to \n*\n\n*I have a blah.app, and on desktop there is an alias to this app\n\n*I went to blah.app/Contents/Resources and replace the icon with my icon, same name\n\n*I went to blah.app/ and created a new folder next to the blah.app/Contents folder, this made the blah.app icon update to show mine however the icon of the alias file on desktop did not change.\n\n\nAny ideas on why this is so? I know I can drag the icon over this alias file, but im trying to figure out whats going on here, why isn't taking my icon? :(\nThanks!\n\nA: As noted in my comment from earlier, you can make an alias of the alias and it will acquire the icon from the original source... for some reason.\n\nThe following example is with folders... so it's not the exact situation in the question, but I think it illustrates the point:\n\n\nA: I was having the same issue with an alias on the desktop of a .pvm file. I found I could change the icon in its original folder, but when I moved it to the desktop it reverted. I tried changing the name of the alias back to its original name as noted above, and the changed icon came back, but I didn't want the long name. I tried making an alias of the alias as noted above, and that worked, but as soon as I removed the .pvm extension on the name it reverted again. Ultimately, I could change the name to anything and keep the new icon as long as the name included the .pvm extension.\n\nA: Either, in a Terminal: killall Finder\nOr, from the Apple menu, Log Out and then log back in.\nEither should cause the Alias to show the correct icon.\nIn the event the Alias doesn't update after this then delete the Alias and recreate it.\n", "Q: Wrong photo count My iPad mini says I have 1701 photos. I deleted all except maybe a hundred. Ipad still says I have 1701 photos. Where they at. Tried everything. Checked forums and they have same problem. What good is ICloud if they want store data and photos because I need storage. But it says I have 5 Gigabytes free. Help\n\nA: Your question has a few parts. I'll go through one by one.\n\nMy iPad mini says I have 1701 photos. I deleted all except maybe a hundred. Ipad still says I have 1701 photos.\n\nI presume you don't see these photos anywhere. Meaning if you go to Photos, they aren't there, and that you're referencing the count in Preferences > General > About. In this case, have you tried rebooting your device. Are the photos taking up space, or is the count just wrong?\n\nWhat good is ICloud if they want store data and photos because I need storage. But it says I have 5 Gigabytes free.\n\niCloud is primarily a syncing platform. Unless you opt to \"optimize device storage\" for the Beta Photo Library syncing, you won't get any benefits where you save space on your device. iCloud storage starts at 5GB, you may need to buy more. I have a 20GB plan and optimize my storage. My local photo library is smaller than my cloud photo library.\n\nA: If your iPad mini shows these photos, and it is on iOS 8, this is why.\nIn iOS 8, they removed deleting photos. Now, your photos are stored in a album called \"Recently Deleted\".\nTo delete these photos:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Photos\n\n*Click on Albums on the toolbar on the bottom\n\n*Click on \"Recently Deleted\"\n\n*Click \"Delete All\".\n\n", "Q: iTunes is changing the number/order of tracks in an album when it loads into my iPod. I want the tracks to stay in order iTunes changes the number (and therefore) the order of tracks in an album when make a new playlist. Therefore, I cannot listen to an album in the correct order. I want the tracks to stay in order when I create a new playlist. It is worse than shuffle because the actual number of the tracks gets changed, so I cannot tell what order the tracks should be in.\n\nA: I'm not sure why this is happening, but you can fix it by clicking on a track, going to File > Get Info (or ⌘ Cmd-I) and changing the track numbers back to the correct information.\nTo get the correct track number, you can try googling the album. Somewhere will surely have the titles and track numbers.\n\nA: Easy to EDIT playlist and put in order downloaded or whatever.  Click DONE and will put in new order.  My problem is I have to do this every time I open iTunes.  I agree it won't \"stay\" in the order set.  Especially a problem for downloaded books.  Need to make sure each playlist is in correct order before you sync.\n\nA: There is no answer.  The latest version of iTunes completely boned all users  You cannot drag folders into a playlist and have the order of the songs be proper.  Yes you can edit them by switching to \"songs\" view and sorting by \"playlist order\" (the first column), but that is a major hassle and I now hate iTunes because of it.\nThe only way I have found to import a folder of songs and have them retain their proper order, is instead of dragging in the folder, highlighting and dragging the songs.  For each folder.  It's a terrible waste of time but at least you don't have to rearrange each song in the playlist.\nIt started with version 12 and there is absolutely NO GOOD reason for this, and they'd better fix it soon.\n\nA: I may have found an answer, go to view In iTunes and select \"sort by playlist order\", it seems to have stopped tracks on a CD  appearing in the wrong order.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can I restore items from a Mavericks Time Machine after upgrading to Yosemite? If I upgrade from Mavericks to Yosemite, will I still be able to recover items from my Time Machine backup?\n\nA: There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to recover files from a Time Machine backup saved using Time Machine under Mavericks simply because you upgraded the Mavericks system to Yosemite. A system upgrade doesn't normally break continuity of Time Machine. There will likely be a lot more data backed up during the first backup after the upgrade, so if you don't have enough disk space for the new backup data, some older backup data might be removed to make room for it.\nAs long as you have credentials to access the backups, you can recover from your current Time Machine backup from another Mac that has been configured for Time Machine whether it was upgraded to Yosemite or whether Yosemite was originally or cleanly installed. Just connect your Time Machine backup to the computer you want to use to recover, hold down option, then click the Time Machine menu and choose \"Browse Other Backu Disks...\".\n", "Q: Unable to run 'display notification' using osascript in a tmux session If I run the following command in Apple Script Editor directly, \ndisplay notification \"Hello, world\"\n\nI can see a  notification as expected\nHowever if I tried to invoke it via command line:\n osascript  -e 'display notification \"Hello, world\"'\n\nIt turns out I am running it in a tmux session. If I just ran the command in my default shell, it works as expected. \nHow can I get it to work with tmux?\n\nA: As @kopischke said, install or upgrade reattach-to-user-namespace may solve this problem.\nIf your reattach-to-user-namespace is old, notification works well after brew upgrade reattach-to-user-namespace.\n\nA: Building on @snomof's answer, you'll want to install reattach-to-user-namespace through Homebrew or MacPorts and wrap the call to osascript:\nreattach-to-user-namespace osascript  -e 'display notification \"Hello, world\"'\n\n", "Q: How do I search ??_doc.xml file in a specified folder in Finder?

So I created several much larger files, up to 2 GB, using dd and /dev/random as the source and made duplicates.  I then rebooted and then did timed copies of each of the sets, one in Terminal and the other in Finder.  This way, there was nothing in the disk cache/memory during the subsequent copy operations in each app for each set.\nThe timings were near identical, so near as to be the same for this test purpose.  I say near identical as in Terminal I used the time command and in Finder I used the second hand of the clock. So in your case, the file definitely was still in memory when the second copy operation was performed.\n", "Q: Can iBeacon range/region monitoring trigger \"dynamic\"/data-based notification? Can an iBeacon range and/or region event (for an iOS app that is not running in the foreground) somehow have a \"dynamic\" notification send to that iOS device (i.e. a notification text that is not hard coded in the app but rather comes from a server)?\nAn example use case that everyone can relate to is that your local super market implements beacons and that as you walk pass the milk section you get a notification saying \"Milk half price for the next half hour\" (because the \"use-by\" date is near).\nI know I can do local notification with static text (i.e. \"welcome to the store\") but unsure if I can so something more dynamic.\n\nA: Yes, beacons with their proximity detection capabilities can directly push content in the form of notifications to the lock screen, thus allowing consumers to interact with apps without having to open one.\nYou can use features like cards, rules, webhooks for creating such notifications.\n\n\n*\n\n*With Cards (Cards are small pieces of content - text, photo, video or audio - that are\nto be shown based on the campaign rules), you can edit the kind of content you would want on the screen as a notification. \n\n*Rules allow you to define a set of conditions that must be satisfied in the proximity of a beacon, for actions to be performed inside the app. \n\n*Webhooks are \"user defined HTTP, URI callbacks\". They are usually triggered by some event and when that event occurs, the source app makes an http request to the uri configured for the webhook.\n\n\nProbably the dynamic variable you are referring to here is the RSSI value of the beacon frequency which increases when you reach a beacon. Couple that with UUID-Major-Minor and you can do custom data based notifications.\nYou can also use various SDKs that have already incorporated these features, through something called camp-on's on a beacon and cannot only do local notifications but also call webhooks among other things, as a reference on Github. \nIf you are interested in learning more about how to go about building a beacon-enabled app right from scratch,  join the Online iBeacon App Development Course: Build a Beacon-enabled iOS App. It will help gain insights on location-based services and also understand terminologies like beacon ranging, background monitoring and much more. \n\nA: Also here's someone actually doing it: The rise of iBeacon - if you read the \"Geofencing\" section: \n\n\"The app only has a few seconds to process this information before it is suspended (in our testing, the app is suspended after 5 to 10 seconds).  This is plenty of time to notify the user, or in the case of our app Geohopper (geohopper.com), the app then notifies our web service and triggers some external action\"\n\n", "Q: Play Audio from a Mac over an iPhone Call I'm trying to play an audio file from my Mac Mini over an iPhone call. I tried using a male to male audio cable to connect the Mac's audio out port, into the iPhone's headset jack, but I guess that would be too easy. I also have a headset splitter but that doesn't seem to work either. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: You should be able to do something like this with a product like IK Multimedia's iRig (or a generic equivalent... of which there are plenty). \n\nThe iRig splits the shared audio input and output on the iPhone/iPad headphone port. Plug a patch cable from your Mac's headphone port to the input on the iRig (you might need adapters to go from mini headphone to standard... 1/8\" to 1/4\"). \n", "Q: Assistive Access when script is launched by agent Problem\nApplescript run by osascript is not allowed Assistive Access when launched by agent (~/Library/LaunchAgents). Although it works when run from Applescript editor or commandline directly (using osascript).\nSituation\nThe applescript performs several GUI tasks for batch printing and is run twice daily. Therefore it needs permission to access Assistive Devices and is launched by an agent.\nThe script runs as expected when launched from:\n\n*\n\n*Applescript Editor\n\n*osascript commandline (non-sudo)\n\nWhen launched by Agent it returns:\n/location/of/my.scpt: execution error: System Events got an error: osascript does not have access to assistive devices. (-25211)\n\n(Message translated from Dutch by me.)\nThis led me to believe the issue is with osascript, but like I stated above, it works fine when entered directly from command-line using:\nosascript /location/of/my.scpt.\nAlso, based on these two posts I edited the /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db SQLite database and when I check the 'access' table it shows:\n$ sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \"SELECT * FROM access\"\nPassword:\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|com.logitech.gaming|0|1|0|??\n\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|com.valvesoftware.steam|0|1|0|??\n\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|com.blizzard.starcraft2|0|0|1|\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|com.apple.AccessibilityInspector|0|1|0|??\n\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|com.apple.ScriptEditor2|0|1|0|??\n\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|com.apple.Terminal|0|1|0|??\n\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|/usr/bin/osascript|1|1|1|\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|com.my.label|0|1|1|\nkTCCServiceAccessibility|/osascript|1|0|1|\n\nAs you can see osascript is allowed access and I also added my agent's .plist for good measure.\nPossible Cause?\nThe only thing I can think of is that, for some reason, the script is run by a 'different user' when launched by an Agent and therefore has different assistive devices allowed? Seems unlikely, however, as the TCC.db does not seem to be user-specific and the agent is located in ~/Library/LaunchAgents.\nHelp, anyone?\n\nA: A simple fix is to save the script as a text file instead.\nAt the top of the script add the osascript shebang\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\nexample:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\nsay \"hello\"\ntell application \"Safari\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\n    delay 2\n    keystroke \"p\" using command down\n    tell application process \"Safari\"\n\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            tell process \"Safari\"\n                click menu button \"PDF\" of sheet 1 of window 1\n                delay 1\n\n                click menu item \"Save PDF to Web Receipts Folder\" of menu of menu button \"PDF\" of sheet 1 of window 1\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\nend tell\n\nThe in the save dialog choose Text as the file format.\nThe file will be saved as plain text but with the .applescript extension.\nIn terminal make the save script text file executable.\nI used:\nchmod +x /Users/UserName/Scripts/newTest1.applescript\nIn the command arguments of the LaunchAgent just add the path to the file.\nDo not add the osascript command to the arguments. You do not need it.\nThe saved script text file will act like an executable shell script.\nWhen you first load or run the LaunchAgents you will get a prompt to set the  Assistive Access in System Preferences. If you already have System preferences open you will not but the Script text file will be added to the list.\nYou now just have to check its check box to allow it.\nI would reload the LaunchAgent so it picks up straight away.\nI have double checked this with the script above and all works as expected.\n\nA: While I have accepted @markhunte's question because it works in the general case, it did not work for me. That is why I post my own solution as an alternative.\nCreate a shellscript that launches the applescript\nBy having the launchagent run a shellscript that simply calls to the applescript (.scpt) the shellscript needs to be allowed access to assistive devices once and can be run by the launchagent to, in turn, call the applescript.\nIn my case, I ended up with the following LaunchAgent .plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.mylabel.some-awesome-utility</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Users/username/absolute/path/to/shellscript.sh</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/com.mylabel.some-awesome-utility.err</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/tmp/com.mylabel.some-awesome-utility.out</string>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>06</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>05</integer>\n        </dict>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>20</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>05</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis LaunchAgent will call the shellscript.sh twice daily as specified by the StartCalendarInterval key. Also note the StandardErrorPath and StandardOutPath keys that were useful while debugging.\nThe shellscript.sh is extremely simple:\n#!/bin/sh\nosascript /Users/mnmt/Documents/InCuffs/Orders/PrepareShipping/print-shipping-labels.scpt\n\nAs you can see, a simple shebang line to specify that it is indeed a shellscript followed by a single call to the applescript I had originally been calling directly from the LaunchAgent.\n", "Q: Does Spotlight index dotfiles (OS X Yosemite)? I want to create an Alfred workflow with some dotfiles (i.e. zsh config files). \nLong story short, in Alfred, I only can play with files indexed by Spotlight. \nApparently, Spotlight doesn't index dotfiles as I can't get any dotfile in my Alfred results.\nAny of my Spotlight setting that would force Spotlight to index dotfiles index is checked. \nSo, my question is there a way to force Spotlight to index dotfiles, dotfiles of a specific directory, a specific dotfile?  \n\nA: Using the mdfind command which queries the Spotlight Database I have to say no because the tests I performed would indicate so.  In a Terminal using mdfind -name .bash_history as well as subsequent commands changing the .filename portion of the command, mdfind did not return the specific file names while only returning filenames that contained the .filename portion within where applicable.\n", "Q: Error / Hang Installing Yosemite and Mavericks on Mac Pro SSD Having had a hard drive failure, I'm attempting a clean install of Yosemite on a 2010 Mac Pro, with a brand new 120GB OWC SSD.\nI've tried using a Yosemite boot disk, using both an external hard drive and a USB memory stick, which both suffered the same symptoms, and now I'm seeing something similar with an old Mavericks USB memory stick, which I believe has worked before.\nThe problem I had with the Yosemite install was that it would start the installation, I'd accept the terms, and it would get to the \"Preparing to install\" screen. It would then count down from 8 minutes, stop at \"1 second remaining\" for about 10 minutes, then \"0 seconds remaining\" for about another 10 minutes, before finally presenting the error message, \"An error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again.\"\nWith Mavericks, I'm seeing the same thing up to the \"0 seconds remaining\" problem, but then it just hangs - on the last attempt I waited about an hour, and I'm in the middle of a second attempt now.\nI've tried resetting the PRAM, and checked the date in the terminal which is correct (albeit the wrong time zone, but I'm guessing that's not important).\nThe only entry in the Installer system log is:\nlocalhost Install OS X Mavericks[387]: Can not connect to /var/run/systemkeychaincheck.socket: No such file or directory\nAny advice much appreciated!\n\nA: Not a brilliantly helpful answer, but a resolution nonetheless.\nI contacted OWC's online chat tech support, who were incredibly helpful - continuing the conversation for an hour and a half - and talked me through diagnosing the problem.\nThe tech support rep first suggested using my old boot drive, and from there, testing whether my SSD was writable via the OS. The setup of this Mac Pro was 1 boot drive, plus 3 RAIDed drives. I found that with the RAID card still in, I couldn't access the SSD, but after removing the RAID card, and resetting the PRAM again, the SSD appeared and was certainly writable.\nI don't think the RAID card was part of the original problem, because I'd tried installing without it as well, but getting feedback that I could write to the SSD was very encouraging!\nI then simply tried installing Mavericks from the USB drive while already booted using the old boot drive and it worked!\nSo - as far as a solution for someone else encountering the same problem, I'm not sure what I can suggest, other than - if you can - boot normally, and install it that way, having selected the new drive that you want to install on.\n", "Q: ss (netstat alternative) for OS X How do I install ss on OS X?

Can MacBooks (late 2010 Air in particular) backup when in hibernation mode?\nThe reason why I am asking this is because I want to backup my MacBook air at midnight however I am not sure if my computer will be in hibernation mode when its midnight. I want to backup at midnight because I cannot back it up when using it during the day.\n\nA: If your MacBook Air has flash storage, supports Power Nap and is connected to a power adapter at night, then it will back up to Time Machine when in sleep. If any of these criteria is not met, then the backup will not take place.\nA firmware update is required for the late-2010 MacBook Air to support Power Nap. Make sure that all updates are installed in the Mac App Store and you can check for Power Nap functionality in System Preferences → Energy Saver → Enable Power Nap….\nFor more information on Power Nap, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Yosemite: About Power Nap\n\nA: No, but you can get the same effect as I use this app to keep my mac running for a  back up at night time http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/37991/nosleep\n\nA: Apple does not use the term “hibernate”, so I assume you mean “sleep”.\nMacs that support Power Nap can make Time Machine backups while they’re in sleep. This includes the late 2010 MacBook Air.\nApple offers a support article subtitled “Learn about Power Nap and which Macs can use it” which says:\n\nAbout Power Nap\nWhile sleeping, Power Nap allows your Mac to do things like periodically check for new mail, calendar, and other iCloud updates. When plugged into AC power, Power Nap can also perform things like Time Machine backups to an AirPort Time Capsule [...]\nMacs that can use Power Nap\nThe following Mac computers can use Power Nap. Some of these computers may require an SMC update in order to use this feature. [...]\nMacBook Air (Late 2010) with OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 and later. [...]\nTurning Power Nap on or off\nYou can turn Power Nap on or off in the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences. It is enabled by default on supported computers when connected to AC power. [...]\nHow often does Power Nap check for updates or back up?\n[...] Time Machine backups are attempted hourly until a successful backup has been completed. [...]\n\nAlthough the article may make it seem like this only works with an AirPort Time Capsule, I can confirm that it also works with a regular USB hard drive.\nHere’s Console showing that my Mac (a late 2010 MacBook Air) went to sleep at 20:34, then was woken for Power Nap at 21:04, made a backup and went to sleep again:\n20:34:51 kernel: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Sleep \n20:34:52 kernel: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][SuspendDevice] -- Resume -- suspendDeviceCallResult = 0x0000 (kIOReturnSuccess) -- 0x8800 ****\n20:34:52 kernel: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][SuspendDevice] -- Suspend -- suspendDeviceCallResult = 0x0000 (kIOReturnSuccess) -- 0x8800 ****\n21:04:47 kernel: Wake reason: RTC (Alarm)\n[...]\n21:05:23 com.apple.backupd: Starting automatic backup\n21:05:23 com.apple.backupd: Backing up to /dev/disk8: /Volumes/Time Machine HD/Backups.backupdb\n21:05:26 com.apple.backupd: Will copy (38.3 MB) from MacBook Air SSD\n[...]\n21:07:40 com.apple.backupd: Backup completed successfully.\n21:07:42 kernel: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Sleep \n21:07:42 kernel: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][SuspendDevice] -- Resume -- suspendDeviceCallResult = 0x0000 (kIOReturnSuccess) -- 0x8800 ****\n21:07:42 kernel: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][SuspendDevice] -- Suspend -- suspendDeviceCallResult = 0x0000 (kIOReturnSuccess) -- 0x8800 ****\n\nNote that Macs enter either “standby mode” or go into “safe sleep” after they've been asleep for a while. The support article “OS X: Saving energy with Sleep” says that “for Mac computers that are started from an mechanical hard drive, OS X includes a deep sleep mode known as safe sleep.” while “for Mac computers that are started from an solid-state drive, OS X includes a deep sleep mode known as Standby Mode.”\nApple's support article isn't so clear on the interaction between the deep sleep modes and Power Nap. However, as far as a late 2010 MacBook Air is concerned, which uses the standby mode variant of deep sleep: the article on standby mode says that “for a notebook to enter standby, it must be running on battery power”, while as explained above, Power Nap only makes Time Machine backups when the Mac is not running on battery power.\n", "Q: iPad won't turn on after a complete battery drain My iPad mini retina is out of warranty,\nI forgot to plug in my iPad after the critical battery warning and it went some minutes following the warning.

Paths are long as we use a lot of nested folders, so it's pretty boring and time consuming to browse through all that.\nNow, in my previous company, we used a central afp server, so the path was common to everyone, therefore I had created an applescript script that could get the absolute afp path to the file, people pasted that path in a mail or chat and the end user could click on that path which automatically became a link and the finder would open, selecting that particular file or folder that the link led to.\nThe reason I can't use the exact same script is that Google Drive folder is in the user home folder. So if user's name is Foo the path will be file:///Users/Foo/Google Drive, while for user Bar the path will be file:///Users/Bar/Google Drive\nClearly the path generated from user Foo won't work for user Bar\nSince, at least in the terminal, the path to file:///Users/username equals to ~, I made my script generate links like file:///~/Google Drive/pathToFolder, but they do not work :( Clicking on such a link will open the finder, but won't select the right file or folder\nThis is driving me crazy because it looks like it should work but it simply doesn't... is there any other syntax I should try?

(Any pitfalls?)\nUpdate:\nCommand output requested by David Anderson:\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 60801/255/63 [976773168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] <Unknown ID>\n 2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  584931504] HFS+        \n 3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 585341144 -    1269544] Darwin Boot \n*4: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 586610688 -  390162432] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            299.5 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                199.8 GB   disk0s4\n\ndiskutil cs list\nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\n\nA: Update 3:\nThere were a two reasons I wanted the output from diskutil and fdisk. First I wanted to check if rEFIt was installed on its own partition. It is not. This leaves either the EFI partition or the OS X partition. The normal (automatic) installation would be OS X, which is backed up with Time Machine. To be safe, you could backup the EFI partition. This is not a problem since it is only 210 MB in size. I usually just make an exact image copy of the entire partition. The command is shown below. The image file efi.img will be stored in the root directory of the OS X partition.\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk0s1 of=/efi.img bs=10000\n\nI do not know if Time machine will backup the \"Recovery HD\" partition. It is only 650 MB in size. Again, you can just image it to the root of OS X using the command below. My outline did not include migrating this partition to the new disk. Therefore, you probably will never use this file.\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk0s3 of=/RecoveryHD.img bs=10000 \n\nThe second reason, for running the diskutil and fdisk commands, was to determine if you are using a GPT or hybrid GPT/MBR partitioning scheme. You are using hybrid GPT/MBR. I assume then that Windows is using the legacy BIOS method of booting and not using the EFI to boot. \nAccording to your original post, you intend to upgrade to Yosemite after migrating to the new drive. It just so happens, I am trying to help someone (riznad) who has already done this. See here. Upgrading to Yosemite disabled rEFId and created a new \"Recovery HD\" partition. So you may need to reinstall rEFId. I would not recommend upgrading to rEFInd. \nI am not sure why you felt the need to use the rEFId boot manager. I use the System Preferences in OS X to boot to windows. Apple provides Boot Camp to boot from Windows back to OS X. On startup, you can hold the alt key to choose an operating system. I rarely need to do that. In riznad's case, rEFId makes sense, that computer has a third partition running the Fedora operating system.\nIf you wish to have a partition writeable by both OS X and Windows, now would be a good time to create it. This can be done by creating the partitions in the following order using the Disk Utility. First create the MS-DOS(FAT) partition for windows 7. This partition will be changed to NTFS by Winclone. Format the next partition as MS-DOS(FAT) or ExFat. Finally, put the OS X partition last.\n\nUpdate 2:\nJust FYI, the output of chkdsk can be viewed in the Event Viewer. An example is shown below. You can \"Open Image in a New Window\" to enlarge.\n\nAn example output is shown below.\nChecking file system on C:\nThe type of the file system is NTFS.\nVolume label is Orca.\n\n\nOne of your disks needs to be checked for consistency. You\nmay cancel the disk check, but it is strongly recommended\nthat you continue.\nWindows will now check the disk.                         \n\nCHKDSK is verifying files (stage 1 of 3)...\n  123136 file records processed.                      \nFile verification completed.\n  171 large file records processed.                    \n  0 bad file records processed.                                        \n  2 EA records processed.                                              \n  50 reparse records processed.                                       \nCHKDSK is verifying indexes (stage 2 of 3)...\n  168030 index entries processed.                                         \nIndex verification completed.\n  0 unindexed files scanned.                                          \n  0 unindexed files recovered.                                       \nCHKDSK is verifying security descriptors (stage 3 of 3)...\n  123136 file SDs/SIDs processed.                                         \nCleaning up 12 unused index entries from index $SII of file 0x9.\nCleaning up 12 unused index entries from index $SDH of file 0x9.\nCleaning up 12 unused security descriptors.\nSecurity descriptor verification completed.\n  22448 data files processed.                                            \nCHKDSK is verifying Usn Journal...\n  36677272 USN bytes processed.                                             \nUsn Journal verification completed.\nWindows has checked the file system and found no problems.\n\n 107460604 KB total disk space.\n  30413860 KB in 94522 files.\n     64108 KB in 22449 indexes.\n         0 KB in bad sectors.\n    228944 KB in use by the system.\n     65536 KB occupied by the log file.\n  76658804 KB available on disk.\n\n      4096 bytes in each allocation unit.\n  26865151 total allocation units on disk.\n  19164701 allocation units available on disk.\n\nInternal Info:\n00 e1 01 00 e3 c8 01 00 a5 53 03 00 00 00 00 00  .........S......\nbf 03 00 00 32 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ....2...........\n11 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n\nWindows has finished checking your disk.\nPlease wait while your computer restarts.\n\nWhat you are looking for is the messages Windows has checked the file system and found no problems. and 0 KB in bad sectors.\n\nUpdate 1:\nIt is my understanding rEFIt installs in the OS X partition. According to the rEFIt documentation, it is also possible for rEFIt to be installed on a separate partition or on the hidden EFI partition. No mention of being installed on the Windows partition.\nAssuming rEFIt was installed using the automatic installation, then it should be saved by Winclone followed by Time Machine. But to be honest, I have never used rEFIt. \nTo be safe, it would be useful for you to post the output from the following commands. They can be entered from a Terminal application window. The first one will ask for your login password. This is normal.\nsudo  fdisk  /dev/disk0\ndiskutil  list\ndiskutil  cs  list\n\nOther than Winclone creating a backup of Windows on you OS X partition, the procedure does not change the files on your original disk. If you wish, you can also backup Windows to a external disk that is HFS formatted (Mac OS Extended Journaled). This way Windows does not have to pass through Time Machine.\nI don't know where you are living. Where I live, I would go to Microcenter and buy an enclosure for the new disk. I would then plug the enclosed drive into a USB port on the Mac. Transfer everything over. I would also boot OS X on the the enclosed drive and test things out. From my understanding, you can not boot windows. You might be able to from Parallels. I have never used Parallels. I would then remove the drive and return the enclosure for a full refund. (Actually, have done this a few times with 3.5\" drives.) The drive could then be installed in the MacBook Pro.\nIf you proceed, it would be a good idea to run CHKDSK on the windows partition before backing up with Winclone. CHKDSK (Check Disk) has be around since the original IBM PC-DOS 1.0. The best way to do this is to open a Command Prompt window as an Administrator under Windows 7 and enter the command:\nfsutil  dirty  set  c:\n\nAfter entering the command, reboot (restart) Windows. It usually is not necessary to see the results, but if you wish, I will post how to do so using the event viewer. (You can also watch the screen during boot up)\n\nI can outline the basic steps using the Winclone product.\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase, download and install Winclone to your OS X partition.   \n\n*Use Winclone to backup Windows to your OS X partition.\n\n*Make sure OS X is backed up to Time Machine.\n\n*Install the new disk\n\n*Do a internet recovery boot. This involves hold the cmd-alt-R keys\ndown at startup and booting over the internet.\n\n*Partition the new disk using the Disk Utility. Format the OS X\npartition as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" and the  Windows\npartition as \"MS-DOS (FAT)\".\n\n*Restore OS X using time Machine.\n\n*Reboot the computer to the new OS X partition.\n\n*Run Winclone to restore Windows 7 back to the new 80 GB partition.\n\n*Drag the Winclone Windows 7 backup to the trash to recover the\n space on the OS X partition (Optional).\n\n*You are done.\n\n\nIf you wish to proceed, let me know. Also, if klanomath happens to post, I would recommend any of his solutions. He has more experience with Time Machine than I have.\n", "Q: Saving a pending print job as PDF I printed an important receipt and quit Safari, only to learn the job never printed because we no longer own the network printer the computer was expecting to find. Thus, the only remaining copy of this information is in the print queue.\nHow do I salvage the information waiting to be printed so I can use it again?\nNote: Dragging the enqueued item from the non-existant printer's queue to an existant printer's queue will print the item. I would like to know how to save the file waiting to be printed so it can be used again.\n\nA: At some point the default for saving print jobs was changed in OS X.  Likely it was earlier in El Capitan, but as of 10.11.6 I'm seeing the \"d0000\" files noted above are not saved once a job prints anymore.  You can return this functionality by typing in Terminal\nsudo cupsctl PreserveJobFiles=Yes\n\nUpon doing this the \"d\" file matching the \"c\" file will be saved in /var/spool/cups exactly as described above.  This file can be copied to your Desktop but if you want to view it you first need to add the .zip extension and unzip it and then you can add .pdf to the unzipped file of the same name and it can be viewed.  Nothing like making an admin's job easy [!]\n\nA: In Finder, from the Go menu in the menubar (the right click menu of Finder in the Dock) select Go to Folder... (⇧⌘G).\nPaste in /private/var/spool/ and hit Go.\nThe print jobs are the files beginning with \"d\". Copy them and rename them to end in .pdf.\n\nA: The CUPS web interface would allow you to direct the print job to another printer.\nHowever it's possible to capture a PDF file from the CUPS queue:\n/private/var/spool/cups  \ntotal 472  \ndrwx--x---  24 root  _lp      816 Mar  1 14:30 ./  \n-rw-------   1 root  _lp     4403 Mar  1 14:30 c00025  \ndrwxrwxr-x  13 root  _lp      442 Mar  1 14:30 cache/  \n-rw-r-----   1 root  _lp    86110 Mar  1 14:28 d00025-001  \ndrwxrwx--T   5 root  _lp      170 Mar  1 14:28 tmp/  \n-rw-------   1 root  _lp     4391 Feb 25 12:13 c00024  \nroot@Macbook: file d00025-001\nd00025-001: PDF document, version 1.3\n\nYou can copy (in this example) d00025-001 to somewhere and rename it with a pdf extension (n this case), after fixing permissions, ownership and group you can open it.\nThe matching file starting with c is the cover sheet.  You should be able to recover the job in the the printers native language from the tmp directory:\n/var/spool/cups/tmp\ntotal 288\ndrwxrwx--T   5 root  _lp     170 Mar  1 14:34 ./\ndrwx--x---  28 root  _lp     952 Mar  1 14:50 ../\n-rw-r-----   1 root  _lp    1234 Mar  1 14:28 17ed254faebef\n-rw-r-----   1 root  _lp    1193 Mar  1 14:34 17ed254fece74\n-rw-------   1 root  _lp  136512 Mar  1 14:28 17f025500d2e2\ndavid_koontz@Macbook: file *2\n17f025500d2e2: PostScript document text conforming DSC level 3.0, Level 2\n\nThis all done with an aging HPLJ-5000N LaserJet specified as a PostScript printer, the print job one page out of an ODT file (OpenOffice).\nThe original (in this case ODT) file isn't kept in the print system, which would force you to format it again.\n\nA: To find and retrieve the print jobs:\nUse the go to Folder in Finder and paste this /private/var/spool/.\nNow right- Click on the CUPS folder and use Get Info to change the permission.\nIf you have files waiting to be printed then it looks like this:\n\nIt is the file name beginning with \"d\" that you want to copy.\n\nA: As all macs using cups for printing, you can manage it with a web interface. To enable it, you have to type:\ncupsctl WebInterface=yes\n\nThen you should be able to check print server configuration, printers, queues and jobs from:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:631/\n\nIf you enter in this website, under Administration → Jobs, click Manage Josbs and you should be able to find you job there.\n", "Q: Mac terminal stop hard drive from spinning Can I stop hard disk drives from spinning using Terminal?\nThe reason why I want to know is because I have my Mac to backup at midnight however I do not want my HDD to be spinning all the time. I would also like a way to spin it back up again.\nThis is an external drive.\n\nA: In a Terminal or script, you can use the pmset command to sleep/wake the computer and more.\nFrom: man pmset\nsleepnow - causes an immediate system sleep\nsudo pmset sleepnow\nSchedules the system to automatically wake from sleep on July 4, 2016, at 8PM.\nsudo pmset schedule wake \"07/04/16 20:00:00\"\nNote: I've added sudo to the above pmset commands as this is necessary unless running as root which under OS X is not the norm.\nFrom: Quick Tip: Save Battery by Spinning Down Hard Drive Sooner\nsudo pmset -a disksleep 5\nsudo - allows a standard “admin” user to run programs usually reserved for the “root” user. These are usually processes that affect the system as a whole – like this one.\npmset - this is the name of the utility we’re using.\n-a - this “flag” tells the pmset utility that we’re applying it to all power configurations: battery, charger, and uninterrupted power supply. If you want to affect JUST when you’re on battery power, change this flag to “-b”\ndisksleep - this is the parameter we want to change: disk sleep time. This parameter is for 10.5 and later; in previous OS versions, you should use “spindown” instead.\n5 - this is the number of minutes the system waits before sleeping the disk. OS X’s defaults are 10 minutes. We halved it here, so it spins down faster, but not so fast that it’s always spinning up (which would be counter to our needs). You may need to adjust this number to a point that works best for you.\n", "Q: Upgrade to Yosemite then triple-boot problem I had Mac OS X 10.8, Fedora and Windows XP triple-boot in refit.\nI upgraded to OS X Yosemite.

I have been doing some reading. There two ways for a operating system to boot on a Mac. The first involves using the legacy BIOS which assumes the disk is partitioned using a MBR scheme. The second uses the EFI which (in our case) assumes the disk is partitioned using a GPT scheme. Macs provide both partition schemes (thus the name Hybrid) which allows for both types of booting. OS X always boots using EFI/GPT. After studying the output you posted, I have come to the conclusion both Windows and Fedora were booting using BIOS/MBR. The boot manager rEFIt is primarily designed for Macs and, in your case, was installed in the OS X partition. \nUpgrading to Yosemite created two problems. First, rEFIt was disabled. Second a small Recovery Partition was added between the OS X and Fendora partitions. Reinstalling rEFIt may be solution to the first problem. I notice rEFIt has not been updated in many years and may no longer be compatible with Yosemite. The boot manager rEFInd is suppose to replace rEFIt, but there are differences worth noting. First, rEFInd is not only for Macs. Actually, the development platform is more for Linux. This is stated on the rEFInd home page. Second, rEFInd assumes a UEFI (which succeeded EFI) and most (if not all) Macs do not fully adhere to this new standard. Third, as far as I can tell, rEFInd assumes all partitions are booting using EFI/GPT. I do not believe this is what you are trying to do. I assume you will still be installing and booting Windows 7 and Fedora 21 using BIOS/MBR. A better choice may be Boot Runner. You can use a 14-Day Trial. If you buy, the cost is $10. If not, it is easy to uninstall.\nThe Second problem, involving the extra Recovery Partition, can be resolved by removing the partition. It is not the best solution, but just the easiest. There is a good chance that if you hold down the alt(option) key at startup, you may be able to boot Fedora. This may also work for Windows, once the extra Recovery Partition is removed. I would still encourage you to copy the Recovery Partition to a flash drive before deleting it. If you every need to reload Yosemite, you can download it by booting to this flash drive.\nThe drivers for Windows 7 can be downloaded from Boot Camp: System requirements for Microsoft Windows operating systems. You can also download the drives using the Boot Camp Installer.  Just so you know, I used the same drivers to install Windows 8 (64  bit) on my iMac (20-inch, Mid 2007), even though this web site says I can not. I assume you could do the same. I may install Fedora on my iMac, just to see if it works. Maybe Boot Runner as well. I am not using the same order as you. I currently have Windows 8.1 installed before Yosemite. I would be installing Fedora between Windows and Yosemite. This is how I avoid the problems you encountered installing OS X upgrades.\n\nUpdate 2: Yosemite installer inserted a hidden partition between the OS X and Fedora partitions. The solution I was going to use involves removing this partition. I have never used the Disk Utility to do this. If you want to try, first you will have to make the hidden partitions visible. The instructions for doing this can be found at View & Mount Hidden Partitions in Mac OS X. You want to view the hidden partitions. Do not mount them. \nI was going to have you copy the hidden partition to a flash drive before you deleted it. Without the flash drive, you may have to reinstall Fedora. If all goes well, Windows should be bootable once the hidden partition is deleted. If not, you should be able to reinstall Fedora and Windows.\nThe alternative, would be to boot from the flash drive and edit the partition tables. This would be complicated but could save you from having to reload the operating systems.\n\nUpdate 1:\nPost the output from the command:\ndiskutil list\n\nQuestions: \nHave you every booted the computer by holding down the alt(option) key?\nDo you have a flash drive 1 GB or larger than you can erase and reuse?\nTo edit the partition tables you will need to boot from a flash drive. To make the flash drive, you will need to download the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant. This application works with Lion through Yosemite.\nAn alternative to making the flash drive would be to delete Windows and Linux. I assume you do not want to erase either one.\n\nI am a novice at this, but I will give it a go. I hope someone else would build on this post. In my opinion, Yosemite added a recovery partition after the OS X boot partition. This partition appears in both the GPT and MBR partition tables. This moved the Fedora and Windows partitions up in the GPT table. Fedora also move up in the MBR table, but since the MBR is limited to 4 partitions, Windows was completely removed from the MBR table. XP can only boot using a MBR partitioning scheme, so it is understandable why XP will not boot.\nIn the GPT table, Windows is shown as partition 5 with type Basic Data. I assume the GUID is EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7, although one would have to run \nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nfrom a OS X Terminal window to confirm this. Partition 4 also is shown as a type Basic Data. This may be an error, since I assume the partition should have a Linux GUID. It would help if you would add the output from the above command to you question.\nIf I am right, you have two options. Option A: move the partitions around so Windows will not be the last partition on the disk. This would be time consuming and would require an external disk to temporary hold one or more partitions. Option B: Remove the OS X recovery partition from the GPT and MBR tables. This partition is only 650MB in size. OS X has a tool you can download which will copy the partition to a flash drive. You can then boot from this flash drive if you need to. OS X has two command line utilities called gpt and fdisk which can be used to restore the GPT and MBR tables to the state before you installed Yosemite.\nAlso, could you include in your question what model iMac you are using.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro low battery warning to instant recharge My Macbook Pro (Mid 2012, OSX 10.10.2) sometimes gives the Low Battery warning, then immediately after dismissing the notification the battery pops back up to about 25% battery, still showing a red battery icon.\n\nIt is above 20% but is still red.\nWhat could have caused this, is it an error in Yosemite OS X, or is it a reserve battery power I did not know about, or is it something completely different\n\nA: That is your battery it self, acting up.\nFollowing the SMC reset I would recommend a single (one time) deep discharge.\nThe deep discharge will reset the Battery values reported.\nJust leave your computer running till it shuts down by it self due to low power.\n", "Q: iOS 8 Refresh to load desktop site I have noted that to view a desktop site in iOS 8 (such as Ask Different) that you need to refresh the page after you clicked on 'request desktop page'.\nWhy do we need to refresh the page when the loading bar move after you click request desktop site?\n\nA: The desktop site is an entirely different site in many cases than the corresponding mobile website (not including responsive websites, of course).\nBecause of this, \"requesting\" a desktop site requires loading a different set of dependencies/resources and a different version of the site you're currently on (this is particularly evident on Stack Exchange sites, but it applies elsewhere as well).\nBecause of this, the page must reload to re-layout the page and load these new resources, and it would not be possible to do it otherwise, as in these cases it is more than a matter of page scaling.\n", "Q: Message icon says I have messages to read but I do not.

This only occurs on my Mac. It runs OS X 10.10.2.\nWhen showing the desktop after starting up the computer, the wifi symbol in the superbar shows the network searching for a wlan connection.

The problem for me seems to be that I chose a spot in my house that has poor Wifi signal, perhaps due to the configuration of walls, the configuration of metal in my house construction, and so on.  If I move my computer a meter or two to the left, the problems go away.\nAlso, the problems are much worse for a Mac laptop whose lid is closed.  The antenna is located in the hinge, and with the lid closed, the antenna's ability to receive signal is reduced by half.\nI don't know exactly why wireless signal strength changes over time, causing intermittent problems.  Could be the use of electronic appliances in my house or someone else's.  Could even be solar radiation changing when clouds go by.  Best thing to do is get your router and computer jointly located so that the signal strength is generally strong - then fluctuations won't cause you to get accidentally dropped.\nTo check out your wireless signal strength and see how it varies when you move your machine around the house, follow this link:\nhttp://letstalk-tech.com/how-to-access-the-wifi-scanner-in-mac-os-x-yosemite/\n", "Q: How to write fstab rules for an NTFS volume if the volume has no LABEL or UUID?

BTW Apples NTFS R/W is disabled of a good reason so I wouldn't enable it.  I use Tuxera NTFS instead.\nSo if you don't have NTFS R/W enabled you'd use:\nUUID=56A9A02B-0590-458E-9493-1DECC2A8F109 none ntfs ro,auto,nobrowse\nIf you have NTFS R/W like Tuxera NTFS enabled you can either use a Label or the UUID:\nExample: LABEL=$Volume_Name none ntfs rw,auto,no browse 0 0\nWhere $Volume_Name is what's shown for the device in Finder.\nOr: UUID=56A9A02B-0590-458E-9493-1DECC2A8F109 none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse 0 0\nNote:  I used nobrowse in the examples because I assume you wanted it as it was in your example.\nHave a look at: fstab\n\nA: You can't reference partitions by anything other than volume UUID or label, so without a (recognisable) filesystem on the partition, you can't reference them at all. In most versions of Linux, you can refer to partitions with kernel name descriptors (/dev/disk1s1 for example), GPT labels or GPT UUIDs - any of which would work for partitions without a recognisable filesystem. Unfortunately OS X doesn't support any of these.\nThis means that for your specific question - how to mount the NTFS partitions without labels or volume UUIDs as R/W - the answer is that it isn't possible unless you alter the partition layout (ideally use GPT, don't use software RAID, 'Dynamic Disk' or 'Storage Spaces').\nHowever, if you just want to stop the disk from mounting at all, there is a way of hooking into the diskarbitrationd mounting process that automounts those pesky partitions: diskejectd. You'll need to edit the config, compile and install it. And it only works with kernel name descriptors (e.g. disk1s1) so it might mess up when you install new drives. But at least it gets rid of those annoying 'The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer' messages on every startup.\n", "Q: How to back out of an app on iPhone?

I am thinking about http://www.filehippo.com/mac for downloading DMGs. Does it have any security/virus issue? If there are other sources then please let me know.  \n\nA: The most reliable place for downloads for Mac is the App Store.\nIt is already installed on your Mac (just click on the top left Apple icon)\nAlso, you do not have to go to http://www.filehippo.com/mac to get Firefox or Chrome.\nIf not available at App Store, I usually go directly to the Developer web site to get the download.\n\nA: Check out Homebrew Cask for non-cli software and Homebrew for cli-software. It makes installing, updating and removing software much much easier.\n", "Q: Is there a way to easily access the emoticons I use most in iMessage? I often use the same emoticons in Messages and would like to quickly access the same set both in my iPhone, iPad, MacBook and iMac. Is there a way to achieve this?\n\nA: When you add the Emoji-keyboard on iOS (Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > Emoji), it automatically collects the recently used emoticons on the first tab at the bottom (the clock icon).\nThe same goes for Messages.app on OS X; when you open the Emoji-selection from the smiley-face in the input box, it shows the recent ones first.\nHowever, on OS X you can select which emoticons are shown in the favourites, a feature currently missing on iOS. You can do this by opening the Characters viewer from the top right corner of the Emoji-popup and selecting Add to Favorites for the emoticons you like.\nAlso, there is no way to sync these usages and selections between devices, at least currently and using stock OS's.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro incredibly slow/laggy I have a Mid-2012 15\" MacBook Pro running OS X (Yosemite) 10.10.2. It has a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB of RAM, and a 750GB HDD.\nOver the past couple of weeks it has become incredibly slow, to the point that simple actions such as clicking on an icon in the dock have caused the spinning wheel to appear. As far as I can tell nothing significant changed around the time that this behaviour started.\nThere is nothing unusual shown in Activity Monitor: CPU usage is low and there is over 6 GB of free memory with no swap being used.\nSome example of the degree of slowness are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Scrolling down the page on an already loaded page in Chrome - Spinning wheel for 30 seconds\n\n*Clicking in text field on Github in Chrome - Nothing happens for 34 seconds\n\n*Refreshing a page in Opera - Spinning wheel for 27 seconds\n\n*Opening Calendar from the dock - 70 seconds for Calendar to open, no visual feedback\n\n*Clicking to focus open Pages document - Nothing happens for 21 seconds\n\n*Opening System Preferences and clicking Keyboard - Spinning wheel for 30 seconds\n\n*Clicking on the File menu in Finder - Spinning wheel for 23 seconds\n\n*Swiping up with three fingers on the trackpad (show Mission Control) - Nothing happens for 12 seconds\n\n*Moving cursor down a single line in vim - Spinning wheel for 12 seconds\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning it off and on again\n\n*Making sure everything is up-to-date\n\n*Performing a disk repair\n\n*Resetting the SMC\n\n*Resetting the PRAM\n\n\nIs there anything else I can try to fix this?\nEdit: Unbelievably enough I somehow didn't think to check the logs.

I had the same problem, after two days of dealing with a very slow Mac, it failed to boot and I had to regenerate bad sectors of HDD using software available on the market. Really time consuming and risky procedure in case your data on HDD is important.\n\nA: *\n\n*You might want to give Onyx a spin: http://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html\n\n*SMC reset: turn off Mac and press ⇧ + Ctrl + ⌥ + Power-Button for 5 seconds\n\n*PRAM reset: turn off your mac, turn on mac and press ⌘ + ⌥ + P + R. You'll hear the startup chime and reboot will start again. Wait until you heard the startup chime the third time and then let your mac boot.\nNot sure if this will solve your trouble but it is the standard debugging steps.\nUPDATE: if your harddrive is broken, make a backup as quickly as possible if you don't already have one. Buy a new harddrive, set it up and exchange.\nTechToolPro might be able to help, but that software is just as expensive as a new harddrive if you're not buying an SSD.\n\nA: For me I believed the problem was League of Legends XD.

So, just consider the main use I do of my Mac is about developing on the java platform (ad just for fun).\nNow I need to move to Java 7 or maybe Java 8 and I need to upgrade Snow Leopard to one of its successors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mountain Lion (10.7.3 at least) \n\n*Maverick \n\n*Yosemite \nHere's my trilemma: which of the aforementioned OS would better fit my laptop's hardware? According to Apple's official site all of them have the same minimum requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*2 GB of RAM \n\n*8 GB free HD space\n\n\nHere's an excerpt from the System Profiler running on my laptop (translated from Italian localization):\n\n\n*\n\n*Model name:  MacBook Pro\n\n*Model ID:    MacBookPro6,2\n\n*Processor name:  Intel Core i5\n\n*CPU speed:   2,4 GHz\n\n*Number of CPUs:  1\n\n*Number of cores: 2\n\n*Cache L2 (per core): 256 KB\n\n*Cache L3:    3 MB\n\n*RAM: 4 GB\nPlease, don't point out the latter are free - I know - just focus on performance. \nPersonally, I don't feel like upgrading to Yosemite, but I'd rather move to Maverick. This is not based on figures, just on my gut feelings: I suspect that Yosemite may be too demanding about hardware configuration.\nWhat do you think?\n\nA: The more advanced version, results in most memory consumption system. So, if you are only care about performance, no doubts, Mountain Lion must be your choice.\n", "Q: CHM viewer with no continuous search? I am using CHMView at the moment. \nThe problem is that when I do a typing mistake in one word. \nI have to wait for long time. \nI would like to have no continuous search. \nOnly searching when I hit enter. \nIs there any application for CHM where the search is not continuous?\n\nA: *\n\n*xCHM should do it for you.

I would like to use .bst style sheets to format the bibliography.\nI'm currently working with BibDesk but could change to JabRef. \n\nA: Depending on your current Pages version, download CiteInPages from here...\nhttp://jhh.med.virginia.edu/main/CiteInPages\nI was able to get this to work in Pages 5.5 using CiteInPages5. It works with BibDesk. It takes a bit to install and configure it, but its a great little package. Apple really should change the name of the Pages app though. Its way too difficult to google any support for it.\nEDIT: Hopefully you see this because I don't have the reputation to comment. But I guess I misunderstood your question. Its been a while since I've used CiteInPages, but I was able to get the formatting I wanted by creating a custom template. I was able to do this with some guidance from the BibDesk community mailing list.

The browser freezes and I can not do basic things like e.g coping the selected text...\nSTRANGE: Chrome Version 40.0.2214.115 (64-bit)\nOS X: 10.10.2\nDISCLAIMER: I got my Macbook PRO retina 3 days ago from service, where they replaced graphic system (whole logic board). \nEXPERIMENT:\ncreate new OS X user and login into it, run Chrome and have a look if it works faster. For me it worked nice. Now I am trying to track reasons why it slow down so much on my current account.\n\nA: Here are some things you can do to try to restore performance within Chrome within your own account. You could try each one at a time and see if it makes a difference.\nExtensions\nOpen the extensions tab from the Chrome's Window menu. Try disabling all the extensions and running Chrome again to see if performance has improved. \nSaved Application State\nClose Chrome. Look for Chrome's saved application state folder within your account. You should find it at /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Saved Application State/com.google.Chrome.savedState. You can delete or rename the folder, it just keeps a record of which windows were open when you closed the application and what state they were in i.e. which sites you had open.\nCache folder\nDelete the /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome folder and try Chrome again. Chrome will automatically recreate this folder.\nApplication Support folder\nThis folder contains a lot of things like cookies, history, extensions, some cached files, etc. So I'd try renaming the /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome folder and trying again. Chrome will automatically create a new folder. If it makes no difference to performance, delete the new one and rename the old one back.\nPreference list file\nWithin /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences you should find the Chrome preference file.\n\ncom.google.chrome.plist\n\nJust rename the file and try Chrome again. Chrome will create a new one. As with before, try with the new file, but if it makes no difference just delete the new one and rename the old one back.\nStill not performing well?\nYou could try running sudo opensnoop | grep Chrome in a Terminal window and checking it when performance degrades. Perhaps it is trying and struggling to do something.\nYou could also try checking the Console.app for Chrome related error messages. Just open Console.app and type Chrome into the search field in the top-right corner of the window.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Disable special characters such as Tilde (German keyboard) I am using my Mac to write Java code in Eclipse. Not frequently, but commonly enough I need special characters such as ^, ~ or `.\nThe problem with these is that I have to press the key(-combination) followed by a space in order to insert the character, since these keys are used to create special characters such as ã or è. However, this is really impractical since I can't use them in Java anyway.\nIs there a way to disable this feature globally on OS X Yosemite (german keyboard layout)?\n\nA: You just need to change input source. Probably you have U.S. International, just change it U.S. and this ugly feature will disappear.\n", "Q: Mac full size keyboards with built in trackpad I want to attach a full size keyboard to my macbook for at least a couple of reasons:\na) the macbook keyboard is slightly undersized.  It is enough so to give my fingers headaches (or something like that..)\nb) I want to look straightforward at the screen but not use an external monitor. Thus I would position the keyboard 12 inches below a small pedestal for the mac\nHaving looked at numerous sites I can not find a full size keyboard with trackpad. There are very few options for keyboard with trackpad for Mac to choose from. Do any exist?\n\nA: You can buy a wired Mac full size keyboard and a Magic Trackpad. Both are manufactured by Apple. Check Apple Store.\n\nA: Do you want the trackpad off to the right of the keys or in front of the keys? I've seen them both ways and you might have to settle for a keyboard that's designated as a Windows keyboard however they typically work on a Mac as well. I sometimes use my Dell full-sized keyboard on my MBP and it works without any issues.\nTo answer your follow up question, no special drivers were necessary.  OS X just wanted a couple of keys presses, it will tell you which ones, and then it set it up.  The mappings were basically the same although the names of the Command key and Windows key are different it functions as the Command key on OS X.\n", "Q: my Mac is restating over and over I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, late 2011) When I upgraded to Yosemite, it was fine until a month ago, then there is no day that my computer does not restart/freeze randomly.

If you replaced memory to maximize, try installing the original Apple memory according to the instructions available at:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1270\nIf you haven't replaced any memory, you may still be able to solve the problem yourself by using the instructions available at the location above to try your existing memory modules one at a time. If the problem goes away when either of the modules is in use by itself, you can probably assume the other one is bad, and you can then shop for a replacement or upgrade.\n\nA: You need to find a shutdown code which caused the crash which can be found in the log files.\nThis can be found either by opening Console app and searching for the \"shutdown\" word, or run the following command:\ngrep shutdown /var/log/system.log\n\nThis line should looks like:\n\nkernel[0]: Previous Shutdown Cause: X\n\nwhere X is your code (either positive or negative number).\nOnce found, please refer to that unofficial Shutdown Causes list.\nRelated: Where to find shutdown causes errors list?\nThis can help to identify the problem and find a more specific solution based on the findings.\n", "Q: Disabling Messages on Desktop I've tried following every instruction available to prevent my desktop mac from receiving my text messages or notifications that texts are being sent or received and can't get it taken care of so far.

I had a Galaxy S4 and I just bought a iPhone 6. Is there a way I can transfer my music using an app to iTunes? Or do I have to download iTunes onto a computer?\n\nA: you won't be able to transfer your music directly to iTunes.\nYou can download this music on your computer per Goolge Music Manager and them sync with your iPhone \n(https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/manager)\nObviously you can use the Google Music apps on your phone too and have the music to play offline too.\n\nA: Google has iOS versions of most of their  apps.\nFor music, download the „Google Play Music“ in the App Store, and log in with your Google account.\n", "Q: Photo backup and management I have run out of space on my 16gb iPad . Over 7.2 go are my photos and video. Is it possible to separate my photos and keep most on iCloud or iTunes, accessing only when I wish to review them.  How can I do so if possible.  I need to free up space. Also, any quick way to delete duplicate photos or files?\n\nA: Mac or PC? It makes a difference.\nRecently on the PC my wife was having a similar problem. The phone will sync everything in the pictures folder. So I created a sub folder called iPhone and set the sync in iTunes to only sync with that folder and not the whole pictures folder. Now she just has to move the pics she wants on the phone to that folder.\nOn the Mac (going from memory here, so...) you can actually select which iPhoto albums you sync with the iPad. So instead of all photos/videos select only the albums you want/need on the iPad itself.\nMake sense?\n", "Q: Terminal/iTerm2 issue: reverse-i-search trims off command I've been having this issue since 10.9.\n\n\n*\n\n*cd into a reasonably long path, e.g., cd /Volumes/Storage/backup/long/path\n\n*Enter a moderately long command, e.g., curl -X GET http://localhost:8888\n\n*ctrl+R, type curl\n\n*ctrl+E\nThe command displayed is shifted to far to the left and leaving whitespace to the right like so:\n\nIs this a known bug or is it just me?\n\nA: It's your $PS1 - it's not properly escaped. You have to escape all non-printing characters with \\[ and \\]. For example, if you have\nPS1='\\e[32m\\u \\W\\e[0m $ '\n\nyou have to change it to\nPS1='\\[\\e[32m\\]\\u \\W\\[\\e[0m\\] $ '\n\nor your cursor will appear far to the right because your shell thinks your prompt is that long, and when it retypes the command it can't find it. Annoying, I know. In zsh you need to use %{ and %} IIRC.\nAnd while you're considering switching to another shell, I'd suggest fish. It's a bit more of a jump, but it keeps me sane.\n\nA: The unfortunate answer is: it's just you.\nMy bash is:\nbash-3.2$ bash --version\nGNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin14)\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n\nAnd iTerm2 is the latest release and it behaves as expected: Ctrl-E during a reverse history search puts me at the end of the line, on character after the last character in the selected line.\nIt might be something in your bash configuration that's causing the problem. You can move aside your ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc` files and try Ctrl-R and Ctrl-E and see if things behave better. If they do, replace your customizations one at a time and see if you can spot the culprit.\n\nA: Changing the export TERM=\"xterm-color\" to export TERM=\"xterm\" in my .bash_profile fixed the issue for me.\n", "Q: How to cycle through recently *used* tabs in Safari?

I have a Fujitsu S1300, and a MacBook Pro 15″ with Yosemite.\nMy patience is running thin. I can scan using Fujitsu's software. But I can't using Preview. \nBut when I look at Preview > File > Import from Scanner, it's greyed out. \nI've done all the things listed here. \nAnd... there is paper in the loader. I'm connected directly to usb (no hub). \nPS: I was inspired to use preview to scan from this article. \n\nA: You can only scan into Preview and other applications which use Apple's standard scanning architecture (such as Image Capture) if the scanner is provided with an ICA scan driver. Fujitsu do not supply ICA drivers for the ScanSnap scanners (at least as far as I know) and therefore the ScanSnap scanners will not work with preview or Image Capture etc. Fujitsu supply their own scanning drivers which other applications have to support directly, and some do (such as Mariner Software's Paperless).\n\nA: If you can print using the printer, please keep reading.\nThe application that shows up when you print can scan. You can find this option hidden in the menu bar.\n(If you don't know what application, it is the one with the same name/icon as your printer)\n", "Q: Best config for day time Windows user + occasional Mac usage I bought a 2015 Macbook Pro 15\" retina, 16GB memory 1TB SSD. I use Visual studio on day time on windows 8 and work on Mac, open source technologies at night and on weekends. I first thought of using VMWare and load windows for my day time use but i am  a little confused on which config i should do.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am thinking of using bootcamp since all i do is windows during day time(may be dedicate 250GB ?) \n\n*dedicate 500GB for Mac OS .\n\n*Dedicate 200 GB for VMware on MacOS to load windows for some rare scenarios where i need to test both windows and mac apps at the same time (like Xamarin)\nIs this a bad idea to config my laptop like this or do you guys have any ideas that you can share for this scenario ?\nUpdate:\nI just noticed another option of loading bootcamp volume in my Vmware Fusion 7. Can i use this option instead of item 3 for doing multi OS programming ?\n\nA: Firstly, I would think about how much you want to share between the two. What documents are you going to be messing with on both sides. If it's a significant amount you might want to consider a third partition for documents, and then setup a partition each for the OSs to boot from.\nGiven the time spent in each you probably want full performance from each OS, which means bootcamp for Windows.\nGiven the documents requirement above, partition out into Windows, OS X, and the options documents partition, and run each OS directly.\nI'd then use the VMWare Bootcamp option as a fall-back in case you want to run something from the Windows side temporarily, but I wouldn't do it full time. Nice option to have though.\n\nA: Your layout sounds reasonable. I can't answer this fully for you, but what I'd suggest is setting up both a Boot Camp and VM (or the Boot Camp as a VM disk), trying both ways out for a while, and see what works best for you. Some of this is personal taste and you may just have to find out for yourself.\nI have a similar setup: Retina MacBook Pro; Mac for personal use, Windows during the day for software development work. Been doing VMs a few years and tried the Boot Camp, both regular dual boot and with VMware 7's running a Boot Camp partition as a VM. They all worked okay.\nFor me, the deal-breaker was trackpad ergonomics under Boot Camp. When running just Windows, the trackpad response felt skittish and hard to work with, and Apple's Boot Camp driver doesn't give you much configurability. I never got used to it, and that sent me back to running VMs full time, because then you have OS X's trackpad ballistics controlling things. This is a matter of personal taste, so you'll want to try it out yourself.\nTwo other big things to consider are whether you will want a) resizability of your VM's drives, or b) drive snapshotting. You can't do either with Boot Camp, and I've found they come in very handy, especially if you're doing software development.\n", "Q: iPad 3 app won't transfer an app to new iPad Air 2 I plugged iPad 3 and iPad Air 2 into laptop through iTunes.

I want to mirror the screen of an iOS device to a a Windows PC. I only found solutions which either use a VGA-adapter or AirPlay. Because AirPlay uses WiFi I seek for a more stable and independent solution. I stumbled on iTools but it seems it isn't developed anymore. It used a USB connection for showing the screen.\nThe only things which would suit my needs are either using a VGA/HDMI-adapter or using iOS 8 with Ad-Hoc WiFi and AirPlay. But then I would adapters for Lightning and Dock-Connector. On the other side it won't work for iOS 7 if I use the AirPlay method.\nSo is there any software which can mirror the screen via USB onto a Windows PC?\n\nA: If you are using a Mac you can try Quicktime Player. Start a new video recording, and select the connected iPhone as your video source and audio source.\n\nA: The HDMI or VGA adapter that can be purchased from Apple allows mirroring to an external monitor, projector or other display that allows video IN.  Does your PC allow video in via HDMI?  (I'm not aware of any that do, most are video OUT)  There is a 3rd party application called Duet that allows your iOS device to be used as an external or second monitor via USB but I think that is the opposite of what you are trying to accomplish based on your question.  The screenshot shows Duet for Mac but there is a PC version as well.\nFrom the Apple documentation regarding cable:\n\nUse the Lightning to VGA Adapter with your iPad with Retina display, iPad mini, iPhone 5, and iPod touch (5th generation) with Lightning connector. The Lightning to VGA Adapter supports mirroring of what is displayed on your device screen including apps, presentations, websites, slideshows, and more — to your VGA-equipped TV, display, projector or other compatible display in up to 1080p HD.\n  It also outputs video content - movies, TV shows, captured video- to your big screen in up to 1080p HD. Simply attach your Lightning to VGA Adapter to the Lightning connector on your device and then to your TV or projector via a VGA cable (sold separately).\n\nApple Store Link\nDuet:\n\nUPDATE:  This may or may not be useful, but this article mentions a method that may suit your needs.  From the article:\n\nApowersoft Phone Manager\n  It is completely compatible with iOS and Android operation system.

I have a macbook pro mid 2012 non retina facetime hd camera. It is advertised as having a facetime hd camera however the frame rate seems to be very low (14.5 fps). Is this normal?\n\nA: The hardware is capable of 30fps, I have this model (MacBookPro9,1, i7 2.3 GHz) on my desk in front of me and just shot a movie that lists as 29.81fps at 720p.\nHowever, Apple will, in software, reduce the frame rate if your HDD/SSD/other storage and/or processor and memory are not capable of handling the maximum frame rate at the time of capture. The do this to ensure you can still use the camera even in non-optimal conditions.\nHow much free space (percentage) do you have on your storage? Are you running any processor intensive applications. How much RAM do you have? These factors can have a serious impact on capture rates.\nIt is also entirely possible that the frame rate is being affected by other factors if you are using a 3rd party application such as Skype.\nHope this helps?\n", "Q: How to check my MBP's logic board properties? A few days ago, my MBP had a lot of issues like multiple beeping sounds as well as black screen anomalies. The beeping issue goes away when I force a shutdown.\nWhen I took it in for repair, they reported that there was an issue with the logic board and RAM. They replaced the logic board and the MBP was working fine. \nHow do I check the properties of the logic board, when it was manufactured and its condition. Again, I trust Apple support, but I just wanted to convince myself. \nIs there any way to check the properties of the MBP hardware?\n\nA: The only way to truly know if something is wrong with any replacement part installed by Apple is based on symptoms of the computer and symptoms alone. Apple does have diagnostic tests they run on each computer that is repaired. That is just a stop gap to find a bad part on the way out the door. Diagnostics will never catch every problem. In other words, if the computer is not exhibiting the symptoms you brought the computer in for to begin with,  the computer (and its logic board ) are fine. \nYou can always run the Apple Hardware Test to check for yourself.\n", "Q: Is there better third-party scanner software for OS X than Preview? I'm not overly happy with the UI for interfacing with the scanner on my Epson WF-3250 series scanner that's provided by the latest Preview that comes with OS X 10.10. It's clunky and awkward, crashes often. You have to reselect your options every time you use. \nIt's just, honestly, not very Apple-like.\nIs there reliable third party scanning software that I could use in place of Preview for obtaining PDF scans of multi-page documents on the Epson's auto-feeder?\nEdit: With OS X 10.9, Epson stopped shipping its own scanner utility. The ship a driver and instructions to use Preview for acquiring images on OS X.\n\nA: PDFScanner from the app store is awesome. Very fast. Simple. Achieves small file sizes.\n\nA: You might try Paperless.  It retains the options across scans, and can do multi-page etc.\n(And, relevant to the ADF):\n\n\n*\n\n*Paperless will display the Image Capture dialog.\n\n*If the ADF is supported by Image Capture, the dialog will display Feeder as an\noption to acquire with.\n\n*Choosing Scan will cause all pages in the ADF to be scanned.\n\n*All scan jobs (multipage documents) scanned before\nchoosing Done will be imported into Paperless as separate multipage\ndocuments.\n\n\nSource\n\nA: You may also want to look into the excellent VueScan.

If you delete a file, but it's still in use (e.g. a document still open), and then try to empty the trash you get something like this:\n\nAs best I can tell the three options do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Skip: ignore this file and keep trashing the rest\n\n*Stop: stop trashing files\n\n*Continue: ignore this file and keep trashing the rest\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, Skip and Continue do exactly the same thing. I've tested this by deleting a few files, and using either option they seem to trash all the other files.\nBut it seems weird that Apple would supply two buttons which do exactly the same thing.\nSo does anyone know of any technical difference in the behaviours of the Skip vs Continue buttons?\nI'm using 10.10.3 Yosemite, but I believe the options have been like this for a few major versions.\n\nA: I couldn't find any documented proof but still, here is my answer.\nWhen you first hit above shown error, it means you can\n\n\n*\n\n*Skip i.e. don't try to trash mentioned file and continue trashing the rest\n\n*Stop i.e. stop trashing for now\n\n*Continue i.e. you have closed mentioned file (it's not in use anymore) and OSX can continue trashing it\nIf you just click continue or fail to close the open file, OSX skips them and hence the confusion.\nMost of the in-use files I have seen are plists which needs to be unloaded before deleting\nExtra info after some experiment:\nAbove said is mostly true in situations when trash contains plists or in general you trashed some app\nFor example:\nIf you create a text file → Open it → Trash it while the file is still open → Try empty Trash → No problem i.e. Trash empty without any error and file still open\nBut If  you start some app (like MAMP in my experiment) → Launch it & start services → Trash the app → Try empty trash → You will get the above said error → Open activity monitor → Kill all related services & hit continue → Trash empty\n\n", "Q: Apple script to toggle comment/uncomment in Script Editor?

Several days ago, I installed the text editor TextMate 2. I notice that the icons of my .h and .m files which were created in Xcode have been changed to the new one. Like the screenshot below which shows the new icons (i.e. AppDelegate.h) and default icons (ViewController.h) at the same time. I am not sure it is the TextMate that caused this issue because if I right-click -> get info on the new icon, it stills display the default one. My question is how to restore the file's icon to their default looking? Thanks.\n\n\nA: What you are seeing are QuickLook preview thumbnails: if you look closely at your screenshot, you will notice each “icon” shows the start of the file’s content. You are correct this is due to you installing TextMate 2, which provides a powerful QuickLook extension for source code files (try selecting one of the files in Finder and hitting space). The original file icon is unchanged by this, hence the fact it appears in “Get Info”. \nAs to the fact some files still display the original file icon: in my observation, there seems to be a bug in Yosemite’s Finder’s way of handling QuickLook thumbnail generation – some files will be missed at times.\nIf you want to disable TextMate’s QuickLook plug-in, this answer should help.\n", "Q: How can i get the mac family number using terminal?

At the moment I have around 10 GB (!!) of mail database locally. Is there a way to use iMail so that it does not cache anything? It would then basically only work if there is any internet connection.\n\nA: AFAIK, there is no real possibility to disable the caching on mail. \nWhat you could do is: reduce the IMAP folder size directly in Gmail :\n\nSettings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > Folder Size Limits > Limit IMAP\n  folders to contain no more than this many messages = 1000\n\n", "Q: Cannot open PDF in iBooks on Mac on MacI sync my PDF files normally between my Mac and my iPhone and iPad. Bookmarks and resume options are working between iOS devices for epubs. However, no PDF can be opened in iBooks on Mac — it gets opened in Preview.app instead and bookmarks and resume aren’t working (while they still do work between iOS devices).\nIs there a way to read PDF in iBooks on Mac? Or at least enable the bookmarks and resume for it on Mac?\n\nA: Considering Preview.app to be mediocre as a PDF viewer (and that's a compliment for it), you might use Adobe Reader on the Mac; this should maintain the annotations (not tested, however).\n", "Q: How to transfer photo sent as SMS to Photos/iPhoto.app Somebody sent me six images with SMS to my iPhone. I want to email these and get them on my Mac to use there. Short of copying them one by one into an email on my iPhone is there any way I can transfer these into Photos so that iPhoto will import them to my Mac?\n\nA: If you visit the conversation in your iPhone/iPad in Messages, click on the 'Details' button in the upper right hand corner, scroll down to attachments, then press and hold one of the photos you'd like to transfer. Select \"More\" from the menu that appears.\nYou should then see Apple's 'Select' arrows appear in the bottom of each attachment. From there, select your photos, and share them however you'd like (email all 6 or save them to your photo app).\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Another way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tip on each foto and save it to your Pictures Gallery.\n\n*Open the Photos App, select them and send them by email.\n\n*Delete the photos afterwards.\n\n", "Q: Create a live USB for Linux Derivation I want to create a live USB to run a Linux derivation and followed these guides: \nMake and create Live USB Linux for Mac? How?\nMaking a Bootable USB Stick on an Apple Mac OS X from an ISO\nEverything just went fine following the tutorial, but when I restart my MacBook Pro I cannot choose the USB drive, it just doesn't show up.\n\nA: I looked at the second guide and the actual process is much simpler than the method suggested there.\nDo the following, it works.\nGo to Disk Utility, click on your USB drive on the left pane and click on the Info button at the top. Make a note of the Disk Identifier (Disk0, Disk1 etc.). Then, unmount any mounted partitions on your USB drive, but don't eject the drive itself.\nIn Terminal type the following, without pressing Enter afterwards...\nsudo dd bs=1m if=\n\nThen, drag your .ISO file to the Terminal window so its path is entered quickly and easily.\nAdd the following line onto the end of the command line, altering the number  at the end if your USB stick's Disk Identifier is other than Disk1\nof=/dev/rdisk1\n\nYou should end up with a command like this...\nsudo dd bs=1m if=/Users/s.darkly/Desktop/Linux/crunchbang-11-20130506-amd64.iso of=/dev/rdisk1\n\nHit enter, put your password in and wait for the magic to happen. It will take a few minutes and there won't be a progress bar so be patient. \n\nA: To boot from an non-UEFI Linux Distro on a USB drive on a Intel based Mac you need to use a boot manager like rEFInd as it can chain load what's necessary to boot the non-UEFI Linux Distro.\nAs an example, I have no problem booting from USB Linux Mint 17.1 (Cinnamon) 64-bit natively without a third-party boot manager.  The Xiaopan is not UEFI.\nCompare the image below with the contents of the Xiaopan ISO Image, in particular the expanded folders showing *EFI.\n\n", "Q: Microphone / Headphones combo port does not work in BootCamp I have an iMac (27-inch, Late 2013) that has a 4-pole TRRS headphone/headset combo port. \nOn OS X any  headset works nicely (e.g. the Apple iPhone headset with microphone). \nOn Windows 7 64bit with BootCamp 5.1, \nthe same headset on the same combo port does not work with the driver as delivered by Apple with BootCamp 5.1 (more precise: 5.1.5640 ).\nApple phone support just told me it is not their problem, \nbecause it works on OS X.\nSo I tried installing a better driver on my own.\nAccording to the Windows Device Manager, \nmy sound card is a Cirrus Logic CS4206B (AB 07). \nThe closest match I could find on the Cirrus homepage was this one:\nhttp://www.cirrus.com/en/products/cs4207.html\n(Go to Resources -> Tools and Software).  \nThe same page is also linked in this related thread, \nincluding a step-by-step installation guide, \nbut it doesn't work for me. \nDid someone get a 4-pole headset to work including the microphone on an iMac with the Cirrus Logic CS4206B (AB 07) sound card?\n\nA: Not sure if people are still having a problem with this as it's been almost a year, but I was running into this problem with my Mac mini 2014 with Windows 10 Home and Bootcamp v6.0.\n  The sound card is Cirrus Logic CS4208 (AB 108), and I couldn't get Windows to recognize the mic on my headset which was designed for iPhone/Apple usage.\nAfter not being able to find the driver for the CS4208 (AB 108) at a legitimate site on the net (results almost always required a 3rd party driver downloader - no thanks!), I went to Cirrus Logic's website and tried to search for another driver.  I was able to find CS4207 from their website, downloaded the zip file, and tried to update the CS4208 driver with files on this zip.  The driver was taken, and, after a restart, the microphone now showed up (even though it was still showing CS4208 AB 108).  It works!\nI even rolled back the driver and updated again to confirm it works, and it sure does!  I also have another 2016 MBP that I would like to test.  Will update here after.\nHere's a few screenshots before the driver update to CS4207:\n\nAnd after updating the drivers and restart:\n\n\nA: This worked for me. It was a Windows privacy issue:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZssiZtyKaNk\nYou can test by recording your voice with the Voice Recorder Application. Give it permissions from Settings > Privacy Settings > Microphone. Also make sure Windows has permissions to use the microphone.\n\nA: If people are still having this issue in 2019 and have USB-C ports on their Mac, Apple's USB-C to 3.5mm adapter seems to fix this issue. While it doesn't work on macOS, it certainly allow you to use the microphone on Apple Earpods (and the in-line controls) and other headsets. The adapter is $9 in US and is mainly for iPad Pro 2018. I hope this helps, as it works perfectly for me!\nOr if you have an Xbox one controller with a 3.5mm jack (I'm not sure about ps4 controllers) you can use that as a USB sound card\n\nA: According to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6767136 this is currently not possible. If someone does get it to work I will happily award a bounty to an answer describing how to do it.\n\nA: It appears that Windows 10 running the latest Bootcamp does recognize the TRRS microphone now:\n\nHi there.  I've been monitoring and looking for a solution for this for sometime and it seems the latest version of bootcamp released today (Bootcamp 6.0) with Windows 10 fixes the problem.\nI had Windows 10 installed through bootcamp and updated to bootcamp 6 today (Aug 13).  Surprisingly, I plugged in my iPhone headset (which is TRRS) and noticed windows installing some drivers. ...\nHeadset is working just like it does in OSX now, awesome for VOIP or gaming. Very happy camper here!\nShould note that I am running Windows 10 with Bootcamp 6 on a late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro.\n\n", "Q: Disable ⌘Q for a specific application I know someone or the other has asked about disabling ⌘Q, but I like the shortcut, and I use it often.

Like a total noob, I neglected to remove the batteries.\nI recently reconfigured my workspace and decided to start using trackpad once more, but to my horror, the batteries had corroded and the one furthest in, is very very stuck.\nI have tried a long neck, thin screwdriver to try and pry away some of the corrosion around the edge, and lot of banging/ knocking/ cursing, but the battery is still in place.\nI welcome any suggestions on how I can remove the other battery and hopefully resurrect this trackpad into working order. I open to suggested chemicals/ power tools etc.\nMany thanks in advance community!\n\nA: So the gel containing battery acid has leaked out and dried up.\nYou need to make it muddy again to be able to remove it, since dry removal is not possible.\nThere are multiple methods to do that described here. (Vinegar, Lemon juice, and others).\nExample:\nMix water and baking soda into a thick paste. Start with about a teaspoon of baking soda and add water a few drops at a time until it can be mixed into a thick paste.\nApply the baking soda paste generously to any corroded areas using cotton swabs. Allow the paste to sit for 15 minutes.\nUse a slightly moistened toothbrush to gently agitate the paste. Rinse the toothbrush often, and continue until the majority of the paste has been scrubbed away. In hard to reach spaces use q-tip to deliver the paste.\nNeedless to say, use gloves!\n\nA: I tried the vinegar method for a while but with no success, using force just resulted in a bent sufface. Another theory I had is heating it so it would expand, but just ruined the plastic.\nSo I ended up drilling it out. I had to use a series of bits since the notch prevented a good grip and the material is very tough.\n\nI used a paperclip to make the connection.\n\nHardly noticeable :)\n\n\nA: I used a self-tapping screw (for sheet metal) to drill into the bottom of the stuck battery. Then I turned a long screw into the hole and pulled out the battery.\nOne advantage of this method is there is no banging or impact to the trackpad.\nOthers above have great methods for cleaning the compartment. The trackpad is good as new.\n\nA: I have had a similar problem. I have managed to extract the stuck batteries after flushing of the battery compartment with half a teaspoon of vinegar and tapping the trackpad. \n", "Q: How to accept Xcode license?

I used Filevault to encrypt an external USB 2TB drive. Last week, I used the drive as usual, entering a password to unlock it to use.\nUnfortunately, it didn't dismount properly. Since then I have not been able to use the drive: Disk Utility tried to repair it, but seems to have broken it even more, because now when I plug it in, Mac OS tells me that it can't recognise the drive, and prompts me to initialize / ignore / eject. Using terminal, the standard repair / verify commands I googled don't work. Please help?\n\nA: Before all, you need to be sure that the drive is 100% healthy at hardware level.\nThe first thing I would do is checking the S.M.A.R.T values on a computer running Windows, using a tool like HD Sentinel or equivalent. This will give you a good estimation about in which condition the drive is.\nYou should test the drive connected in an external USB or eSATA dock as the original drive enclosure may also have problems, like weak electrical contact or so.\nThen, I would low level clone the drive to another one.\nEven if its condition is 100% Ok according to the S.M.A.R.T. values.\nThis step can reveal a few defective sectors, which were not referenced yet by the S.M.A.R.T. monitoring.\nEven if your drive is 100% healthy, every serious data recovery professional will tell you than in a situation like the one you're encountering, we never work on the original drive, but always on a clone, especially when possibly dangerous commands like verify/repair ones are used.\nThe fact that your drive suggests that you should initialize it (-- don't to it ! --) if often an indicator or hardware issues, like corrupted firmware or damaged heads, requiring data recovery by a company that is specialized in data recovery (and not the first local computer shop you can find).\n", "Q: How to open a .zip file which is embedded in .xlsx file?

One of them (the 50 GB part) contains a bootcamp with Windows 8.1. I also have an external hard drive, which is 1 TB with both USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt connections. I partitioned this into to two parts also (500GB and 500GB). One of them is formated for Windows and the other is for Mac.\nSince I don't have too much space on the bootcamp internal hard drive (50 GB) I installed MSVC2013 on the external hard drive's Windows part. After the installation I learned that I didn't save too much space, but it worked and I had no problems with it. Since I didn't need it anymore I uninstalled it, but then for some reason I had to install it again. For some reason when MSVC2013 was uninstalled I changed the external hard drives Windows partitioned part's driver letter to a different one. When I tried to install MSVC2013 again it didn't let me, since it wanted to install it to the same place where it was before and I couldn't change the installation path, because it was grayed out. I read it in some forums that this is a \"normal\" behavior from MSVC2013 and to change the installation path you need to format the whole OS. Formating at that time was not an option for me, so I thought I create a small partition from the external hard drives Windows partition with the driver letter what MSVC2013 wants. I created the partition with Disk Managment in Windows and the installation was able to finish. MSVC2013 worked again.\nAfter all this I went back to the Mac part of my internal hard drive and I realized that now on the Mac side it doesn't recognize the Mac part of my external hard drive. In the Mac's Disk Utility it shows the part, but it is grayed out. So I went back to Windows to see if the Mac part of my external hard drive is recognized there and I learned that it is.

You will likely see that it's a Python-internal issue. Most likely a recursion or some exhaustive memory allocation. Python and other languages use a limited stack/heap to store runtime data (like the call stack). If that is exhausted they simply croak and do not ask the OSX to provide more memory.\n", "Q: Can I add a room number to an event's location? Suppose I have an event at a building of which the location can find the address so I get a nice travel time estimate. Problem is, the building contains an awful lot of rooms and I'd really like to add the room number to the location (as that shows up in my overview).\nSo how can I add the room number to the location without the automatic travel time estimates breaking?\n\nA: I guess you can't since Calendar always auto-completes to something without additional room/extra info. Alternatively put the room in the notes.\n", "Q: Migrating Bootcamp to new SSD I bought a Mac Pro (Late 2013) about a year ago. I recently ran out of space on the built-in 250gb SSD (Windows was the culprit of that), so I bought a 1tb ssd replacement from eBay. I just installed it today, and I want to move all of my data over to the new SSD.\nI've already got all of the Mac content copying over, as that is really easy, but I also want to put the Bootcamp partition back on the new SSD too. I created a 500GB partition for it, but I don't know how to move the bootable partition over there. I created a DMG from it in Disk Utility before I swapped out the SSDs, and I have that, but Disk Utility won't let me restore it to the new partition I created. It gives me an invalid argument error.\nHow can I migrate my bootcamp DMG to a partition on my new SSD without having to reinstall it completely?\n\nA: You'll need to create an image of the Boot Camp partition of the old SSD using Winclone and restore it to the new SSD.\n", "Q: Lightning Cable in Washing Machine I accidentally put a USB to Lightning cable in the washer and dryer.  The cable is mostly ok, but the plastic at the lightning end got a little warped.  Am I risking anything by trying to connect a device with it?  I'm reluctant to damage an iPhone, but at the same time, those cables aren't cheap.\n\nA: I would caution you to consider that all Lightning cables have small chips (basically a little computer inside them) to control charging as well as signaling. It's not as damaging as putting a phone through the wash, but depending on the age of the cable and if it's physically intact - water could easily compromise the electronics in the connector. Especially when it's warped by the heat of the dryer or otherwise compromised physically.\n\nWe have confirmed that the Lightning cable does have four chips embedded in it, plus some passive devices. Two of these chips are very simple (only a couple of transistors), and the third is an NXP NX20P3. However, the fourth and arguably most interesting of these is the TI chip.\n\nDetails of the chips are from http://www.chipworks.com/about-chipworks/overview/blog/inside-apple-lightning-cable\nOne trip on a new cable is probably low risk of damaging the phone if you use it, buy if the cable connector is cracked or that water damage causes corrosion, some time down the line that cable will fail. I'm sure it's designed to fail in a safe mode, but this isn't a situation where you have wires that can dry out harmlessly as you would expect if you had headphones that go through the wash or an older 30 pin cable design that was simply wire and plastic.\n\nA: The important part of the lightning connector is metal with a small plastic insert - as long as the plastic insert with the contacts is flush with the metal you should be fine to try it and it shouldn't damage the iPhone connector. Don't use it if it's not flush and smooth with the metal surface.\n\nA: If you let the connectors dry for a day over the heating you are save. \nIf a cable gets wet (and nothing else happens in a washing machine) it will soak with water (the detergent improves that). A wet cable may produce short circuits but not really in that kind of connector. It works at 5 Volt levels and that is much too weak to produce harm. So what you would eventually notice is that electronic communication over such a cable would not work. \nLuckily water can evaporate over time (faster with higher temperatures). So after a day over the heating latest it's ok. If after that it's still not working - buy a new one :-)\n", "Q: What is the best app for controlling the time of kids spend on iPad? My kids spend way more time on ipad. I want to limit the time each child spends on iPad on a daily basis. Any apps?

It does 4K, but only at 30Hz.\nIt does 60 Hz up to 2560x1440; anything above that is 30Hz.\nIs that a limitation of DVI?\n\nA: A single dual-link DVI connection can deliver up to 2560 × 1600 at 60 Hz. Achieving 4K at 60Hz requires two dual-link DVI cables, or DisplayPort 1.2 or HDMI 2.0.\nSo, yes, as you put it, that's a limitation of DVI.\n\nA: No, this is beyond DVI spec and I haven't been able to successfully force it.\nYou can, however, achieve 2K (2560x1440) @60Hz over a single dual-link DVI cable, and you can achieve 4K (3840x2160) @30Hz over a single dual-link DVI cable.\nI have successfully tested this on a Geforce GT 730 connected to an Asus MG28UQ 4K monitor with a DVI-to-HDMI adapter cable.\n\nA: My colleague Viktor Klimo has achieved 4K @30Hz with dual-link DVI out of an Nvidia GT 730. It's a great and affordable solution if you can live with 30Hz (30Hz for some reason looks better on some monitors than others, looks terrible on 4K televisions when I tried 30Hz via HDMI but looks okay on my Eizo EV3237).\nI did some experimenting with HDMI 4K@60Hz but it was a lot of trouble even with special adapters. For 4K@60Hz only DisplayPort works reliably. In the future with HDMI 2.2 the situation will improve.\n\nA: I have a Dell 3007wfp-hc monitor using DVI-D dual link 2560X1600 native and am on a ASRock z68 Extreme4 Gen3 / 32GB RAM/ i7 2600k oc to 4.4GHz. I have 2 X ASUS Strix GTX 980 SLI enabled with DSR selected. most of my games are running  3840X2400 at 60fps minimum and the few that dip below 60 fps don't go below 40.\nMy gaming platform is not supposed to be able to run 3840X2400. Obviously the reviewers are telling us something about a compelling need to upgrade to achieve a quality 4k gaming experience. What it is may not be the whole story since my experience on a 5 year old platform clearly are not exceptional beyond the fact that I am using factory OC video cards and have a modest OC on my Sandy Bridge. OS is windows 10.\n", "Q: Replace Recovery HD with a “bootable drive” formatted partition? A while ago, I had the idea to use the bootable Mac OS X USB drive-making procedure on a hard drive partition, so that I could basically have a version of the “Recovery HD” that doesn’t need to download Mac OS X every time. Then I realized that since I have that partition, I have absolutely no use for the original “Recovery HD.”\nI was wondering, is there a way to actually turn my new partition into the official “Recovery HD”? As in, invisible during normal computer use but boots when ⌘+R is held during startup?\n\nA: If you've installed Yosemite it will automatically have created an invisible recovery partition and so you may as well delete the recovery partition you created. Keeping a copy of the Yosemite installer on a USB stick is definitely a good idea though in case your drive ever dies or you need to perform a clean install (on an SSD for example).\nAlternatively, you can hide volumes/partitions using the Utilities>Visibility function in Onyx.\n", "Q: Network broadcast/multicast not sent by iPhone in personal hotspot mode Based on recent empirical findings, and based on various posts on the web, it seems that an application running on an iPhone with personal hotspot enabled cannot send broadcasts and/or multicasts out onto the personal hotspot's network.  Can anyone shed light on the cause of this problem?\nThe Application\nI have an IOS application, built with cross-platform C++ code, that broadcasts and multicasts its presence onto the network it is running on.  The application works flawlessly when the iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network.  In this case, other devices on the network receive the broadcasts/multicasts, and everything functions correctly.  This can be verified easily by connecting a computer running WireShark to the network -- the broadcast/multicast packets can be seen in the packet trace.\nNeedless to say, the application works well on an iPhone connected to a local Wi-Fi.\nThe Problem\nWhen I run the application on an iPhone that has its personal hotspot enabled, no broadcasts/multicasts are released onto the hotspot network.  This can be verified using WireShark, which shows no such packets in its trace.\nIs there any constraint regarding using a personal hotspot as a network router capable of handling broadcasts and multicasts?\nWhen I requested a web page on my \"WireSharking\" device using a browser, the personal hotspot responds correctly to all packets, returning the web contents.\nCollateral Information\nI have come across other Stack Overflow pasts that report the same, or similar, problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*TCP connection not working properly when using iPhone as hotspot\n\n*Fail to send ssdp broadcast by personal hotspot\nA good tutorial for writing such a broadcasting/multicasting application on iPhone is Michael Tyson's \"The Making of Talkie: Multi-interface broadcasting and multicast\".  Suffice it to say that my application conforms with all requirements (e.g., setting socket options SO_BROADCAST, SO_DONTROUTE, and IP_MULTICAST_IF where appropriate).\nA reply to reference (1) above writes \"Could it be because the personal hotspot introduces Network Address Translation?\".  I filtered the WireShark traces to show only packets connected to the hotspot IP, and there is no evidence of the personal hotspot sending anything to a NAT address.\nIn summary\nCan anyone explain why an iPhone running a personal hotspot does not broadcast/multicast packets, and how to solve the problem?\nMany thanks in advance.\nP.S.  I originally posted this query on Stack Overflow, and learned about this more Apple-oriented forum.\n\nA: Quick-and-dirty workaround\nI also ran into the same problem when developing an iPhone app that uses a UDP multicast message to discover devices on the network. Apparently the iPhone blocks multicast messages in personal hotspot mode.\nHowever, iPhone seems to use the 172.20.10.0/28 subnet for devices on the personal hotspot network. This means that there are just 16 possible addresses. Of these, 172.20.10.0 is apparently not used, 172.20.10.1 is the iPhone itself, and sending messages to 172.20.10.15 fails with a 'not permitted' error. This means that only the following 13 addresses can be used by clients:  172.20.10.2, 172.20.10.3, ..., 172.20.10.14.\nSo my work-around is pretty simple: instead of sending broadcast messages only to to 224.0.0.0, I also send them to all the other possible addresses in the subnet (172.20.10.2 - 172.20.10.14).\nOf course, to be future-proof in a production app you should probably check the list of network interfaces, check the IP and subnet, etc., but for my personal use this method is sufficient.\n", "Q: I have Installed Windows 7 on an external drive and I want to replace this drive with a larger capacity one. What should I do? I'm using a Mac Book Pro. I boot my Windows 7 from an external drive. As this drive is getting full, I want to replace it with a bigger one. What should I do to move the  Windows 7 from the one old to the new? \n\nA: Boot Camp officially only supports installation of Windows onto an internal drive, and isn't required for any installation of Windows onto a dedicated drive. BC's main function is to create a hybrid partition table that will allow both GPT (for Mac) and MBR (for Windows) to coexist on the same drive, and this is Winclone's speciality.\nHowever, if Windows has been installed on its own dedicated drive it will most likely be formatted as NTFS on an MBR partition table. This means you're not restricted to using Winclone and you should be able to use various Windows disk cloning utilities, including Acronis True Image (shipped free with Crucial SSDs, works well). Clonezilla is another package to try, it's open source and free, OS-independent and boots from USB.\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, WinClone is the only thing to use to move or copy Bootcamp partitions.  \n", "Q: Mac OSX Mail; how to delay 'Mark as Read' In OSX 10.10 Mail app a message gets read immediately when as soon as it is selected.\nOften this happens by accident; i.e. when organising folders, or it gets auto-selected when you delete/move another mail. Suffice to say this behaviour can disturb a workflow.\nFrom other mail clients I'm used you can give it a small offset (few seconds for example) before it is 'Mark as Read'. Does anyone know if OSX has such a setting?\n\nA: The Plugins MailHub and Mail Act-On have such options:\nMailHub\n\nMailHub is a 'smart' plug-in for Apple Mail that revolutionises email management. It learns as you work, suggesting likely filing locations to take the pain out of keeping your mail organized.

But this monitor has real 4k resolution of 4096 x 2160! \nCan i get this resoluton at 60Hz on my rMBP?\n\nA: I'm afraid not.\nFrom Everymac\n\n*This model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt and a single 1080p display at up to 60 Hz, 3840x2160 at 30 Hz, or 4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI.\n\nFrom Apple\n\nYou can use 4K displays and Ultra HD TVs at the following resolutions and refresh rates via the built-in HDMI port.\n  3840 x 2160 at 30 Hz refresh rate\n  4096 x 2160 at 24 Hz refresh rate (mirroring is not supported at this resolution)\n\n\nA: Hi I had the MAcbook pro late 2013 and it worked at 50Hz with my LG31MU97.  Upgraded now to latest Mid 2015 macbook pro and the rate is 60Hz.   For me the macbook screen is closed this might make a difference. I understand you need the very latest OSX\nThe only snag for me with the macbook screen closed was the need to restart the Macbook to get the 50Hz after sleep.

In System/Library/spotlight there are several files like \" Application.mdimporter \" which seems they appropriate searching for spotlight. Can I add any file like them? Is there any way to make files like them? Can I find files of this kind produced with developers?\n\nA: Yes, you can create your own Spotlight importers.\nYou can find Apple's documentation here.\nThe importers don't need to sit in /System/Library/Spotlight that is intended solely for importers that come with the operating system. What usually happens is an application developer will create an importer to support their file formats and include the importer within the application bundle. So, for example, the importers for Pages file formats sit within the Pages app bundle. But you can also drop importers in ~/Library/Spotlight within your own user profile and OSX will find them there.\n", "Q: Eclipse Fails To Launch Complaining of Incompatible Java VM I get the following error when trying to launch Eclipse, which I recently tried to install.\n\"Version 1.6.0_65 of the JVM is not suitable for this product.

Is it okay? Okay, so I have a speck candy shell grip on my phone, I have never dropped my phone before but yesterday I let my friend do something on it in the YMCA and he dropped it. It was only from no more than about two feet and it fell on the spongy-soft floor. I'm really paranoid something may have happened but there is no damage and it functions no differently. 100% perfect. Any way anyone can put my mind at ease?\n\nA: Your phone is fine. The Speck CandyShell cases offer excellent protection. In general, the iPhone often takes falls quite well with the particular exception of shattered screens if it falls onto concrete/rock. I dropped my previous iPhone 4S multiple times and it was still in great condition. One time it fell from about 3' onto concrete and survived with just some scratching and minor dings to the metal. \nAs a side note, my personal opinion is that the Speck CandyShell (while they last) is not at all far off from the Otterbox Defender that many people have: so you phone was well protected.

I am mostly concerned about the mackeeper icon since I have heard very bad things about it. What is going on?? This didn't happen to me (also on a mac). How do I fix this without any kind of damage?\n\nA: So the torrent file had extras, and your friend installed them.\nVideos are, in general, just data files and thus safe to open. If the download included an installer package, program (perhaps disguised as a video) or script, and you run it, it can do many things.\nAsk your friend if she was asked for her password at any point in the process. Videos will never, ever ask for your password. If she said yes, and typed it in, she just allowed the download to install anything it wants. This is a trojan, not a virus, and like the horse the Greeks gave to the Trojans it bypasses almost all of the system security.\nYour friend needs to stop using her computer. Right now. From a different computer, she needs to change all of her passwords. Email, online banking, Apple ID, Google Drive, dropbox - anywhere she has ever accessed from that machine. That needs to happen immediately after turning the computer off.\nNext, you get to reformat the computer's drive and reinstall everything from the original media. Do NOT use the migration assistant or restore from a backup - it's very easy to install something in the user's library that will persist through a restore process. And copy files one by one, only if you recognize them. Copying folders will also copy hidden files, and we don't want any of those.\nWill this take a long time? Yes, it will.

But I love Safari because it syncs with all my other devices.\nI tried to search for extensions that do this, but was unable to find any.\nNote: Pinned Tabs (or App Tabs) offer several functionalities:\n\n\n*\n\n*they allow you to select tabs that should always be loaded when Firefox starts\n\n*these tabs are minimally represented in the tab bar\n\n*these tabs stick to the domain, e.g. eternal links are opened in new tabs by default\n\n*these tabs are difficult to close (e.g. [cmd]+W is ignored)\n\n\nSee this screenshot (gmail and twitter are pinned), or the documentation\n\n\nA: The only way you can really emulate this is if you create a Safari Extension for each website which you can put whatever picture you want for the buttons background.

It started wit the 10.10.3 update. Before that they worked fine. I have cards from different brands and sizes. The problem is with the MacOS X update having a bug. Older computers that do not have the 10.10.3 update do not have the problem.\n\nA: What worked for me is putting my SD card into a camera (canon 60d) and using its format utility.

Profile Manager has an option to add the Documents folder but not Downloads. I figured I'd add it in the Dock Items, but so far it isn't working.\nIn Dock Items, I've tried:\n~/Downloads\nDownloads\n/Network/Servers/<fully qualified servername>/Users/%short_name%/Downloads\n\nThe last configuration shows a proper folder on the client dock but it has a permission denied icon present and it clearly is not pointing to the right place. \nI'm considering another approach which would involve allowing the dock items of the user to merge with those provided by Profile Manager as this keeps the Downloads on the dock. This approach would require me to create a dock template that is used when I create the users' accounts.

How do I assign a keyboard shortcut to an AppleScript? I found a script for automatically going back to the inbox in Office 2011. \n\nA: \nNote: In macOS Mojave it was renamed from \"Service\" to \"Quick Action\" in Automator.\n\n\n*\n\n*cmd + space and type \"automator\"\n\n*Select: File > New\n\n*Select \"Quick Actions\"\n\n*Search in the top of the left section for \"applescript\" or \"shellscript\" or \"javascript\"\n\n*Drag desired action to right side workflow\n\n*File > Save with desired name\n\n\nTo add keystroke to your workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Select Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*Select Services on left\n\n*Find newly created service and double-click on \"none\" to add keyboard shortcut\n\n\nA: In summary you will need to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator to create a service that runs an Apple Script\n\n*System Preferences to assign a keyboard shortcut to the service\n\n\nBelow are the steps involved for each. \n1. Create a service using Automator\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)\n\n*Go to File > New\n\n*Select Service and click Choose\n\n*In the top right hand of the window that appears, ensure that \"No input\" is selected from the Service receives drop-down list\n\n*Ensure the In drop-down list is showing \"Any application\"\n\n*In the second column containing the long list, find \"Run AppleScript\" and double-click on it\n\n*This will add the Run AppleScript window on the right\n\n*Now, replace the (* Your script goes here *) with the script you want \n\n*Save the service using a meaningful name (e.g. GoToInbox).\n\n\nNow to the next step.\n2. Creating your shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*Select Services from the sidebar\n\n*Find your service (it'll be in the list on the right-hand side)\n\n*Add a shortcut by double clicking on the service name\n\n*Now go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy\n\n*Select Accessibility in the sidebar\n\n*Click on the + sign (you may need to unlock the padlock if it's locked)\n\n*Add Automator.\n\n*Add Finder (to find this you will need to navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app).\n\n*Exit your System Preferences.\n\n\nNow you should be able to do two things:\n1. Run the service from any application by going to the Services list within any Application menu (e.g. Finder > Services, Safari > Services, TextEdit > Services, etc) and select the service you just created. \n2. Use the keyboard shortcut to run the service.\nNOTE: I am aware that for some users keyboard shortcuts do not seem to work even though they've been assigned to a service. This is a whole other topic, but if this happens in your case, at least you can run the service from within any application you're using.\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: Just to reiterate a very important point first noted in the post by @MegaCookie:\nWhen creating a script that emulates mouse or keyboard activity, you must add not only Automator, but also each and every app in which you wish to use your script to the System Preferences > Security > Privacy > Accessibility application list.\nThis is counterintuitive as you don't actually want those apps to control the computer, but this is what Apple requires.  Otherwise, you will receive a popup like this (it will vary depending on what you're trying to do):\n\nThe action \"Run AppleScript\" encountered an error: \"System Events got an error: com.automator.runner.xpc is not allowed to send keystrokes.\"\n\nClicking Show Workflow in the popup just opens up a Finder window to the location of the script.  OK closes the popup.\nThis may not have always been necessary but I found it necessary in macOS 10.15 (Catalina).\nAs an example for when you'd need this, I created a script to emulate pasting the clipboard by simply \"typing\" the contents of the clipboard into an application that does not accept paste operations.\nIn my case, this is the remote console provided by VMware's vCenter when looking at VMs on ESXi hosts.  I needed to add the browser being used to view vCenter, which in my case is Chrome.  Definitely a security risk, IMHO.\n\nA: You cannot assign keyboard shortcuts to AppleScripts out of the box. However, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a launcher that supports setting global hot keys and executing AppleScripts (Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, FastScripts - whatever takes your fancy), or\n\n*put the script into a Run AppleScript action inside an Automator service. Note it has to be a service, not an application or an ordinary workflow: services can be assigned hotkeys in the System Preferences keyboard settings.\n\n\nA: It is also possible without paid 3rd party apps!\n1. Open Automator.\n2. Make a new Quick Action.\n3. Make sure it receives 'no input' at all programs.\n4. Select Run Apple Script and type in your code.\n5. Save!\nNow go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts. Select Services from the sidebar and find your service. Add a shortcut by double clicking (none).\nFinally go to System Preferences > Security > Privacy > Accessibility and add Automator and the preferred app to run the shortcut.\n\nA: I used BetterTouchTool which also works fast. It's also paid but it is popular.\n\nA: You can go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> add a new shortcut. You can then select your script.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH18418?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Can iTunes be made to play Apple ProRes files? My videos encoded as Apple ProRes are playable in Quicktime but not in iTunes.

I have a mid 2010 Macbook Pro running Yosemite that I foolishly did a reset on while it was connected to an external monitor that was designated as default in settings And connected to a USB keyboard and mouse. Now I have the white screen of death on startup.\nI have tried all keyboard combos to try to boot into safe mode, single user, reset PRAM, etc and none work. Yes, I know, I mucked up.\nMy question is; I have a working windows based desktop and is there any way for me to create a bootable image on an external drive (either USB or an external HD) so that I can at least get into some type of diagnostic on the MBP?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Have you tried Command+R when booting to access your recovery partition (if Yosemite created one during installation)? That would be your easy get-out-of-jail-free card.\nOtherwise you're looking at seeking the help of some kindly Mac owner who has disc images of the original install discs (or a retail Snow Leopard disc). If you put some contact details in your profile I have a friend who may be able to point you in the right direction. Once you have a disc image you can burn a disc off with any Windows disc-authoring software supporting .ISO files, which is pretty much most of them.\n", "Q: Early 2011 MacBook Pro SMC firmware update question OS has been upgraded to Mavericks.

I've put the old HDD in a case in the superdrive place and tried to install 10.10 but the install failed. \nI then tried with th SSD in an USB case, managed to install & boot 10.10. Then I put the SSD back in the Mac and got the stop sign at boot. \nAt first I thought it was the Firevault on the HDD which was causing the issue but even after turning it off, the mac didn't want to boot...\nWhich brings me 2 questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does it boot when plugged in an USB case and not from inside?\n\n*How can I fix this thing?\n\n\nA: To solve the problems we have to place the HDD on the original place. Then we place the SSD to the SuperDrive place. \nJust install Yosemite as usual and everything is working now.\n\nA: I'm not sure about the former question without getting hands-on but here's a fix...\nMy usual advice - boot your Mac and download the 10.10 installer from Apple. Do not run the installer, cancel it. Next, build a USB installer from the 10.10 installer so you can perform a completely clean install. Take an 8GB USB stick and (very important) name it Untitled. Then run this command in Terminal...\nsudo /Applications/\"Install OS X Yosemite.app\"/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/\"Install OS X Yosemite.app\" --nointeraction\n\nIt will take a few minutes to process so be patient.\nWhen that's done, shut your Mac down and fit the SSD in its desired location. Then, start your Mac and hold the Option key to bring up the boot selector. Select the USB installer and proceed.\nOnce the installer has booted you can wipe the SSD using Disk Utility, partitioning it as GPT (in the Partition tab options) and format as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Then let the installer do its thing and you should now have a properly bootable internal SSD. When that's done you will be given the option to migrate your data from the old drive, if that's what you want to do.\n", "Q: Extension to hide Safari toolbar I used to have an extension that hided the toolbar completely (which I installed from a website, outside the extensions market) giving a minimalist look, but it suddenly got removed from my Safari for some reason, and I can't find it back in Google.\nLuckily I had a screenshot of the extension running:\n\nDoes anyone knows how was this extension called, and probably why it got removed without any notice?\n\nA: You can just select View -> Hide Toolbar in Safari... no extension required\n", "Q: Reinstall OS X (Yosemite) without Internet Connection I have got very slow internet connection.

In the second scenario I need to send and receive with both devices.\nIs this possible with a single headset?\n\nA: I know there are some Bluetooth headphones (such as these ones that I can talk about from personal experience) that come with an optional audio cable, enabling them to be used as a standard pair of wired headphones in case the pairing malfunctions or something. It has the really awesome side effect of enabling the headphones to play two streams of audio at once: Pair them with one device wirelessly and plug them into another.\nI know, it's not a perfect solution, but it's the best one I've seen so far.\n\nA: I have the Jabra REVO Wireless headphones and they are able to connect to 2 devices at the same time allowing for what you are looking to do.\nhttp://www.jabra.com/Products/Bluetooth/JABRA_REVO_Wireless/Jabra_REVO_WIRELESS\nThey don't really say it anywhere on their support documentation but this review on Amazon explains it pretty well (look for Multipoint section): \nhttp://www.amazon.com/review/R2PTODOLO53PFW/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFO14W8\nI've had them for a few months and they are great!\n", "Q: iPhone 5s camera takes random size photos My iPhone 5s camera takes random size photos. Sometimes they are large and at other times they are postage size images.  Any answers ?\n\nA: Here is a logical explanation for the problem and although, I can't guarantee, in this case it is the problem, I think there is a high probability. \nWhen you select to email a photo, after you tap send, you are prompted with sizing (compression) options like this:\n\nYou can choose one of the options and as most things in life, everything has a trade off. If you select anything but \"Actual Size\", it will compress your photo, and the size it then comes in at will be smaller than what you would have expected. \"Actual Size\" is massive on all but the older iPhones. Full size it big, but likely will fit on a monitor, and the \"Medium\" and \"Small\" sizes are just like you described. \nThis is not \"lossless\" compression like you see sometimes and does what it needs to with the image to reduce the actual file size.\nFor transferring images to your computer, AirDrop is the easiest way but only works if you have a Mac. If you use a PC, you could consider using iCloud for Windows to download Photostream images (which should be quite high resolution, if not natural size), or there is always the old faithful Image Capture\n", "Q: EarPods sound problems I have a pair of earpods and when I connect them to my MacBook the sounds is more bass-y that it should.. The fun fact is that if I don't plug the mini jack completely into the port the sound is 'as it should be'! But when I put the plug correctly for 1 second the sound is ok an then it turns to very bass-y again... I presume that something is wrong with configuration or something?! When I plug it into my iphone is the same effect.. Anybody knows what's the problem??\n\nA: Sounds like you have bad EarPods. Take them back to the store where you purchased them if they are new.\n\nA: I went to the apple store and they told me that the EarPods are lowering the volume because they have some sound-protection-thingy.... I find it very annoying though. Also I found this link from Apple and I presume that using the EarPods with my laptop is not really an option as I can not adjust the bass... also really annoying...\n", "Q: Showing Macbook screen on a larger monitor When I connect the Macbook to a TV monitor it does not duplicate my screen.  It shows the Yosemite screen.  It doesn't change as I open different files.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Displays and turn on Mirroring. This will duplicate the main window onto the TV monitor.\nYou can alternatively decide to put the Menu Bar at the top of the TV monitor instead of the MacBook, or choose to put the menu bar at the top of both screens. These preferences are found in the Displays Preference Pane.\nBy default, the split screen puts the secondary display (the TV monitor) to the right or left of the main (MacBook) screen.

I am trying to get into the Volumes directory. \nHidden files are being shown. \nHowever, the Volumes folder won't let me access it, it's \"greyed out\". How can I bypass this?\n\nA: We need more specifics about what is going wrong. Do you have admin privileges on your computer?\nHave you tried ⌘-⇧-G from the Finder and then typed /Volumes in that window?\n\nYou can also open a Terminal window, type cd /Volumes and then if that works type open . (a period).\nIf none of those work, then you need to set up that account with privileges to access root folders, but I think it should at least ask you to authorize when you try Go to Folder...\n\nEdit: Just a guess, but from the Finder, click on the Home icon to get to your user menu. Then go to the View menu > Show View Options (or press Command-J). At the bottom, click to show Library folder. (If you don't see this option, you probably have the wrong folder selected.)\n", "Q: How to calculate the amount of space that iCloud Photo Library would take up? I recently got the OS X 10.10.3 update, which got me Photos for OS X and the opportunity to use iCloud Photo Library. However, I'm a little worried about maxing out my iCloud storage if I upload every photo on every device I own, since I currently only have the free 5GB and I'm already cutting it kind of close.\nI was wondering, is there a way to figure out how much iCloud storage my combined photo libraries (MBP, iPhone, and iPad) would eat up before turning on iCloud Photo Library and learning the hard way?\n\nA: Yes. You can start Photos app and turn off iCloud backed storage. \n\nYou can see that the Photos Library is not my System Photo Library\nThen you can import all the photos you want locally and observe how much space it takes. I'm using DaisyDisk, but Finder can show you folder size as well. I have a small system library that I'm using to test out the cloud side of things (15k photos) while I do the heavy lifting on non-system Photo libraries.\nOnce I'm happy with how albums and such work, I'll probably unify everything so that it fits within 200 GB of space that I'm budgeting for within iCloud.\n", "Q: All my iMessages were deleted My iPod Touch ran out of battery and died for a short time. When I plugged it back in and it turned back on, all of my conversations on iMessage had been deleted. I still have the contacts but all of my texts and messages were gone. Why did this happen and is there any way to get my messages back?\n\nA: Reboot your phone.\nI discovered a solution for this one accidentally, after I encountered this bug a couple of days ago. I turned my phone off for a time, and then back on again - when it was turned back on, the list of messages was fully restored. I think that this might be because only the listing of messages was made inaccessible, and the messages themselves weren't deleted - I noticed that when I was texted by someone who I'd received messages from in the past, the message history was properly displayed once I opened the text conversation with them.\nIt's possible that the simplicity of fixing this issue is why Apple hasn't patched the bug in the 5+ years it's been known about.\n\nA: There ( sorry ) Is no possible way to get your messages back. The reason is is probably because your iPod was corrupt or not up to date. Simply contact an apple store and turn your Pod in, and they should give u a replacement while they check for a virus. Other reason may be because someone sent u a corrupt picture, long text, or virus text while your phone was off. Update your iPhone ( Software update ) and it'll never happen again. \n", "Q: Carbon Copy Cloner circumvents FileVault authentication? I have a MacBook Pro on which I created a FileVault partition.  To access it, I click on the .dmg file, OSX asks for the password, then it mounts the partition in a readable form.  So far so good.\nI use Carbon Copy Cloner to make backups of my MBP onto an external USB drive.  I recently decided to test the CCC image by plugging in the USB drive and booting the MBP with the startup manager (pressing Option during startup).  The backup image was offered as a startup volume, so I selected it.  The machine booted, albeit slowly.  So far so good.\nI got to the log in screen, I logged in, and then navigated to my encrypted .dmg file.  I clicked on it.  Much to my astonishment and consternation, it duly mounted the partition without asking for my password.\nDoes this mean that \n(a) the \"encrypted partition\" on my MBP drive isn't really safe?  Or\n(b) the CCC image somehow circumvents the authentication mechanism?\n[FWIW, I'm 95% certain that the FileVault partition was NOT mounted when I ran the CCC backup.  If it was mounted, I could see that as an explanation to what happened.]\nEither way, it seems that something is really broken.  The whole reason for encrypting the partition is to protect the contents.  Just because it's on a backup drive doesn't mean it should be readable without authentication.\nCan someone explain what's going on here?\nUPDATE\nI noticed the following in the CCC release notes: \n\nThere is a bug in OS X Yosemite's diskutil command-line utility in\n  which it will unlock and attach a FileVault-protected volume, but not\n  mount that volume. This contradicts past behavior as well as the\n  documentation for this utility. This update offers a workaround to\n  this OS X Yosemite bug.\n\nShould I assume this is the problem?  If so, what can I do to protect the data on the FileVault?\n\nA: An encrypted disk image is not a FileVault volume, those are two different things. It sounds like you might have the password for the encrypted disk image in your login keychain. CCC isn't \"circumventing\" anything... And no, the diskutil bug in Yosemite is not related to this behavior.\n", "Q: Hide Shared Network Drive in Finder Is there any way to hide a shared network drive in Finder?

I followed this http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/revert-back-mavericks-from-yosemite-3581872/ to try to downgrade back to Mavericks, and I believe I successfully made a bootable Mavericks Install Drive. Everything worked just as it should have, I shut down my computer, pressed alt while turning it on, and chose the USB drive.

Since the router's password is also used as the Samba password, perhaps the cause is related to the legacy of Samba and Lanman password limitations:\n\"passwords are limited to a maximum of only 14 characters\"\n\"Many legacy third party CIFS implementations have taken considerable time to add support for the stronger protocols that Microsoft has created to replace LM hashing because the open source communities supporting these libraries first had to reverse engineer the newer protocols—Samba took 5 years to add NTLMv2 support\"\n\nA: No familiarity with that particular brand of NAS however I have a lot of experience with Windows (SMB) shares. So take this with a grain of salt (at least a medium sized one...)\nGenerally Windows authentication looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*USERNAME:   [DOMAIN][USERNAME] \n\n*PASSWORD:   [your password]\n\n\nWhere the domain is the name of the NAS device. And use the backslash not \"/\"\nWhen you try something like this:\nSMB://readyshare\nDo you get a password prompt? If not try:\nCIFS://readyshare\nCIFS is the fallback protocol when SMB does not work, but you often have to force it this way. Failing that it may be a name resolution (DNS) issue. Try it with the IP address instead:\nSMB://192.168.x.x (or whatever the IP is)\nIf you get a dialog asking for a username and password try it in the format as above if just a username (without the domain prefix) does not work.\nIf none of that works, post what does happen wen you try and connect.

I would be curious to the see the actual content of the file in case the content is somehow causing the indexer to fail, but then you say the indexes okay with shorter names, so it doesn't follow that the content is a problem.\nSomething you could do is try running mdls against the file. This should show you metadata that is recorded in the Spotlight index for the file. For example when I run it against the PDF I used for testing I get things like the following.

This extenuates the likelihood of it being a bug. For example, I'm unable to reproduce this with the maximum length filename possible in Finder on my MacBook Pro, but Spotlight seems to ignore the same file on my iMac (both with the same version of OS X).\nYou can provide feedback to Apple here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\n", "Q: Why can I set VLC as my default browser? I have Yosemite 10.10.2 installed; in my System Preferences > General, my default browser selection allows me to choose VLC. Why does this happen and can it be removed?\n\nA: It's probably because VLC supports generic http URLs.  If you want to experiment, proceed with caution.\nFirst, make a backup copy of /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/Info.plist and put it in a safe place.\nThen, using a text editor such as emacs or vi (not TextEdit.app !), remove the following lines:\n            <dict>\n                    <key>CFBundleURLIconFile</key>\n                    <string>generic</string>\n                    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n                    <string>http url</string>\n                    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n                    <array>\n                            <string>http</string>\n                    </array>\n            </dict>\n\nThis should be enough to convince the OS that VLC should not be used as a browser; although I don't know what (if anything) will break in VLC.  You may need to reboot in order to see the effects of the plist change as well.\nIf things are unstable after that, you can restore the backed up Info.plist file to /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/Info.plist in order to return to the way things used to be.\n\nA: This can happen, because VLC can open weblinks which are both VLC and browser supported. But to switch back, just open your main browser and set that to be the default browser.\nFor Firefox:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Firefox\n\n*open Preferences > Genereal\n\n*and enable the checkbox to check if it is the default browser\n\n\nIf anything other than Firefox then becomes default browser, Firefox will ask to set this back to Firefox on the next opening. This works for Safari, Chrome as well.\n", "Q: How can I force Terminal.app to take up exactly half of my screen? I'm using Spectacle for Window Management and I regularly use the commands to split my screen horizontally for exactly two windows.

A research group named SMACK has released a vulnerability known as FREAK which can be used for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The vulnerability is due to an old ghost created by USA Government (NSA, more specifically) where in, years ago, they convinced several organizations to use weaker keys, known as export-grade keys for any software that was to be used outside the borders of USA. While the use of strong keys is wide spread now, several servers still have support for the weaker keys.\nThe group discovered that this vulnerability can be exploited by using a client and making a connection via a weak key. Once the key is generated by the server, it is reused until the server is restarted which can potentially be months. The group was able to crack this weak server key in 7.5 hours using Amazon EC2. Once this is cracked, potentially all the communication can be downgraded to use weak keys and MITM'ed.\nThe attack mainly addresses OpenSSL (e.g. Android) clients and Apple TLS/SSL clients (Safari) in conjunction with vulnerable web servers but not Firefox, Chrome or IE. \nHow may I disable some or all of the insecure Cipher Suites manually on the client side by e.g. editing some configuration files in Safari, using an appropriate Safari extension or modifying binaries directly to immediately fix the vulnerability especially in older Safari versions probably not updated by Apple? Is it possible at all?\nThe Cipher Suites in question are:\nCipherSuite TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5         = { 0x00,0x03};\nCipherSuite TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC2_CBC_40_MD5     = { 0x00,0x06};\nCipherSuite TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x08};\nCipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x0B};\nCipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x0E};\nCipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x11};\nCipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x14};\nCipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5     = { 0x00,0x17};\nCipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x19};\n\nand maybe some more.\n\nA: Safari on OS X uses Secure Transport for SSL/TLS, the same implementation which is linked in cURL, App Store, etc. Secure Transport does not have any user configurations available. Therefore, it is not possible to modify Safari cipher suites.\nAnyway, Apple recently released Security Update 2015-002 which fixes this issue.\n\nImpact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept\n  SSL/TLS connections\nDescription: Secure Transport accepted short ephemeral RSA keys,\n  usually used only in export-strength RSA cipher suites, on connections\n  using full-strength RSA cipher suites.

I found the (higher level) culprit to be a call to socket.getfqdn(). \nRunning the following command in the terminal on OS X 10.10.2, demonstrates the problem:\n$ time python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'\npython -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'  0.02s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 5.122 total\n\nI traced the code that runs when socket.getfqdn() is called and the delay is caused by getaddrinfo(3). I wrote a small program that isolates the problem and gai_strerror(3) provides this message:\n$ time ./hostinfo\nHostname: MacBook-Pro.local\ngetaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n./hostinfo  0.00s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 5.101 total\n\nIt seems like the delay is waiting for the DNS query to time out. The above results were using Google's public DNS servers. If I use my ISP's DNS servers, however, the time increases to 30 seconds:\n$ time python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'\npython -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'  0.01s user 0.01s system 0% cpu 30.114 total\n\n(curiously the C program hostinfo still takes just above 5 seconds)\nWhat is causing this issue? Is my hostname invalid or causing problems?\n$ hostname\nMacBook-Pro.local\n\nThis problem doesn't happen on a Macbook Air on the same network.\nThe major difference I can see is that on the problematic machine, the following DNS confiugration is listed:\n$ scutil --dns\nDNS configuration\n\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : Home\n  nameserver[0] : 8.8.8.8\n  nameserver[1] : 8.8.4.4\n  flags    : Request A records\n  reach    : Reachable\n\nDNS configuration (for scoped queries)\n\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : Home\n  nameserver[0] : 8.8.8.8\n  nameserver[1] : 8.8.4.4\n  if_index : 4 (en0)\n  flags    : Scoped, Request A records\n  reach    : Reachable\n\nOn the Macbook Air, several extra entries are included that relate to mDNS. For example:\nresolver #2\n  domain   : local\n  options  : mdns\n  timeout  : 5\n  flags    : Request A records\n  order    : 300000\n\nThis seems to be significant. Interestingly, the timeout listed above is about the same as the runtimes above.\nI should note that I'm connected to the internet using WiFi and the problem only exists when trying to resolve my computer's host name.\n\nA: I originally had the same issue, but eventually resolved it.\nI used to have:\n$ scutil --get HostName\nMichaels-Macbook-Pro\n$ scutil --get LocalHostName\nMichaels-Macbook-Pro\n$ time python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'\n... 30s ...\n\nThen I changed:\n$ scutil --set HostName Michaels-Macbook-Pro.local\n$ time python -c 'import socket; socket.getfqdn()'\n... 5s ...\n\nThen I added into: /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1       localhost Michaels-Macbook-Pro.local\n::1             localhost Michaels-Macbook-Pro.local\n\nIt became fast.\n\nA: Don't use the .local top level domain. Use .home.arpa instead.\nRFC 6762 specifies:\n\n... that the DNS top-level domain \".local.\" is a special domain with special semantics...\n\n\nAny DNS query for a name ending with \".local.\" MUST be sent to the mDNS IPv4 link-local multicast address 224.0.0.251 (or its IPv6 equivalent FF02::FB).\n\nOn macOS this uses Bonjour and from what I have experienced is that after 1 minute of inactivity it will take about 10 seconds to resolve a .local name. Presumably it is trying to find the service via Bonjour and only falling back to DNS after a 10 second timeout.\nI did some digging and found RFC 8375 which specifies that .home.arpa:\n\n... is designated for non-unique use in residential home networks.\n\nI'm not sure why it says residential. The RFC for Home Networking Control Protocol doesn't make a distinction between residential and non-residential \"home\" networks.\n\nA: I was able to fix this issue by explicitly setting the HostName using scutil to be the same value as LocalHostName:\n$ scutil --set HostName $(scutil --get LocalHostName)\n\nNow:\n$ sudo scutil --set HostName MacBook-Pro\n$ time python -c 'import socket; print(socket.getfqdn())'\nMacBook-Pro\npython -c 'import socket; print(socket.getfqdn())'  0.01s user 0.00s system 86% cpu 0.016 total\n\nI was confused before because of the following:\n$ scutil --get LocalHostName\nMacBook-Pro\n\n$ hostname\nMacBook-Pro.local\n\nBut:\n$ scutil --get HostName\nHostName: not set\n\n\nA: Had the same issue, but your suggestions didn't work for me.\nEventually, I fixed it by doing this once I did this:\nsudo scutil --set HostName uranus.local\n\nMy machine host is 'uranus'. I only had to add '.local' to it.\n", "Q: Is there a built-in way to both save and copy a screenshot to the clipboard at the same time?

However, when I exit the ssh session and am sitting nicely at my local directory, it still tells me the directory path of the place I was previously logged in to.\nIs there any way to have it tell me that information only when I am actually logged in to a remote machine? I have already gone to Terminal -> preferences -> profiles -> window and I only have \"Dimensions\" checked.\n\nA: Taken wholesale from this SuperUser.com question and answer...\nThe issue is that the shell on the remote host is configured to send an escape sequence to set the terminal window title. This is a fairly common setup. The solutions mentioned in the blog post you linked to are correct.\nThe simplest and most direct solution is to configure that same remote shell to reset the window title when it logs out. e.g., if the remote shell is bash, put this in ~/.bash_logout:\nprintf '\\e]0;\\a'\n\nAlternatively, if you'd like to have your local shell update the window title with something useful, anyway, then do that. When the ssh connection ends, the local shell will set the window title to something else instead of leaving the stale value. e.g. put this in ~/.bashrc:\nPS1='\\[\\e]1;\\s\\$ \\W\\a\\e]2;\\u@\\h\\a\\]'\"$PS1\"\n\nThis puts the user and host name in the window title (which is typically what remote shells are configured to do), and also sets the tab title to show the shell name and type (normal user or root) and current working directory.\n", "Q: How to search for .zip files instead of all compressed files?

Any way to fix this behavior?\n\nA: Much of this depends on the setup you have done in ITerm and setting up shells.\nBy default iTerm runs the default shell  as a login shell. By default for old versions of OSX the shell is bash but the user has changed this to zsh, for newer versions of macOS the default shell is zsh.\nzsh has several files that are used at startup see zsh manual $ZDOTDIR is by default your home directory\n\nCommands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden.\n... ...\n\n\nCommands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv. If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile. Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc. Finally, if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.\n\nSo when items starts a login shell  the following files are sourced\n/etc/zshenv\n~/.zshenv\n/etc/zprofile  # This is in later versions of macOS\n              # Not in Mojave but in Monterey\n~/.zprofile\n/etc/zshrc    # This is in later versions of macOS\n~/.zshrc\n~/.zlogin\n\nIf zsh is started from a shell prompt it is not a login shell and so only the following are read\n/etc/zshenv\n~/.zshenv\n/etc/zshrc    # This is in later versions of macOS\n~/.zshrc\n\nIf you get different behaviour in the two cases then look at your  ~/.zprofile and  ~/.zlogin .\nIn this case one of them probably is sourcing ~/.zshrc. Note that this differs from bash where a login shell reads ~/.bash_profile and a non login interactive shell reads ~/.bashrc and thus the normal bash use is to source ~/.bashrc in ~/.bash_profile so to stop the need to duplicate code.\n", "Q: How do i get back my old user account after upgrading to OS X Yosemite 10.10.2?

I am sole proprietor of the laptop and have an administrator account. Shouldn't I be able  to install software without using sudo?\n\nA: Even though the account is an administrator, you still need to use sudo to become the root user. Administrator still has restrictions on what files can be read or written to.\nFor example, the /System/Library/User Template/ folder is set to System: Read/Write and even though you are an administrator, you won't be able to open this folder without either changing the permissions or using sudo to become the root user.\n\nA: This is by design. The vast majority of users want to install GUI software and adjust system settings, but do not want to install command-line software. Those same users would prefer malware have a harder time getting into the process, and often need to be protected from themselves (\"Library\"? Don't need a folder of books...). So the admin user is not root.\nThose users who are familiar with the Unix layer know about sudo, and should also know how to add specific commands to sudoers when needed. There's also the sudo bash method of getting a root shell.\n\nA: No, you need to use sudo because you are not root user (good thing, because you don't want to accidentally wreck the computer), sudo allows you to momentarily \"become\" root. If you were not an administrator, you are not one of the privileged users that are allowed to use sudo, and thus, you would not be able to install anything requiring sudo.   \n", "Q: Install Yosemite ISO on VMWare Workstation 11 I have a win 7 computer with vmware workstation 11 and I need to install Yosemite in it.

(Error code -36)\n\nBut regardless of the error message, single files will still copy over. Multiple files however, will copy the first file, then kick the error message and stop. \nReally a pain when I have a folder with 100's of images and I have to copy each image over individually!\nHowever, when I copy files from a PC Desktop or Laptop to the Mac Server, no error message occurs.\nI've been dealing with this issue for months and have not found a solution. I get the same message no matter what type of file it is.....PDF, JPG, DOC, Ai, etc.\nCan anybody help??\n\nA: use dot_clean, the directory which is being copied and throwing the Error Code 36, the basics look like this:\nLaunch the Terminal (found in /Applications/Utilities/ or with Spotlight)\nAt the command prompt, type:\ndot_clean /Path/To/Directory/With/Problem/\n\nWhen dot_clean is finished, attempt the file copy again and it should succeed with no error code\nFor example, if copying ~/Documents/FileBackups/ is the problematic directory, use:\ndot_clean ~/Documents/FileBackups/\n\nFor more info see http://osxdaily.com/2015/02/21/fix-error-code-36-finder-mac-os-x/\n\nA: The Finder can be a problem when you drag huge file & folder structures in the IU. \nTry using the cp command in Terminal if you're moving many hundreds of files, as it bypasses all the overhead the Finder imposes when manually dragging:\ncp [source_file] [target_destination]\ncp -R ~/Desktop/BigFolderOfFiles /Volumes/<server>/<directory>\nFrom man cp:\n\n-R    If source_file designates a directory, cp copies the directory\n  and the entire subtree connected\n             at that point.  If the source_file ends in a /, the contents of the directory are copied rather\n             than the directory itself.\n\nIn Terminal, it is quite easy to do this without a lot of typing. You can drag folder icons into the terminal window and have the paths auto-expand, (and it escapes any spaces for you, too.)\nYou simply type:\ncp -R [space] drag source folder on the Mac into Terminal window [space] drag target folder on the server into Terminal window, check to make sure it looks OK, then hit return.

So I then run\n$ xattr dev\ncom.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms\ncom.apple.quarantine\n\nThese have no meaning to me. \nIt looks to me that the permissions are what they should be (600)  where is the discrepancy coming from, and how do I fix it?\n\nA: I assume your working directory is ~/.ssh/ when you run ssh-add, ls and xattr.\nI suspect there is a subdirectory named dev (i.e., ~/.ssh/dev/). Check for it with ls -lFd dev.\nls normally lists the contents of a directory. Adding the -d option lists a directory as a directory itself.\nFurther, I suspect that there is a file, ~/.ssh/dev/dev which is what ls -lF is displaying the information about.\nIf my suspicion is correct, xattr dev displays the extended attributes of the subdirectory named dev (not the file dev/dev). The directory attributes probably are not the cause of this problem.\nIf this is confusing, ls -lFR might help you see what's happening (the -R option recursively lists subdirectories).\nFinally, if my suspicion is correct and you're really trying to add a private key identity file named ~/.ssh/dev/dev to the ssh authentication agent, try ssh-add dev/dev (or perhaps better, ssh-add ~/.ssh/dev/dev, which should work no matter the permissions of the enclosing directory.\n", "Q: Flashing folder icon appeared once after changing Macbook hard drive About 2 weeks ago, I updated my late 2011 Macbook Pro hard drive to a Crucial MX100 solid state drive. The drive installation and data migration went fine with no issues, but today I found the computer in a state where the screen just showed the \"flashing folder\" icon indicating an issue with the main boot disk. I restarted the computer in recovery mode and verified the disk, and Disk Utility said the disk was fine, with no issues. I then rebooted into Mac OS X (Yosemite 10.10.2) as normal and the computer is working fine.\nIs there any reason why this would suddenly happen like this? Are there any hard drive related settings I should change on my system now that I have changed to a solid state drive from a magnetic drive?\n\nA: This could have been a situation where the PRAM somehow lost the startup disk settings. If you reboot holding Command+Option+P+R and wait for the startup chime (or two) that will reset the PRAM and might fix the issue.\nWhat you did was exactly right, however, as there might have been disk corruption or some other sort of disk problem. Unfortunately disk utility isn't as verbose as many would wish. Other disk utilities like Diskwarrior, TechTool Pro or Drive Genius might give you a more detailed report And even a freeware SMART utility might give you info on the health of the drive that Disk Utility won't report.\nIn other words you might be fine and this was a random occurrence (Murphy was a computer engineer...) or it could be the sign of an impending failure.\nI would check it out further, and back up my data.\n", "Q: Record click action and replay via command line?

Anything i can do about it? Is it something to do with his settings or mine?\n\nA: iMessage can be configured to send/receive from your phone number as well as any email addresses that you have verified through your account. If your iPhone is configured to start new conversations from your phone number, but continues sending from your email address to a particular contact, you would need to delete the existing conversation with that contact and start a new one.\n", "Q: Installing pymol using macports on yosemite I tried to install pymol using macports (after trying to build from the source code failed): \nsudo port install pymol\n\nIt did install it, giving me two warnings:\nWarning: xcodebuild exists but failed to execute\nWarning: Xcode does not appear to be installed; most ports will likely fail to build.\n\nI am able to run pymol, but it crashes after a minute or so.

I deleted MacID and the problem went away but supposedly you can upgrade it and fix the issue as well\nReference: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6702053?tstart=0\n\nA: What happens when you select Mahmoud's 27 iMac in the Bluetooth menu? Does it show Connect to or Disconnect from Network, or something else?\nI would bet Mahmoud's iMac is set up to share its internet connection over Bluetooth, which would probably also explain why it's not showing up in the Bluetooth devices list. Try looking under Network in System Preferences and see if Bluetooth PAN appears there. If so, click on it, and I think it will show Mahmoud's 27 iMac in the Devices list.\nTo disable this, on Mahmoud's iMac go to System Preferences > Sharing, click on Internet Sharing on the left-hand side, then either uncheck it (to disable sharing completely), or next to \"To computers using:\", uncheck the box next to Bluetooth PAN. If Mahmoud doesn't want to disable this, on YOUR computer you can go to System Preferences > Network, click on Bluetooth PAN on the left and click the minus sign at the bottom of the list.\n\nA: When the Bluetooth device is connected, press ALT/OPTION and click the Bluetooth icon. When you select the device in the list you will see a Remove option that should stop if from connecting in future.\n\n\nA: I faced the same situation and found that my colleague uses Notifyr app (http://www.getnotifyr.com/) which runs with bluetooth connection.

The home button doesn't work the lock of the screen doesn't work. I always have to restart the phone.\nHas anyone else experienced the same?\n\nA: I haven't experienced this, but I would highly recommend reinstalling the latest iOS (iOS 8.2) onto it, by using a computer with iTunes and hooking your phone to the computer with the USB data cable.\nIn iTunes, it should detect an update available and ask if you would like to update.  Go ahead and update it that way.  If that doesn't work, manually download the iOS 8.2 firmware update for your device from IPSW Downloads and then, with your phone plugged into the computer via the USB Data cable, and iTunes open, hold down the shift or control key while clicking on \"Update\" on iTunes.  This will open a file selection dialog/window, then just select the file you downloaded (iOS 8.2 Firmware file that you downloaded from ipsw.me), and it will flash your phone with the latest version.\nHopefully this will take care of the issue.\nIf not, you may have to take it to an Apple store and have them fix it/replace it.\n\nA: Had a problem with my I phone 6 freezing.

But it will not be around next time unless you put it in ~/.profile.\nI do this quite a bit.  Don't like to mess with the PATH for every single app that needs bash launches and it avoids stepping on something else by mistake.\nThen you just type: \ndmd ...your arguments...\nessentially, alias here does exactly what you don't want to do, it types out /usr/bin/dmd.\n", "Q: throughout repairing, Apple provide a macbook? I am thinking to give my macbook pro to apple service. Because on the right side, USB, hdmi and sd card reader are not working. According to the people in the store, it will take about 3-5 days to fix the problem.\nBut: I need a computer because I have to study and work on computer. 3-5 days are very important for me. Does any one know if i give my macbook to apple service, they provide me a laptop during repairing time ? If yes, I should pay or not? I still have guarantee..\nLocation : Bern/Switzerland\n\nA: Apple doesn't offer warranty replacement Macs during service unless you are paying / participating in the Joint Venture program. It's basically premium service that you pay for as an add-on similar to how AppleCare is an add on that can reduce your repair costs in some cases. I don't know how many countries it is offered, so contact your store's Business team to check. From the USA web site, the program has this as one of it's benefits:\n\nPremium access to Apple Support.\nYou’ll get your own website with easy access to every service we offer\n  — custom training, Genius Bar reservations, tech support, and\n  workshops. And you can speak by phone to an Apple Genius who can help\n  resolve your issue, check into necessary parts, and estimate repair\n  turnaround time. We’ll even loan you a computer while yours is being\n  repaired. If you prefer to meet in person, you can make a Genius Bar\n  appointment at any Apple Store in the world.\n\nYou'll need to rent a replacement elsewhere before you turn in your computer or time the repair to when you can afford to lose the days it takes to do the work on it.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro refuses to boot/recover, hangs at \"white screen\" I am somewhat new to caring for Macs, but one has been left in my care and I have not been able to restore it to working order yet. Here are the symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MacBook Pro would hang with a \"white screen\" during the boot process. A bit of boot splash would show up, but the gray background would at some point just hang.\n\n*Booting recovery mode did not work, as far as I remember.\n\n*Boot from a Ubuntu 14.04.2 USB stick works, provided one attaches \"nofb nomodeset\" to the kernel commandline (though I put that one down to insufficient driver support). I have no idea whether or not these usually work out-of-the-box.\n\n*Using parted from the aforementioned stick, I was able to see three partitions, one EFI Boot, one large main partition and one labeled Recovery. It seemed strange that the recovery was recoognized as HFS+, as I expected, but the \"main\" partition was not mountable and did not show a filesystem type.\n\n*I also discovered that the drive in question was an OCZ Vertex3 256 GB, which I assume is not standard? The previous owner could have upgraded it.\n\n*At this point, I decided to wipe the drive and try with a fresh installation. I removed the SSD from the MacBook, pulled a full disk image from my desktop just in case (which went without any read errors) and used hdparm to do an SATA enhanced erase, leaving me with a \"fresh\" disk. Then I put it back in.\n\n*I started internet recovery, which loaded, showing me the global and everything. Afterwards, it rebooted, showing me the Apple Logo. But then I run into the original \"white screen\" again.\n\n*I've tried resetting the NVRAM on boot, which succeeded because it turned the boot chime back on, but even then, running internet recovery again just causes it to hang on the white screen.\n\n*There seems to be either very high CPU or GPU usage on the white screen, as the fans start wailing pretty intensely, also the body gets very hot in a very short time.\n\n*For funsies, I installed Ubuntu onto the MacBook, which works (after smoothing over a few hiccups, fortunately I have lot more experience doing that).\n\n*Recovery mode (Cmd+R) and Apple Hardware Test (D?) I have not been able to run. The former suffers the same white screen issue as described above.\nCurrently, my only vague guess is a GPU issue, that may be circumvented by Ubuntu by using the not completely feature complete open source radeon drivers. But that is a wild guess. Any input is appreciated.\n\nA: \nIf your MacBook Pro was built around 2013, this is most likely a hardware fault to do with the actual GPU itself. It happened to me so I took it to Apple, they ran some diagnostic application on it and basically gave me a new, updated model. Apparently the problem is well known to them. I have some documents on the subject. I will edit/update this post if/when I manage to find the paperwork.  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\n\nA: You might want to try using internet recovery again, completely erasing the disk using the supplied disk utility. (select the drive (not the partition) and use the delete tab. This will also recreate the partition map accordingly.\nAlso, try using safe boot (hold shift while booing).\nIf that doesn't do the trick boot in verbose mode, which will give you more output about what's happening (hold cmd+V while booting).\nAlso try resetting SMC and PRAM\n\nA: Just my 5c, may have nothing to do with, just a wild guess.\nI have attached an encrypted USB harddisc with no OS to my MacPro. Every time I reboot, I need to press ALT for the boot dialogue, otherwise my MacPro is stuck within a white screen. When I detach the USB harddisc and reboot, no problem.\nSo how about just detaching all peripherals and try booting again...\n\nA: Follow these steps to start up into safe mode.\nStart or restart your Mac. \nImmediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the Shift key.\nRelease the Shift key when you see the Apple logo appear on the screen.\nAfter the Apple logo appears, it might take longer than usual to reach the login screen or your desktop. This is because your Mac performs a directory check of your startup disk as part of safe mode.\nTo leave safe mode, restart your computer without pressing any keys during startup.\nSome features of your Mac aren't available when it's started in safe mode, so after you're done using safe mode you should restart your computer normally.\nFor example, these features don't work in safe mode:\nYou can't play movies in DVD Player.\nYou can't capture video in iMovie and some other video apps.\nSome audio input or output devices might not work.\nSome USB, FireWire and Thunderbolt devices might not be available.\nWi-Fi networking might be limited or unavailable depending on the Mac and OS X version you're using.\nFrom Apple Support pages, provided from experience. \n", "Q: Image Compression Power point Presentation 2011 I am trying to make a presentation, and am facing a problem.

The same box can be found in the CmdTab menu.\nThis happens only on some of our Macs, which have the same version of OS X (10.10.2) and the same AppleID - but other Macs with the same OS X and AppleID don't seem to show the same behaviour.\n\nWhen the cursor is over the icon, it says \"From Mac\". The only 2 icons that have appeared there are Chrome and Mail. Clicking the Chrome icon opens a webpage on Chrome that someone else in the office opened recently, and that's a little bit creepy.\nI tried to Googling it, but without success... I'm sure it's an AppleID related issue, but I can't find a name for it, and hence I can't disable it.\nWhat is that, and how can I get rid of it?\n\nA: This is called \"Handoff\" and is a feature that Apple introduced with OS X Yosemite and iOS. It is designed to allow you to quickly switch from your Mac to your iOS device but can also work between different Macs. \nIn this case, it would allow you to switch over to the exact environment that is running on the other Mac. This could be useful if one was working on an iMac, and then picked up their MacBook Air to continue their efforts on a Pages document, for example. Obviously the functionality extends to a number of programs. \nTo disable, open System Preferences and click General. Uncheck the \"Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud Devices\" option. \nFor more information: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18754?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Is safe to turn off iphone for 3 months My phone was taken by my teacher because i play with it while the school time, is it safe to turn it off for 3 months with battery 100% ?\n\nA: It is recommended that you store you iPhone at roughly 50% charge. If you store it for more then 6 months, then you should charge it back to 50%. \nFor more information:\nhttps://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\n", "Q: PDF form is missing information entered on a Windows PC I have a 3rd party form which has a lot of fields to be filled in. I started entering the information on a Windows PC and saved it to Dropbox. When I open the form in Apple Preview on my OS X Yosemite machine the fields that I filed in are all blank! If I open it in Adobe Reader instead the information is present but when I save the file and open it in Windows again all of the previously saved information from my initial Windows session has gone. Please tell me how I can stop this happening as I use these forms on a regular basis and I need to edit them in Windows 7 and Mac OS X Yosemite.\n\nA: Adobe recommends:\n\nMac users: don't use Preview\nFor Macintosh system users: DO NOT use the Preview program to fill in\n  the PDF form. Adobe Reader is the only program that will allow you to\n  work with the form properly, and allow us to read the results once\n  back on a Windows machine.\n\nThe fillable PDF forms are created with Adobe app. If opened with Preview it will completely mess-up that capability, so newer open it with Preview.

There might be a better (or more elegant) solution, but since i don't have a spare Mac at the moment (and it doesn't work in a virtual environment) i can't figure that out.\nThe solution outlined here removes any partition which obstructs the expansion of the CoreStorage Volume Group. Then the physical (CoreStorage) volume and afterwards the logical (CoreStorage) volume will be expanded non-destructively to almost full size.\nAt the end the Recovery HD deleted previously will be restored by reinstalling the current system.\nInitial state (disk0 is your physical device and disk1 is a \"virtual\" CoreStorage device - the disk identifier may vary depending on your setup):\n\nFinal state:\n\nPreparation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your data.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite).\nBelow I assume that the disk identifier of your Internet Recovery HD (OS X Base System) or thumb drive is disk1, disk0 is your SSD, and disk2 your CoreStorage Logical Volume. Disk3 - ~ disk14 are used by Internet Recovery Mode. Don't mess around with them.\nLVUUID: UUID of the logical volume.

Afterwards install all updates published later. You will NOT lose your personal data.\n\n\nA: I found another solution. It may take time though. You need to try reinstalling windows by using bootcamp and then uninstall it. When you ask bootcamp to delete the partition used for windows, it will also \"delete\" the free space. It worked for me.\n", "Q: Macbook air yosemite update I was updating my macbook air to Yosemite. When I almost finished the update, my battery died. I've charged my laptop, but it won't turn on again. The screen just stays black. What should I do?\n\nA: During Installation Yosemite also installs a Recovery partition on your disk.\nYou might be lucky and it has finished that job before the lights went out.\nYou could try to call it up by restarting while holding cmd + r\nIf that did not work, you will need a external Yosemite.\nUsing a USB stick with bootable Yosemite you can reinstall it on your Hard Disk.\nHow to get it?\nFrom another Mac, from a friend, from Apple Store...\n", "Q: Using Shazam to pick up audio over internal soundcard / headphones I recently discovered Shazam has an app for mac, it seems it works by listening on the built in mic (or any mic presumably).\nI wondered if there was a way I could get it to listen to the soundcard instead? I typically listen to radio streams over VLC, through headphones and thought it would be awesome to be able to use Shazam for those unknown tunes.\nI found out about the Audio MIDI Setup.app which you can create aggregate devices, I thought maybe I could somehow forward the output into the mic- but I don't really understand it exactly truth be told.\nIs there a way I could get this to work?\n\nA: You can do this like so: \n\n\n*\n\n*Install Soundflower (from https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/)\n\n*Option-click the volume icon and change both the input and the output device to \"Soundflower (2ch)\"\n\n*Start the Soundflowerbed application that comes with Soundflower, then click its icon in the top right (of a flower) and choose \"Built-in Output\" from the list under \"Soundflower (2ch)\"\n\n\nNow your system audio output (e.g. VLC) is going out on the Soundflower virtual audio cable and your system input (e.g. Shazam) is coming from the Soundflower virtual audio cable, so Shazam can listen to whatever you play on the Mac, but Soundflowerbed lets you also route that virtual audio cable out through the system audio output so you can hear it all the time!\nThis could have a slightly negative effect on CPU usage and latency, so you might not want to use this set up all the time if you aren't using Shazam - in this case, you just Option-click the volume icon and set the output (and input if required) back to \"Built-in\". It's really cool to have Shazam IDing tracks as you listen to a DJ mix/radio station, and it's (sometimes) impressively accurate!\n\nA: Have a look at Soundflower - freeware internal audio router\n\nA: It works with soundflower on el capitan again. WoW, installed soundflower version 2.0b2 and be sure to uninstall earlier versions first with the given script in the 2.0b2 installer (available at GitHub). If you set with the alt-click option on the volume icon all (both input and output) to soundflower(2chl). If you have no real audio output anymore you can create e.g. a multi-output device in audio/midi configuration. This will disable audio volume control. Instead I can use soundflowerbed v1.1.6 again with no trouble on OSX El Capitan 10.11.6\nWith Soundflowerbed volume control keeps being in control.\n\nA: No, no ,no.\nTHE EASIEST WAY YOU DO IT - IS THROUGH WINDOWS SOUND settings (go to them and select RECORDING, then STEREO MIX and enable it and then right click it (stereo mix) and click LISTEN and then Listen to this device (aditionally select what device is playing the audio).\nThen hit OK and shazam will work (you may have to dissable all other microphones or just set stero mix to default).\nYou just usually need some soundcard for this (Asus works good) - but in asus drivers you should alway disable FX and GX and use Classic as effect. Also to generally improve quality on soundcards - just dissable unused playback devices / recording devices (use only those that you use).\n\nA: SoundflowerBed is available separately from Soundflower. You can get SoundflowerBed here: https://github.com/mLupine/SoundflowerBed\n", "Q: Configure terminal dimensions to show as Lines x Columns In my terminal, when I ask to show Dimensions (profiles -> window -> dimensions), it shows the dimensions as Columns x Lines, but when I use resize -s 25 200, I am actually resizing as Lines x Columns, so I would like the dimensions to display in the same way.\nIs there any way to get the Dimensions in the title to appear in the same order as the parameters in resize -s?\n\nA: There is no straightforward way to change the Terminal option, you can define your own resizing function though to accomplish this (you may want to add error handling if required):\ntsize() {\n     resize -s ${2:-25} ${1:-80}\n}\n\nPut this into your .bashrc (and deploy to all your computers if you are using several).\n", "Q: How to transfer notes on the iPhone between different IMAP account? After adding a new email account (call it gmail-2), my default note app account has been accidentally changed to the new gmail account(gmail-2). I did not realize it until after tons of notes to it. So right now I have two accounts on my iPhone both have a lots of notes. So I wonder is there any way that I can transfer the all notes in the gmail-2 to the old account(call it gamil-1) automatically without copying all of them by hand?\n\nA: I asked apple, the response is that there is no other way than copy and paste.\n", "Q: Frequent Locations didn't record a location I have Frequent Locations turned on and it does a great job recording everywhere I go and for how long. A few nights ago I was at a residential address for about an hour, however Frequent Locations did not record it. Is there a reason why?\n\nA: If you don’t go to a certain location at the same time on a regular basis, your iPhone will obviously not be able to detect a pattern in your various locations. \nIt means that you must go to a place around the same time, on the same days, for a certain amount of time for your iPhone to establish a pattern.\n", "Q: Ways to find messages from blocked contact info Is there a way, or ways, to retrieve iMessages or text messages sent to me by a number or email address I have blocked on my iPhone 6?\n\nA: Text messages that are blocked are not saved. So you cannot go in to see old text messages. \n\nA: If you have a MacBook (I have MacBook Air), you can easily tell if someone has blocked you. With the new iMessage service every message appears as \"delivered\" (blocked or unblocked), however if your MacBook Air is synced with your iPhone, you will not see a delivered notification on the very same message your iPhone is showing as \"delivered\".\n\nA: Tap the Phone Icon.Then tap the Voicemail Icon. Scroll to the very bottom, and if anyone left a voice mail while the number was blocked, it will be listed under Blocked, and you can play them back.\n\nA: If you have been blocked the phone will ring once then go straight to voicemail  or it will go straight to voicemail without ringing. A text message will show as delivered but the person will never see it. If it has a single green tick next to it it means you have been blocked.\n", "Q: Is there anything we can do on iOS to stay safe while waiting for Apple to issue an update for the latest FREAK SSL vulnerability? I guess the vulnerability has been around for a decade [ars technica], but should we just stay away from using any personal information until there is a security patch?\n\nA: Use Chrome for the moment. IIRC, Mac Firefox (and Chrome) uses a vulnerable crypto library, but Google has promised a fix for Mac Chrome is imminent. \nSee this site for a table of vulnerable and safe browsers. \n", "Q: Determining OS X version from Time Machine backup I have Time Machine backups from my iMac Early 2008 (20\"). Can I determine from those backups what OS X version was running on the machine at the time of latest backup?\n\nA: Just open the file  \n/Volumes/BackupVolumeName/BackupName.ext/ComputerName/latest/VolumeName/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist\n\nto determine the product version (\"latest\" is a sym-link). \nBackupName.ext, BackupVolumeName, ComputerName and VolumeName are all variable and depend on the type of backup or the names configured/given to your backup volume, Mac and main system volume. BackupName.ext is often Backups.backupdb though.\nHere is my SystemVersion.plist (it's the original file and not a file in a  backup) opened in PlistEdit Pro. You may also open it with an arbitrary text editor or Xcode:\n\n\nA: Yes you can look at the value of the ProductVersion in the SystemVersion.plist file located at, e.g., /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/<ComputerName>/yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss/Macintosh HD/System/Library/CoreServices/.\nThe SystemVersion.plist is an XML plist file so, you can just open it in TextEdit, if you do not have a .plist editor and you'll see as an example:\n<key>ProductVersion</key>\n<string>10.8.5</string>\n\n\nA: As of Big Sur, the previous solution no longer works, because Time Machine no longer backs up the unchanging parts of macOS, which are stored separately in a Sealed System Volume, which is hidden from you during normal use, but which you can see with Disk Utility.\nAs a workaround, to see which version of macOS made a particular Time Machine backup, you can boot into Recovery mode (hold down command-R on Intel Mac, hold down power button during startup on Apple silicon Mac), and choose restore from Time Machine backup. You'll get a list of dates and corresponding macOS versions.\nYou can't actually restore these backups outright (because macOS is no longer backed up in its entirety), but Recovery will still show them to you. To restore from a backup made by Big Sur or later, you need to clean install macOS, then run Migration Assistant.\n\nA: Since SystemVersion.plist is not available in current systems, I wanted an easier method than booting into recovery mode.  For someone less disorganized, that would just be keeping a log of updates.  But for me and folks like me, I created an cron job of\n~/bin/SysID > ~/Versions/$(sw_vers -productName)_$(sw_vers -productVersion)_$(sw_vers -buildVersion)\n\nand the script SysID is\ndate\nuname -a\nsw_vers -productName\nsw_vers -productVersion\nsw_vers -buildVersion\ndf -g | grep -vi backup\n\nSo now, each backup contains a record of its version and all previous versions, the approximate time of each and the approximate amount of disk space of each.\n\nA: Perfect information. One little addition. If you've got a really big monitor (as I do) you can read the SystemVersion.plist file just by clicking it and looking at the \"carousel\" preview in the Finder window.\n", "Q: Escaping the in-app browser in iOS apps Most iOS apps that open web pages open them in in-app browsers. These are somewhat restrictive, in that they don’t support bookmarks (and hence bookmarklets) or Handoff (although they do support AirDrop). Is there a quick way to open them in the full Safari iOS app?\nThe Share Sheet doesn’t seem to have one built in. You can copy and paste the URL, but that’s quite a bit of precise tapping.\nThis seems like functionality a third-party extension could add pretty easily. Not interested in jailbreaking though.\n\n\nA: You can use \"Add to Reading List\" to store the URL and then open it in Safari. Still not ideal, but less clumsy than the copy/paste option.\n\nA: The share sheet is therapy to go. Use the ... control to have it open in safari or possibly a third party web app. If your share sheet doesn't allow Safari as a share, then you'll need to agitate to the maker of that app to add Open in Safari to their app or find another app to use that supports your needs to escape their browser.\nThe workflow app used to be a great choice for glue between apps, but since Apple bought it - we might either see it continue to be useful and change or absorbed into the iOS. Worst case, another workflow type app surely will arise to help stitch together apps that didn't think they wanted to be linked and automated.\n", "Q: Anyone else having problems joining domain in OS X 10.10.2?

The process softwareupdated seems to be taking up way too much memory. It can take up to 400 MB RAM sometimes. I can't nail down what is causing this to happen, so I've been watching my console closely. I've narrowed one incident to a 15 minute period, but I still can't see what might be causing this. I am attaching the console output below. Usually softwareupdated only takes up 18 MB. When it gets up to 400 MB, it won't ever go back down unless I restart my computer. Its like it can't release the memory or something. Its very frustrating since it slows my computer down considerably. I have also had my computer freeze a few times requiring a manual shutdown.

is (very likely) a known issue with 15\" 2010 Macbook Pro's. I experienced the same problem with my own 15\" 2010 Macbook Pro about a year ago. \nI recommend that you back up all and any important data as soon as possible (if you haven't already), and take your computer into an Apple store to be examined. Depending on what region of the world you are in, you might be able to get the malfunctioning parts replaced for free, or get it repaired (at the cost of the parts and labor).\nSee https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203554\nfor the (recently ended) free replacement program for 2010 models\nAs well as http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/\nAlthough it pertains to the newer 2011 models, the 2010 page carried the same information before the program was ended.\n", "Q: Multiple iOS App Store Updates in under three days The other day I noticed that some major apps like Instagram, Snapchat, Nike, Facebook, etc. can have multiple updates (sometimes three or more) in only a few days (less than three or four). See this screenshot from Instagram's update schedule below and notice that they've published three updates in the past four days.\n\nHow is this possible? Apple takes at least a week or more per app review (including minor updates). In order to speed up the process to say two or three days, one can submit an Expedited App Review Request. However, Apple only grant these on a limited basis.\nHow do apps like this get updated so darn quick? Is Apple playing favorites to major companies and keeping smaller developers at the bottom of their queue?\n\nA: It is well known that Apple has special relationships with certain developers. It is also possible that they have asked for an \"Expedited App Review,\" though it is unlikely that they have done this for each of these updates. The Expedited Review is supposed to be only for horrific bugs (especially when the app will not open, or if there is a data loss problem) which need to get fixed especially quickly.\n", "Q: TextEdit does not show recent documents in Yosemite I am new to Mac OS X Yosemite. How do I make TextEdit show recent documents? When I go to File and select Recent Documents, it does not show the last few documents like it used to.\n\nA: You probably have the Recent items setting in System Preferences > General set to None:\n\n", "Q: Does Time Machine improve startup time? This may initially sound like a question, and I'm by no means a amateur user of the OSX Operating system(s). \nHowever, upon recently upgrading to Yosemite, my system has become SUPER slow to boot, and I'm wondering if Time Machine will at all aid the start up time by distributing the burden to two disks? \nThanks in advance. \nEDIT: Per request... \nEtreCheck version: 2.1.8 (121)\nReport generated March 5, 2015 at 10:04:05 PM PST\nDownload EtreCheck from http://etresoft.com/etrecheck\n\nClick the [Click for support] links for help with non-Apple products.\nClick the [Click for details] links for more information about that line.\n\nHardware Information: ℹ️\n    iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2012) (Technical Specifications)\n    iMac - model: iMac13,1\n    1 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 CPU: 4-core\n    8 GB RAM Upgradeable\n        BANK 0/DIMM0\n            4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz ok\n        BANK 1/DIMM0\n            4 GB DDR3 1600 MHz ok\n    Bluetooth: Good - Handoff/Airdrop2 supported\n    Wireless:  en1: 802.11 a/b/g/n\n\nVideo Information: ℹ️\n    NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M - VRAM: 512 MB\n        iMac 1920 x 1080\n\nSystem Software: ℹ️\n    OS X 10.10.2 (14C109) - Time since boot: 2:34:0\n\nDisk Information: ℹ️\n    APPLE HDD ST1000LM024 disk0 : (1 TB)\n        EFI (disk0s1) <not mounted> : 210 MB \n        Macintosh HD (disk0s2) / : 999.35 GB (469.15 GB free)\n        Recovery HD (disk0s3) <not mounted>  [Recovery]: 650 MB \n\nUSB Information: ℹ️\n    Seagate BUP Slim Mac SL 1 TB\n        EFI (disk1s1) <not mounted> : 210 MB \n        Time Machine (disk1s2) /Volumes/Time Machine : 999.86 GB (846.04 GB free)\n    Apple Inc.

The presence of a timecapsule is found by osx, only after the bonjour service detects the Timecapsule. Bonjour service kicks in only after a user logs in. \nThe slowness may be caused by the sheer amount of data that needs to be transfered to memory (Which more or less increases with every update). I suggest you to add a SSD and install the os in that. You can still use your existing 1TB ADD as a secondary storage to keep your files.\n", "Q: Timezone in Calendar I am planning an international flight. I have the flight details, with local departure times and arrival time at destination. I have entered these into my Calendar.\nDue to the differences in timezone this appears as an 8 hour trip, when in reality is is 19.\nIs there a way to enter timezone so the duration shows correctly and so when I adjust my timezone on arrival, it will show the correct local time.\nI have turned on timezone support, but there seems to be no way to have a different timezone for start/end times.\n\nA: This does not seem to be possible, so I made a second entry \"arrival\" for the destination timezone, then drag the finish time of the first to match. \n", "Q: How do can I close all windows on Preview and OpenOffice, so they don't open again when I open Preview to see something else?

And would I still find this kind of performance?\nEdit: If it is a good idea, I have no problem with doing a clean install of Yosemite.\nThanks in advance for your help. My Mac is still young and I don't want him to be sick.\n\nA: You file system is corrupted, hardware is probably fine. Backup, wipe and restore.\n\nA: DiskWarrior is brilliant at repairing file system issues that Disk Utility can't manage, but if you're not bothered about repairing your existing file system then you may as well wipe and restore.\nIn addition the above answer I'd strongly recommend creating a USB installer so you can boot from that and then properly repartition and reformat your SSD. Installing from USB will be much quicker than performing Internet Recovery, and you definitely don't want to restore from the recovery partition if there is any doubt about the file system integrity.\nTo do this...\nDownload the 10.9/10.10 installer from Apple. Do not run the installer, cancel it. Next, build a USB installer from the installer so you can perform a completely clean install. Take an 8GB USB stick and (very important) name it Untitled.

A lot of hard drives delivered with Macs come with an Apple logo. \nIs it possible to put those drives in other laptops like Asus, Acer, Toshiba etc.?\n\nA: Those hard drives are OEM-drives build by Seagate, Toshiba or other hard drive manufacturers for Apple.\nUsually there should be no problem to put them in other non-Apple laptops if they fit physically.\nYou won't be able to mount the HFS-volumes on those drives without special file-system drivers like Paragon's HFS+ for Windows in a dual-bay configuration.\nThere might be rare cases however, where drives with Apple firmware in conjunction with special SATA- or IDE-controllers used in non-Apple laptops might not work reliably. Without knowledge and special hardware it's almost impossible to detect occurring errors (e.g. bit-errors).\n\nA: A hard drive is a hard drive.\nBasically, if the plugs fit, it will work.  \nWith the caveats that... \n\n\n*\n\n*SATA 2 & 3 run at different maximum speeds, 3GB/s & 6GB/s; in a mixed environment you will run at the slowest speed.\n\n*you may need to reformat to be able to use the drive in another machine.\n\n*if it's a Fusion drive Windows won't be able to use it as Fusion; it will see it as 2 separate drives.\n\n*The Mac OS itself, will, of course, not work on a PC.\n\n\nA: if it's a normal hdd, no problem with the caveats mentioned above.\nIf it's a SSD, it'll run, but you might not be able to properly use the garbage collection features of the SSD on e.g. Windows\n", "Q: Yosemite supplied curl stopped supporting https I am having the issue that curl is failing to deal with https, and thus I cannot update Homebrew:\nbrew update && brew upgrade\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/': Protocol https not supported or disabled in libcurl\nError: Failure while executing: git pull -q origin refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\n\nThis is incomprehensible to be, because it has just started happening today.

I am trying to run BAPS, which requires the Matlab Runtime Compiler, though it is provided with BAPS and an ancillary installation.

This is the reply from Apple.\n\nThere are no plans to address this based on the following:\nThis configuration is no longer supported.\nWe are now closing this report.\nIf you have questions about the resolution, or if this is still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report with that information.\nPlease be sure to regularly check new Apple releases for any updates that might affect this issue.\n\nSo, since Apple aren't supporting this, I'm wondering if Is it true that the default pager does not use swap?\n\nA: The issue is not that paging is actually turned off but that mode 1 is no longer an implementation of standard memory management but instead an ugly hack that prevents compression by making almost all active memory \"wired\", hence preventing compression but as an aside also swap.\n\nA: In OSX Mavericks, I had also turned off VM compression (via the vm_compressor=1 boot-arg & reboot), because it seemed implicated in some very sluggish sessions when using a high-RAM VMWare Fusion guest. Everything seemed to work fine in Mavericks, no compression but still the expected paging. \nAfter upgrading to OSX Yosemite (10.10.4), I was getting freeze-crashes similar to what you describe. (Specifically, after just 10-15 minutes of light web-browsing, the mouse/display/keyboard would freeze. After about another minute, the machine would spontaneously reboot. The crash report after reboot mentioned a \"progress watchdog\" event in all four cases.)\nFortunately, the first thing I tried was reenabling VM compression (vm_compressor=4). After 4 crashes in the first ~90 minutes of using Yosemite, there have been no crashes in the 4 days since. \nSo I can confirm: the vm_compressor=1 setting that seemed functional before Yosemite now seems crash-buggy. Using the Mavericks-and-beyond actual default for this value, vm_compressor=4 ('VM_PAGER_COMPRESSOR_WITH_SWAP'), seems to fix. \n", "Q: How to manually reset OS X Applications settings without reboot? I want to reset OS X Applications settings, like TextWrangler or some other applications. I kill the TextWrangler Process in Activity Monitor, delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.barebones.textwrangler.plist, but nothing happened, settings doesn't reset. I need to reboot, then reopen the applications, and  the settings are reset. Running OS X 10.10.2 (14C109)\nHow can I manually reset settings without reboot?\n\nA: Macos X has changed over time in how it handles preferences.\nIt used to be in most cases that you could just quit the App and delete its preference file.\nBut now in many cases that will not work. Deleting the file will have no effect because the preference are read once from file and then stored in memory. Changes you then make are also only in the memory. At some point those settings are synchronised with the file. (written to file). If you delete the file before this is done a new file is created with the stored setting and you will find nothing has changed.\nI am not really sure why apple changed this to this behaviour but I suspect it is related to the same reasons Apple now hides the users Library folder in part to stop people from deleting files that should not be deleted.\nThe tool to use if you want to do it so that the system pays attention to what you are trying to do is the unix command /usr/bin/defaults.\nMake sure the App is not running.\nThen in the Terminal.app found in the  '/Applications/Utilities/' folder\nType the command and arguments:\n/usr/bin/defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.barebones.textwrangler\nThis will wipe the plist file. But may not trash it.\nNow when you open Textwrangler the Prefs will be back to the default.\nThis will work with many Apps. But I cannot guarantee this for all.\nAs with any unix command you can screw things up easily if you do not know what you are doing.\nSo read up on it.\n defaults man page \nApple guide \nGoogle search\n\nA: Traditionally, most Mac applications are reset by quitting the application then deleting the relevant preference file found in /Users/[your account]/Library/Preferences. The application will open with its default settings the next time it is run. There are a few exceptions to this, notably those with registration details that are stored in a hidden file which may take a bit longer to hunt down, but generally killing the preference file will restore an application's default settings.

I'm getting this 'grey bar' in my home icon row:\n\nIt is the same colour as the 'grey dot' underneath some of the applications in the home icon row that are active. \n\nMy question is: What is this grey bar underneath the home icon row?\nI'm running Yosemite. \n\nA: Oddly enough I have been having an extremely similar problem. There was a small bar that showed up under the Dock on my desktop, about as long as the Dock is wide (my Dock is vertical) and with rounded corners. It was black, and the running application dots on my Dock are black as well (whereas yours is grey, and the bar is grey).\nUpgrading from 10.10.1 to 10.10.2 caused it to disappear. Then it reappeared, along with a second one. It survived reboots. I didn't think it was actually part of the Dock, because it stayed in the same place when I moved the Dock from the right side of the screen to the bottom. Although, when the second one showed up, and I ran my cursor over the dock (triggering magnification of the icons), it stayed above the icons on the app side of the dock, and was below the icons on the Trash side of the dock.\nI finally ran this terminal command to kill the Dock, and when it restarted itself, the bars were gone. It's been about a day and they haven't reappeared. Fingers crossed. I'm assuming this is a bug in Yosemite.\nkillall -KILL Dock\n\n\nA: The dot is \"Running Application\"\nThe bar usually indicates something is currently being downloaded, but it ought to be more definitely underneath one specific icon. It might be a stuck indicator - a reboot should fix it, or killall Dock if you want to use Terminal.\nThere's also a distant possibility it could be a Google Chrome bug - https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=150743 - make sure Chrome is up to date\n", "Q: OS X Mail - How can I setup multiple e-mail addresses under the same mail account?

The \"Email Address\" field is now a dropdown, and you add additional addresses by selecting \"Edit Email Addresses...\" from this dropdown.\n", "Q: Is there anyway to turn off the dreaded slot machine date picker in iOS? The date picker in iOS is awful.  Every time I put something on my calendar it's a \"game of chance\" if I will notified about it.  Combine that with a touch screen and you have a recipe for scheduling disaster.   \nI would prefer to select a date from a calendar, or heaven-forbid, type it in using the keyboard!!!!!\nIs there any way to turn this thing off?\n\nA: Simple answer: Nope.\nSorry to disappoint you. I also dislike this new picker. It is found all over the new UI and it is just terrible.

According to iTunes:\n\nAccording to my phone:\n\nBut also:\n\nWhat's going on? :-/\nI look into my DCIM folder on my iPhone through Windows Explorer and it's empty, too.\n\nUpdate: I have no photo syncing going on in iTunes, nor do I have any \"recently deleted\" items on my iPhone\n\n\nA: Set the date of your phone a few months back. These phantom photos should now show up in \"Recently Deleted\" section on iOS photos. Delete them from there, and then set the date back to the present.\n\nA: Since iTunes is showing the photos on there, are you not perhaps syncing photos from your PC? Your screenshot shows you looking at your Camera Roll which is indeed empty, but if you tap the < Albums button (visible at the top of your screenshot), does it show any more albums? The other option, as @Tetsujin suggested, is that the photos are still in your \"Recently Deleted\" album, which you will see when you tap < Albums.\nOnly photos taken on your device will show up in the DCIM folder on your PC, the same as a DCIM folder from any digital camera. Windows doesn't have access to the other directory where synced photos are stored so you won't see them in Windows Explorer.\nTo remove photos synced via iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes and connect your device.\n\n*Select your device in the iTunes window.\n\n*Select the \"Photos\" tab in the sidebar (iTunes 12) or under the main ribbon (iTunes < 12).\n\n*Deselect the option to sync photos or a folder to your device.\n\n\nA: move the Date on your phone earlier by 1,2,3 months and find the phantom photos in the Recently Deleted Folder. Next, delete the photos manually from the Recently Deleted Folder and then reset to your current date\n\nA: Set the date back 6 months or more if necessary, and keep deleting the \"deleted photos\" until there are no more deleted photos available.

LVM provides many advantages over using a regular partition none of which are assessable in the OS X GUI, but you can read more about it on that link if you are interested. In Linux disks, logical volums, etc are labeled different from eachother but on OS X a disk can be /dev/disk0 and a LV can be /dev/disk1 which can be confusing because they are different in many ways.\nNormaly you can only see the partitions that don't directly contain data by  opening Terminal.app running diskutil list.\nSo you may want to disable that setting to put the GUI back to it's simple defaults.\n", "Q: How to preconfigure wifi on Mac OS X (Yosemite)?

But this, I do not understand. I have 16 GB of RAM, 6 GB used, plus 2.5 GB app-cache, 1 GB file-cache and 1.5 GB reserved is a total of 11 GB used memory. But for some reason, I have 1 GB of compressed memory and about .5 GB of used swap. Whenever the system starts to use swap, it get's noticeably laggy. Because of this, I have to reboot about once a day.\nWhat do I miss here? Why swap? Why compressed memory? Why lag?\nMaybe there are some clevererer people than me around here. Any answer as to WHY is greatly appreciated.\nHere is a screenshot of the memory tab of Activity Monitor:\n\n\nA: The values in your image look fine. Since the system is lagging, why not measure things over time:\nvm_stat 60\n\nYou can let that run in a terminal to get an aggregate feel for when swapping happens and at what rate. It's highly likely that some other thing is the bottleneck like CPU or storage, but without seeing things change over time, it's hard to say what's causing the lag. I've never seen a system lag due to RAM without the memory pressure being yellow or worse, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to have.\nThat coupled with the fact that your system still has 10 GB of free RAM makes it even less likely it's contention for memory/swap causing slowness. Feel free to ping me if I miss an edit to the question with more data to go on.\n", "Q: Unable to delete IMAP mail account in Yosemite I have an IMAP mail account in the Apple Mail client that I want to delete.

What processes do I have to call from the command line to enable Internet Sharing, or conversely, what processes do I have to kill to disable Internet Sharing?\n\nA: I stumbled across a seemingly stupidly easy way to enable/disable Internet Sharing the other day. There's just a bit of prep work to be done first.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Network\n\n*Highlight the interface you want to share your connection FROM and click the gear below the interface list\n\n*Select 'Duplicate Service...'\n\n*Give the duplicated service a name and save it\n\n*Set the service to 'DHCP with manual address' (because some DHCP servers will not assign an additional address to a MAC) and input a valid IP\n\n\nThat's the prep work done. Now you just need to change your IS settings to share from the new service instead of the existing one. Then, you can use \nnetworksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled <networkservice> <on off> to toggle the network service you just created on or off. Doing so disables IS as there is no service to receive internet access from, and you still retain access on your machine because there is still an active interface connected to your network!\n\nA: I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Duplicate the \"Automatic\" location. I gave the duplicated the name \"Shared\".\n\n*On the \"Shared\" location, rename the Ethernet interface to \"Shared Ethernet\".\n\n*Configure the shared internet to use the \"Shared Ethernet\" interface.\n\n\nWith this setup, when switch from the \"Automatic\" to the \"Shared\" location, the \"Shared Ethernet\" interface becomes available/unavailable and therefore the Internet Sharing can be enabled/disabled.\nFrom here to using command line, is just a matter of calling\nnetworksetup -switchtolocation \"Shared\"\nor\nnetworksetup -switchtolocation \"Automatic\"\n\nA: First, bring down any active internet interfaces using the terminal command:\nifconfig [interface*] down\nThen a launch daemon found here:\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.NetworkSharing.plist\nneeds to be toggled with the launchctl command.\nthen bring up the interfaces with the command \nifconfig [interface*] up\n*Note: en0 is the wired ethernet interface, while en1 is the wifi interface.

You should only use this solution with Apps that you fully trust.  If you are just randomly downloading software and using this solution to bypass Gatekeeper, you will end up with a compromised system.  So, use at your own risk.\n\nA: I got the same message today as well. This worked for me:\n\nTo get around this, temporarily disable Gatekeeper as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*open System Preferences and the 'Security & Privacy' options\n  \n*Click the padlock at the bottom if it is locked\n  \n*Set 'Allow applications downloaded from:' to 'Anywhere'.\n  \n*Keep that open, but go back to your finder window\n  \n*Open JOSM.app it should work this time ...although you still get:\n\n\"JOSM.app\" is an application downloaded from the Internet.

Yes, I know that it wasn't a .app file, but that didn't seem to matter.\nNote: I found this out after the bounty.  I still would like to see a better answer, maybe with a cause.\n\nA: Solution for this is in another thread here: Gatekeeper preventing from opening files from Finder (launching apps is fine)\nShort answer: Check /var/db/gkopaque.bundle to see if the file is valid or damaged. In my case this was a zero byte file.

That allows all the clients to only spend time downloading non-junk.\nHave a look at Mail Route (10 percent off link from the podcast where I heard about it sponsoring most recently) - http://mailroute.net/thetalkshow.html\nYou probably will spend more on the service than the cost to run your Mac all the time, but the filters will likely be much better on the hosted site than OS X mail client.\n\nA: Yeah, the only thing I can really think of is setting up stricter filtering rules with your host, be that iCloud or Gmail or whathaveyou. You can weirdly only do this for iCloud using their webmail interface. You might also try using SpamSieve on your OS X inbox to train mail to sort items as Good or Junk; I believe those designations once determined are maintained for the iOS clients, but it takes a while to get it trained.

There are a few answers on old questions about the same issue under Lion / Mountain Lion. Now with Java 1.8 and OS X 10.10 I wonder if anything has changed? Would be great to have exact removal steps.\nIt really is asked too much, for Oracle to provide a proper uninstaller?\n\nA: An uninstaller might be nice, but you literally have to drag one file to the trash.

Occasionally when I ssh into another machine and then the connection dies (e.g. the Internet goes down or I move to a new location), the terminal window with the open SSH session is frozen and the only way I seem to be able to move ahead is to close it and start a new session.\nIs there some way to configure things such that if the SSH session's connection dies, I will be returned back to my normal bash shell, as it was before I executed my ssh command?\n\nA: You can suspend and then kill the ssh process that's hung up. To do this you have to issue the escape sequence, suspend the ssh process, and then use kill -9 to kill that process.\nThe default escape key for the ssh that ships with OS X the ~ character. You have to enter it immediately after a new line for ssh to respect it. And then the key sequence Control-z is used to suspend and background a task in bash.\nSo try this key sequence:\nReturn\n~\nControl-z\nIf it works you'll see something like:\nmyhost.local:~ |ruby-2.2.0|\n> ssh someremotehost\nLast login: Fri Mar  6 14:15:28 2015 from myhost\n\nsomeremotehost:~ |ruby-2.2.0|\n> ~^Z [suspend ssh]\n\n[1]  + 48895 suspended  ssh myremotehost\n\nThis line of output:\n[1]  + 48895 suspended  ssh myremotehost\n\ntell you the process ID of the ssh process on your machine. It's 48895 in this example. That process is still running, it's just been suspended and backgrounded. You need to kill it.\nYou can do that with the kill command. You want to kill it with prejudice so use the -9 option when you call kill like so:\nmyhost.local:~ |ruby-2.2.0|\n> kill -9 48895\n[1]  + 48895 killed     ssh someremotehost\n\nJust use the PID of your ssh process when you call that command in place of the 48895 PID I used above.\nAnd you'll have your prompt back.\nAlternatively, you can open a second Terminal window and use ps to find the ssh process in the process list and issue the kill -9 call against the PID. Though, that kind of defeats the process of getting your prompt back in the original Terminal window, doesn't it?\n", "Q: Script to relocate the menu-bar on dual monitors set-up Is there a script that could be written to achieve this:\nIn System Preferences/Displays... is it possible to relocate the menu bar ...via a script?\nMy set-up is one monitor and a Cintiq.

I tried Automator, but it's not recording the action. :(\n\nA: You can use a command line utility named cscreen to do that.  You can wrap it in a AppleSctipt script or in Automator.  You can download the cscreenIntel.dmg from the link provided. In a terminal use cscreen -h to output the internal help information.\nI have a MBP and a Thunderbolt Display so in a Terminal I want to have cscreen list my displays\n$ cscreen -l\nDisplayID  Index     Depth     Width     Height  Refresh\n5ac6fa7f       1        32      1440        900     0\n 3247b0f       2        32      2560       1440     0\nuse -h to display all usage options\n$\n\nSo to set the Thunderbolt Display to have the menu bar I run the following command:\ncscreen -s 2 -p\nI can then toggle it back using the same command as the Index shifts.\nIn AppleScript: do shell script \"/<path_to>/cscreen -s 2 -p\"\nIn Automator add Run Shell Script and add command: /<path_to>/cscreen -s 2 -p\nNote:  This is a simple toggle if you only have two displays however if you have more then two you'll need to write some logic flow into the script.\nYou can also use, cscreen -i <DisplayID> -p, e.g. cscreen -i 3247b0f -p to code with the DisplayID which doesn't change.\nThis can also just be used in a Terminal as a singular command or incorporated into a shell script without using AppleScript and or Automator. \n\nA: For multi-monitor setups the tool I wrote, displayplacer, does this.\nConfigure your screens how you like, drag the \"white bar\" to your primary screen in the macOS system settings, and then execute displayplacer list. It will output the command to run to put your screens in their current configuration. The screen with origin:(0,0) is the main display with the \"white bar\".

How can I determine whether the heat sink is no longer firmly heat-tied to the CPU?\nThis appears to be the case for a seven year old MacBook, but I'd like to confirm without going to the trouble of re-applying the thermal paste just to find out that the old CPU (a core 2 duo) will indeed trigger the fan even for simple tasks.\nI am looking for a recipe such as: Running a given process on a MacBook with a core 2 duo in a room with ambient temperature of 20C will not trigger the fans for at least 10 minutes.\nIn retrospect it's solvable. I can now run various jobs on each new MacBook and determine which processes trigger the fan. The same recipes should continue to work for the lifetime of a machine. If you have a core 2 duo and you can describe a specific testing recipe, please do.\n\nA: Notwithstanding what Buscar says - \nIf you suspect the paste, change it.\nFor the sake of a fiver you'd then be certain. \nI actually change the paste on all the graphics cards in the building every year, as part of a full strip & clean; though I only do the CPU coolers if I don't trust the existing application.\nOn non-Macs, cheap PCs, often the original paste is cheap & inefficient & simply changing it for good stuff can make a world of difference.\n", "Q: How can I automate pasting of password into SecurityAgent? On OS X 10.8.x I had an Automator service set up to paste a password from clipboard into the password window that pops up for mounting an encrypted disk.\nI don't wish to store the password in my keychain, and it is long and tedious to type out.\nI never got the applescript within the Automator service quite right. It would generate an error, but it still got the job done (i.e. the password was pasted). Since upgrading to Yosemite it seems the script in the Automator service doesn't work at all.

I can, however, have Automator actions perform that task. But it would be nice to see (for learning) how to achieve that with AppleScript.\n\nA: With thanks to input from markhunte and tetsujin, I came up with the following solution. With all things considered, the exact requirements evolved to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure a SecurityAgent dialog is actually present so that script doesn't run otherwise.\n\n*Reposition the SecurityAgent dialog because it can readily get in the way in its default position.\n\n*Display a message which will stay on top of 1Password, but is not generated through 1password, instructing the user to select the correct item in 1Password\n\n*Automatically copy the password for current 1Password item\n\n*Delay the script long enough for the password to actually end up in the clipboard, before the script attempts pasting it.\n\n*Paste the clipboard into the SecurityAgent, and submit it.\n\n\nI came up with the following solution:\nset appName to \"SecurityAgent\"\nset passApp to \"1Password 5\" (* set this to the name of your password manager *)\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n     if not (exists window 1 of process appName) then -- test if SecurityAgent window exists\n         return -- abort if SecurityAgent window does not exist\n     end if\n end tell\n tell application \"System Events\"\n    set position of window 1 of process appName to {10, 10} -- move SecurityAgent window out of the way \n end tell\n tell application passApp\n      activate -- bring 1Password to the forefront, run it if not running\n end tell\n tell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application \"SystemUIServer\"\n      set answer to display dialog \"Make sure correct 1Password item is actively selected (i.e. click it again if it was previously selected), then click “Continue” to proceed.\" buttons {\"Continue\"}\n    end tell\n    tell process passApp\n    (* If you are not using 1Password, you may need to change the menu item clicks, below, to whatever is correct in your particular password manager *)\n        click menu item \"copy password\" of menu \"item\" of menu bar 1\n        delay 1\n        set appData to the clipboard\n    end tell\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process appName\n            set value of text field 1 of window 1 to appData\n            if exists (text field 2 of window 1) then\n                set value of text field 2 of window 1 to appData\n                click button 1 of window 1\n            else\n                click button 2 of window 1\n            end if\n         end tell\n     end tell\nend tell\n\nI made the whole script conditional on the presence of SecurityAgent, because this script will be assigned to a keyboard shortcut, and if that key combination is inadvertently selected by the user, I'd rather they not be bothered with an unexpected script process.\nIf there are ways in which I could refine or improve this solution, please advise. I am very happy to be learning more about AppleScript. \nFINAL UPDATES: Had to make one final change. It turned out the button numbers for CANCEL and OK change around from the SecurityAgent instance for creating an encrypted disk/disk-image, and for when opening an encrypted disk/disk-image.

(e.g. partitioning/resizing the OSes partition) How is it that Disk Utility allows you to resize the partition that OS X is botted from live, while the OS is running?

I would have thought that booting into recovery mode to do these things would be a requirement.\nHere's what I mean, Disk Utility will allow me to \"Apply\" this change while booted in OS X:\n\nI'm not sure whether clicking the \"Apply\" button is something safe to do while the OS is live. Is it? If so, how/why?\n\nA: Although I don't know what specific property of HFS+ allows a user to modify the current system partition while in use; my expectation would be that operations to blocks of storage that the filesystem is not currently utilizing are allowed.\nNow if you tried to shrink the system partition below the current size of your system installation (the blue shaded area) disk utility would present an error.\nEDIT\nJust wanted to add some additional information that I came across. If you refer to the diskutil(8) man page under resizeVolume it states:\n\nNon-destructively resize a volume.

This will select the invisible new line character. Now hit command + c to copy this invisible character, and then got to\nEdit > Find > Find and Replace...\n\nand search for your copied character and replace it everywhere with just a space.\nNow you shouldn't have any more line breaks in your text. :)\n(On a side note, you don't need to replace with a space you can replace it with another symbol if that may be more convenient for what you're doing in Excel.)\n\nA: A simple technique which also works in Mac versions of Excel is to use the formula \"clean\". This removes all non-printing characters including line breaks.\n\nA: I had this issue for years and could not find the line break equivalent in Mac Excel, and now what I do is:\n1.I insert an empty column next to the column with line break issue then add the following command =clean(Cell number) \n*cell number will be the first row of the column with line break issue.\n2.Then grab the bottom right corner and drag the function through all rows.\n3.When finished dragging, copy the new column data and special paste it with values only in a new column, the new column is guaranteed to be without line breaks as the clean function gets read of all issues.\n\nA: If there are only a few of them, select the cell, then click in the formula box.  This makes the formula box act like a text field, so the arrow keys and delete and other editing functions will work.

I've checked Force Quit and it's not there, so I'm curious how you get rid of this thing.\n\nA: Check Activity Monitor to see if there are any Dropbox processes running. If there are, kill them, then you should be able to delete the Dropbox app. If you have used Dropbox at all, then remember that any files you synched will still be on your MacBook's HD in /Users/[your_username]/Dropbox.\n", "Q: Keynote control text box size How do I control the text box size in Keynote? My main problem is that I can't even select the box, though I can select text within the box. When I click on the paintbrush on the upper right of the keynote page, and then select Arrange, the dimensions of the textbox are shown, but greyed out.\nKeynote Help is no help. Usually Google can find the answer in such situations, but not in this one. There is just an assumption that you know how to select the textbox itself, rather than the text inside the box.\nI am using OSX 10.9.5 on a Macbook Pro. My Keynote is version 6.2.2. I do get messages that I should update Keynote, though I would first have to update my operating system. I hesitate to face the inevitable disruption just before giving a big presentation before a large audience, perhaps an unwise decision to try Keynote for the first time on this occasion.\n\nA: Selecting the box turns out to be easy (but is undocumented). You just click outside the box first, and then click inside the box. If one then selects text inside the box, one is able to select a tab labelled Text, when you can control Font and Font Size. Other tabs control other aspects of the text. \n\nA: If you select the text inside the box and click Command+C to copy the text and then click anywhere on the slide and click  Command +V. The text will then paste into a new box that does not auto-resize. Instead the text will stay the same size and the box will get bigger as your type. \n\nA: Short answer, use a rectangular shape as you were to draw a block, and then just type words inside it.  Then you can change its size freely.  However, this is NOT called textbox in Keynote.\nThe confusion/frustration comes from how Keynote and Powerpoint handle textbox.  In Keynote, I think a textbox can't be changed height wise, since it's supposed to big enough to expose all the texts in it.  So you can't arbitrarily change its size.  In contrary, Powerpoint let you change the size of a textbox freely even if you block some of the texts in it.\nMac OSX Yosemite 10.10.3\nKeynote version 6.5.3(2151) (don't think these matters in this case)\n\nA: After you insert the text box go to the format/arrange tab and set the width of the inserted and selected text box. This width will stay constant and will not change once you write/insert new text!\n", "Q: How can I play music while chatting in Google Hangouts? I want to play music while chatting in Google Hangouts and let both parties hear it, as well as our talking.\nI'm using Apple earbuds with a built-in (external) mic on a MacBook Pro from about 2009.  Conversation works fine, and when I play iTunes or something in QuickTime, I hear it through the earbuds, but the person I'm talking to can't.\nEnter Audio MIDI Setup, an Apple utility in OS 10.6.8 (in my case).  It lets me create an Aggregate Device, which can be used for input or output or both, but I can't find the magic combination to achieve the goal stated above.  Can Audio MIDI Setup do this?\n\n\n\nA: What you need is an audio loopback.  Basically, what it does is it takes the output from one device and \"loops it back\" to the input of another device.  \nYou're in luck.  There's an App that does that and coincidentally, it's called \"Loopback.\"\nMacworld has a good article on it and apparently, it's rated quite high.\n\nA: What you want to do is re-route your output into your input. ASss Tetsujin suggests, SoundFlower can do that.\n", "Q: How to release storage used for Backup? \nMy mac pro only has 13GB left, with more than 24GB are backups, how can I release these space? \n\nA: Looks like you have a portable Mac rather than a Mac Pro and Time Machine turned on. What you are seeing here are local snapshots. From https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14329 : To stop saving local snapshots, open Time Machine preferences and slide the switch to Off. Snapshots resume when you turn Time Machine back on.\n", "Q: Restore Applications folder to dock I have inadvertently deleted my Applications folder from the dock. I tried accessing the Applications icon in a Finder window and then I tried to drag it down to the dock. I did so to the lower left hand of the screen, but the Applications icon went away with a cloud image. Now, I have no access to my Applications.\nHow do I recover access to Applications?\n\nA: Open up a new finder window.

But I don't see clipboard mentioned, and haven't seen it when I've viewed backups in the past.\n", "Q: Can CS5 run on OS X 10.7.5? I've been avoiding updating my OS because I didn't want to lose the use of older applications. I just bought a new Airport Extreme which requires OS X 10.7.5 or later. I'm currently running OS X 10.6.8 and need to know if I upgrade will it run Creative Suite CS5?\n\nA: I'm running CS5 on Yosemite right now, (Photoshop is running right now, in fact,) and have had CS5 run on OS Xs all the way back to Snow Leopard or earlier:\n\n\nA: See adobe.com for details:\n\nAdobe Photoshop CS5, CS4, and CS3 were also tested with Mac OS X Mavericks and there are currently no known major issues.\n\nSo it's probably safe to assume that CS5 will work with 10.7.x as well. To be on the safe side, you should make a full system backup before upgrading and test CS5 afterwards (before you start to use it for real).\n", "Q: Torrenting slows down my network speed I've noticed that when I have Transmission running my network speed becomes very slow. Even if I'm only uploading data (the same is true even if the upload rate is low as 5KB/sec) via Transmission the download speed becomes very slow throughout the computer. It doesn't mattet if I'm browsing using Safari, streaming music in iTunes, if a software is upgrading itself etc they all become slow. As soon as I close Transmission everything speeds up again. \nI'm connected through my Airport time capsule. \nCheers.\nEdit: This is to clarify some things as mentioned in Tetsujin's response. \n\n\n*\n\n*I only get this problem when Transmission is running. Even if Transmission is downloading 0 KB/sec and uploading at 3 KB/sec I still have these problems, so it's not because I'm reaching maximum bandwidth. \n\n*I'm actually running through a VPN so my ISP should not be able to see that it's torrent traffic (nothing illegal here, I'm using VPN because I like anonymity). Actually Transmission is running through a udp port that I opened via my VPN provider. I've also tried running it through a tcp port, same issues. I tried randomized ports, same issue.  \n\n*I've tried using other torrent software and I think this actually might be due to Transmission specifically. \n\nA: This is not a answer but a comparison.\nI had to use it to show screen shoots.\nFirst here is my basis: (my WiFi connection)\n\nSecond here is a sample when downloading two large files (at same time). As you can see the download did not budge, so I am not at the limit.\nFirst file is 853 Meg size while second is 442 MB. Both are downloading with about 160 KB/sec.\n\nAnd I am using Firefox to access the download sites.\nHowever my example is strictly downloading. And there is no limit on download speed. How ever there is a speed limit to Upload.  As you know Torrenting could be tricky since you are also uploading (sharing).\nSo if you can limit the number for Uploading, that also uses your Internet connection and can slow it down significantly.\n\nA: Only when torrenting? \nDid you check you aren't hitting your actual bandwidth limit, either up or down?\nEither will hinder your speed. \nIf not, check you have QoS & WMM enabled on the wifi router. [idk how to do that on an Airport\nAlternatively, your ISP may be actively limiting you when it detects P2P.\nFrom http://www.wired.com/2013/05/optimize-video-stream/\n\nWMM (Wi-Fi MultiMedia) is a ratified certification that prioritizes network traffic based on four types of traffic: voice, video, best effort, and background. In theory, WMM should route your traffic automatically based on traffic type. Apple’s Airport Extreme has WMM on by default, and you can’t turn it off. Linksys, on the other hand, gives you the ability to adjust WMM settings.\nQoS (Quality of Service) does the same thing but at the application level. It also deals with the quality and predictability of networks, but you don’t really need to know any of that stuff. You just want to watch Downton Abbey without it looking like a copy of a copy of a VHS tape.\nWith QoS, depending on the router, you can prioritize applications or devices. The device prioritization will usually ask for MAC address. This is the unique number assigned to all devices for networking. You can usually find it near the Ethernet port, in a device’s settings, or the router will display it for all the devices connected to it. If your router allows it, prioritize both the application and the device to ensure you’re getting the best possible bandwidth within your home.\n\nAhhh…\nFurther research tells me the Airport has neither of these…\nFrom TopTenREVIEWS\n\nThe AirPort Extreme does not have parental controls, Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) or Quality of Service (QoS), which means that it is not able to prioritize different types of network traffic or guarantee predictable network behavior. It instead relies on the device to select the optimal band. It does have a USB 2.0 port for networked printers and network attached storage for Mac and PC users.\n\n…so you might be stuck.\n\nA: You don't mention your connection bandwidth, and that can be important. You should never use 100% of your upload bandwidth, or that will drag down your download speeds. \nSo, to check if this is the problem, can you answer this?\n\n\n*\n\n*what up/download speeds are you supposed to get according to your provider?\n\n*what do you get in speedtest.net when no torrents are running?\n\n*what do you get in speedtest.net when torrents are running?\n\n*does the change happen as soon as torrents start running, or takes some time? how long?\n\n\nNot really an answer (yet), but I can't post comments, so...\n", "Q: How do I transfer or sync u2 songs of innocence from My Library to my iPod? I have U2's Songs of Innocence in My Libray of my iTunes. I have a PC. How do I transfer/sync this album to my iPod? Clicking the \"sync\" button does not do it; it only syncs up all other albums. And, I have an iPod 5th Generation, not and iPod Touch.\n\nA: Check your sync settings. If all music is set to sync it should work out.\nAnother possibility is that they haven't been downloaded yet. In that case a small cloud should be next to the songs in your library. When you click it, they're downloaded.\n", "Q: How do I notify a blocked caller that he has been blocked on my iPhone 5? I have an iPhone 5 with iOS 8 installed and have blocked a person who is harassing me via my txt messages.  \nI do not have a phone number for this person as he is texting me via iMessage with his email address. This person lives in Norway and I in the US. \nI have researched and have found that when blocking a caller on an iPhone the caller will NOT be notified that he has been blocked. He will receive a \"message sent\" notification on his end. I do not want this caller to have the satisfaction of thinking that I have received his message. \nI also do not want him to have the satisfaction of receiving a text from me telling him that he has been blocked.\nI would like for him to receive a message notifying that he has been blocked immediately after he sends me a txt.  \nIs there any way to accomplish this task?\n\nA: No, this is not possible. Blocking a user will still deliver the message to your account, it just won't be shown. You can't prevent a message from being sent to you, except by creating a new account.\n", "Q: Remove partition and restore the space without erasing Time ago I split  the hard drive (500gb) in two partitions (250 each), now I don't need them anymore, so I have first erased successfully one partition and now I have still the second one (Mac HD 2)\nSee the image attached\n\nWhat I need now is to reapply the 250 gb I have gained from deleting to the Mac HD2, how is it possible?

I'm using a Mac with Yosemite (OSX Yosemite, 10.10). How can I create a symbolic link so I can open Sublime with the sub command?\nOne\nln -s 'Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' /bin/sub\n\nTwo\nln -s \"Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl\" /bin/sub\n\nThree (no quotes)\nln -s Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /bin/sub\n\n\nA: You're missing the '/' at the beginning of your app and sudo as /bin is owned by root and you can't actually write to it as a normal user. As you currently have it, it would only work if your present directory was the system root. This assumes of course that the Sublime Text app is in your main Applications folder.\nTry this…\nsudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /bin/sub\n\n\nOne afterthought: It's considered bad practice to change the content of /bin and /usr/bin because any upcoming OS X upgrade may wipe the content there. /usr/local/bin is the usual place to install user-provided binaries in, so\n[[ -d /usr/local/bin ]] || sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin\nsudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/sub\n\nmight be the better option.\nOr (as you probably never need to run Sublime Text from within a shell script), simply define a bash alias\nalias sub=/Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl\n\nwhich should be added to your bash startup file to make it stick\necho \"alias sub=/Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: Late to the party.

Bogon means the type of IP addresses that should not appear in a traceroute, like a reserved IP address.\nbogon on wikipedia.\n", "Q: Mac OSX 10.10 how to recover data To my greatest stress I did following today \nsudo rm -rf * tmp/ instead of sudo rm -rf tmp/* from home folder. And ta-da everything is gone from my home directory. Unfortunately I dont have time machine backup either. Can anyone suggest best recovery software for this situation?\n\nA: If you are still using the same computer, your chances of recovery go down with each minute of operation - recovering deleted files is time-consuming, recovering over-written files is impossible. And your computer is constantly writing things to disk.\nRestart the deleted machine in target disk mode and connect it to another mac. Get a copy of Data Rescue 3 and use it in deleted-files mode. You will also need alternate storage equal to the original drive size.\nAfter it's done recovering things you get to rename everything. The filenames are gone (overwritten) at the time of deletion, your stuff will be recovered with sequential names (Image001.jpg, Image002.jpg etc.)\nAnd I don't think we have to do the usual lecture on backups. Point is well made?\n", "Q: Is undoing Yosemite's CoreStorage conversion dangerous? I tried to make an 8 GB partition on my hard drive so I could make it into a bootable drive, like Recovery HD but without the need to redownload the OS, but for some reason Disk Utility wouldn't let me make a partition smaller than around 40ish GB. After some trial and error in an effort to make a partition of no more than 8 GB, I wound up with quite a bit of unused free space.\nI entered a bootable USB drive, prepared to wipe my HD into one volume and restore everything from a backup, but then I encountered this method for reclaiming free space that had me revert my HD back to its non-CoreStorage state. It worked perfectly to reclaim the free space and enable me to specify a disk partition size, but it seems too good to be true. (As in, I wasn't expecting it to be this easy so now I'm scared.)\nMy question: Is there an important reason why Yosemite always converts hard drives to CS volumes, such that undoing the conversion could come back to haunt me in the future? If so, how do I go back to CS?\n\nA: There are no obvious reasons to convert parts of the main drive(s) to a CoreStorage scheme - except for Fusion drives and FileVault 2 encryption - until now.\nTo convert your classical to a CoreStorage scheme boot to Internet Recovery Mode, Recovery Mode or an external bootable (thumb) drive, open Utilities/Terminal in the menubar and enter:\ndiskutil list to get the Disk Identifier of the partition to convert (usually it's disk0s2).\nThen enter:\ndiskutil cs convert DiskIdentifier with the DiskIdentifier found in the step above.\nThe conversion will take some seconds ( SSD) or up to minutes (HDD).\nAfter the conversion is finished, quit Terminal, open Disk Utility and check the result for errors. Then restart to your main volume and continue enjoying your Mac.\n", "Q: iMessage hacking I recently found a rather romantic exchange on my boyfriend's iPad.  He insists that he does not have any record of this exchange on his iPhone (which is linked to his iPad) nor does he know the phone number that sent the messages.  The iPad has the other person initiating the conversation and his responses.  Is it possible that he was hacked, or is he simply lying? \nHow Imessages come up on the phone bill? As texts oor data/emails?\n\nA: The devices are connected with iCloud, so if you receive a message on iPhone, the same message appears on iPad. They are synchronised... but they are synchronised by a COPY. If you remove a message from one device, it still exists on other devices. And deletions are permanent for a device (iPad, iPod, iPhone). So, he forgot to erase the copy. But is not the same with contacts, or calendar. Removing event, or contact from one device will cause the same action for another devices. They are synchronised fully. \nAbout messages, they are synchronised only when receiving or sending messages, not when removing.\nSo, there is a hope for you, if your boyfriend has a MacBook too. :-) They are not removed permanently from MacBook. Just send to that person any message from another device. Then a whole thread will be restored on his MacBook :-) If it happens then you are sure - he is lying.\nIt is impossible for an iPhone/iPad to be hacked by someone else.\n\nA: Though it is difficult to hack an iPad or iPhone, it is possible and people are coming up with new and inventive ways to do it more simply. It is also not that difficult to hack someone's iCloud account if you have the chance to get the password and send messages via the iCloud website. It will show up on other devices that are logged into the account as well but not necessarily all of them. Copies generally go to pads and MacBook/iMac/mac mini.

But the following Apple Support Communities post explained how to find it by trial and error:\n\nHere are the steps I used to correct, as even after removal from Launch control it kept returning on reboot:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open a Terminal Prompt\n  \n*Show non Apple startup Agents. At $ execute\nlaunchctl list | grep -v apple\n\nThis will look something like the following.\nPID Status Label\n-   0      org.openbsd.ssh-agent\n282 0      com.symantec.symsecondarylaunch.application\n274 0      com.symantec.quickmenu.application\n-   0      com.google.keystone.system.agent\n-   0      com.valvesoftware.steamclean\n-   0      com.oracle.java.Java-Updater\n276 0      com.Logitech.Control Center.Daemon\n302 0      com.google.Chrome.62228\n-   1      com.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.updater\n295 0      com.symantec.scannotification.application\n-   0      net.tunnelblick.tunnelblick.LaunchAtLogin\n275 0      com.symantec.savdiskmountnotify.application\n317 0      net.tunnelblick.tunnelblick.119880\n\nOne of the returned items is likely your issue, mine was also com.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.updater\n  \n*Change to the Agents directory, cd ~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n  \n*I also had to remove the actual agent files, as it kept re-appearing on reboot. You can view those on your system and remove. List out the items in directory: ls\nSharedServices.Agent.plist\ncom.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.plist\ncom.valvesoftware.steamclean.plist\nnet.tunnelblick.tunnelblick.LaunchAtLogin.plist\norg.virtualbox.vboxwebsrv.plist\n\n  \n*From ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ execute\nrm com.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.plist\n\n  \n*Also remove from Launch control with\nlaunchctl remove com.facebook.videochat.USERNAME.updater\n\n  \n*Exit and reboot\n\nIf I recall correctly then this videochat thing might also have been a plugin in her browser, which we then already removed earlier.\n", "Q: How to preview location of image on Albums on iPad? I am able to see image's location on Photos tab on iPad, but how to preview the same in Albums tag using iOS 8 Photos app?\n\nA: I use the View Exif app to extend the Photos app to have geo mapping visuals. It shows all the exif information I've ever needed so I'm quite happy with the value.\nI'm interested if there's another way, but this works great for me.\n", "Q: How to change location of specific keys I've spilled a coffee on my keyboard, as a result right and left arrows don't function any more. Is there a way to change locations or maybe to create a shortcut to represent those keys? for example shift + up arrow = right arrow, smth like that?\n\nA: There is a free app called Karabiner that allows you to modify the keys.\nA powerful and stable keyboard customizer for OS X.\nYou can easily customize from prepared settings.\nYou can also add your own settings by XML.\n\n\n", "Q: installation os x on Mac pro 2 from scratch I purchased mac pro 2 model no# a1186 few days ago with a new Hard drive . Now im trying to install os x from usb.\ni made bootable usb through another mac mini machine  by formatting it through disk utility and transfer dmg OS X lion 10.7 in it.\nNow issue is that i cant boot from usb and the Hd is new, nothing in it so how to boot usb on mac pro 2. \nI have tried key such as cmd (alt) + R  key but nothing happening. Its just shows grey screen and after few seconds question mark symbol blinking.\nAnd when press and hold \"R\" key . it just shows a mouse cursor on screen and nothing else.\nPlease guide me how to install OS x in it. Im in urgent.\nPS : am i making any mistake during making bootable usb or whats the key combination for booting mac pro 2 to usb?\n\nA: To make a USB installer from the 10.7 .DMG you need to open the .DMG, then open the installer application by right-clicking and selecting Show Package Contents and then find the actual installer itself, InstallESD.DMG.\nUse the Restore function in Disk Utility to copy InstallESD.DMG to your USB device (if you receive any errors, try mounting InstallESD.DMG first before copying it). You should then be able to boot your Pro from it :)\n", "Q: How to download bought apps without old credit card? I changed my residence and cancel my old credit card. Now I did a clean install of OS X and want to download purchased apps and free apps (Aperture, Keynote and iPhoto) but the App Store asks me for my credit card info and since I don't have it anymore I can't do it.\nWhat can I do? How to change my credit card info to that where I'm living now? Will that respect my purchased apps?\n\nA: Once you purchased an app, you can always re-download that app free of charge, given that the following criteria are true:\n\n\n*\n\n*The app is still offered on the App Store\n\n*The app is available in your country\n\n\nIf you moved countries and all the above is true for you, apps purchased elsewhere will be hidden, but can still be obtained by regularly searching for them.\nThey will state a price and you will need to go through the purchase process again, but once you entered the Apple ID you used to purchase the app originally, you WILL receive a message saying that you already own it and that the download will be free of charge.\nI know that this sounds scary and I always shiver until I receive that message myself, but having moved countries myself, I can confirm that behavior and never had any problems re-downloading an app (except for sometimes finding them among the many other search results when looking for it).\nOne thing, however, since you mentioned Aperture and iPhoto.  Since Apple is discontinuing those apps, if you want to keep them, re-download them very soon and make a copy (e.g. compress them) to store somewhere on your computer.\n", "Q: Can I use the same time machine backup for two macs? Is it possible to use the same time machine backup for two different machines? Is it possible to take the backup of my laptop and push it to my desktop?  If I make changes to one machine do the changes go to the other machine?\nI know I can restart and hold CMD + R and select a time machine.  So far though the time machine backup is not recognized.  I ended up with two sparse files.  So all the programs and stuff on one mac are not installed on the second mac.\n\nA: In a nutshell: No, you can't.\nA backup is not a synchronisation solution so there is always a 1:1 relationship between your main drive(s) and your backup. You can use Time Machine to backup multiple computers to the same network drive, but the backups will always end up as separate bundles.\nTo transfer applications/data from one Mac to another once, have a look at Migration Assistant (/Applications/Utilities/Migration\\ Assistant.app). To share data with ongoing updates from several machines, consider defining remote access/folder sharing on a master drive or look into rsync.\n", "Q: How to get correct file permissions from Macports pip installs? Macports sets up the ownership of its Python site-packages directory as root.wheel with world-readable permissions.  Python packages instally via port install have the same\n# ls -l -d /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages\ndrwxr-xr-x  151 root  wheel  5134 Mar  8 10:56 /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages\n\nThis of course prevents individual users from using pip install  to add packages, which is just fine since that really ought to be done as root.\nHowever, if one uses sudo or a root shell to pip install, the packages are installed by pip as readable only by root.wheel (740).\n% sudo pip install BeautifulSoup\n...\n% ls -l -d   /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/BeautifulSoup.py\n-rw-r-----  1 root  wheel  79567 Mar  8 11:09 /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/BeautifulSoup.py\n\nThis precludes my user account from actually importing or using the package (*).\nHow can I get pip to always put reasonable permissions on installed packages?\nUpdate (edit)\nI have reworded the question to emphasize that it is about pip installs only.  I would also like to emphasize here that the problem is not about needing write permission to the modules.  The problem is that the modules are being installed without read permissions.\n(*) A hack to fix it is to chmod a+rX the proper permissions (744/755) onto the newly installed package files\nUpdate 2 (solution)\nAs suggested by both Mark and Ian, and confirmed in a quick test, this has to do with the umask for root.  Here is the documentation on how to change /etc/sudoers for OSX.  Note that it is not necessarily a good idea to change the umask for all sudo instances!\n\nA: You can use virtualenv to create a local \"copy\" of the Python installation that's owned and easily manipulated by you. The advantage to using virtualenv is you can make many copies of the same version of Python, but with different versions of similar packages installed, and then switch between them with the virtualenv command line.\nThis lets you use different versions of libraries in different projects or incompatible libraries.\nTo install virtualenv:\nsudo pip install virtualenv\n\nAnd now you can use it yourself, without sudo, to create a virtual python owned by you:\nmkdir -p ~/Development/mypythonproject\ncd ~/Development/mypythonproject\nvirtualenv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\nFor example:\nIanCsiMac:~/Development/keybase-python |ruby-2.1.2| [git::develop]\n> which python\n/usr/local/bin/python\n\nIanCsiMac:~/Development/keybase-python |ruby-2.1.2| [git::develop]\n> source .venv/bin/activate\n\n(.venv)\nIanCsiMac:~/Development/keybase-python |ruby-2.1.2| [git::develop]\n> which python\n/Users/ian/code/keybase-python/.venv/bin/python\n\n(.venv)\nIanCsiMac:~/Development/keybase-python |ruby-2.1.2| [git::develop]\n> deactivate\n\nIanCsiMac:~/Development/keybase-python |ruby-2.1.2| [git::develop]\n> which python\n/usr/local/bin/python\n\nYou can virtualenv-install in your ~ directory if you want a default python that you control to be available at all times like so:\ncd ~\nvirtualenv venv\n\nAnd now you've got ~/venv/bin/pip available to you. You can modify your ~/.bash_profile and add:\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\nRight at the end of it to have your virtualenv available by default in your shell.\n", "Q: MacBook shows it is charging when MagSafe is green My MacBook currently shows this  even though the MagSafe charger has a green light.\nDoes anyone know why this is?\nIf it helps I am on a MacBook Air late 2010 with 819 cycle counts, 4,995mAh (currently), max capacity is 4,995mAh and the original capacity is 6,700mAh.

The update failed, although the cause isn't known. It was over wifi and the wifi signal was strong and consistent. Maybe the actual internet service cut out. I don't know. Now, the phone has been replaced, so it no longer has cell service either. I've been asked to retrieve the file off of it.\nI've tried hooking it up with iExplorer and it won't discover in there. I've also thought of jailbreaking it, but I'm not sure if that requires deletion of all the drive contents. I'm also open to breaking the thing open and somehow mounting the drive on another computer, but I'm not sure if there are adapters available for that or how possible it is. Maybe there's a way to restore and then recover the deleted files? Again, I don't know. I'm not typically an Apple user, although I do have access to Windows, Mac, and Linux OS's if need be.\n\nA: You could try out software like phoneview, but I'm asuming you're out of luck if it doesn't boot. \nThe memory is on the iPhones mainboard, so no way of external mounting. \n", "Q: Mirroring an iPad to a Samsung HDTV I have an iPad 2 which I would like to mirror NBC Sports Live Extra to my Samsung TV. My cable provider, Verizon Fios Quantum (New York City), does not carry the channel but allows subscribers to access it online using their Fios account. I, like many others, are hoping that Apple will announce a brand-new 2015 Apple TV at tomorrow's (3/9/2015) press conference or in the very near future. Until then, other than using a variety of cables and adapters or devices such as Roku 3, is there any way to mirror my iPad? Would Chromecast do the job? Thank you\n\nA: Sorry to give you such a short answer, but: no. \n\nA: I am looking for the answer to the same question, by direct screen mirror. So it seems like the answer is no... but there are some indirect methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use an Apple TV and stream to it, and with the Apple TV output to the Samsung TV.\n\n*Use a USB cable to stream to QuickTime on a Mac, or use Airshou or AirServer to do it. Then, output the Mac's screen to the Samsung TV by an \nHDMI cable.\n\n\nA: I know this is a dated question, but a few things have changed since it was asked.  Many apps on iOS now support Chromecast, and this includes the NBCSn app. The NBCSN app supports Airplay to AppleTV, and Chromecast, to Chromecast dongles and TVs.\n", "Q: Can't access one specific subdomain Using OSX 10.10.2 on a MBA 11\" I can't access \n\nhttps://developer.worldweatheronline.com\n\nI flushed the DNS, rebooted my machine, connected via iPhone instead of WLAN (I can access the site via iPhone directly, but not when using the iPhones Network-connection on the Mac.\nTested on all installed browsers.\nThe results of ping, traceroute and dig:\nping: cannot resolve developer.worldweatheronline.com: Unknown host\n\ntraceroute: unknown host developer.worldweatheronline.com \n\ndig: \n;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL, id: 20383\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\n\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;developer.worldweatheronline.com.

The ending period means \"this is all, don't add a suffix\".\nI'm running the following on my computer:\n\nc:\\> nslookup\n\n> developer.worldweatheronline.com.\nServer: mylocal.server.local\nAddress:  192.168.0.2\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName: developer.worldweatheronline.com\nAddress:  78.137.123.255\n\n> server 212.60.61.246\nDefault server: ns4.fcom.ch\nAddress: 212.60.61.246\n\n> set q=ns\n> set d=2\n> set domain=worldweatheronline.com.\n> worldweatheronline.com.\nGot answer:\n    HEADER:\n        opcode = QUERY, id = 4, rcode = REFUSED\n        header flags: response, want recursion\n        questions = 0, answers = 0, authority records = 0, additional = 0\n*** ns4.fcom.ch can't find worldweatheronline.com.: Query refused\n\nI would say that the people there have either failed to setup their named.conf file properly... or they've chosen an interesting (bad) IP address for their server by using what is normally considered a broadcast address of xx.xx.xx.255.  Some computers assume that .255 is a broadcast address and some don't.  This could explain why one client behaves differently from another.\nSomething else to note is that DNS lookups can sometimes involve three computers:  1) your workstation makes the lookup request from your local router, 2) your router then makes the query on your behalf and uses your address, 3) the distant DNS server then attempts to respond directly to your workstation.  In some cases, this un-initiated inbound attempt for that foreign server to respond directly to you fakes out your firewall so it blocks the response.\n\nA: Maybe DNS addresses that set in your Mac and iPhone differs. Try changing the DNS address on you Mac.\n", "Q: Can I make tmux scroll from my trackpad?

(Mid 2012 Retina Macbook Pro, 10.10.2) I have a Macbook Pro 10,1 (Mid 2012) running 10.10.2. Over the last few months, I have had issues with the system suddenly hanging - mouse won't move, keyboard does nothing, and the clock is stopped. I have to hold down the power button and restart the computer when this happens.\nI have been experiencing these freezes ranging from daily to weekly. There is no consistent action that reproduces the freeze on demand. At some point in the last few months, though, I did switch to Safari from Chrome as my primary browser because the battery life seems so much better when using Safari. I've been doing a project over the last week that is dependent on Chrome, and as such haven't been using Safari, and have had no freezes. In retrospect, I think the freezes began happening when I started using Safari regularly.\nI'd prefer to not have to choose between using Safari and having a stable system. Is anyone aware of issues like the one I'm experiencing? Any suggestions for further troubleshooting?\nEdit 5/28/15:\nI saved Console logs surrounding one of these freezes.

I'd like to try to organize the songs in my iTunes library (rename artists and albums, etc.), but my library's pretty large and it would be time consuming to manually edit my songs via the Get Info screen.\nIs there a way to mass-organize your songs? Ideally by exporting your library's song info to Excel, and then importing it back into iTunes?\nI've tried exporting a playlist as a .txt file, editing it in Microsoft Excel, resaving it as a .txt file, and importing it back into iTunes, but my changes had no effect.\n\nA: The free (and open-source) program MusicBrainz Picard would be a good option to consider. It can identify songs and albums by their acoustic ID's and automatically enter the ID3 tags. \nThe program will \"play nice\" with iTunes as well. Just use it to organize and tag your music, then do the following (copied from the MusicBrainz Picard website)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes, then go to File > Add Folder to Library\n\n*Point it at the top of your iTunes directory (\"My Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Music\\Music\" on Windows, by default).\n\n*iTunes will rescan your music.\n\n", "Q: Will updating Mac OS affect my Windows/Bootcamp partition? On Macbook Air, I have OSX 10.9.4 and it allows me to update to Yosemite, will this affect the Windows 7 partition that I installed using Bootcamp ?\nEdit: seems to work ok for one windows/bootcamp partition, but an additional windows partition will cause problems. I will add a detailed answer to my own question.\n\nA: Unless something goes wrong during install: no. But it's always smart to have a backup. \n\nA: Updating from OS X to Yosemite on Macbook air seems to work OK if you have one Mac partition and one Windows/Bootcamp partition. But ...\nIf you have two windows partitions then the update will cause problems, the new partition setup created by Yosemite update was:\n\n\n*\n\n*One very small partition (~ < 200MB), probably booting data\n\n*One Mac partition\n\n*One Mac recovery tools partition (~600MB)\n\n*One Bootcamp/windows partition\n\n\nThe MBR has space for 4 partitions (?!); so if you had two windows partitions, the second one (Fat32) might not be visible. In my case Mac could still see it and browse files, but windows 7 seen it as unpartitioned space.\nI booted with an USB stick (Minitool Partition wizard free), deleted Mac \"recovery\" partition (to make room on MBR), created that 2nd windows partition from scratch. Did that without changing starting point of Bootcamp partition, otherwise windows might not boot.\nYou are losing the ability to boot into Mac recovery tools. But in worst case scenario you can delete all partitions and boot from network to re-install Mac from scratch.\nI couldn't find a better solution to have two Windows partitions, tried re-installing and re-partitioning around 6 times, windows would fail to boot whenever I touched the bootcamp partition.\nThe tool should also work to re-size the bootcamp patition, as long as starting point remains unchanged.\n\nA: I just upgraded from Snow Leopard to Yosemite 10.10.5 2 days ago.  The upgrade took all evening.  However, when I went to restart the computer, Yosemite was installed and my Boot Camp was there with Windows XP working just fine.\n", "Q: What is the maximum memory limit for a MacBook mid-2010 with the latest EFI and SMC updates? According to Apple, the mid-2010 MacBook (not MacBook Pro) will support a maximum of 4GB of memory.\nI am seeing some references like this one which indicate that the latest SMC and EFI updates allow for more memory. \nAre there any more authoritative references to more than 4GB of memory working in this model of MacBook?\nWhat is the safe and cheap path to verify this myself? Can I get a single 4GB chip, replace one of my 1GB chips and see if the supported total memory is 4GB or 5GB? Worst case I've just bought the maximum 4GB, best case I prove that it can take more right?\n\nA: If it's indeed the last model of white polycarbonate \"unibody\" MacBook that Apple made prior to the discontinuation of the MacBook (non-Pro/non-Air) lineup then it will actually support 16GB of RAM (2x8GB PC8500 DDR3 1066MHz SO-DIMM 204 Pin) and that's vouched for by the specs for that system in MacTracker as well as by the reliable folks at OWC.\nYou'll want to verify your exact model identifier via the System Information app though (this app also used to be called System Profiler in older versions of Mac OS X). \nOpen up that application, select \"Hardware\" at the top of the sidebar pane, then look for \"Model Identifier\" on the right. If it reads MacBook7,1 and your \"Processor Speed\" is 2.4 GHz then you're good to go for 16GB of memory!\n", "Q: How to know if (and when) a shutdown occurred due to power outage I have a Mac in a remote location that operates as a server.\nIt's configured (from Energy Management) to automatically power up in case of blackout as the power comes back.\nHow can I tell if a power outage has happened (and the mac self-restarted later) and when ?\nI guess I can inspect the console, but what should I search for?\n\nA: If you can get to Terminal on your remote machine, just type uptime\nThis won't, of course, tell you why it was last restarted, but when.\n", "Q: Trim the middle of a file name I have a lot of files in a directory that have [!] in the file name. Is there a way to trim that out with a command in the terminal? Here's an example filename. file001[!].ext\n\nA: I would just use the 'sed' command.  You can run a for each loop over all the files and parse out the \"[!]\".\nsed 's/\\[!]//'\n\nfor loop version:\nfor f in /path/to/files/*; do\nrename=`echo \"$f\" | sed 's/\\[!]//'`\nmv \"$f\" \"$rename\"\ndone\n\nOtherwise I would suggest installing \"rename\" from homebrew if you have that installed.  I also have a Automator right click service that does batch rename's if you would like a graphical way.\n\nA: Yosemite features a graphical way to do this. Select all the files you want to rename, Control-click on them, select \"Rename x Items...\", and you'll get what is basically a find-and-replace window for file names.\n\n\nIn your case, select \"Replace text\" and substitute \"[!]\" with the empty string.\n\n", "Q: If i deleted something from iPad notes how can I get it back? If I deleted something from iPad  notes can I get it back somehow?\n\nA: If you have synced your notes with an iCloud account and your iPad is not connected to the internet you have a chance to access your notes at iCloud.com.\nIf your iCloud account is set with other devices like iPhone, Mac, and even Windows with iCloud application installed you have more chances to recover your note before connecting them to the internet.\n", "Q: How to set default finder window size? How do I set the default size of my finder window to a size of my choice? Currently each time I open a finder window, it opens up in a very small size and I have to adjust it before I can start looking for my files. I'm running Yosemite.\n\nA: Open a folder in list or cover flow view. Then press cmd+J. Now hold option key and press Return to default button at the bottom. New finder windows will be opened normally.\nYou can try deleting .DS_Store file in folders with false view.\nYou can also delete the normally hidden .DS_Store file with some utilities or with the terminal app and a command line removal - since Finder will recreate this file when it's missing, it's pretty safe to delete them.\n rm .DS_Store\n\nYou need to get to the directory so you can type cd and then drag in the folder that needs clearing. (Navigate one folder up in path view or using the title bar of the finder window) and drag the folder in to the terminal window after you type cd and space\n\nA: This works for me in MacOS Catalina, Monterey (in 2022) and Ventura (in 2023):\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Finder window, do not navigate to any folders yet;\n\n\n*Resize the window to the size you want (however don't move the window to your desired location yet);\n\n\n*To lock the location and size:\n\n\n*start by pressing the Command ⌘ and Alt / Option keys together and drag the window to your desired location;\n\n\n*release your mouse button first then release the Command ⌘ AND Alt / Option keys second;\n\n\n*Close resized window;\n\n\n*Any Finder windows opened after this will open at that size.\n\nA: Open a finder window, hold down the option key and resize the window as you wish. Close all finder windows and next time you open a new one it will remember the size.\n\nA: It is very easy to do this:\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Finder window.\n\n\n*As you resize the window, hold the Command ⌘ (not Alt / Option) key. Close resized window.\n\n\n*Then hold the Alt / Option key as you right click on Finder in the Dock and click Relaunch. Another way to implement this step is to press Command ⌘ + Alt ⌥ / Esc, select Finder from the menu to pop-up and click on Relaunch.\n\n\n*Any Finder windows opened after this will open at that size.\nNote: This does not work for windows opened from folders on the desktop.\n\nA: Previous solutions seem to have stopped working with recent macOS releases. Yesterday, I answered a very similar question related to both size and position of Finder windows. I am reflecting it here for completeness.\nThere's now a specific solution to Finder's lack of ability to remember its size and position. What's more, it seems to have been inspired by this exact question.\nFinderFix Give extra powers to your Finder windows!\n\nIf after all those years of using your Mac you are still fighting with\nFinder to get it to behave as you wish, look no further, FinderFix\nwill get it to open every new window in the exact same position and\nsize you want it to.\n\nI tried it, and it works as advertised. It also comes with some of the essential features of TotalFinder such as the option of opening all windows in tabbed mode or activating Cut & Paste with Cmd+X / Cmd+V, without compromising the System Integrity Protection (SIP).\n\n", "Q: Outlook 2016 Exchange Error I'm using the beta of the new Outlook 2016.

I can't seem to search for it as none of the search engines I tried would take the special characters.\n\n\nA: In my experience, that's a Safari Web Content process, although since you seem to be a Chrome user, it could also be Spotlight Web Content.\n", "Q: MPlayerX frame skip keyboard shortcut While playing a video in MPlayerX the right and left arrows skip ahead and back 10s respectively.

This process clears all the server-side data for a member including any App device tokens used for push notifications.\nProblem\nAt the same time as I reset the server database I have been trying to uninstall the app and delete any associated app data. I was hoping that if I did this the next time I install the App it would be like it was a first time download again. This is not working.\nHow I am doing this:\nI have tried the steps listed on the following site https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-devices_organizer/articles/remove_app_from_device.html.\nI have also tried uninstalling via the phone:\nUnder Settings > General > Usage > STORAGE > Manage Storage. I have been clicking on the app and then clicking Delete App;\nUnder Settings > General > Usage > ICLOUD > Manage Storage. I have been clicking on the current device, then selecting the app and turning off backup and deleting.\nI had hoped that this would remove all data so that when I reinstall via Xcode or Test Flight App, the app would start just like a first time user again. However this is not happening. The app still seems to remember some settings, in particular it thinks I have already sent my device token and won't prompt me for it again.\nQuestion\nHow should I be uninstalling an app form a device so that all app data is removed and the next time a reinstall I am treated as a new user?\n\nA: Please try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings --> General --> (iPhone/iPad/iPod/ect.)Storage --> Select app and \"Delete App\"\n\n\n*Go to Settings --> Profiles & Device Management (Could also be called \"Profiles\", if you don't use this feature, it will not be there) and delete any app data.\n\n\n*Go to Settings --> [Your Name] (At the very top) --> iCloud --> Manage Storage --> Select the app and \"Delete Data\"\n\n\n*Delete and re-install the \"Test Flight\" app\n\n\n*Completely reset the device (Press and hold Home and Sleep until the Apple logo appears)\n5a.

Can I have Yosemite safely installed next to it on the same machine? If so, how?\n\nA: Yes. You need to partition the drive into two volumes, and install Yosemite on the second partition. \nYou can, in theory, multi-boot your machine with any compatible OS until you run out of storage space. I have in the past had one machine boot with OS9, 10.3 and 10.5. You can also run two copies of the same version.\nHowever, you will run into fairly serious synchronization issues if you want to run cloud services. You will not be able to revert to Mavericks after using any service with Yosemite.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S 64GB not charging unless switched off My iPhone is simply not charging unless I switch it off while it is already plugged in.

Is it possible to set up he following combination of partitions; how?\n\n\n*\n\n*two OS X partitions, each bootable (one for the main system, another for testing new OS X releases)\n\n*a Bootcamp bootable partition for Windows 7\n\n*data partition shared between OS X and Windows?\n\n\nI don't need access to either of OS X boot partitions from Windows. And vice versa: don't need to access Windows boot partition from OS X.\nI use MacBook Pro 13\" 2010, Windows 7 64-bit, OS X Mountain Lion.\n\nA: It should be possible to partition the HDD like that but not in a default setup with Boot Camp and Windows 8/8.1 is recommended:\nThe hybrid MBR/GPT necessary for Boot Camp Assistant to install/boot Windows doesn't allow more than 4 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple CoreStorage or Macintosh HD\n\n*Recovery HD\n\n*your future Windows 8/(7)\n\n*a place holder in the MBR linking to the GPT (some count the EFI-partition as the fourth one, but this doesn't seem to be true)\n\n\nSo a different approach is necessary:\nSkip the hybrid MBR and use a pure GPT setup. Alternatively a multistage boot loader setup with rEFInd may also be possible.\nHere is an obviously working setup for Windows 8 (source):\nCheck the comments there before proceeding.\nWindows 7 may work as well with this guide. Here is an opposing point of view which claims that it is impossible to install Windows 7 in native UEFI-mode.\nWarning: These steps require you to completely  erase your hard drive! Make sure you have all the materials and have backed up all of your data before proceeding.\nMaterials:\n\n\n*\n\n*A recent MacBook Pro (this will probably work on other Macs, but I don’t have any to test with) I’ve tested this on the 1st-gen Retina 15″ and a 13″ 2nd-gen i5 model.\n\n*A disk drive capable of reading DVDs (you’ll need an external drive for MacBook Retinas or MacBook Airs)\n\n*A Mountain Lion Installer thumb drive\n\n*A CD/USB drive with the “Windows Support” files from Bootcamp\n\n*A Windows 8 Pro Install DVD\n\n\nProcedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the Windows 8 Disk in the disk drive\n\n*Option-boot the computer and choose to boot off the “Windows” disk (Do not choose “EFI Boot” but make sure that it does show up, you’ll need to use it later)\n\n*Once the installer gets to the setup screen, hit shift+f10. This will bring up a command prompt\n\n*Type the following commands (this assumes that you only have one hard drive):\n\n*\n\n*diskpart (this puts you into the windows partitioning shell)\n\n*\n\n*select disk 0 (this selects the primary hard drive, make sure you don’t have any extra drives connected)\n\n*clean (this erases your entire hard drive by removing all partition information)\n\n*convert gpt (this converts your hard drive from an MBR partition table to a GUID partition table)\n\n*create partition efi size=200 (this creates the efi partition where the bootloader will live)\n\n*format fs=fat32 (this formats the EFI partition as fat32 so that Windows can write to it)\n\n*create partition msr size=128 (this creates a “MicroSoft Reserved” partition… because microsoft)\n\n*create partition primary (this uses the rest of your free space to create a usable partition)\n\n*format fs=ntfs quick label=Windows (this formats the Windows partition and labels it as “Windows” which is what OS X will see)\n\n*exit (this exits the windows partitioning shell)\n\n\n*wpeutil reboot (this tells the computer to reboot)\n\n\n*Option-boot the computer when it reboots, but this time choose “EFI Boot” instead of “Windows”\n        Remember to press the any key to boot into the installer!\n\n*Choose to use a Custom Install and install Windows 8 to “Partition 3″ (The only primary partition)\n    Make sure you leave the install disk in the drive through the whole install or you could get a BSOD\n\n*Install the Windows Support software from your CD/USB drive to gain full functionality of your computer\n    Congratulations! You now have a natively-EFI-booting Windows 8 Install! Now, on to dual-booting OSX…\n\n*Open “Disk Management” in Windows.\nFind your “C Drive” partition and resize it by right-clicking on it and choosing “shrink volume”\n\n*\n\n*Shrink it by the size you’d like your OS X installations and the shared volume to be (e.g. if you want to give the 3 partitions 200GB, use 204800MB)\n\n*Right-click on the now empty area at the end of the drive and make 3 new “Simple volumes” Don’t format it.\n\n\n*Reboot the computer into your OS X Installer thumb drive\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*\n\n*Choose “disk0s4″ as this will be the 4th partition on disk 0\n\n*On the “Erase” tab choose “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)” since this is what OS X likes to use.\n\n*Give it a label that you like (e.g. “SystemML”)\n\n*Hit Erase\n\n*Choose “disk0s5″ as this will be the 5th partition on disk 0\n\n*On the “Erase” tab choose “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)” since this is what OS X likes to use.\n\n*Give it a label that you like (e.g. “SystemExperimental”)\n\n*Hit Erase\n\n*Choose “disk0s6″ as this will be the 6th partition on disk 0\n\n*On the “Erase” tab choose “ExFAt”.\n\n*Give it a label that you like (e.g. “WinMacShare”)\n\n*Hit Erase\n\n*Exit Disk Utility\n\n\n*Install OS X on your new partitions.\n\n\nIf step 8.2. fails you have to partition the unallocated space manually after step 9 in Terminal.app with \ngpt -r show /dev/diskNumber\n\nto get the partition table, and\ngpt add -b StartBlock -i IndexNumber -s SizeOfPartition -t PartitionType diskNumber\n\nto add partitions.  \nYou have to format the volumes afterwards with Disk Utility.\n\nA: Windows 7 and previous has a limitation of being on a drive with no more than 4 partitions. When BootCamp partitions a Mac HD and adds the Windows (NTFS) partition that makes the fourth partition, so if you add more after that Windows will likely become unbootable.\nYour plan has a total of 6 partitions, two of them hidden (and rather small) a boot partition and the system repair (bootable) partition. So it looks like you only have four. If you go into Disk utility you can see the other ones (may have to turn on debug mode to see them tho, don't remember...)\nYou may have to add a HD to the system to do what you want.\nNote this info  may have changed with Windows 8, I'm not sure.\n\nA: The answer is YES. My mid 2007 iMac is currently configured in such a fashion. My Windows 8.1 uses a BIOS boot. I have two NTFS partitions, one exFAT partition and two HFS+ partitions. (I also have the hidden EFI partition and the hidden OS X recovery partition) The exFAT partition is read/writeable from all operating systems.  \nDo you need to keep your current Windows and/or OS X operating system partitions? Or, will you be starting from scratch and erasing everything? If you need to preserve your existing windows system then I would recommend using WinClone (cost $30) to move the operating system (preferably) off computer to external storage temporarily. OS X can be backed up and move off computer using the disk utility. \nTo complete the install, you will probably need to boot from a flash drive containing a copy of the hidden recovery partition. Do you still have your hidden internal recovery partition and does it work? (Better yet if you have already made a flash drive copy) If you don't know the answer, then reboot your computer, then hold down the alt/option key and see if the recovery partition appears.\nI assume you have installed windows 7 on the mac before. If not, then do you know if you get \"Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install described here? If you do, then you will need to make a new install DVD.\nTo get things to work, the idea is to do everything opposite of what apple tell you to do. I would recommend the following steps (assuming the internal disk can be erased and you are saving nothing.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the flash drive.\n\n*Create a new GPT partitioned disk using the Disk Utility. The first partition will be for Windows 7, so format it \"MS-DOS (FAT)\". The second partition will be ExFAT formatted. The third and fourth partitions will be for OS X so choose \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\".\n\n*Exit the Disk Utility and select install OS X from the internet.\n\n*Boot to the installed OS X. Open a Terminal window and enter the command:\nsudo  bless  --device  /dev/disk0s2  --setBoot  --legacy\n\n*Insert the Windows 7 DVD and reboot the computer. Hold down the alt/option key and select the DVD to boot from. Hit the space bar when prompted to continue booting from the DVD. (You only do this once.)\n\n*Install Windows 7. Make sure you install to the correct partition and format the partition NTFS.\n\n*Install bootcamp drivers stored on a MBR partitioned, FAT formatted flash drive. The drivers can be downloaded under OS X from here. I suppose the drivers could also be copied to and installed from the exFAT partition.\n\n*Enjoy hours of installing hundreds and hundreds of updates.\n\n\nOf course, I have left out many details, but most of the time no one responds. After I while, I learn not to spend to much time on an answer, unless someone shows interest.\nUpdate\nI no longer use ExFat formatted internal partitions. I found ExFat to be unreliable. I now use MS-DOS(Fat).\n\nA: I used to believe that I solved the problem, but my solution only lasted a few months. For the record, here it is, in a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*create as many OS X partitions as required; Bootcamp partition and shared FAT32 data partition--all under OS X\n\n*now use gdisk from gptfdisk (as detailed in this post) to create MBR containing only Bootcamp, Shared and one of the OS X partitions chosen (so effectively MBR becomes a subset of GPT limited to only 3 partitions)\n\n\nThis setup lasted a few months until the shared partition became corrupted. Looks like it happened after a minor software update under one of OS X instances, which, in my belief, didn't involve recover partition--but I may be wrong.\nNow I'm looking for a best way to recover that shared partition--see a separate question on that.\n", "Q: How long does Safari's cache last? I would like to know Safari's cache lifetime. In case it has limited duration, also how to extend it.\n\nA: The Safari cache lasts for as long as the max-age header (see section 14.9) is set (by the server which is serving the file) for the specific file that is being cached, unless it is cleared manually. However, max-age=0 caches the file until the file is modified (or the server tells the client the file is modified).\n", "Q: Is intermittent high ping an issue in my Macbook or my router?

I have an iMac Retina 5K (27-inch, Late 2014) with 8 GB of RAM (2 * 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory modules).\nThere are 2 memory slots free/available, and I want to add RAM to these two slots.\n\nMy question is - Am I required to add only 4 GB memory sticks into these empty slots, or is it perfectly fine if I add a higher capacity RAM (8 GB sticks) in these empty slots?\nI don't want to swap out the existing 4 GB RAM sticks. I want to keep these two as is, and add two more RAM sticks of 8 GB each.\nI want to do this if I can be perfectly sure this works, and does not affect the system performance/reliability in any way.\nI reached out to Apple customer support, and the customer service agent told me he wasn't sure, and that I should just stick to 4 GB uniformly across all slots.\nAny of you good people have tried this already and have some advice?\nThanks\n\nA: The newer imacs support dual channel what means that tou can have 2 different sorts of ram memory.\nBut make sure that there are at least 2 of the same installed so:\n2x 4 gb and 2x 8gb should work fine. For more info, this link\n\nA: Yes, like on every other computer you can mix the ram sizes. \nThough watch for the frequences (they have to be at same or higher) and the compatibilites. \n\nA: I have mixed sizes on a 2012 iMac with no problems that I am aware of.  I recently purchased the iMac 18,3 5k 27-inch 2017 model. I will be purchasing 32.0GB (2x 16GB) 2400MHz DDR4 to go along with the 8GB (2x4GB) 2400 MHz DDR4 that comes pre-installed from Apple. In 2012, Apple told me there was no problem mixing sizes then, the same rules apply to the new models.\nBe sure to match the other specs of your old and new RAM (MHz and DDR4 type), but unlike in other things in life, \"size doesn't matter\"\n", "Q: How to rename disk indentifier?

When writing a message using Siri, the software will stop listening for the message at the slightest pause.\nFor example:\n\nMe: Send a message to John\nSiri: Okay, what would you like it to say?\nMe: Hi John...\nSiri: Okay, your message to John is \"Hi John\", would you like me to send it?\n\nAnd this continued every time I left a pause to think what I wanted to say next.\nReally annoying. Especially when driving or cycling.\nIs there a way to make Siri wait and listen properly?\n\nA: Just continue to hold down the home button (or Siri microphone button) after Siri has been activated and you have started talking.\nIf you do this, Siri will wait until you let go of the button to process what you have said, so you can make pauses to your heart's content without triggering the \"I've stopped\" action. \n\nA: No - Siri currently has no way to program the pauses to detect when you are done speaking. You could have siri open notes and then use the dictation feature to dictate your thoughts with pauses using the keyboard command and then edit them and then finally push that composed thought to messages, but it defeats the ease of using siri to automate the sending of your message.\nWithout knowing your context (Are you driving and totally hands free? Are you without function of arms/fingers either temporarily or permanently?) it's hard to see if there's a solution to your end goal, but your short term solution is to change the way you interact with Siri to leave less pause. Perhaps just skipping the formality of \"Hi John\" and just blurt out what you need John to know/do.\nOnce you've trained yourself to get the main message sent you can work on tacking on \"comma thanks so much exclamation point\" (or period) or whatever you wish to humanize the main point that's about to be sent.\n\nA: As far as I'm aware there is no way to get around this if you want to continue to use Siri from the lock screen or by holding the home button.\nYour only solution at the minute is either to make sure you say everything without pausing or enable and use the dictation feature on the keyboard - It listens indefinitely until you tap on 'done' so you will be able to pause to think without getting cut off.\n\nA: Or u could just go 2 the voice setting and change it 2 never expire, cuz that’s what I did.\n", "Q: Internet Recovery failed -1006f My problem is same as with this question\n-1006F error message when trying to recover mac\nI have follow that question which direct me to this thread\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/22273842#22273842\nfrom this link it says I need to buy new harddisk, so I bought a new one and installed it.\nNow when I boot up the macbook it automatically goes in to internet recovery, but again in middle of loading I still get the -1006f error again?\n\nA: It's solved already.\nThe problem is my internet connection not stable at that moment.\nwhen I had a stable connection it worked flawlessy!\n", "Q: How do I uninstall a Kernel Extension in Yosemite?

Following the pricing announcements on Apple Watch, it seems that the \"Watch\" edition is priced 200$ above \"Watch Sport\" ($349 vs $549 for the 38mm model).\nI can read the spec sheet but apart from different band options and another type of front glass and don't understand the differences.\n\nA: The Watch Sport is made of aluminium and glass and plastic composite backing.\nThe Watch is made of stainless steel, sapphire and ceramic backing.\nThe bands are different but those are priced as accessories and the materials there are pretty straightforward to deduce.\n\nA: In addition to the aluminium vs stainless steel case, The Apple Watch has a Sapphire crystal cover as opposed to the Apple Watch Sport's \"Ion-X Glass\" cover.\n\nIn addition, there are more options for bands that can be used with Apple Watch. Specifically, while the Apple Watch Sport is sold just with the Sport band, the Apple Watch is available with the Sport Band, the Classic Buckle, the Milanese Loop, the Leather Loop, the Link Bracelet, and the Modern Buckle. \nHowever, you can purchase any band to go with your watch as every band will fit every watch.

It seems that the new USB-C connector is good for charging, good for HDMI output, good for connecting to new devices that use USB-C connectors, and good for older USB devices like an old scanner, printer, external hard drive, and video capturing box.\nI suppose the older devices can be connected by using a USB-C to multi-port USB hub.  However, I wonder how this USB-C connector can be connected to multiple USB-C devices, HDMI output, and older USB devices?  For example, let's say an HDMI output adaptor is plugged into the Macbook, then how do you charge the Macbook, and how can another USB-C device as well as an older USB device be both plugged in?\n\nA: Although Apple named it USB-C, it's officially called USB Type-C.\nUSB Type-C does not allow daisy chaining like Thunderbolt or FireWire.\nThat being said, you will need a USB Type-C hub.\nUSB Type-C Hub\nA USB Type-C hub will likely have:\n\n\n*\n\n*One USB Type-C DFP (Downstream Facing Port) connecting to the host.\n\n*Multiple USB Type-C UFP (Upstream Facing Ports) connecting to devices or another hub.\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Multiple USB Type-A UFP (Upstream Facing Ports) connecting to devices or another hub (USB Type-A are the old USB ports).\n\n\nUSB Type-C hubs will need to comply with the USB 3.1 specifications. USB 3.1 provides backwards compatibility to older USB standards, therefore you would be able to add older USB devices with the use of an adapter or if the hub provides older UBS Type-A ports.\nExample: USB Type-C hub\nWith a USB Type-C hub, you could add multiple USB Type-C devices, for example 2 USB Type-C monitors, as long as the host can drive/support them. In that sense, USB Type-C hubs work just like 'normal' USB hubs.\nExample: USB Type-C devices\nLaCie announced a USB Type-C external hard drive. If you add this to a laptop with only 1 USB Type-C port (and this laptop also charges via that same USB Type-C port, like the MacBook 12\" mid-2015), then you cannot use the hard drive and charge the laptop simultaneously, unless you add a USB Type-C hub (that allows for charging) between the laptop and the hard drive.\nExample: USB Type-A devices\nYou could add a USB Type-C to USB Type-A hub or adapter. For example an Apple USB-C to USB, USB-C to HDMI or USB-C to VGA adapter. Thereby making old USB devices, like a keyboard or a scanner, available to your host.\nNote that using a USB-C to HDMI or USB-C to VGA adapter you can simultaneously:\n\n\n*\n\n*Charge your MacBook\n\n*Use HDMI/VGA\n\n*Use an old USB Type-A device (this can also be a USB Type-A hub with multiple devices).\n\n\nUSB 3.1 specifications\nPlease read the USB specifications, including USB Type-C, for more details: http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/\n\nA: The Apple HDMI and VGA USB-C adaptors have USB-C and USB ports as well as the HDMI or VGA port. See here, for example.\n\nA: The USB Type-C port is a curious beast. It is, in fact several connectors in one:\n\n\n*\n\n*A high speed data path\n\n*Power delivery\n\n*A USB 2.0 port\n\n\nNow, the high speed data path can be used for really speedy USB, 10 GBit/s \"Superspeed+\" mode. Then you can connect this to a speedier version of the plain old USB hub and have as many USB 1.1/2.0/3.0/3.1 devices connect to the hub as you wish.\nOr it can be used in an alternate mode. This can be a lot of things, currently DisplayPort, HDMI, MHL is supported but the potential is there for Ethernet and even PCI Express and whatnot. However, let me emphasize again: if you do this then your superspeed+ USB is not there. You can still use the power delivery lanes and the USB 2.0 port. The latter is a usual High Speed USB 2.0 port, goes into a USB for USB 2.0 devices.\nThere will be a lot of confusion because the charging only USB C connector on the (some video)/USB2/(USB C charging port) adapters is visually not distinguishable from the versatile port on the machine. Theoretically you could even build an adapter which has all sorts of ports on it and a button that switches which one is active.\nEven more confusion will arise when accessory manufacturers will create a SuperSpeed+ \"docking station\" that has a kind of DisplayLink chip in it. Remember, DisplayLink is the technology behind USB-to-DVI adapter but this time the bandwidth is quite there to do uncompressed video over USB 3.1 -- it's less than half of the available bandwidth. With compression you can even do a dual display adapter! At least for 1080p60 or 4k30 you can. Perhaps it'll even be possible to drive a 4k60 monitor this way. There's a possibility that such a docking station will feature one or more of the familiar blue USB 3.0 ports or even USB-C ports just for fun and confusion. Because these USB-C ports are now locked to USB mode and can't be used with native display adapters.\nOther docking stations, however, will switch the USB-C connector to DisplayPort, add an MST (MultiStreamTransfer) hub and drive three displays natively and happily (as long as they are only 1080p). These ports can have USB 2.0 ports but not 3.0/3.1.\nBasically there will be a tonne of scenarios where users can plug in something into an USB-C port and it simply won't work. At all. Or where you plug in a monitor, expect it Just Work and faced with needing to download drivers.\n", "Q: Set file metadata attribute values I'm trying to set the values of some file metadata attributes in OS X Yosemite - kMDItemDateAdded and kMDItemLastUsedDate - the values of which can be shown using mdls <filename>.

There is no option for it in the setattrlist function. The comments on this SO question go into a little (but not much) more detail. The \"Date Added\" value appears to be derived from some other seemingly inaccessible metadata value, not stored as an extended attribute.\nI would guess the same applies for the \"Last Used\" date.\n", "Q: Remove all items in mdfind How would I remove all of the items returned by mdfind?

It will give you a listing of items on your phone and their sizes. It takes about 15 minutes to create the table so be patient. You can see at bottom of screen that it is working.\n\nA: Without knowing precisely what you \"added up\" (\"usage data\" is more than a little vague), it's hard to say, but I suspect your numbers didn't account for things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*the OS itself\n\n*the size of each application\n\n*the size of overhead in any storage device, including flash memory\n\n\nNo matter what, the 1.7Gb is going to be the most applicable answer.\nYou might also want to look at this answer.\n", "Q: Podcasts play in Reverse Order I regularly listen to Podcasts from a radio station. These normally consist of a number of segments, which I download as individuals.\nOn my old iPod (iOS6) these played in Music in order.\nOn my iPhone5S (iOS8) they play in Podcasts in reverse order (last played first), regardless of the order I download them. If I select the 1st (usually the last unplayed in the list), it does not automatically continue with the list, although if I play the last it does, but the segments are in reverse order.\nIs there any way of making iPhone5S (iOS8) behave like iPod (iOS6)?\n(There is a similar 3 year old question - I hoped Apple would have fixed this bug by now.)\n\nA: When you select the podcast, click on the description by the icon (at the top of the page above the Unplayed/Feed heading with an arrow that takes you to another page) and it'll give you some settings. These settings allow you to set the order in which they play. \n\nA: I just figured out with Podbean if you click the all button to the right of the downloaded button the arrow is either going up or down  and that changes the order you can listen to the podcasts like it you want oldest first\n", "Q: Transfer PDF from OS X to iPad I download pdf files on my Mac, and often transfer them to iPad to read.\nThis used to be straightforward, but the process seems to be much more complex.\nI need to select the pdf, select \"Open in iBooks\" (which actually displays in Preview) then go through the process on iTunes to transfer it to iPad.\nIs there a simpler way. I don't actually want to read in iBooks on the Mac (which doesn't happen anyway)?\nAll I really want to do is transfer selected pdf to iPad. \n\nA: Use cloud storage like Dropbox, iCloud drive, or Google Drive and put your PDF files on it. I personally read and highlight Pdf files on an iPad app called GoodReader. With the app I can sync my highlight between Mac and iPad. The highlight from GoodReader shows on Mac OS X' Preview app without a problem, unlike Adobe Reader on iPad. If you read a lot of PDF then GoodReader is a worthwhile little investment.\n\nA: If your Mac is from 2012 or later with Yosemite, and your iPad is 4th generation, Air, or Air 2, then you can use AirDrop. Select the PDF in Finder, click AirDrop from the Share menu, and if your devices are on the same wifi network and have Bluetooth turned on, then you should see your iPad on the list of devices that you can send the PDF to.\n\nIf your devices don't meet the system requirements, or if what I described above doesn't work for any reason, plenty of 3rd-party solutions exist. My personal favorite is DeskConnect.\n\nA: As mentioned above you can use any iOS PDF reader or File Manager to transfer them via cable & iTunes. Good Reader or PDF Expert are one of the market leaders for PDF Viewers, both supporting iTunes file sharing & using custom PDF viewers (support different types of annotations, bookmarks, etc.) \nAmong the free alternatives, using standard iOS PDF viewer, I'd choose Documents by Readdle. Here's how it looks: \nIn short: \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPhone, Launch iTunes\n\n*Select device icon at the top bar\n\n*Choose File Sharing\n\n*Tap on the app icon you picked to be the file manager \n\n*Simply drag PDFs there\n\n", "Q: Vertical colored lines on broken screen -- is it just my screen? I cracked my iPhone 5S screen on pavement. It's currently not covered under AppleCare. I'm wondering, though, if it's worth it to take this to one of those companies that replace broken screens. From what I know, they just replace the glass -- am I wrong in thinking that it's not just the glass that's broken here?\n\n\nA: The glass and screen are fused together at the factory. Replacement kits, such as those sold by iFixit, include the glass, LCD/digitizer (screen), and other parts. Cell phone repair stores/kiosks use this same type of thing when repairing devices.\nIt's possible that additional parts inside the device were damaged, but it's also just as possible (and probably more likely) that the screen is simply too heavily damaged to display anything.\nAlso of note - Apple will fix a broken screen for $129 out of warranty, so keep that in mind when comparing prices if you move forward with repairs.\n\nA: It is hard to replace only the glass on your phone. So the price is some high. Apple charges $129 (plus tax) to fix a broken iPhone 5s screen. If you can't get to an Apple store, you can mail your device in to Apple for a shipping fee of $6.95. If you purchased AppleCare+ ($99 for two years) for your device, you'll only have to pay $79 for a screen repair -- though AppleCare+ only covers two incidents of accidental damage. My advice is that you can buy the screen replacement with the lcd digitizer and other small parts from a reliable supplier like hcqs.cc then you can do the repair easily.\n\nA: If you've powered off/on the iPhone and do not see any semblance of the iOS and or Home screen then I'd say it was more then just the glass that's broken.\n\nA: well for me that happened and i dropped it again after the lines showed up and it got a little bit better but still is kind of bad \n", "Q: Terminal git:master after oh-my-zshell installation I just installed oh-my-zshell.\nAnd my terminal looks like the image now. What is git master there?\nI installed oh-my-zshell on other macs, the look is not like that. \nI am on the root here BTW. \nCan you explain this, please?\n\n\nA: Typically some of the oh-my-zsh themes provide special prompts for directories that are Git repositories. The 'git master' just means that it thinks that the directory you're in right now is a Git repository, with new, unstaged changes. All of this has to do with source control. I don't know your background with source control but you can look it up if you're curious.\nI would start with looking at your ~/.zshrc file and see what ZSH_THEME is set to. Then, I would look inside ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ and look for the theme that's set in ~/.zshrc. This latter typically has the prompt set that you're seeing right now. After this I'd change the prompt to look the way you want. In your case you might just want to disable the Git-related stuff from the place where the prompt is setting those variables.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: i want to stop iMessages from being deleted I want to prevent my step daughter deleting message from iMessages so they can't be viewed (once you delete that using the more button you can't see it again) \nIs there a way to prevent that (disable that function)?\n\nA: There is no way to disable that function.\nBut you always can get another Apple device, such as mac or any of iOS family and login with her apple ID in iMessage section of settings.\nOnce you'll made it that will allow you get the copy of all the iMessage conversations.\nDespite the reason of your idea, I just want mark it as not so fair activity.

Now, my laptop currently has 2-2GB DDR3 1333 MHz for a total of 4GB. I wanted to upgrade my RAM to a total of 8GB.\n\nHere's my confusion:\nThe Apple Support page on upgrading RAM recommends 1600MHz for my model. \nSo what should I do? Stick with 1333MHz or buy 1600MHz?I'm willing to spend the extra money if the motherboard will be able to utilize faster memory. Will I notice a difference? Also, what about warranty? Will my warranty be voided by installing either of these myself?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro: How to remove or install memory article you linked does not state 1600 MHz for MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2011)!   It actually states \"PC3-10600 DDR3 1333 MHz type RAM\".  I would not purchase 1600 MHz RAM and instead purchase what is specified.\nAs to voiding the warranty for upgrading the RAM yourself, I was told at an Apple store that it wouldn't however If you live close to an Apple store and your Mac is still under warranty I'd suggest you have them do it unless you have the proper tools and knowledge to accomplish the task. \n\nA: The 1600Mhz will not harm your computer and yes it is faster. \nIt is unclear if you will notice the 1333 vs 1600, since the main speed improvement will come from memory size increase from 4 to 8 Gig.\nRecommended is not to mix old and new, so you will have to buy all 8 Gig of same type.\n", "Q: how to block udp ports I am more of linux and windows user, now forced to use mac as testing device, for testing a webrtc app, I want to block all the UDP ports in my macbook, how do I achieve it from commandline( or some tools)\n\nA: This is a good tutorial for beginning with \"pf\", because system preferences do not allow you to enter manual rules.\nhttp://krypted.com/mac-security/a-cheat-sheet-for-using-pf-in-os-x-lion-and-up/ \nI used to use the very good firewall fronted \"HandsOff!\" by metakine (but they sold it), where you can do what you like, but honestly I do not know whether there is a Yosemite update for that.\nUpdate:\nhttps://www.oneperiodic.com/products/handsoff/\n", "Q: Dire need to make Bootcamp work with Thunderbolt Display According to this Apple KB article, it's not possible to re-connect a Thunderbolt Display to Windows Bootcamp without restarting the computer.\n\nA directly-connected Thunderbolt device that is removed by\n  disconnecting the Thunderbolt cable will not be recognized until you\n  restart the computer.\n\nBut if the reboot sequence is able to send a signal to the display to power up, surely it must be possible to write some code that will run in Windows and do the same thing?\nAre there any tools out that can do this, or anyone with competence on the area that would be interested in writing a tool to do so?\n\nA: As the source of that info is Apple themselves, you'd imagine that they're probably best placed to offer advice on the subject.\nThis suggests that the 'fault' is not just Apple's, but requires Windows to be complicit. It would appear Windows 8 is capable, but requires the latest Apple hardware too.\nQuote\n\nAre Thunderbolt devices “hot pluggable” using Windows with Boot Camp?\n  The iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and the Mac mini (Late 2014) support “hot pluggable” Thunderbolt devices using Windows 8 or 8.1 (both as 64-bit only).\n  For all other Mac computers, Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 scans and activates Thunderbolt devices connected to Thunderbolt ports only during the Windows startup process. If your device was not plugged in at start up, Windows will not detect it without a restart.\n\n", "Q: Is my Macbook too old to edit videos? I got my Macbook Pro 15\" around 2011 to edit videos for my film school. I carried my MacBook around with me using Final Cut Pro 7 with no problem for around 2 years. I stopped editing videos after I graduated, but time to time I tried using Final Cut Pro again, but it won't let me edit without a huge lag. (I always use an external HD when editing videos) I can't even play the preview especially when I have some effects on it. I also tried using Premiere but my mac just half-freezes. Is it because my Macbook is too old and the processing speed is too slow? I'm not trying to make a 2hrs long feature film, it's more like a short film. This MacBook still works great with other software, so I wish I can find a way to edit videos again with this MacBook.\nP.S. I didn't update my OS yet. Should I??\nModel Name: MacBook Pro\nModel Identifier: MacBookPro8,2\nProcessor Name: Intel Core i7\nProcessor Speed: 2 GHz\nMacBook Pro, Mac OS X (10.6.8), Bought in 2011\n\nA: Your MacBook isn't the weak link in the chain, it's your external hard disk. The 2011 machines don't support USB 3.0 so you're either using Firewire 800 or USB 2.0 - the fastest throughput you're going to see on FW800 is around 95MB/s for RAID 0 HDDs and SSD devices.\nMore RAM will help with overall speed, 16GB is supported, but fitting an SSD and using it to store the video files you're working on will give you a much more responsive system. I don't do video but I regularly work with 500MB+ still images and working from an SSD is a breeze, archived images stored on a couple of LaCie 2Big Quadras take an eternity to load in comparison (over FW800, USB 2.0 really is painfully slow).\nAs for your OS, I still have a lot of love for 10.6. It may not feature the latest, greatest technologies but it is lean, solid and fast. I've tried 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10 on my photo machine and not found any performance improvements/benefits over 10.6, certainly nothing to offset the compatibility with older software offered by the Rosetta functionality. I'd advise you upgrade when the applications you rely on require you to do so, upgrading isn't otherwise going to offer any significant improvements for your current setup and workflow.\n*Forgot to mention using storage attached to the Thunderbolt port - this is pretty much the only way of leveraging the full available speed of an external RAID 0 HDD or SSD. It's an expensive route, depending on budget, but it may suit your purposes. I'd still consider the internal SSD idea though, seeing 15 second boot times and applications opening in one or two bounces makes you realise how much of a bottleneck an HDD is...\n", "Q: automator and python script utf-8 output I wrote a python shell script and it fails in automator workflow :\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nimport urllib, json, os, datetime\nimport locale\nlocale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'fr_FR')\n\nurl = \"http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/json/lefakir/ws?count=8\"\n\nurllib.urlopen(url)\n\ndeliciousFeed = urllib.urlopen(url)\n\nposts = json.load(deliciousFeed)\n\nfor post in posts:\n    print \" * {0} : [{1}]({2})\".format(post[\"n\"], post[\"d\"], post[\"u\"])\n\nThe problem occurs on post[\"n\"] and post[\"d\"] which have utf-8 symbols.\nIs it a common issue ?\n\nA: I found myself :\nprint \" * {0} : [{1}]({2})\".format(post[\"n\"].encode( \"utf-8\" ), post[\"d\"].encode( \"utf-8\" ), post[\"u\"].encode( \"utf-8\" ))\n\nIt was an unicode/utf-8 problem :)\n", "Q: IF statement doesn't work properly in osascript I'm working on script which should do something if application is running or not Also there should be a timer of checking(60 seconds) The problem is that \"if\" statement which is checking \"count\" doesn't work.\nHere is a script:\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript -e \"do shell script \\\"\n\nCOUNT=\"0\"\n\nwhile true;\ndo\n    if (ps aux | grep Skype | grep -v grep > /dev/null)\n    then\n        echo \"RUNNING\" > /Users/someuser/Desktop/RUNNING.txt\n    else\n        echo \"STOPPED\" > /Users/someuser/Desktop/STOPPED.txt\n    fi\n\n    sleep 1\n    COUNT=$((COUNT+1))\n\n    if ((\"$COUNT\" > \"60\"))\n    then\n        exit 0\n    fi\n\ndone\n\n\\\" with administrator privileges\"\n\n\nA: This way works:\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript -e do shell script \\\"\n\nCOUNT=0\n\nwhile true;\ndo\n    if (ps aux | grep Skype | grep -v grep > /dev/null)\n    then\n        echo 'RUNNING' > /Users/someuser/Desktop/RUNNING.txt\n    else\n        echo 'STOPPED' > /Users/someuser/Desktop/STOPPED.txt\n    fi\n\n    sleep 1\n    COUNT=$((COUNT+1))\n\n    if (($COUNT > 60))\n    then\n        exit 0\n    fi\n\ndone\n\\\" with administrator privileges\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't need the quotes before do shell script, as this is an applescript sentence.\n\n*Avoid unnecessary double quotes to prevent errors.\n\n", "Q: Automator \"Filter Finder Items\" issues with spotlight When using an automator workflow with the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Specified Finder Items (some zip files)\n\n*Open Finder Items (with an unzipping utility)\n\n*Move Finder Items (to an existing folder)\n\n*Filter Finder Items (i.e. excluding folders)\n\n\nI get mixed results, most of the time the filtered Items are incomplete.

The MacBook only has one USB-C port, so I may need a USB-C adaptor to load my apps on my iPhone.\nIs the USB-C adaptor necessary to load freshly compiled iOS apps on my iPhone?\n\nA: You really need to make up your mind whether you want the latest and shiniest product, or whether you want a good development machine. Once you use Interface Builder, a 15\" MBP is the smallest that is usable without an external monitor. And once you use an external monitor, you are connected to a desk, and the portability doesn't help much. \nThe new MacBook is targeted at certain use cases. Serious software development isn't one of them. \n\nA: \nI want to do iPhone development with the MacBook.\n\nNo, you don't. Really, you don't.\nThat model is meant for users who value portability over everything else. Developing an iOS application (or, really, any other software product) requires many, many hours at the keyboard. You need screen space for editors, the editor's toolbars, the documentation you will refer to twice a minute, and the simulator to test the results of your labour. You don't do this during spare moments here and there. \niOS code also needs to be compiled - not a process for lightweight, energy-efficient systems. The MacBook isn't for video editing either, Apple has other models for this part of the market.\nI do software development with a 27 inch desktop, and it's about the right size. I also have an Air for remote work, but it uses my desktop for the heavy lifting and content delivery. My work would take substantially longer on a 13 inch screen.\n\nA: Developing on the new MacBook (Early 2015) isn't going to be any harder than using any recent portable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the simulator (this can be great at first, but you'll need to test on a real device later).\n\n*Build an IPA and upload it through iTunes (works over wifi) or TestFlight (works over cellular too). Both options would be really slow, but they can work combined with the simulator. There's no debugger though.\n\n*Use Apple's $19 adapter and add a USB hub if you need more than one device connected.\n\n\nA: You will need the USB-C to USB Adapter for this:\n\nThe USB-C to USB Adapter lets you connect iOS devices and many of your standard USB accessories to a MacBook with USB-C port.\nPlug the USB-C end of the adapter into the USB-C port on your MacBook, and then connect your flash drive, camera, or other standard USB device.

The screen is too small, the hard disk is too small, the RAM is barely enough. And to add insult to injury, you have to buy a dongle in order to get access to more than one port. No thanks!\nGet a refurb 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Pro (perhaps with Retina display), max out the RAM (from a third party like Crucial or Kingston), and pair it with a 27-inch external monitor.

All other disks (disk2 - disk11) are related to this recovery system.\nEssentially your HDD, the SATA-controller or the SATA-cable is dead.\nYou may open your MacBook Pro with this guide or another one available there if you have a 13\" and check the seating of the cable.\nCheck other answers here at apple.stackexchange.com (e.g. this one) or at superuser.com how to proceed then.\n\nA: Based on your \"diskutil list\" it looks like your partition map is gone.  This will most likely warrant data recovery options.  You could try using Data Rescue (http://www.prosofteng.com/datarescue4/ or something like it) and Target Disk mode to scan it yourself - if you have a second Mac.  \nBut if the disk is physically failing (which it appears to be), the more you work on it the the less likely you are to recover your data.  I'd recommend you find an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP) to assist you.\nhttps://locate.apple.com/ will help you find the nearest service provider.\n\nA: You could try using The Data Rescue Center. They have good services available for data recovery. It's especially nice because they don't need to send your hard drive elsewhere since they have a clean room on the premises. \nMy mother recently used them to get thousands of pictures back off an old hard drive that crashed.

Currently I boot OS X and Windows Boot Camp from an external Thunderbolt HDD. LaCie just announced a new external USB-C (USB 3.1) hard drive enclosure. Will I be able to boot OS X or Windows Boot Camp from this or any other external USB-C HDD on the new MacBook?\n\nA: Considering the just announced new MacBook isn't yet generally available there are very few people, if any, that can say they've actually connected a LaCie USB-C (USB 3.0) external drive to the just announced new MacBook and booted either OS X or Windows from the external drive.  That said, I'd be very shocked if one was not able to boot any OS that supports booting from an external USB device while connected to the just announced new MacBook that isn't yet generally available.  Especially considering the just announced new MacBook only has only the USB-C port (and an audio jack) for any type of physical expansion capacity it would be insane that past normal functionality was not capable.\n\nA: To me USB stays USB. \nType-C is just a physical form factor as Type-A and Type-B.\nSo yes it will work. \n", "Q: iTunes shows my iPhone 6 has several audiobooks and music from CDs but the phone itself says no content This happened with the most recent update.

I'm looking for an option to not disconnect the network for x number of seconds/minutes after the screen dims.\nHere's the situation (happens a couple times a day): I'm VPN'd in somewhere and have a bunch of SSH and RDP sessions open. I then have to go sit in a meeting where I'd be busy talking to someone or looking at a presentation.

I was on a Mac with no plaintext text editor installed, and needed to make a very quick change to a HTML file saved on a shared drive. I opened it in TextEdit, set it to \"Plain text\" in Preferences (which had no effect), hit Format > Make Plain Text, hit undo since that didn't help, then I closed TextEdit without saving. \nIt gave some warning about not being able to store previous versions of the file because the shared drive doesn't support that, and wouldn't quit until I chose \"okay\". I thought this would be fine since I hadn't saved any changes.\nSomewhere along the line, TextEdit had quietly deleted the original HTML file and created an RTF version. This unwanted RTF's creation date was from around the time I opened it.\nThere's nothing in trash, and I've tried \"Revert to\" in TextEdit (no previous versions).\nIs there anything I can do to get the original file back? \nOperating system is 10.9.5 if that's relevant.\n\nA: TextEdit is a plain text editor it you first set the preferences for Format to \"Plain text\" before opening the file.\nUnfortunately Auto-Save has it drawbacks and if you do not have a proper backup of the file I'd say you're out of luck since the file was stored on a volume that could not store versions of the file.\n", "Q: How to connect a USB-C-based MacBook to a Thunderbolt display? Given the new 12\" Retina MacBook doesn't have a Thunderbolt and only has a USB-C port, how do I connect it to an existing Thunderbolt display?\n\nA: As @Kevin McKenzie already said, and just to expand on it.\nAt present there is no adapter for the USB-C to Thunderbolt.\nHere is quote from http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/09/apples-12-macbook-gets-new-usb-c-power-vga-usb-and-hdmi-adapters/\n\nThunderbolt Gen 1 and 2 don’t support USB 3.1, Type C or even 3.0 for\n  that matter. An adapter wouldn’t have fixed this problem. However,\n  Apple is releasing Thunderbolt 3 later in 2015. It’s not ready yet,\n  because it’s developed with Intel and now Gen 3’s functionality is\n  tied to Skylake chips – which will replace Broadwell shortly. I know.\n  You’re thinking “But Broadwell just came out!” That’s true, but only\n  because of delays. Now, you may wonder how a new MacBook without a\n  Thunderbolt port or a Skylake chip will support a Thunderbolt Display.\nWell, in short it won’t. That is unless Apple releases a firmware\n  update for their Thunderbolt cables. Which they won’t. So it probably\n  won’t support it. Considering the last time they updated it, I think\n  we’ll see an update at WWDC, with a USB C port on the display itself.\n\n\nA: Right now, you don't.  The Thunderbolt display requires a Thunderbolt connection as input, and while Apple did announce some USB-C dongles yesterday, none of them were USB-C to Thunderbolt.  They may well come out with something in the future, or a third party may, or they may be releasing a replacement for the Thunderbolt display soon, one that also supports input via USB-C.\n\nA: If you go to the technicality the Thunderbolt Display, according to iFixit, is technically a DisplayPort monitor internally coupled to a Thunderbolt dock station with DisplayPort output, and the internal DisplayPort connection is actually detachable from the dock station assembly as a Mini DisplayPort cable (!)\nSo if you are brave enough to give the monitor a hack, with some quick drilling action on the chassis and a Mini DisplayPort extension cable you can actually detach the display from the internal docking station and use it as a standalone display and use the docking station portion of the machine independently. Ugly hack and probably not worth it since Apple already had a Mini DisplayPort+USB Cinema Display in the past.\nUsing one of that and a third party USB Type C to USB+Mini DisplayPort+Power adapter you can use that last generation Cinema Display on your MacBook actually.\n\nA: Apple have released a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter.\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter\nI have one of these. It works well, still providing access to the extra ports on the back of the Thunderbolt Display.\n2 issues I have with the adapter: (1) it is quite long and slightly unpretty and (2) the Thunderbolt Display intermittently does wake from sleep, requiring that I unplug and replug the adapter.\n\nA: If your display is Thunderbolt, it won't run even if you connect it properly to a mini-DisplayPort signal.\nIf you have a DisplayPort display, you can get things to work as follows:\nYou need three items to make this work. \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's USB C to HDMI video adapter\n\n*an active HDMI to DisplayPort adapter\n\n*an inexpensive Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable\n\n\nThis only lets the display itself work and you would need to connect USB to gain speakers and camera functions. \n\nA: Could this be a solution to connect the new MacBook to a Thunderbolt display?\nUsing the following adapters (and an Ethernet cable):\n\n\nA: Apple will surely have a USB-C Display coming soon. The display would provide USB2.0, ethernet, firewire, thunderbolt, etc. The kicker is that the display could also charge the laptop through the USB-C cable. So you basically get a docking station in your display with a single connection to USB-C. Very slick, even if the Monitor is 2x the cost of what it should be. =(\n", "Q: Mac OS X doesn't recognize hard disk I replaced my CD drive with a Western Digital 750GB hard drive using the iFixit guide.\nMy Mac for some reason throws error on any interaction with the hard drive,\nfor example on disk utility when I tried to create 1 partition of FAT:\n\nWhen I try to setup BootCamp I get this error:\n\nI have successfully managed to erase and format the hard drive while booting up to GParted, but I want to install windows on it.\nDo you have any suggestions?

I originally suspected a damaged SATA cable, but swapping the SSD into the optical drive bay and the HD into the primary hard drive bay solved the issue for me. \n\nA: In the off chance it is not a hardware problem with the cable, try creating GUID partitioned disk (GPT) with no partitions.

I like to use Ultimate Boot CD as it has a number of great utilities to test out your Mac.  It runs on Linux so it completely eliminates OS X from the equation.  And if you are wondering, yes, this will boot and work on your Mac.  I have been doing it on Macs going back to 2006.\nFirst, download, burn, and boot Ultimate Boot CD.  There are a number of HDD utilities you can run that will test out your drive for you.\nThere is a USB Flash Boot Drive option instead of a CD (I personally use this).\nBoot your machine by holding down the \"Option\" key before you hear the boot chime.  You will then be able to choose your boot device.\nThere are a number of HDD tests you can run.  Pick a simple test and run it.  \nNext, ff everything passes, try using a utility to delete/create a partition\nIf all works here, then you can attempt to create the bootcamp partition again.\nLet us know what happens.\n", "Q: Simple 3 line applescript - Error -128 I have a scenario where I'd like 2 separate applescripts.\nThe idea is super simple. 2 Applications, but only one runs at a time.\nExample: Close application 1, launch application 2 (and vise versa)\nHere are the 2 scripts I have:\nA.)

But now everytime I connect it to a Mac 3 seconds later a total crash of the system follows and the Mac needs to reboot.\nI tried with OS 10.10, 10.9 and 10.6 on three different devices. All systems crashed, so it's not my Mac.\nI removed the harddrive from it's case and put it into a new external case. Still crashing, so it's not the controller.\nIf I start the Mac into Recovery Mode and plug in the external harddrive there is again an immediate crash.\nThe disk itself still produces a good spinning sound but it's a killer-disk now... Problem is: I don't have any other PC with Linux or Windows and I want to get some files from the disk.

However, randomly the process would die and the HD would act like it locked up.\nFor me the solution was to stop Spotlight from Scanning the HD.  This allowed me to utilize SuperDuper again, to take the image from the HD, move it to a Sparse image, which I could then backup on a NAS or offside disaster recovery, freeing the HD for other jobs.  I included the steps from an [article that helped me] to avoid future dead links.\nExclude Specific Items from Spotlight Indexing\n\nThis is by far the simplest way to universally exclude something from\n  Spotlight searches and it works in all versions of Mac OS X\n\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences from the  Apple menu and choose the “Spotlight” preference panel\n\n*Click on the “Privacy” tab\n\n*Drag & drop folders or drives to exclude from the Spotlight index, or click the “+” plus icon in the corner to manually select hard drives or directories\n\n\nResult:\n\nSpotlight will now NOT scan your HD, thus it won't hit that corrupted\n  file or OSX unfriendly file.\n\n\nA: Following Matteos advice I installed Ubuntu using unetbootin on an external harddrive. It boots without any additional installation and I could access and copy the files immediately and format the external harddrive afterwards.\nNow it works again also with my Mac OS so there must have been some corrupt files on it who can crash the Finder.\n\nA: I had a very similar problem as OP. In my case the issue was a shortage of current available to external USB 3.1 SATA 6G enclosure.\nI have an iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013). I'm using it with Samsung 860 Evo SSD and external Unitek DisGuard Limpid R USB 3.1 SATA 6G 2.5\" disk enclosure. macOS is booted from external drive.\nInitially, I experienced some random complete OS freezes followed by computer restarts. Sometimes it was happening after couple hours of normal usage, sometimes sooner, sometimes later. I was associating each freeze (and restart) with high peak of multiple demanding tasks trying to be executed.\nI was using the enclosure with original USB 3.1 cable (USB A 3.1 <-> USB Micro-B 3.1) which came in the box. Fortunately, I also had another USB 3.0 cable (Y-shaped) with \"double connector\" from older external USB hard drive (USB A 3.0 + USB A 2.0 power only <-> USB Micro-B 3.0).

Aquamacs integrates with the Mac and offers the same comforts that any application on the Mac provides. Yet, it comes with all the ergonomy and extensibility you've come to expect from GNU Emacs.\nWe support the standard Mac user interface that you've come to love. For instance, in addition to traditional Emacs shortcuts like C-x C-f (open a new file), Aquamacs understands Command-O. Aquamacs behaves like a modern application on Mac (or Windows) when it comes to selecting, copying, pasting texts within Aquamacs or in between applications. Aquamacs offers nice, smooth fonts. Asian input methods work. It's easy to install and runs out-of-the box with no configuration. And all is built on GNU Emacs, so you can use your favorite Emacs packages!\n\n\nA: The Apple supplied emacs is terminal only/\nThere are two GUI based emacs Aquamacs which includes much configuration to make more OS X like and emacs for OSX which is just an unconfigured GUI build so is more similar to emacs on other operating systems.\nThe Homebrew emacs with the cocoa build flag is similar to the latter. However to run in the GUI you need to launch Emacs.app (either from the GUI or using the open command) not just emacs. From the Emacs wiki installation after the brew command is given as\n\nTo install using the --cocoa switch, one simply uses:\nbrew install --cocoa emacs\nto get some “pretty” colours add the --srgb switch:\nbrew install --cocoa --srgb emacs\nand finally link it to your Applications folder:\nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/24.4/Emacs.app /Applications\nAfter installation, using the emacs command in the terminal or shell will run the -nw version of Emacs.

If they're not, how can I identify where they came from? Why would they still be there after I just reinstalled Yosemite yesterday?\nHow can you tell what's an official part of the system, and what isn't? How can you uninstall 3rd party crap, short of rooting out individual files from within alllll of the folders in the three different Library folders, not to mention anything hidden in the /private directory??\nThanks.\n\nA: It's the kernel extension for JMicron SATA controllers, and yes it's official, as are the others. It's up to you if you want to delete them, I wouldn't bother as they take up minimal space. Check System Profiler before doing anything silly just to make sure your iMac doesn't require any of the listed extensions.\nExample:\n\nJMicronATA:\nVersion:    1.1.6\nLast Modified:  5/22/12, 8:19 AM\nLoaded: No\nGet Info String:    1.1.6, Copyright JMicron Technology Corporation\nObtained from:  Not Signed\nKind:   Intel\nArchitectures:  x86_64\n64-Bit (Intel): Yes\nLocation:   /System/Library/Extensions/JMicronATA.kext\nKext Version:   1.1.6\nValid:  Yes\nAuthentic:  Yes\nDependencies:   Satisfied\nSigned by:  Not Signed\n\n\nA: You're right that this extension isn't signed, but it does come from Apple and it can be loaded despite the missing code signature.\nIf check with kextutil in a shell this tells you some information not available in System Information, specifically:\n> sudo kextutil JMicronATA.kext\nDiagnostics for /System/Library/Extensions/JMicronATA.kext:\nCode Signing Failure: not code signed\nkext file:///System/Library/Extensions/JMicronATA.kext/ is in hash exception list, allowing to load\n\nThis \"hash exception list\" doesn't seem to be documented by Apple, but I think it explains the discrepancy here.  For some reason Apple didn't want to sign this kext, but they do have some special exception built into the OS that will allow it to be loaded.  \n(Perhaps approach was taken because it'll be easier in the future to revoke that right? though just speculating.)\n\nA: Knowing what Kernel Extensions are from Apple\nJMicronATA.kext is not part of OS X, but has been installed from some other source. The best way to know if it is from Apple is to read the Obtained from: field. For example JmicronATA.kext has:\nObtained from: Not Signed\n\nNot:\nObtained from: Apple\n\nAs a general rule you don't want to be using unsigned Kernel Extensions just like you don't want to be using Apps from unidentified developers. It is probably a good idea to disable unsigned extensions.\nDisabling a Kernel Extension\nBefore disabling an unwanted KEXT check that the Loaded: field has No, that way we know for sure that it is not being used. I strongly advise not to ever disable Apple KEXTs, even if they read Loaded: No.\nNext we open a terminal and change into the folder that contains the KEXTs:\ncd /System/Library/Extensions/\n\nNow rename the unwanted extension to have _DISABLED on the end.

It works well and it mounts a disk image when doing backup or when I enter Time Machine.\nWhen the disk image is mounted, I can access all the directories of my backups.\nHowever, I can't mount the disk image from the sparse bundle. If I try to mount it, Finder shows an error after few minutes (I don't know what is the exact name of the error in English).\nIs there a simple way to overcome this drawback? \nI have a WD My Cloud EX2 NAS and a\nMacBook Pro running Mac OS X Snow Leopard.\n\nA: To mount your .sparsebundle (requires command line), try\nhdiutil mount /path/to/sparsebundle\n\nEnsure that your EX2 is mounted as a network share on your Mac. Usually, this will involve mounting your Time Machine share to reveal your .sparsebundle.\nBe aware that this will take a substantial amount of time depending on the size of your .sparsebundle.\n\nside note: I tried mounting my sparsebundle on the WD My Cloud I backup to, and it seems that there isn't really much of an issue except for the sluggishness of browsing. Could you post the issue you're facing in your native language?\nBy the way, to find files in the sparsebundle, navigate to\n*.sparsebundle/Backups.backupdb/[name of your computer]/Latest\n\n\nA: The OP wanted to browse the TM backup without TM so this doesn't apply but I found this thread when I was trying to access my old TM backup. Here is my solution:\nExpanding on @Mic Channel comment\n\nIn System Preferences -> Time Machine, make sure \"show time machine in\n  menu bar\" is selected. Then Alt-click the time machine icon in the\n  menu bar and choose \"browse other backup disks\". Find your old Time\n  Machine volume and restore selected files.\n\nLike the OP, I also couldn't see my mycloud TM drive initially. These steps fixed it for me: \n\n\n*\n\n*I logged in to mycloud.local with my admin password and turned off \"enable time machine backups\". this stops the TM services and makes the drive available to other processes. I diagnosed this because I couldn't mount the sparsebundle with hdiutil mount - [\"resources busy\" error] (Sparse bundle on NAS - can't open \"Resource temporarily unavailable\"). \n\n*Go to Network and mount the network location \"mycloud\". make sure you connect with your username and password with which the TM backup was created. \n\n*click on \"Time Machine Backup\" and make sure it mounts as a drive. \n\n*Now go to the Time Machine program and \"Browse other backup disks\" and your backup computer's name should be there \nI found going through the TM interface easier than trying to find my file manually because the different snapshots only have the changed files.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you don't need to mount anything to get to your backups, use Time Machine's Enter Time Machine function and it will mount the backups for you. The file structure isn't really designed for direct access. If you have any problems connecting to the MyCloud try connecting as Guest, no password.\n\nA: It seems the problem is coming from the finder.

Even when all participants are using iMessage, it will not display either receipt.\n\nNote: Whatsapp does provide for this. Tap and hold a message. Tap \"info\". At the bottom, it will show who read the message.\n\nA: No, sorry. The reason being is that it saying delivered would have to guarantee that it was delivered/read by each phone and one message would not be able to do that.

I feel like my system right now is very unorganized with some projects on my desktop, home directory, etc. because of my ignorance on these things, I want to find a good, organized system.\n\n\nA: OS X spawns from two different cultures: Unix/POSIX and Mac OS.\nFolders like /usr, /var, /etc, the command line shell in the Terminal (bash by default) all belong to POSIX environment. Portable software targeting Unix-based systems (like git) go into /usr/local by default, or into package manager's defined location if installed by it (Homebrew uses /usr/local, MacPorts use /opt/local).\nLibrary, Applications, /System and others belong to Mac OS specifically. Apple's software, services, and GUIs of third-party apps go there.\nThe ~ symbol in path is a traditional way to denote path to current user's home folder. Things that must not be seen by other user accounts go into ~/... counterpart. For example, Mail keeps emails in ~/Library, but standard stationery templates in /Library.\nLibrary folders are supposed to be accessed by applications programmatically, not browsed by user via Finder. Since 10.9, ~/Library is hidden so that users won't unknowingly screw anything there.\nThere are no out-of-the-box recommendations how to store your files. They will be as good organized as you are good in organizing. They only thing to say in context of OS X is that your files must be in the home folder, but not in ~/Library, and probably not in ~/Public which exists to share files with others.\n\nA: This might be good reading material for all your questions.\nOS X Mavericks\nCore Technologies Overview\nOctober 2013\nhttp://www.apple.com/media/us/osx/2013/docs/OSX_Mavericks_Core_Technology_Overview.pdf\n", "Q: Airdrop from 1st gen iPad Mini to MacBookPro I am trying to copy a photo that I just took with my 1st gen iPad mini (with iOS 8.2) onto my late 2011 MacBookPro (with 10.10.2) and I can't seem to use Airdrop. Is this a restriction of the OS or the hardware and is there any way to overcome it?\n\nA: No. iOS 8 will Airdrop to and receive from a Yosemite Mac.

Because of that, I decided to modify my Spotlight preferences (System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Search Results) to only show results for Conversion and Calculator (everything else is unchecked).\nHowever, when I enter the equation 5*3 it picks the DVD Player app. Note that if I do 5 * 3 (with added spaces) it shows the calculator results, which is what I desire. So far, only 5*3 triggers the DVD Player app.\nI'm guessing Spotlights results are cached, and it's just using the cached results. Long story short: when trying to get Spotlight to show only calculator results, I unchecked everything in Spotlight's preferences except for Calculator. However, then Spotlight didn't work at all, even for simple equations. I tried to tinker, and checked Applications, and entered 5*3 and hit enter, assuming the Calculator would be used, but instead the DVD Player app was opened. I unchecked Applications and checked Conversion, which made the calculator work. But now 5*3 results in the DVD Player app opening, not the calculator.\nIs my hunch that Spotlight caches its results correct? If so, how long is this cache valid for (i.e. when will 5*3 result in the calculator being used instead of the DVD Player)?\nSimple screen capture:\n\n\nA: The first thing I would do is remove the Spotlight local store on your boot volume :-\nsudo mdutil -E /\nDo the above at a Terminal Prompt.\nYou might also try adding the entire volume to the \"Privacy\" pane in System Preferences→Spotlight.\n", "Q: iTunes says I have more photos than I really do I have a 5th generation, 16GB iPod Touch that has iOS 8.1.0.

The installation failed because \"recovery system can't be created\". So I backed up everything, and installed Lion on an external drive. From there, pressing cmd+R upon start (a feature available for only Lion and above), I was able to use Disk Utility to erase/reformat my normal HD. After that, I tried reinstalling Lion on my normal HD, with the external drive attached. This time the installation progressed quite far, almost to the end, but eventually it failed for the same reason as before (\"recovery system can't be created\").\nMy problem now is that every time I restart my computer, with or without the external drive (with Lion) attached, the installation of Lion on my normal HD resumes automatically, failing every time. I cannot even use cmd+R anymore. I am stuck, with no access to anything. I do not have the 10.6 installation DVD that came with my purchase years ago, so unfortunately that is presently not an option.\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: You should be able to boot to your external Lion disk by holding option/alt at startup to bring up the boot selector, and then selecting your external disk. Once booted, I would then proceed to erase the internal disk with Disk Utility and create a single partition, selecting GPT as the partition type and Mac OS Extended (Journaled) as the format type. If you want to be really thorough select the zero-fill option when erasing the drive, it may help if you still have issues with creating the recovery partition as it will check every sector on the drive and reallocate any it finds to be unreliable.\nWhile you're at it, make sure the SMART status of your drive is okay - it's not a guarantee your drive doesn't have any physical issues but it's a useful warning of impending failure.\n", "Q: Finder gets confused after using the mv command in the Dropbox folders I should mention I'm new to command lines.\nI want to rename files using the mv command in the Terminal. I type:\nmv oldFileName.pdf newFileName.pdf\n\nAfterwards, I use the ls command to check whether things work as expected. The presented list shows me what I expected: The old file name does not appear, but the new one does. \nHowever, when I use Finder and open the folder in which I renamed the file, it shows me two things: The old file name and the new file name. The file with the new file name is fine, but double-clicking the file with the old file name, I get the message\n\n\"oldFileName.pdf\" can't be found.\n\nWhen I use Finder to delete oldFileName.pdf, then both the damaged / \"missing\" oldFileName.pdf and the file newFileName.pdf are moved to Trash (even though I only right-clicked oldFileName.pdf to delete it). \nIt looks to me as if there was something wrong. What's the problem? Should I not use mv to rename files? \nAs a test, I checked what happens when I use the mv command on folders. I created an empty folder named oldFolderName, \nmkdir oldFolderName\n\nand renamed it,\nmv oldFolderName newFolderName\n\nAgain, the ls command shows me newFolderName but no oldFolderName. However, in Finder, I now see two folders with the same name newFolderName, which is a bit different to what happened when I copied .pdf files, but which is still an unexpected behaviour. Again, when I delete one of the two folders, both go into Trash.\nWhat's wrong? What's the right way to rename files and folders via the command line?\nEdit: I'm using OS X Yosemite, 10.10.2. I just made an observation: The problem I described arises in folders that are within my Dropbox. The problem doesn't seem to arise in folders outside my Dropbox. Could there be an issue with using the mv command in the Dropbox?\nEdit 2: The problem only seems to arise in Dropbox folders that I share with other people, but not in folders which only I have access to (and the NSA).\nEdit 3: Similar problems arise when I use the rm command in such folders. The deleted files are still shown in Finder, and trying to delete them in Finder results in the error message\n\nThe operation can't be completed because one or more required items can't be found.

The new MacBook 12\" has been launched and on the apple store the processor says \n\n1.1GHz dual-core Intel Core M processor (Turbo Boost up to 2.4GHz)\n\nDoes this mean that the Core-M processor will run at 2.4GHz or will it run at 1.1GHz?\nIf the Core-M does run at 1.1GHz would you be able to manual turbo boost it to 2.4GHz through some software?\n\nA: It will likely run higher than 2.4 GHz in bursts and then throttle itself as heat builds up and/or all cores are busy constantly at which time you should expect full load 1.1 GHz or better.\nSo - it will run at both speeds and many others.\n\nThere is no indication that the Intel CPU works any differently in the MacBook than all the rest recent Mac hardware. The lower number is a steady state / worst case / all cores are active and running and the heat being generated by the CPU is being removed as designed - you get 1.1 GHz clock rate for hours long calculations.\nWhen you wake the Mac from sleeping, it will generally start in power savings mode and the CPU only spins up cores / clock rate when there is work to do, but it will ramp up to the burst GHz (or possibly higher) once you have one thread worth of work to get done.\nIf your work is single threaded, you can expect performance similar to a 2.4 GHz clock rate CPU unless/until the internal temperature near the CPU raises close to the design limit.\nSince this product isn't shipping, only Apple's engineers really know how the case without a blower will cool the processor and what loads will run at which speeds.\nNo Apple software allows you to \"boost\" things on previous MacBook / Pro / Air - so it's hard to guess if they will continue that pattern.\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro - Logic board stopped working I Had purchased Mac Book Pro before around 14 month from one of the apple store.

Try to avoid closing anything that will inconvenience you too much.\n\n*As you're doing this, periodically check if the app is still considered \"running\" (ie. hold-click on the icon - if it says \"Force Quit\" it hasn't worked yet).\n\n*Eventually the restart task will terminate the stuck app. When you notice this, stop telling it to restart.\n\n\nThis is the only solution I've found. It's more art than science, but it looks like within 60 seconds or so the restart task gets rid of the broken app and everything is fine. For me, this was much more convenient than actually restarting the computer - some apps don't restore very well.\nI tried the same approach with Force Quit (ie. repeatedly Force Quitting) and got no results.\nEvery time this has happened to me I have been able to successfully bail out of the restart (usually by refusing to close apps that are blocking the restart) after it's closed the broken app.\n\nA: I had problems with the other solutions as my computer was stuck in \"attempting to shutdown\" mode.

I have set up our family with iCloud, using iCloud Family Sharing.  Currently, myself and my husband define our Family and use our Family calendar for household events. \nI also have a work iCloud account and would like to be able to subscribe to my home Family calendar from my work account so that I can see family events on my work calendar.  Is this possible, and if so, how can it be done (without adding my work account as a family member)?\n\nA: I found the solution from my iPhone (and assuming iPad).  Open your calendar app and click \"Calendars\" at the bottom.  Find your iCloud family calendar and click the information icon \"i\".  Scroll to the bottom and you will see the option to share the calendar.  Once you share, you can copy the link.  I'm using this for a DAKBoard display and it works perfectly.\n\n\nA: You can share a Calendar with anyone in your contacts list…\nRight click the calendar in the list on the left > Sharing Settings…\nStart to type the name & select from matching contacts \nAs I recall [it's been a long time since I set mine up], they must have an iCloud account to be able to actually use it, so you'd add their mac.com, me.com or iCloud.com address.\n\n\nA: Since macOS & iOS can handle multiple iCloud accounts, you can just add your personal iCloud account to your work Mac or iPhone in addition to the work account. \nYou may consider to turn all other iCloud options except the calendar off in order to limit the chances of mixing them up or bringing your personal email to your work Mac.\n", "Q: Blocked contact and multitasking menu iOS 8 What happens if I call or send a message to a contact I have blocked? \nDoes that contact show up on the recent contacts multitasking menu?\n\nA: Yes.

If I type something on the keyboard, then the callee become deaf instantly.\nSo the fan & keyboard sounds are very loud whereas my voice is quite low. How can I (try to) fix this?\n\nA: My checklist would consist of ensuring that the mic is not covered by dust/particles, try to use audio-recording software to make sure it isn't a problem with your voice chat software, and use an external mic to make sure it isn't a problem with the system itself.  One issue with the 15\" MBP 2011 is that the mic is actually near the left speaker grille, so if you're running more intensive software that will run your fan up, you may have issues with fan noise being audible on the voice chat.  Typing will also result in noise on the mic, moreso on the left side of the keyboard.  It's a specific design issue with the 2011 MBP 15\", and is noted by users on numerous Apple forums.  Making sure that the mic/speaker grilles are clean can help with the audio clarity; however, typing will always be audible on the mic.\n", "Q: Can't delete apps that are no longer available in App Store I have four apps that are no longer available in the App Store.

How do I remove all four of these apps to avoid getting that message when connecting my phone to my computer?\n\nA: The apps didn't have .ipa files in my system, which may have been part of the problem. What I ended up doing was a search in iTunes (the global search at the upper right corner of the app) for each one. In the results, there is an icon with three dots, clicking on that icon brings up a contextual menu with the option to delete.\nThat error message I was getting before no longer appears after that.\n\nA: Not sure if this will resolve it, but you could try removing the .ipa files from your computer.  \nIn Finder, navigate to \"/Users/your name/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications\"\nFrom there, you can try removing the .ipa files.  \n\nA: Just encountered the same problem. The files were likely removed from your computer but still present in the iTunes library.

In Word it is easy, you simply right click on the image and “Insert Caption…”, but I cannot find any way to do it at all in Pages?\nYou can set a ‘Description’ on an image, however that only affects voiceover, which I do appreciate! But I also want the ability to move the image and it’s caption together.\nI am using Pages 5.5.2, I understand that this is easier in Pages ’09, but I don't have that version anymore…\nEdit: The only method that I have found that vaguely works is to create a new text box, manually make the text box the same size as the image, and text, set the paragraph style to caption, and, finally, group the image and the text box together so that they are treated as a unit. I hope that there is a simpler way that I have just missed somehow!\n\nA: There's no automatic way of adding a caption.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your image is inline, add the text below using the Caption text style.\n\n*If your image is floating, you'll need to add a text box below the image. You can group these if you wish.\n\n\nA: I found a way to add Table Label in the Inspector for others who might be looking at how to add a caption. Click on Table in Inspector, and in the section with Header Footer select Table Label.\n\nA: I often make a table that has two rows. Paste your image into the top cell, put your caption in the cell below, and remove the borders. The figure scales with the size of the cell and the caption moves with the text. However, I can't do this on pages in iCloud, so if you are going back and forth with iCloud editing, grouping of objects seems more robust.\n", "Q: Automate Fn key switch when opening Excel So Microsoft released a free preview of Office for Mac, and it is pretty sweet.\nOne of my biggest problem when using Excel on a mac has always been that the most popular/frequent shortcut (F2 -> edit cell) was not available on macs (there was a default replacement, cmd-T I think, but not half as handy as F2).\nNow F2 is here in the preview, great! But one still has to either press the Fn key, or switch the whole Fn key row (link from Apple page). Hence the question:\nIs there a way to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*selectively only switch the F2 key, or\n\n*switch the Fn key row automatically when opening Excel?\n\n\nA: I think the best way to achieve this is to install a keyboard mapper program. I use Karabiner. Once installed (might need a reboot?) you'll then see a menu bar icon that looks like a rounded square probably with the word 'Default' next to it; it is suggesting you're using the default mapping profile. Click on it and select 'Preferences' to access Karabiner's prefs applet so you can edit the private.xml file and add in the mapping below. You should be able to find a button for \"Open private.xml\" under the \"Misc & Uninstall\" tab of the preferences window.\nPut this into your private.xml file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n\n  <!-- ============================================================ -->\n  <!-- Make F2 send as Ctrl-U for formula editing -->\n\n  <appdef>\n    <appname>Excel</appname>\n    <equal>com.microsoft.Excel</equal>\n  </appdef>\n\n  <item>\n    <name>F2 becomes Ctrl-U in Excel</name>\n    <identifier>private.map_F2_to_ctrlU</identifier>\n    <only>Excel</only>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F2, KeyCode::U, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nThat will now make it that when you hit F2, it will send to Excel the Ctrl-U sequence instead. Whatever F2 was doing before will no longer work, but it appears to be some kind of cut-and-paste.\nNote that I am doing this on a wired apple extended keyboard (from a Mac Pro) where F2 doesn't require Fn (the alternate functions like volume do), so I don't know what the non-numeric keypad or laptop keyboards will do, but perhaps you'll have to add either KeyCode::FN or ModifierFlag::FN to the left side of that mapping if it doesn't work right away. Then again, the Fn behavior might be a keyboard preference- I don't recall off the top of my head.\nIt is worth pointing out that in the mapping file I created for this, I defined it in a way that this mapping will only be valid for the Excel application, it won't do it for any other application.\nThe only other thing you might need to do in the preferences window is under the \"Change Key\" tab, there will now be a checkbox for \"F2 becomes Ctrl-U in Excel\" which will need to be checked.\nLet me know if that works. FWIW, I've used Karabiner for a few years now as a way to map the Right-Option key as a Windows Menu/Context key when running under Citrix Receiver (remote login to work PC) and it has worked well for me and updates have been painless.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the  Fn   key is interpreted before it even leaves the keyboard, so there is no way to 'fake it' later.\nI haven't seen that version of Office yet, but… if there is a menu item for the function, you should be able to replace it using System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts / App Shortcuts.\nHit the + button under the right-hand box, dial in the appropriate app, type the menu name & add any key combo you wish.\nEdit\nOn second thoughts, unless Microsoft have stopped ignoring the Mac toolbox guidelines, that may not be possible…\nSee Create or delete a keyboard shortcut for the delightfully non-standard way MS has chosen to implement this functionality.\n\nCreate a keyboard shortcut for a task\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*On the Tools menu, click Customize Keyboard.\n  \n*In the Categories list, click a menu name.\n  \n*In the list next to Categories, click the task that you want to assign a keyboard shortcut to.\n  Any keyboard shortcuts that are currently assigned to the selected task appear in the Current keys box.\n  TIP   If you prefer to use a different keyboard shortcut, add another shortcut to the list, and then use it instead.\n  \n*In the Press new shortcut key box, type a key combination that includes at least one modifier key (COMMAND , CONTROL , OPTION , SHIFT ) and an additional key, such as  COMMAND+ F11 .\n  If you type a keyboard shortcut that is already assigned, the action assigned to that key combination appears next to Currently assigned to.\n  \n*Click Add.\nNOTES   \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*To cancel the keyboard shortcut assignment, press ESC .\n  \n*Keyboard shortcut descriptions refer to the U.S. keyboard layout.

I have a 2010 MacBook Pro (2.4Ghz) with 4GB of RAM (2x2) and a 250GB hard drive that's about 85% full. It's been running pretty sluggishly lately even for basic tasks. It is 5 years old, but a new laptop isn't really an option for a year or two. I use it primarily for web browsing (lots of tabs) and some Photoshop work.\nWould I see more improvement from upgrading to 8GB of RAM or swapping out my hard drive for an SSD? Also what would the cost differential be between the two since I'm planning on only keeping this computer another year or two?\nAny insight would be helpful.\n\nA: Open up activity monitor and check your RAM usage. If it's high pressure (check the graph), or even swapping files, you will benefit from more RAM.\nAny computer will benefit heavily from installing an SSD. Expect everything to go 10x faster (not kidding). Also, it will make you not having enough RAM less of a problem, as it will speed up your swap.\nSo it just depends on your budget and needs.\nMy personal opinion if you can only buy one? Get an SSD.\n\nA: Depends on what you're hoping to gain from your upgrade.\nAn SSD will load everything faster, but RAM can keep more stuff open at once. If you find your computer being unbearably slow in literally everything it does, an SSD is the way to go, but if, for example, your computer only starts acting up once you open your \"lots of tabs,\" you'll want the RAM boost.\n\nA: Just did SSD upgrade on 2012 MBP non retina and it flat flies now. Was gonna do ram but my graph is low mostly it's just HDDs are sooo slow. Love it now! \n\nA: Go to Crucial.com (or any other similiar site that sells ram and ssds) and check out prices. Ram is a LOT cheaper than getting an ssd. If you can afford both, get both. If you're running Yosemite then 8gb will make a marked difference. If all you're doing is surfing the internet then go through your hard drive and free up a load of space, a cheap usb drive will take any data you need to store. Running PhotoShop will not get hugely faster with an ssd, just opening it. Running PhotoShop with only 4gb will be slow as it will probably spend a lot of time paging stuff out to disk.\n\nA: Simply…\nBoth\nSSD first - having that for your swapfile will immediately appear to 'speed up' the RAM, just because access times will be much faster.\nRAM second - as more RAM/less pagefile will be faster still.\nRough prices…\n500 GB SSD - $200\n4GB RAM - $33\nSource http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/Apple/macbook-pro-%2813-inch%2C-mid-2010%29 \nHowever, that's just a guide. Check Crucial from the home page & work through using your exact model, or download their scanner app to do it for you.\n\nA: It depends on your budget. If I were you, I would upgrade both RAM and change 512 GB SSD. There is also Super Driver bay to SATA HD adaptor available. You could put your HDD there.\n", "Q: Which firmware should I download for iPad 2 A1397?

Within my first couple of days, it became apparent that users were having performance issues reading from and writing to the file server (which had been a problem for several months before I started.) \nAfter a quick investigation, the RAID was near capacity (4.99 of 5TB used, 14GB free.) We decided to purchase an additional RAID system and are expecting it within the next two days. \nMeanwhile, I have been unable to successfully back up the data files. I have tried using Disk Utility to create disk images of the entire volume, as well as images of individual folders within the volume. It never completes and returns a generic error: \n\"Unable to create [folder].dmg. (Input/output error).\"\n\nConsole shows hundreds of the following error:\nkernel: disk3s2: I/O error. \n\nI ran diskutil -list in Terminal and confirmed that disk3s2 is the RAID volume. I have also tried to manually copy (or even drag and drop) important folders to another volume, but that has also been unsuccessful. \nDoes anyone have any other ideas that may help? This data is mission critical, so any and all advice is welcome.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The kernel: disk3s2: I/O error is indicative of a disk going bad and you'll need to replace the disk and rebuild the disk array in order to retrieve the data.

I have this folder /private/var/folders/bf/ with 3GB of what seems temporary files. Can I delete this folder?\n\nA: From a general safety for the system integrity viewpoint:\nAnything withinin the hierarchy of /private/var/folders/* can be deleted. zz included.   \nBut a restart should reduce the amount of temporary files and data in there anyway. \nQuitting well written applications does that too, as should a quick logout-login cycle. \nThe system will repopulate an empty /private/var/folders/* after it reboots.\nFrom a practicality and consequences for the users viewpoint:\nThere is a small catch: it is probably not completely without side-effects to just wipe all and anything under folders there. \nAlthough theses side-effects are few. Force deleting everything with sudo rm is possible but not the best option on a live system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some of those files might be currently in use. Thus making it difficult or unwise to just delete them all from a running system if one feels the need for that. You'd have to quit the processes using them first. This quitting the process is in itself, as stated above, often enough to have those files removed automatically.\nIf some databases, mainly generated by Apple processes, grow out of hand it might be necessary to move them to the trash, logout-login and then delete them.\n\n*A small number of applications or services may store some of the preferences there.\nOne example is NotificationCenter (NC) with your settings in there: your choice of applications and what of them to be 'in' there. NC rebuilds its preferences with everything in NC enabled. If you have many Apps and prefer most of them to not disturb you this is quite annoying even if only done once.\nBut then it is not really essential data that gets lost in this way.\nSince this practice is highly non-standard, it looks only Apple violates its own guidelines: I can't remember any third-party application storing important, not-supposed to be volatile, and non-temporary data in this hierarchy.\nConclusio:\nTherefore it is best to locate which of these folders belongs to your most active user, go in there and look for the biggest offenders to delete them manually. It is also prudent to learn which of your apps leave so much stuff behind. Quitting and restarting an actively cluttering app might often be enough to gain some space there. If the second catch is of concern, spare those files related to e.g. NC from deletion.\n\nA: You can safely delete anything in /private/var/folders/ but not the folder itself\nsudo rm -rf /private/var/folders/*\n\nQuit all apps before you do & reboot afterwards … and whatever you do, don't touch anything else in /private/var/, and do not delete /private/var/folders/ itself.\n\nRumor has it that one should not delete /private/var/folders/zz. This article implies otherwise, but if you want to be on the safe side, use\ncd /private/var/folders\nfor i in *; do if [ \"$i\" != \"zz\" ]; then sudo rm -rf \"$i\"; fi; done\nsudo rm -rf zz/*\n\ninstead.\n\nA: On Catalina, I have restarted my Macbook in recovery mode (CMD+R at startup). Then, I have opened the terminal to disable the system integrity protection by typing csrutil disable. Then, I restarted in normal mode. I closed all applications. I ran disk utility and clicked on first aid for my system drive. \nThen, I went to /private/var/folders/. It is now 2019 and I have found that some folders weren't modified since 2016 and 2017.\nThen, I copied the zz folder content to a USB drive. I went to the zz folder and I deleted all the folders that were not from today. I went to the kt folder, I copied the content in my USB drive and I deleted the folders that were not from today inside the folders 0 and C and T. Before restarting I emptied the trash bin. \nI unplugged my USB drive and I restarted in recovery mode, I re activated the system integrity protection, by typing csrutil enable in the terminal and that's it. \nI saved 50GB\n\nA: For what it is worth (meaning decide worth yourself :-), doing this is dangerous on Catalina (10.15).  I did this on a Macbook Air after the upgrade to Catalina.  It would not restart, and what a pain to recovery from Time Machine with bad internal screen.  \nI also had another bad screen Macbook Air (and bad keyboard, and bad trackpad, but I digress).  I was paranoid because I use that for development.  So instead I found online another trick.  Holding the shift while booting make the Mac go into \"safe mode\".  The Mac then booted into safe mode, and \"sudo du -d 1 -h /private\" confirmed 44GB.  After another reboot back into regular Mac OS X and the same command showed 3GB.  \nBTW, this did not work with a regular keyboard, I had to find an apple keyboard.  \nMuch safer, if a pain, to do that regularly.

There is some third party software out there which will let you mount it, however it's too risky.  You could very easily delete a file and OS X would no longer boot.\n\nA: I've been trawling the lists on this topic.\nIf you have a fresh install of Yosemite (not upgrade, clean install), you get a Core storage volume which is marked as NOT revertible. Hence the advice to use:\ndiskutil cs revert <G/UUID>\n\ndoes NOT work.\nI've tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot from recovery, can't convert the disk, nor delete the disk\n\n*boot from external install disk or USB installer, cannot convert/remove the primary storage\n\n*A post I saw, saying \"Turn on file vault, then after its finished, turn it off.\" (total elapsed time on my 1tb disk; 26 hours) Disk is still NOT 'Revertible'\n\n\nI've been trying to resolve this issue for 2 days now.\nAfter reading through hours of posts, the only way to revert a Core Storage volume to a HFS volume is to...\n\n\n*\n\n*start with a HFS volume in the first place\n\n*upgrade to Yosemite\n\n*revert the disk\n\n\nOtherwise there is nothing to revert to.\nMy current plan is to install Lion (it's the only installer I burned to disk in the last few years). Then install Yosemite, then revert the disk to HFS+\nMy logic is sound, but with wiping my disk (again), and the inherent loss of internet history, its unlikely I'll find my post here to let you know how I got on. \nYour milage may vary.\n\nA: as mentioned by klanomath, the reason you cannot see you Mac HD from bootcamp on your SSD MacBook Pro is because on that machine, the Mac HD is a CoreStorage device. \nIf you have been able to revert it to HFS+ as described then ok, If you can't revert it as per my post earlier, then you are stuck with it. You'll need to use a USB stick to transfer.\nI've done extensive research on this. I have not been able to find any windows drivers that allow you to read a Mac CoreStorage device from Bootcamp.\nIn anyone has found a way to do this, please post.\n", "Q: USB keyboard acting strange with MacBook Pro I have a Cooler Master Storm USB keyboard.  I have plugged it in to my new MacBook Pro.  The OS took me through the keyboard setup screen, and 'recognized' the keyboard as a standard US one.  Some keys work, other keys do strange things.  When I press c, it types a c after the cursor, instead of before.  When I type e, it types an e along with a space after it.  Is it possible that this particular keyboard will not work with Mac OS X?\n\nA: For anyone else with this issue...\nReferring to the user manual for the Cooler Master Storm USB keyboard, check the N-Key Roll Over mode (NKRO) as OS X doesn't support NKRO.\n", "Q: Pages - Why dont numbers like 6th format like they do in Word? Whenever I type something that involves order, like 6th or 2nd, in Pages, I want it to be able to do the behavior that Word does, i.e, make the 'th' or the 'nd' part a superscript. Is there any setting to do this? If no, is there any other possible way?\n\nA: To have this feature, you need to use Pages 09, where it can be selected in the Autocorrect preferences.  The Pages 5 released in 2013 deletes this feature, along with dozens of others, and has become useless for many purposes.\n\nA: You can manually make the \"th\" superscript.  Highlight the \"th\", then in the menu bar, select \"Format > Font > Baseline > Superscript\".  There is also a keyboard shortcut: ⌃+⌘++ \n", "Q: Which MacBook doesn't have any fans? I'm looking to buy a MacBook Pro (13\"), but I want it to be as quiet as possible.\nSo, which MacBook Pro doesn't have fan? Only the Gen-5 Broadwell CPU?\n\nA: The recently announced 12 inch sized retina screen MacBook (Early 2015) will be the first fanless MacBook to ship once it goes on sale. \nThe MacBook Air (11\" & 13\") and the MacBook Pro 13\" have one fan, the MacBook Pro 15\" has two.\n\nA: As Matthieu stated the only model without a fan is a new MacBook 12\".\nThe good news is that newest MacBook Pro Retina (13-inch, Early 2015) has only one fan which is on only under have load. I'm playing with this machine from few days (max out with i7 CPU) and most of the time fan is 0 rpm. (in my 15\" model they only slowed down, in 13\" is completely off)\nYou will like new Trackpad as well because in the settings you can make it more quite by setting Click pressure to Light. So the most loud thing is the keyboard. (but more quite then on the 15\" model - less travel keys)\n\nA: The recently announced MacBook has no fan.

Is that possible? Images can be opened in a number of apps but how to do it for text? \n\nA: Text is handled by default with copy/paste. While it would be possible to create an app that allows text to be sent to TextCrafter (or similar), and a new document to be automatically created from that text, it is not default in iOS. \nAs a result, the only option is to copy the text (which is available system wide) and paste it into TextCrafter. \n", "Q: Separate personal phone and company phone which were set up synchronized I bought a new iPhone 6 for personal use.

To open it, save it with Pages ’09 first.\" and Keynote reports \"This presentation can’t be opened because it’s too old. To open it, save it with Keynote ’09 first.\" How can I open these files without finding and installing an old version of iWork?\nEdit: The latest update, version 6.6 (2550) (as of October 16, 2015) opens Keynote '06 and '08 version files. I verified this on a file from 2007 and it works properly.\n\nA: This solution requires using Terminal. Do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup copy of your file\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*In the Terminal window, type cd (that's with a space after the cd) then drag your file to the window. It should insert the full path of your file (e.g. /Users/me/Documents/My\\ Great\\ File.pages).\n\n*Copy and paste the following command as a single line and press Return: gunzip --stdout index.apxl.gz | sed 's-:version=\"72007061400\"-:version=\"92008102400\"-g' > index.apxl\n\n*If you don't see any errors (such as No such file or directory), now type rm index.apxl.gz and press Return\n\n*Type exit and press Return and try to open your file. It may give you a compatibility problem report but should open.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe file index.apxl.gz is a compressed XML file that holds information about your document. The command in step 4 uncompresses the file and runs it through a search-and-replace program which looks for the version 72007061400 and replaces it with the version 92008102400 (I don't know what these versions mean but it appears to work). It outputs to an uncompressed version of the file, which is why in step 5 you remove the original, compressed file (iWork will used compressed or uncompressed files).\nNotes\nIf step 4 gives you a No such file or directory error, it's possible the index.apxl or index.apxl file is uncompressed, in which case you can replace the step 4 command with sed 's-:version=\"72007061400\"-:version=\"92008102400\"-g' index.apxl | gzip > index.apxl.gz, and step 5 with rm index.apxl.\nThis solution could be adapted to an Automator action by someone motivated.\nSource\nThis method is adapted from a comment on this Google+ post.\n", "Q: Alert me when a certain app/process isn't running Is it easily possible to have some sort of cron job or something run on my Mac that alerts / notifies me when a certain program isn't running?\nI use an app last.fm, and since it doesn't run in my dock I don't notice that the process might not be running any more.\n\nA: I ended up writing a simple applescript and creating a cronjob to run it every 10 minutes.\nWhen Last.fm is not running, this launches it.  when it is running, it does nothing.\nAppleScript:\ntell application \"Last.fm\" to run\n\nCronjob\n*/10 * * * * osascript /Users/Jacob/Documents/AppleScripts/LastFMRunning.scpt\n\n", "Q: Can I use Siri to tell me the time without using the Internet? I only use Siri when I need to know the time. And she can't do it 80 percent of the time.\nIn a scenario: phone is in my pocket, I am listening music through earpod. And I want to know the time without taking phone out specially in cold. But on the way internet connection sometimes sucks. When she finds the connection, she brings an article about Time magazine.\nAfter tries and talking to myself on the road. She tells me the time. \nBut sometimes I have to take the phone out, again it is cold and I already talked to myself in the crowd.\n\n\n*\n\n*me - Hey Siri, What is the time ?\n\n*siri - I can't get any request right now.\n\n*me - Ok Siri, What time is it?\n\n*siri - Here is a article about Time magazine. (WTF)\n\n*me - Ok Siri, Time, time, time.\n\n*siri - It is 19:08.\n\n*me - fckiss you siri.\n\n\nSo is there a way to force Siri to tell time without going internet?\nIt would be better if I could make her tell the time in my native language though. It is shorter.\n\nA: Siri needs the internet to do voice recognition. It doesn't understand your question without first sending the audio of you asking up to a central processing system.\n\nA: The basic answer to your question is that Siri, as of now, still cannot work offline. Cortina on Windows phone can, so there is hope that at some point in the future, Apple will bring that ability to Siri.\nI have a couple basic quasi-suggestions. The first is to use Voice Control. It's basically what came before Siri, and if you disable Siri, that's what comes up when you hold the Home button. Here's an article  that explains how to use this. I can confirm this is still available on iOS 7, have not checked on newer versions of iOS.\nThe second one is VoiceOver. You can enable in Accessibility settings that when you triple tap the home button (or maybe the pause button on the Ear Pods), it activates VoiceOver. Then the phone will read whatever element of the screen is selected. This works better if you're not listening to music, because then if you just push the home button to turn the screen on, the time will be selected, but if you're listening to music, it'll read your current track position.\nWhat I would personally do is press the pause button on the Ear Pods, then triple-press it to turn on VoiceOver, and hopefully it'll read the time. If there's no notifications.\nIf nothing else works, then you're stuck taking out the phone and glancing at the screen.\n\nA: With the exception of the phrase \"Hey Siri\", Siri must have an active connection to the internet to interpret it what you say.\nHowever, if you disable Siri, you will get the old-style Voice Control functionality. This can and will work offline. It just cannot do as much as Siri can.\n\nA: I don't really get how you worded this question but i'll answer it in two ways t could be interpreted.\n1~ Siri is unable to even listen to what you say without wifi connecton as siri is run through internet.\n2~ If you say something and siri goes online there is a way you can 'text' him.\nIf when you say something and it isn't specific or he mishears you, underneath the dialogue from you it should say'Tap to edit' if you tap here you can actually text him and he will just answer back in voice but this is only on the siri window not on iMessage\nI hope I have helped\n-Hayden\n", "Q: OS X repeatedly stops syncing contacts and calendar with Gmail For what feels like forever (but is probably only a year or two), OS X constantly ‘loses’ my Gmail password. This is particularly annoying, because I use two-factor-authentication with my Google account, and have to go generate a new password every time I see this bug:\n\nEven worse, I don't know there's any problem until I actually open the Contacts application (a thing I never do). I'll get text messages on my Mac, and wonder who the hell's messaging me, because it'll show up as a phone-number; meanwhile, I created a new contact for that person months ago on my iPhone, and it turns out Google hasn't synced to my computer in that entire time.\nI clear all the Google/Gmail entries out of my keychain, generate a new one-use password with Google, and put it in OS X, every time I see this. It just happens again a couple months later.\nDoes anybody know what could be causing this?\n\nA: Usually an easy fix is to remove the google account from your mac all together so that all info is taken off. Then re-add the account from scratch, it should resync everything and this usually stops it constantly asking for the password.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina 15'' Late 2013 Stoppped Charging Related questions here and here.\nHi everyone. This is what happened to me:\nI was giving a class, in a 200 people auditorium, and there were lots of power extensions and cables for everyone to connect their laptops while the class. I was running out of battery (about 20%) so I decided to plug my MBP to one of those connectors. I didn't notice if it started charging or not, I just trusted it would. Then after 20 min aprox, we had an hour off the auditorium, and when we got back, I connected the machine again, but this time I noticed the light in the charger didn't work. I thought it was an issue with the power, I changed the place but the MBP was not receiving any power.\nI asked to my students for a different charger (thinking it was a charger issue) but trying 2 different ones, still light didn't turned on, so I thought it was an internal hardware issue. (at this point the MBP was still on, with 5% battery or so).\nAfter class, I took the MBP to an official Apple Service center, they told me it was the \"Magsafe\" (like an internal little board that allows power from charger to battery?) and the charger, both of them seemed to be damaged. Most likely an overpower incident. I understood since it made sense.\nNow issue is they asked warranty Magsafe piece, the installed it but machine still not turning on. THey say at Apple Service retailer that could be Logic Board, but does that even make sense? Could a MBP still be on and working if logic board is damaged? I mean, the machine never got turned off, it was alive until battery drained out...\nNow we are waiting another freaking 4-5 days to get the logic board. I'm getting crazy since that machine is my main work tool. What do you guys think it could be?\nEDIT\nNow, I get that this specific model's parts are all welded, so, a new logic board would mean what other new pieces? I'm worried about the data in my hard drive.\n\nA: It is possible the logic board needs to be replaced. \nI would try resetting your SMC (manages the power in the laptop):\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n*Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.\n\n*On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.\n\n*Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.\nPress the power button to turn on the computer.\n\n\nNote: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.\nFor the full Apple KB Article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n\nA: Ok everyone thanks a lot for your answers and comments, it turned out magsafe, logic board and charger, all three needed to be replaced. Seems that logic board is not mandatory for the Mbp to be on. \n", "Q: How to have arrows for moving the cursor right and left when writing text on iPad? On an iPhone, I was writing text. Among the keys, I have seen arrows for moving the cursor right and left.\nHow can I have these keys on iPad ?\nThese would be very useful.\nWhy aren't these keys present on iPad ?\n\nA: At this point, there is no default functionality on the iPad for arrow keys. (I suppose the idea is to tap the text to position the arrow). There is a chance that there is a 3rd-party keyboard for iPad that would include arrow keys.\nThose arrow keys, from what I have seen, are unique to the iPhone 6 (and Plus) while in landscape mode. \nBecause of the way that the iPad can be typed on (two-handed vs. two-thumbed on the iPhone), there is a chance that arrow keys will never be brought to the iPad's default keyboard.\n\nA: Try holding two fingers at same time anywhere at virtual keyboard and you should be able to move cursor / marker left - right (keyboard letters become invisible in the meantime) using ios 9.x.x.\n", "Q: Finding iPhone 3G firmware version after full reset I \"reset all settings and erased all data\" on my iPhone 3G yesterday using iTunes.

The two cameras are, as far as I can tell, configured in completely identical ways.  And yet for some reason when I connect them to my Mac to import video, completely different things happen:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I connect one of the cameras, iPhoto launches automatically, the camera appears under \"Devices\" in the iPhoto sidebar, and I have the option to import video directly into my iPhoto library.\n\n*When I connect the other camera, iPhoto does not launch automatically. If I launch it manually, the camera does not appear under \"Devices\", and there does not seem to be any way to get iPhoto to recognize that the camera is connected, or to import video from it.  Instead I have to navigate to the AVCHD file in the Finder, open video clips using Quicktime Player, and then use Quicktime Player to Save the clips to my hard drive.  (This method works on the other camera, too, of course.)\n\n\nSince I am able to save video from both cameras to my HD, this difference in behavior is not mission-critical, but it is annoying and mysterious.

One of the cameras had a DCIM folder as a top-level directory (created, I can only assume, when I used that camera once to take a still photo) and the other did not.

I can't put my pincode in as my screen is broken!\nThe screen seems to be responding to key presses as it vibrates when I touch the screen where I think the numbers are, but this still doesn't work.\nDoes anyone know a way I can get a backup of my phone despite this issue?\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, entering the pass code is a security feature when you backup for the first time to a different iTunes/computer. You can't get around it, however its possible that Apple will be able to repair the screen without wiping the phone. Maybe even mention you haven't backed up the phone when you take it to get repaired and see if they can do anything for you\n\nA: Logic board works but no display, in other words the phone works but there is no way for you to see whats going on on it. My best suggestion its to take this phone to repair to a local phone repair shop. that way you get the same phone back and they don't need to reset the phone for any reason, unless you consent. The key here is not to loose that logic board which is the one that contains all the info, files that you wanted to back up. Apple will just process your phone as any other and they will replace for a another of same kind just like phone insurances. \n\nA: If you have previously synced your iPhone to iTunes, it should automatically sync your device (with 'Sync' button). This creates a backup of everything on your phone. So in case you did the backup previously on the different computer, try connecting to it. You should see some files by browsing the devices (audio/video recording, apps, etc.). In case you just need to backup the pictures, try to run Photos or Picasa app instead, you should be able to import these pictures directly from there. Then after you're happy with the sync and backup, you should consider restoring the device from the previous backup in the recovery mode.\nSee also the following steps depends on your circumstances:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to unlock your iPhone passcode if you have previously synced your iPhone to iTunes\n\n*How to unlock your iPhone passcode if you have never synced your iPhone to iTunes\n\n*How to unlock your iPhone passcode if you don’t have access to a computer\n", "Q: how to turn on empty iPad while loading? How do I turn on an iPad (first revision) during it is loading. Or how do I turn it on at all?\nWhen I plug it in, the display shows a battery symbol with a little bit of red juice on the left side (seems to be empty). Then the display turns off after a few seconds.\n\nA: All iOS devices do that after they have been completely discharged.\nIf it does not boot up with in 5-10 minutes of being plugged in, then it could be an indication of hardware failure. The battery is likely not accepting a charge.\n\nA: You are seeing the (very obvious) low-battery indicator. The battery does not have enough power to boot the device.\nA first-generation iPad is at least 4 years old - if it has been used regularly the battery has likely done enough cycles that it needs to be replaced.\nIf it has been left on the shelf for extended periods the battery has discharged itself - this is very bad for lithium batteries.\nAnd finally, you must use a high-capacity USB charger, the small cube for your phone will not charge an iPad, neither will a powered USB hub.\nAssuming you have a suitable charger, leave it plugged in overnight. If it still won't start, you need to replace the battery (or the iPad).\n", "Q: Font Browser on OSX? myfonts.com has a create feature where we can choose sample text and selected size while browsing hundreds of fonts.

Background\n\n\n*\n\n*I live in the USA and I have an iPhone 5S (version A1453).  It was bought under contract to Sprint and is currently locked.\n\n*My girlfriend lives in the NETHERLANDS and has an iPhone 5S (version A1457).  It was bought for full retail price and is unlocked, but currently on the Netherlands' T-Mobile network.\nWe are thinking about switching phones, because I have more gigabytes of storage and I don't use that extra space.\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Will her European iPhone 5S (version A1457) work in the USA (and on which major carriers)?\n\n*Will my American iPhone 5S (version A1453) work in the NETHERLANDS T-Mobile network?\n\nA: It's not going to work because Sprint will not let you add her phone to their network. Sprint limits subscribers to phones specifically sold for the Sprint network. Verizon has a similar policy.\nYou may, however, be able to get the phone to work with a different carrier. Many European companies typically sell unlocked phones, so if the phone was purchased in Europe, it may already be unlocked. In that case, the only issue would be to find a network that supports the phone in the United States. Considering that European countries often use GSM networks, you may be able to use AT&T, T-Mobile, and possibly some other carriers. If you need to use the phone for only a short time in the United Staes, you may want to buying an AT&T GoPhone sim card or a similar contractless service from another carrier.\nIf you do, however, need to use the Sprint network then you should keep in mind that the two phones support different LTE bands so it's likely that you both would lose access to LTE. It's not certain because there is some overlap but it's quite likely.\nhttps://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/\nHere's the FAQ for Sprint unlocking:\nhttp://www.sprint.com/legal/unlocking_policy.html\n\nA: Buscar웃 brought up a good point in his comment. You can theoretically get your phone unlocked to use in other countries, but there are two caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sprint uses a slightly different technology than some other carries. This means that the phone itself might not actually be compatible with the networks of the country you want to travel to.\nHere is an article from PC Mag that talks about the difference between CDMA and GSM cellphone technologies. You may also find this world list of CDMA networks helpful when checking if you phone will work in the country you want to visit.\n\n*If your phone is supported in the country you would like to travel to, you will still need to unlock it. This poses another potential problem: unlocked phones are usually considerably more expensive than locked ones. This is because when you buy a phone on contract, your cellphone company actually pays for most of the phone's real cost for you, and therefore generally locks it to their network. They do this because they know that as long as your phone remains locked, you cannot use it on other networks. Because of this, many carriers will not unlock a phone until you have fulfilled your contract with them (generally two years).\nHere is a page about Sprint's Unlocking Policy.\nLastly, your best option will probably be to talk to Sprint directly since they will be able to provide you with the exact details related of your particular contract and cellphone model.\n", "Q: Selected application loses focus Since upgrading to Yosemite, the current application -- could be anything from Sublime Text to AppCode to Chrome -- will lose focus while I'm typing.\nThis happens with an external keyboard or an internal keyboard, with the computer lid closed (MBP Retina) and open.\nAny advice or event hints?\n\nA: The issue was due to a dockbar application grabbing the focus occasionally. One such culprit: older versions of Google Drive, as seen here: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/drive/epLdP4Bny5w/gKQsxwDMoUAJ\nHowever, any application can grab and keep focus. \nNote: for me the problem was a very outdated version of Google Drive.\n\nA: @DanRosenstark - probably - I haven't researched the Mac App Store restrictions.  \nI wonder, however, if there are any security holes that can be caused not by malware stealing focus, but by malware interacting with the user, so that the user is pointing and clicking, and then the malware doing something, like an error,  that causes 'legitimate' SW to steal focus, so that the user input events go to the legitimate SW - and cause it to do something that the user probably does not want it to do.\nThis certainly applies if the 'legitimate' focus stealer puts up a box with \"Delete\" or \"Are you sure?\" buttons. Worse if the async legit SW asks for a program to run, or presents something like finder with program icons to click on.\nIt's hard for malware to control this - but malware is smart. \nHeck, I am sure that this is a vulnerability.\nFocus stealing, by anyone, whether malware or goodware, is a security risk.\nThe only really secure thing if you really, really, need the user to stop typing or mousing at his current app and pay attention, e.g. to an error, is to put up a dialog box with an error message, gray everything else, after a while beep or otherwise warn if there is any input anywhere else, but not to accept input into the new dialog box until the user has done something explicit to get there.\nNot just click on a button in the dialog box, because the mouse may already have been positioned where it pops up.   But some unlikely to be accidental thing, like moving the mouse around (like a big circular gesture), and then clicking.\n(It does not have to be so onerous if the error button is someplace where the user would not normally have his mouse.  E.g. display an error message that might say \"You need to go to the notification error to cancel this\")\nFocus stealing is a security hole, no matter who steals the focus, if whatever the user may be doing, wherever on the display, pointing, clicking, typing, touching, possibly with head down not looking at the visual feedback, may be misdirected.\n", "Q: iPad 3 stuck on the iTunes logo My iPad 3 will not turn on. \nIt started freezing up and would reboot and then it would have a black screen with white text.

I currently deleted Apple Legacy Java SE6 on my macbook because I've already downloaded JRE8 on my machine and I think I no longer need the older version. After I deleted it, every time I opened Intellij it popped up a window and asked me to get Legacy Java runtime 6. In the meantime, Android Studio and Eclipse worked perfectly fine without popping up any window notifying me about the installing. So my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way I could use jre8 instead of jre6 to run Intellij?\n\n*Why does Intellij require me to install jre6 while Android Studio doesn't?\n\n*What is the benefit to install Legacy Java runtime 6?\n\n\nA: Edit /Applications/<Product>.app/Contents/Info.plist file, change JVMVersion from 1.6* to 1.8*\n<key>JVMVersion</key>\n<string>1.8*</string>\n\n\nA: Q1. No. Intellij deliberately requires jre6 because of bugs in Java 8 as described at :Why is Java SE 6 Legacy required to open Intellij?.\nQ2. I assume that the Android Studio app has its own embedded Java and so does not depend on or use the version you have on your Mac. (This is the way people producing Java apps are going now, and I think it is the only way if you want to sell them on the Mac App store.)\nQ3. The benefit of installing java 6 is the obvious one that you can run older java apps that either require it or were built using Apple's jar bundler which doesn't talk to Oracle's Java 8.\n", "Q: Can not visit some sites because of too many ads!

Or would it be possible to package up the folder with all this in and make it into a .PKG installer? any thoughts anyone i'm new to all that is mac and sorry if things sounds like i'm talking about windows.\n\nA: Apple's software installation is a bit of a deep subject.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could use a unix packaging system and script it with shell/bash/python/perl - whatever code base and language you prefer.

I used Composer in conjunction with Apple Remote Desktop, which can push a .PKG onto a Mac and install it silently.\nIf you are dealing with more than a Handful of Macs, this may be a (not inexpensive) way to go. \nPresently, the Mac admins where I work use opensource munki:\n\nMunki is a set of tools that, used together with a webserver-based\n  repository of packages and package metadata, can be used by OS X\n  administrators to manage software installs (and in many cases\n  removals) on OS X client machines.\nMunki can install software packaged in the Apple package format, and\n  also supports Adobe CS3/CS4/CS5/CS6 Enterprise Deployment \"packages\",\n  and drag-and-drop disk images as installer sources.\nAdditionally, Munki can be configured to install Apple Software\n  Updates, either from Apple's server, or yours.\nMunki is currently in use at organizations all over the world,\n  managing software for tens of thousands of Macs.\n\n", "Q: How can I search the contents of PDF email attachments that are backed up to Time Machine? So I have quite a specific situation where I need to dig out an old email I have backed up to Time Machine, but I can't remember when I received it. Could be anywhere between 6 months to 1 year ago.\nFollowing the advice here, I ran the following in Terminal:\nfind \"/Volumes/Time Machine\" -name \"*.emlx\" -exec grep -l \"search term\" {} \\;\n\nWhich found me several thousand results matching \"search term\" (the subject line).\nThe problem is, the contents of the body of those messages are all identical. It's the contents of the attachment, a PDF document, I need to search for a specific term for.\nAny idea how I can do a search similar to the above, but searching the contents of the PDF attachment?\n\nA: To search the PDF contents embedded in an email using grep you are facing at least one if not two challenges.\nThe first is that files embedded in an email are not preserved in their raw form and instead are encoded into plain text for transmission in the email message.  The MIME format commonly used is Base64 but it's not always the case.  You can find more details on base64, including encode/decode methods here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64\nAssuming the attachment was encoded in base64, it's still not as simple as taking your search string and turing it into a base64 representation because the resulting encoding depends on where in the input string your target string appears. base64 takes every 6 bits of the input stream and turns it into a plain text character. Assuming the PDF document is using a simple 8-bit encoding for the string, 3 characters in the PDF will turn into 4 encoded characters.  A quick illustration of how character position can change things:\n% echo \"123456789\" | base64\nMTIzNDU2Nzg5Cg==\n% echo \"0123456789\" | base64\nMDEyMzQ1Njc4OQo=\n\nIn the first example, 123, 456, and 789 turn into MTIz, NDU2 and Nzg5 respectively. In the second, the encoded tuples are 012 => MDEy, 345 => MzQ1, ... etc.\nYour search string could start at the beginning, middle or end of one of these tuples.  If you search for a long enough string you could carve out 3 search strings from the middle that would be searchable, each must be a multiple of 3 characters long.  For example, if I wanted to search for the string 123456789, I could base64 encode three possible search candidates:  123456789, 234567 and 345678.  One of the base encodings should show up in the encoded PDF file if the plain text string 123456789 is present.\nNow we get to the 2nd big problem.  Through this we've assumed that the unencoded contents of the PDF file is in UTF-8, plain text encoding.  If you look at the contents of an actual PDF file, you'll find it has all sorts of internal encodings that include font indicators, text encoded in UTF-16 or UTF-32 and so on.  It's quite likely that your simple search phrase wouldn't appear in the PDF data exactly as you expect. There can be extra content in the PDF between characters, between words, and then there are also line breaks so if you are searching for a phrase that crosses a line break, more complication in building your target search string.\nThere are a couple other things you could try though so all is not lost.\nIf you know the name of the PDF, you could search for that instead.  The file name should appear in the MIME text of the email message in UTF-8 and thus is searchable.\nYou might also get lucky and instead of searching the emails, search for PDF files.  OSX Mail extracts attachments and stores them to a mail download directory.  I'm running Mavericks and Mail v7.3 and my attachments get written to subdirectories under ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail\nBy the way, your grep command is looking for an exact match so if you are unsure of upper/lower case usage you should add the '-i' option for a case insensitive search.\n", "Q: icloud said it will not let me in for security purposes icloud said it will not let me in for security purposes.

Make sure that you changed his Apple ID in his iTunes & App Store setting on his phone.\nYou shouldn't have to, but you may want to make sure that Automatic Downloads is not turned on also (in the same settings menu).\n\nA: Your Dad's phone is still tied to your Apple ID for automatic downloads, so any of your purchases are automatically downloaded to his phone. This is easily fixed, and can even be done without access to his phone.\nYou can manage your automatic download devices with iTunes. Launch iTunes (these instructions are for iTunes 12.x), make sure you're signed in to your Apple ID, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the account dropdown in the title bar, to the left of search (it'll be labelled with the first name of the Apple ID).\n\n*Select Account Info (you'll probably be prompted for your password; make sure you login with your Apple ID.\n\n*In the section labelled iTunes in the Cloud, click the Manage Devices link.\n\n*All devices authorised for automatic downloads, whether they're currently set to receive items or not, are listed. Remove any unwanted devices by clicking the remove button next to their entry.\n\n*Click Done, 'cause you are (done).\n\n\nAny devices you removed from the list will no longer be able to automatically receive purchase you make with your account. If you remove a device within 90 days of adding it to your account, that device cannot be added to another Apple ID until the 90 days have passed; in this case, the device's entry will show the remaining number of days.\n", "Q: How do I make multiple screen recordings with the exact same portion of the screen I can only select the portion of the screen to record manually.

The second most common, and what I think you\n  are looking for is: http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC\n\n", "Q: How to view CPU clock rate in GHz or MHz? I am looking to get the new 12″ MacBook and as a result I would like to know the clock speed (in GHz) my current MacBook Air (late 2010) is running at so I know the processor on the MacBook will cope.\nAt the moment I know my processor running at the lowest frequency is 1.86GHz (as shown in System Information) and when I look in Activity Monitor as suggested here it only shows me the CPU usage and not the current clock speed. I have also looked at this suggestion but again it does not show me my processing frequency.\nThe reason why I want to find out the current speed my MacBook Air is running at is because Turbo Charge (explained here) can have it's clock run at various speeds from moment to moment. I have also tried Intel's power gadget software as suggested by @grgarside however my Air's CPU is not supported as shown here.\n\n\nA: Intel Power Gadget can show the current CPU frequency.\n\n\n\n\nA: There may be a way to view your CPU's clock speed at this exact second, but as mentioned elsewhere, it is a constantly changing variable (due to Turbo Charge). Comparing clock speeds between different CPU generations, especially nearly five years apart, is also not at all useful.\nA much more useful approach would be to use benchmarks. MacWorld uses Speedmark 8 to test most (if not all) Mac models that are produced, and there is a list here of the results. They \"take the performance results from the 15 individual tests that make up Speedmark and boil them down to a single number\", resulting in an easily-compared list which reviews multiple facets of the computer (not just the CPU). That list does not yet have the new MacBook models on it, but it likely will soon.\nYou can also compare scores on the GeekBench browser, which directly measure the CPU's performance. Your model's benchmarks are here and average about 1950. The Core M-5Y70 processor, which powers the new MacBook, is available at 1.1 GHz, 1.2 GHz, or 1.3 GHz. The only benchmarks currently available are for the 1.3 GHz version of the CPU, and the score for that averages about two times higher than your model's score. (Hence why the clock speed is irrelevant when comparing different generations of CPUs.)\nA score of two times higher on GeekBench indicates two times the performance. Even accounting for the slower base models at 1.1 GHz and 1.2 GHz, performance will still be significantly increased versus your existing MacBook Air.\n", "Q: iPhone warranty valid in another country?

I want to make a purchase from the Apple Store as a gift to my friend. The purchase is a physical item (e.g., iPhone), rather than an app to download.\nBecause I live far away from her, I want to use my Visa credit card and send it directly to her address with the option of \"Gift\" selected. Would that be possible? I will be using her address instead of mine. So, what would the transaction look like when I check my Visa transactions at my bank? Would her name appear on the transaction? Would I still be able to send it to her directly with her information, or do I have to send the package to myself, and send it to her after that?\n\nA: You have multiple questions here.\nFirst see Apples instructions here http://store.apple.com/us/help/gifting\nWill your Bank show and what, you can answer that based on prior experience. My Visa shows the Store name and the amount, not to whom is it shipped or what it was.\nIn your case better option might be a Gift Card, that you can mail your self, thus no trace.\n\nA: Presuming that you are in the US, have a US credit card with a US billing address, and your friend's country is one of the ones listed on Apple's US gift rules, you can send the gift by purchasing it through the appropriate country's online Apple store. You get to that store by visiting the online Apple store, then clicking the flag at the bottom-right of the page next to \"Select a Country\". Note that country's store will be in that country's language, so you may need to visit the website through a translation tool (such as Google Translate), or if you use the Chrome web browser, it will offer to translate the page for you.\nYou then proceed with your purchase as normal, just selecting the gift option so you can enter her address as the shipping address. The gift will be sent directly to her.\nThe transaction on your credit card will reference Apple, and it will be presented in the currency of the country that your friend lives in. For example, if the gift is going to Germany, the transaction will be presented to your bank in Euros. Your bank will convert that into US dollars. Depending on the currency, this means you may pay more or less than the amount shown when you check out. If you are sending the gift to Thailand, for example, US$1 equals approximately 33 Thai Baht (their form of currency) as of this writing. So at checkout, if you buy something worth US$1,000, it will say the total is about 33,000 Thai Baht.\nAdditionally, your bank will almost certainly charge you a foreign transaction fee. You would need to contact your bank to find out if that is the case, and if so, how much it is. Generally it is 1% to 3% of the transaction amount.\nAlternatively, you could place an order through the US Apple Store, have it sent to you, and then send it on to your friend. The issue with this is the product will be a US model. Depending on the destination country, a power adapter may be necessary, and it may have to come back to the US for warranty service, if needed. If it's a computer, the keyboard that comes with it will be the US model, which again probably won't match the destination country. Additionally, you will have to pay shipping charges, and your friend may have to pay customs charges or taxes when it arrives. Having it sent to them from within their own country avoids all of these things.\n", "Q: iOS 7, Facebook Messenger app keeps crashing I was using my Facebook messenger app, and it suddenly crashed. I tried to open it again, but it kept crashing either instantly or after 20 seconds or so.\nI've tried to turn it off and on, and delete and reinstall but its not working. Is there anything else I can do? What's wrong with it?\n\nA: An app that consistently crashes on launch is usually due to the device being out of memory (RAM, not system storage). There is a nice list of ways to cure that here. \nThe next likely cause is bad data triggering a bug. You can often delete the app and redownload it to clear bad data files.

All app icons on the iPhone \"jiggle\" and display an \"X\" in the upper left hand corner of their icons.  When touching the \"X\" on any given app icon, the app then disappears, and is essentially removed from the iPhone's memory.   However,  the factory loaded Apple application named \"Calendar\" icon does not display an \"X\" in its upper left hand corner of its icon.  Therefore I can not remove the \"Calendar\" application.  Is there a procedure which will allow me to remove any factory loaded applications on my iPhone 5?\n\nA: Simply… \nYou don't.\nYou cannot remove the base set of Apple apps - Calendar, Clock, Weather, Stocks, etc, etc.\nPossibly Jailbreaking would allow you, but that's outside my knowledge-base.\nThe usual workaround for any undeletable app you don't want to see is put it on the last home screen, in a folder if you really need the screen-space\n", "Q: Fan on Mac Book Air & Finder crash always This is my first question here.

I think my computer is randomly not syncing email correctly with Apple Mail, but it's only a problem when it wakes from sleep.\nThat issue is neither here nor there. What I'd like to do is write a script / something that will quit Apple Mail if it detects that the computer is going to sleep.\nIdeally, there'd be a similar process to open Apple Mail upon waking from sleep, but that's less of an issue.\nI tried looking for a system event library of some kind, but all I can find is fsevents (which I don't think has anything about sleep).\nThanks!\n\nA: I suggest using a daemon like SleepWatcher. Once you’ve installed SleepWatcher (ref. the README included with it), you can run commands like the following.\n/usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher -s /path/to/sleepscript -w /path/to/wakeupscript\n\nThe script\n#!/bin/sh\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Mail\"'\n\nwill quit Mail, and the script\n#!/bin/sh\nopen -a /Applications/Mail.app $1\n\nwill open it. You can save these as .sh files and reference them from sleepwatcher, but ensure you run chmod +x filename.sh on them before you try running them. Otherwise, OS X won’t recognize them as executable.\nNow, you have two options for loading sleepwatcher: you can manually run it, you can configure a LaunchAgent to do so. I like the latter, so create a file in /Library/LaunchAgents/ named com.custom.mailfix.plist (the name is unimportant, but I recommend you keep the formatting, the “com” and the “plist”). The file’s contents should resemble the following.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>com.custom.mailfix.plist</string>\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher</string>\n    <string></string>\n    <string>-s /path/to/sleepscript</string>\n    <string>-w /path/to/wakescript</string>\n</array>\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<true/>\n<key>KeepAlive</key>\n<true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nAs before, replace the script paths with paths to your shell scripts.

This was not yet possible a year ago, when the question was asked.\nYou can also use HoudahGeo to both update the location in Photos and write the corrected GPS data to EXIF tags within the image files. Note: I am the developer of HoudahGeo.\n\nA: For those who already have it, or who would be willing to get it, Adobe Lightroom handles that with impressive ease.\nImport and open your photo, and toggle the \"Metadata\" panel on the right (typically under \"Histogram\") and scroll to the bottom. Next to \"GPS\" click the coordinates that are displayed.

Initially it got stuck at the end of the first part of the installation. I could however pull up the installation log using Command-L and so I could tell it was still doing something. Eventually it completed and rebooted. It then got into the Completing Installation phase with a similar progress screen. It's been at \"Less than a minute remaining\" for the past 4 hours and no sign of activity. I also can't pull up the installation log by pressing Command-L. I just hear the familiar error sound when I try that.\nI do use Homebrew so there's probably a lot of stuff in /usr/local causing the installation to take a long time, but I figured that's what caused part 1 of the installation to take so long, but it doesn't explain why part 2 is taking even longer.\nMavericks was installed on an external SSD (Lacie Rugged series) connected through thunderbolt. I now read that some people are experiencing problems with 3rd party SSD drives in Yosemite (yeah, I know I should have checked that before starting the upgrade, but who would have known?).\nI'm not sure what to do now: just power off the computer and see if it continues finalizing the installation process after I restart it? Or just wait until tomorrow morning and see if it's still stuck? Even though I have a time machine backup on an external drive I don't want to risk losing my data forcing me to do a restore. Any advice?\n\nA: Alright so I waited it out only to come back this morning to see that it was still stuck. I've waited several more hours until 10 am this morning which comes down to a total wait of 18 hours. I went ahead and manually rebooted and it looks like the upgrade was completed successfully after all.\nPlease note that this is not me suggesting you should reboot if the installation seems stuck. In general you should just be patient and wait. In the first phase of the installation press Command-L to show the installation log and you can verify it's actually doing something. Note that it can take a while for the installation log to show up after pressing Command-L.\nIn the second phase if it gets stuck you can't view what it's doing so it's pretty much a gamble if you decide to reboot it when it seems to be stuck.\nI rebooted with my external backup hard drive disconnected to make sure my backup stays intact when things turn sour after all.\nI verfied the disk and the permissions with Disk Utility and some permissions were off so I've repaired those. I'm now in the process of fixing Apache, but I'm guessing that's because of the differences between Apache 2.2 and 2.4.\n\nA: UPDATE: I bit the bullet and just rebooted by holding down the power button and it seems to have rebooted as normal and I have Yosemite, hopefully with no issues!\n\nA: Same thing happened with my dead standard 2011 Macbook Pro. Got stuck while booting after the upgrade. Hard rebooted after a few hours.

But this seems to work reliably.\nI created a temporary folder with just the application I wanted to package (leaving the app sitting elsewhere seemed to result in the aforementioned strange behaviour), then package it from there. So I created a temporary folder called \"test\" on my desktop and dropped the app in there on its own. The following command then reliably results in a working package on my Desktop.\nproductbuild --component ~/Desktop/test/myapp.app /Applications ~/Desktop/myapp.pkg --sign \"my certificate identity name\"\n\nSomething that is helpful when testing is to run sudo opensnoop | grep installd in a Terminal at the same time. It generates a lot of output but you should be able to see the application bundle being created in something like /var/folders/zz/GIBBERISH/C/PKInstallSandboxManager/GIBBERISH.activeSandbox/Root/ and then copied to its final destination.\nNote: I'm not certain why you are using -s in the second example productbuild command you gave in your question. There are three options arguments to productbuild that start with \"s\" (synthesis, scripts and sign) and the man page doesn't mention using the shorter \"-s\" for any of them. Perhaps this is the problem. Of course it could just be a typo. :)\n\nA: I think the issue here is that you are using --component rather than --root. The docs are a bit unclear on its usage but it looks as if, like with root too, you need to specify the folder that encloses the .app bundle not the actual bundle path itself. I made this mistake when using --root and witnessed just my bundle contents getting installed into /Applications. The same caution is required when actually building the package using pkgbuild.\nI would copy my .app into a ./build folder and then:\npkgbuild --analyze --root ./build MyApp.plist \npkgbuild --root ./build --component-plist MyApp.plist --identifier co.uk.MyApp --version 0 --install-location /Applications MyApp.pkg\nproductBuild --synthesize --package ./MyApp.pkg ./Distribution.xml\nproductBuild --distribution ./Distribution.xml --resources ./Resources --sign \"Developer ID Installer: My Id\" --package-path . ./MyApp-ver-whatever.pkg\n\n", "Q: How can I run Windows Software .exe on a PowerBook G4?

Wine Is Not a (CPU) Emulator, nor does it include\n  one.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*So if I understand correctly, WINE will not work on a PowerPC Mac as it does on an INTEL Mac and I could use it only in combination with a CPU emulation like Q?!\n\n\nQemu\nFurthermore there seems to be Q or Qemu, which seems to emulate a guest PC and therefore needs an installation/license for Windows (and maybe more ressources?)\nVirtualPC\nIf I remember correctly, I have an old version of VirtualPC somewhere, if that might be a better option.\n...?\n\nA: VirtualPC is the most stable option, but x86 -> PowerPC instruction emulation is slow and cannot be used to play games at all, unless it's legendary Solitaire.\nMac OS X 10.4 is the fastest OS X system you can find for PowerPC Mac, but the system itself will eat 512 MB from available RAM for adequate speed and that leaves you with 256 MB for Windows, not enough to run Windows XP, maybe Windows 95?\n", "Q: JetDrive installation with missing Recovery partition: Clone internal SSD to external SSD I have accidentally deleted my recovery partition (Yosemite) - no problem so far.\nNow I have bought the JetDrive 725 and want to install it.

How safe is it?  \nAlternatively, are there other options to clone my internal SSD to the new JetDrive SSD?\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner - which can also create Recovery partitions - though it does need to get it from somewhere.\nYou can clone your boot drive whilst booted from it, with no issues.\nThen just swap drives.\nIf you first clone without the Recovery partition option, you then have 2 identical drives to attempt the Internet Recovery on, with a full safety copy.  \nRecreate the Recovery Partition on either & CCC can then clone it to the other.\nAs far as I'm aware, the Internet Recovery should not mess up any settings - but this way is belt & braces.\n", "Q: Dragging file at the Dock creates a copy of a file?

I've moved from the US to the UK and I'm trying to change my country in the App store on my iPad.  I have family sharing setup, and a child account included in the family sharing.\nThe problem is that changing countries demands that I disable family sharing first.  But when I try to do this, I can't, because I have a child under 13 on my family sharing account which cannot be removed from the family. The child account can be transferred to another family - but I don't have another family!\nSo it looks like I have to delete my childs account, then disable family sharing, then recreate it all in the UK.  Hence losing anything bought by my child and causing a lot of disruption.\nIs that really the only way to do it or is there any better method out there?\n\nA: original poster here - I did basically what Mitchell D suggested and it worked.   I actually moved my wife's account to UK first, set up family sharing with her, invited my child to join my wife's new family, then disabled my family sharing and moved myself to the UK, then invited child back to my family.  Phew!\nSo far, all seems to have gone OK but was a bit of hassle and entirely non-obvious!\n\nA: You could create a temporary 'second family' account and transfer the child to that. Then change country to UK and transfer the child account back.\nLittle bit of messing around but you wouldn't loose any data\n\nA: I had a Family Sharing with a UK Apple ID as Organizer (\"UK ID\"), one adult member (\"Adult\"), and one child member (\"Child\"). The problem was that the payment was linked to a fourth, US-based Apple ID (\"US ID\"), not allowing any of us to do anything.\nThese are the steps I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the UK ID iCloud account, I removed the Adult from Family Sharing\n\n*The Adult then set up a new Family Sharing in her iCloud account\n\n*Adult invited the Child to join the new Family Sharing under her iCloud account\n\n*UK ID accepted, so that the Child moved to the new Family Sharing under the Adult's iCloud (the UK ID Family Sharing now had zero members)\n\n*UK ID Stopped Family Sharing in UK ID's iCloud (UK ID now does not have Familiy Sharing enabled in his iCloud)\n\n*UK ID immediate set up a new Family Sharing in UK ID's iCloud, using a UK payment card\n\n*UK ID invited the Child again\n\n*Adult accepted, so that Child moved to UK ID's Family Sharing\n\n*Adult stopped Family Sharing on her iCloud\n\n*UK ID invited Adult to join UK ID's Familiy Sharing\n\n\nThere then was another issue:\nApparently, if only ONE member of Family Sharing has a Country other than the Organiser, NONE can join Apple Music! My Child also had a US account, so neither Adult nor Child could join Apple Music under the Family Share. The only way to fix this is to go into Child's iPod/iPhone, go to her account in Apple Music, iCloud, and iTunes Store and in one of those, you will be able to change the Country to UK. ALL member accounts, and the Payment Method account have to be set to the same Country.\n", "Q: Hotkey to move mouse and click I'm currently using Keyboard maestro to create a macro that allows me to move the cursor to certain coordinates and perform a left click.\nUnfortunately under Yosemite it doesn't work as expected, since it clicks sporadically (it always moves the cursor but doesn't click everytime).\nAre there any other viable options to achieve this?

Using this software I enabled Trim and smart optimization.\nQuestion 1:\nWhat is all the commotion about Trim? Chameleon seemed to have no problem enabling Trim.\nQuestion 2:\nWhat options should I set with Chameleon SSD Optimizer (i.e - Sudden Motion Sensor, NOATIME, Time Machine, Sleep Mode/Image)?\nBasically, what is it that Chameleon does to optimize SSD performance and where does Trim come into this, and why are people giving out, this is my main curiosity? Everything seems OK to me...\nI would like as much info as possible but assume no prior knowledge\n\nA: The TRIM command was introduced to facilitate “garbage collection” of deleted data, allowing the SSD to reset those “unused” blocks back to an “empty” state. This allows for better performance for many SSDs.\nAll Chameleon does is hack your SSD to enable TRIM. What the hack does is basically tell the OS that the non-Apple SSDs in the system are Apple drives so TRIM can be engaged with them.\nSome people have not been able to boot up with Yosemite because it doesn't support TRIM but programs such as Chameleon have created a work around. The real issue is that the TRIM hack needed to be applied every time you upgraded to a new OS version, which was a real pain. But now that is not a issue. Hope this helps.\n\nA: The Trim command helps with “garbage collection” of deleted data, resetting those now-unused blocks to an empty state at the time of file deletion. This allows for better performance for many SSDs, because waiting for the next write operation that requires use of that space to reset the blocks can significantly lower the speed of the write operation.\nChameleon, and similar software such as Trim Enabler, modify a kernel extension (essentially a driver) to enable TRIM support for non-Apple branded SSDs.\nWith the release of Yosemite, kernel extensions are now required to be signed. Since these pieces of software modify the kernel extension, the digital signature is no longer in place and OS X will refuse to boot. The work-around is to disable the kernel extension signing requirement. The Trim Enabler Yosemite FAQ has more details on this.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010) shuts down unexpectedly My wife's MacBook Pro has begun shutting down unexpectedly, at seemingly random intervals. This started occurring after I (very carefully) upgraded the machine from 4 GB to 8 GB of RAM and replaced the old battery, which had reached the end of its life.\nThe shutdowns are instantaneous, while there is plenty of power left. It's as if the power button was held down. It has happened twice when a USB hard drive was connected, but that might have been a fluke. I haven't been able to consistently reproduce the issue.\nDoes anyone know how to debug this issue, like if there are any logs of unexpected shutdowns that might provide some clues as to what's going on? Any pointers greatly appreciated.\nI'm not sure if this is relevant, but the same machine was having a different issue with sleeping until I upped the RAM and changed the battery. This issue has since stopped happening.\nEdit: The problem we're experiencing sounds very similar to this blog post.\n\nA: Here is a Terminal command to find out what is shutting down your computer.\nsyslog -k Sender kernel -k Message CSeq 'n Cause: -' | tail | awk '/:/{$4=\"\"; print}' | pbcopy\n\nIt will save a text format copy to your desktop.\n\nA: Shut down fix after liquid spill.  Well I hope this helps some people.  So, I bought this 2011 macbook pro on craigslist for $100.  The issue was that it would not stay powered on according to the seller due to a liquid spill so I took my chances.  I installed a new SSD and got it to power on.  Indeed the it would turn on and then power off.  Sometimes it would stay on for hours and other times it would power off before it would even boot up.  The number keys would not work and they typed letters instead.  What was odd though was that most times when it was on it would open the window that pops up when you hold down on the power button and then shut down on its own.  Other times it would shut down with no warning.  Another odd thing is that after holding the shift, control and option button (not the power button) it would reset it self like I did and SMC and then I would hit the power button or any key and it would turn on.  At this point I was suspicious that something isn't right with the keyboard which might be the source of the shut downs.  However, that was a hard fix so 1st thing I did was a new battery.  I was hoping that since it still had the original better that maybe thats why it would shut down.  So I bought a new aftermarket one for $30 but no fix.  So now it was for the challenging mission.  Keyboard replacement.  I bought a new one on amazon for $20 without the backlight since mine was still working.  Once I got everything out I found that the keyboard from the inside is covered with a black plastic cover.  So I am thinking wow, it would really be hard even with a big liquid spill for the liquid to reach the logic board.  To get the to the point, I go the new keyboard in.  Took about an hour and....the Macbook is like new.  No shut downs anymore.  For those that do not know, the keyboard and power button are connected (once peace) so I am sure thats the reason for the shut downs.  Something was shorting out to cause the shut downs.  This was actually not a hard thing to do so don't let it scare you. As long as you don't jerk anything out you will be fine.  I hope this helps some people.  By a new keyboard before you sell your macbook or buy a new logic board.  Good luck!\n\nA: Considering the fact that you have a Mid 2010 the Buschar(in the comments) is correct that the Apple Hardware Test is installed on your hard drive not on the DVD. Sometimes the Hardware test will not run on the boot sequence if you have a USB or DVD in one of the ports. \nThe first thing I would do is perform a fresh install of the OS, that way you can possible remove some possibilities of it being buggy software related, (Obviously don't forget to backup the important stuff)\nI know that some of the 2010 models had reports of faulty logic boards and battery connectivity issues and and need the boards to be replaced., hopefully is not the case\n\nA: Did you have unexpected shut downs with the computer before the upgrades?\nHave you tried reinstalling the original 4gb of ram and see if the problem persists?\nYou changed two things new ram and a new battery. Maybe the ram is faulty or maybe the battery is not outputting the correct voltage. If you did the install yourself, make sure your connections are good and are not interfering with any other components or the bottom case. I have the same computer.\n\nA: I eventually brought the machine to Apple, who ran hardware diagnostics and changed the battery to an original Apple battery, which resolved the issue. My unconfirmed hypothesis is that the first battery I installed, which was not an Apple original battery, was faulty.

Since I don't know Apple's internals (I'm new to Mac OS X) I reversed engineered it with a few trial and errors plugging and unplugging the adapter, both while asleep and also while awake, to see which log entries are reliable.\nYou will notice that I tried using pmset -g log to detect when the power was unplugged but it's unreliable. Upon unplugging, the log entry is Summary- [System: DeclUser kDisp] Using Batt but unfortunately the same log entry occurs during sleep while unplugged so it's unreliable. I resorted to syslog instead.\nNOTE: This reports the time since the last unplugged event. This may not be when the battery was 100 %.\nPotential issue: The above code takes the timestamp from syslog and matches against pmset. If pmset doesn't have an entry (any entry) at the same timestamp then it won't work. That shouldn't happen but if it does, then you could convert the timestamps to epoch seconds and detecting the closest timestamp in pmset that way.\n", "Q: How can I make iTunes start again after disabling it?

It's a bit like a zip file except that you can 'see' straight into it without unpacking to a new folder…. but like a zip file you need to get the contents out of it before you can use them.\nThink of a .dmg as having 3 'stages'… \n\n\n*\n\n*stage 1 - the original .dmg file - when you double click that \n\n*stage 2 - it mounts a virtual disk on your desktop, which will open to show something along the lines of your blue window.\n[They're not always as nicely set out as that one & they don't always open automatically, sometimes you have to double-click the virtual disk to open it]\n\n*stage 3 - You then take the contents [your shiny new app] & either drag directly to your Applications folder or a convenient shortcut in the same window.\nSometimes you need to double-click that 'application' to launch a separate installer.\nYou will [almost] always be told which to do.\nOnce the Application has copied itself to the Applications folder, you then can 'put away' the virtual disk.\nYou can do this by dragging it to the trash.

In other forums it says to go to Preferences -> Save, and from there you can change the dpi. \nHere's a fuzzy screen shot of what it should look like: \n\nHere's what I see instead:\n\nWhat are my options to increase the resolution/dpi?\n\nA: Unfortunately and inexplicably, Microsoft dropped this option (\"Advanced resolution settings\") in PowerPoint 2011. \nA quick-and-dirty solution would be to simply increase the pixel dimensions in the export settings. You do this by entering e.g. the width (the height will be calculated automatically). Microsoft has limited the maximum possible export  dimensions to 2999×2249 pixels (for aspect ratio 1:1.3) which is comparable to the size of a photo from a 6- or 7-megapixel digital camera. This is sufficient to print the slide on a full A4 or Letter sheet at 300 ppi.    \nAlternatively, you can save slides as PDF instead of images (File > Save As…), and place those in your page layout application or word processor. At least some of the graphical elements in the design templates are vector graphics, which ensures that these elements won't pixelate later in printing at any resolution. \nHowever, since MS Office uses the OS X PDF framework to create the PDF files (which is no good for commercial printing workflows), you may still want to create high-resolution images from the PDFs. This can be done simply by exporting the images in the Preview application (File > Export). The export dialog allows you to set the graphics format and resolution. Alternatively, you can also open the a PDF in Photoshop or GIMP, which creates a new bitmap image, for which you can set the dpi of your choice.\nImportant: To avoid later pixelation of your photos or other images placed in the PP presentation, make sure these image files have a high resolution suited for the targeted printing process in the first place.\n\nA: There are multiple ways to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*After making your slide, save it in PostScript format (easy to do). To do this, give a print command and on print setting setting page, select the \"Print as Postscript\" (I think default is PDF). This will save the file in .ps format. For publication, some Journals accept even .ps file also. If you want any other format, open .ps in Mac preview and Export it in desired file type and Resolution.\n\n*Another way is Select everything on your slide (Command A) and copy it (Command C). Then open preview and under File Tab>>select New from Clipboard. Then, Export it in desired file type and Resolution.\n\n\nA: Just to confirm the therms used.\n\nDPI: Dot’s per inch. The number of dots in a printed inch. The more\n  dot’s the higher the quality of the print (more sharpness and detail).\nPPI: Pixels per inch. Most commonly used to describe the pixel density\n  of a screen (computer monitor, smart phone, etc…) but can also refer\n  to the pixel density of a digital image.\nResolution: Resolution is the measure of pixels in the display,\n  usually expressed in measurements of width x height. For example a\n  monitor that is 1920 x 1080 is 1920 pixels across and 1080 pixels\n  down.\nHigher resolution means more detail. Higher DPI means higher\n  resolution. Resolution is not “size”, but it’s often confused with it\n  because higher resolution images are often bigger, but that doesn’t\n  necessarily have to be the case.\n\nNow to your question:\nInsert a high resolution image in Power Point.\nRight Click and select Format Picture ->size.\nIn this screen select the Resolution.\n\nIf you now click on the Compress in PP menu bar you can compress the file if you want to reduce the DPI.\n\n\nIf you want to export Pictures from PP2011 that you already have, than the highest resolution is equal to the original as saved, means PP would have reduced its size/resolution. Not so if you are making new presentation and save the picture in it its original size/resolution.\n", "Q: Disable carrier \"features\" on IOS 7 My IPhone 4 has some carrier features I would like to disable:\nWhen ever I miss a call this thing opens and I have to close it. If I do not close it(say for ex. a missed call at night) the screen will stay on with this thing till I close it. It will often even drain the whole battery.\nI'm using IOS 7 on a jailbroken(I did this hoping I would find a solution there) iPhone.\n\n\n\nA: Yes like previous comments suggest all carrier settings are generally toggled on or off from the carriers systems and not locally in iOS.

I have an iPhone 3GS that is unlocked and jailbroken. It is running iOS 4.1. I cannot update because that will undo the unlock mechanism.\nI was originally on an iPhone 4S. It got bricked somehow, so I pulled out my old iPhone 3GS. I had already migrated completely to iCloud for my contacts; I run 10.7.5 on my Mac and was using iCloud to sync all of our Apple devices.\nWith iOS 4.1, it doesn't support iCloud, but I can't get it to sync my contacts manually. I was hoping that when I connected my iPhone to iTunes, that by clicking the 'Sync Contacts' under 'Info', it would just pick up all the iCloud contacts that are stored locally on my Mac and treat them as regular contacts.\nApparently it doesn't work this way. iTunes doesn't see iCloud contacts stored in the Address Book as normal contacts so those don't get synced.\nIs there a way to get around this? I'm willing to do a manual sync (i.e. use some other app to copy, en masse, the contacts over), since my contact base doesn't change very frequently.\n\nA: If you go into the contacts/address book app on you mac, select all the contacts (either cmd-a or select first, scroll to bottom, hold shift and select last) and you can either right click or click on the little cog wheel at the bottom of the app and export the contacts to a vCard.\nYou can then use another free cloud service such as google or yahoo and import the contacts into that account on their website.\nSign in to this account on your iPhone and choose to use it for contacts only and they should start to all sync down from the cloud. \n", "Q: Is there an iPod touch voice control app that can play music offline? I recently bought a 5th generation iPod touch, but was dismayed to learn that I can't use Siri to play music in my car because it doesn't work offline. Is there a voice control app that I can use to choose songs without a wifi connection?\n\nA: If you're willing to sacrifice Siri for the ability to control your music with your voice, you could turn off Siri in Settings>General>Siri, which'll make your iPod respond to a held-down Home button with the classic Voice Control interface instead. A Google search is telling me that that one works offline!\nFor more information about non-Siri Voice Control, check out Apple's support page. Here's what it says about music playback:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*You can play all songs in an album, playlist, or by an artist. The device won't recognize commands to play a particular song.\n  \n*If you can't get the device to recognize the album or artist name, try telling it to play a playlist.\n  \n*If an artist has \"The\" in the name, say it.\n\n", "Q: Syncing ipod to itunes I have an iPod that has been in use for some time. \nI now want to sync it to iTunes on my macbook pro so I can copy some songs from the macbook to the iPod. \nwhen I connect the iPod to the macbook it comes up saying \nwelcome to your new iPod \n\nThe only options are to set up as a new iPod or restore from a backup, neither of which are what I am trying to do.\nis there are way to get this to work the way I am wanting? or is there an alternative way to get songs into the music section on the iPod without syncing with the mac?\n\nA: Your best bet would be to copy the iTunes library folder and the iPod backup from the computer that it was originally synced with to the macbook you want to sync to. This may get around iTunes wanting to force it to be step as new.\nIf you have never backed up your iPod then plug it into the computer you originally synced it with and perform a backup in iTunes. You can then use iTunes preferences to find where the backup was stored and copy this to the new macbook.\nThen choose restore from backup on the macbook and theoretically it should re-setup the iPod in the same configuration as now and also allow you to use the macbook as the current syncing computer\n", "Q: How do I sync tags between two Macs using Google Drive? I have two Macs, and I use Google Drive to sync my data. I created tags in Finder on one Mac for some of the files and directories in Drive, and they don't appear on the other one.\nIs this possible? Or are tags restricted to the system they live on and not synced along with the files they apply to?\nIn case it matters, I don't use iCloud sync, and I'm not willing to turn it on.\n\nA: The tags you see in the Finder that are associated with a file/folder are stored as extended attributes of that file/folder.\nThere is an excellent article which goes into some details about the portability/syncability of these extended attributes.  It suggests that Google Drive, amongst other cloud services, does not support the syncing of extended attributes, which is a pity. It lists three services which do support extended attributes, to varying extents, namely iCloud Drive (of course), Dropbox, and Resilio Sync.\nI have personally found it effective when working with Google Drive to use workarounds to sync extended information. This includes different folder organization (e.g. red files in one folder, blue in other) or naming files differently. The exact way you'd do it is entirely based on the context of what you're trying to do, your goals, and whatever works for you.\n\nA: You can crate a smart folder on Mac and name it according to the tag and save the folder on google drive. It’s a workaround, but serves my purpose ;) Maybe that works for you. \nUPDATE: it doesn’t show the files!\n\nA: I switched to Dropbox because it syncs Finder Tags.\n", "Q: aptX Bluetooth Headphones (B&O H8) Drop Sound - Yosemite The B&O H8s work great some of the time wirelessly (iPhone) and wired, but not with MacBook Pro 15 early 2011 (Airport/Bluetooth card upgraded to BT4.0). However, sometimes, they will start to skip and drop in and out (as if I were plugging and unplugging an audio cable). The speed of the audio will increase after it skips to \"catch up\".  None of the online fixes seem to help this out. Can't get the RSSI above -60 dBm.  Appreciate any help at all.  Thanks.\n\nA: They are working perfect with OS X Yosemite 10.10.2. After upgrading to  10.10.3 (beta or final) the problem that you described appear. The headphones are working perfect first time after adding to bluetooth list, but is not a solution to delete and add again.\nBang & Olufsen post this to their website:\n\nCan I connect my BeoPlay H8 headphones with my MAC/PC using Bluetooth?\nIn most cases BeoPlay H8 is able to connect to a PC/MAC with Bluetooth 4.0 and a A2DP Bluetooth profile, provided that the hardware and drivers of the computer are also compatible. However, the computer protocols in the market are inconsistent and we cannot guarantee that BeoPlay H8 is able to connect using Bluetooth to all PC/MACs.\n\n\nA: I had some success by installing XCode, then installing the Hardware IO extensions to Xcode (I seem to recall that was in Xcode..open developer tool...more tools).\nOnce installed, you can run bluetooth explorer, which has two useful tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tools..audio options\n\n*Tools..audio graphs\n\n\nBetween these you get some specific settings you can adjust, and more information about what is going on.\nIn my case I increased the minimum and maximum bitpool, and pushed the buffered packets out to 1000.  This seemed to increase the quality setting that bluetooth uses, and to allow it to be much more tolerant of dropouts.\nUltimately my problem was also partly a line of sight issue, and also probably being close to both the microwave and the wifi router, which would cause interference.  But pushing up the buffer size gave a bit more tolerance to that interference.\nThe only thing to watch out for is that I'm having serious issues with my bluetooth not reconnecting to my bluetooth speaker...I don't believe it's due to this setting change, but arguably it could be.  \n\nA: Try to edit advanced settings to macbook bluetooth with \"bluetooth explorer\" HardwareIOTools_Xcode.

I have a Macbook Pro (Mac OS 10.10.2, late 2013 model) and am considering to buy an AirPort Extreme 2TB. I want to use it not only for TimeCapsule backups, but also as a general-purpose storage disk (as discussed here Can I use a Time Capsule as an all-purpose storage disk?).\nCan the data, which I save on AirPort Extreme not in the context of TimeCapsule, be encrypted with FileVault?\nMy question is not if TimeCapsule-backupped data can be encrypted - as I understand this is possible - but my question is if the other data, put onto AirPort Extreme outside of the TimeCapsule functionality, can be encrypted with FileVault?\nI.e. can the entire AirPort Extreme be encrypted with FileVault?\n\nA: Yes, just create an encrypted disk image on the Airport Extreme. That has nothing do do with it being an Airport, or having Time Capsule functionality; you can do it on any disk that you can mount. It's not technically FileVault, but it is 128- or 256-bit AES encryption.\n", "Q: Why is my keyboard is not responding to touch when using Whats App?

On the mac, I get a message saying that the iOS device has refused transfer. Is it normal? Is there a way to send my documents via airdrop (i know I can use dropbox but sometimes I do not have access to internet)?\n\nA: One way of transferring PDFs directly from a Mac to an iOS device is to drop them into iTunes. Once in iTunes you can transfer the PDFs to the iOS device and they will appear in iBooks on your device.\n", "Q: Cellular traffic noise on iPhone On an iPhone 4, running iOS 6.1.3, when I'm listening music,\nI regularly hear noises related to cellular phone network.\nFor example I hear cellular traffic noise:\n\n\n*\n\n*when I was out of reach of cellular network and entering a new phone cell,\n\n*just before receiving a new SMS,\n\n*just before receiving a phone call.\n\n\nI would like to get rid of these \"cellular traffic noises\".\n\nDoes anyone else hear these \"cellular traffic noises\"?\nDo they occur on more recent versions of iOS?\nAre these \"cellular traffic noises\" interference noises and hence fully hardware related?\nDo the new models of iPhone (5 or 6) avoid these interferences?\n\nA: All phones have done this, since they were first invented - the analog ones used to be far worse. It used to be compulsory to switch them off in the studios where I worked, as the interference could actually make its way onto a recording.\nIt's caused by electromagnetic induction to a nearby amplified circuit - hi-fi, tv, computer speakers etc.\nIt was always known as 'hunting' - not that it's any real technical term, but it roughly describes what's going on. If the phone is bordering one cell & hunting for the next, or if a signal comes through that data is about to be fired at it, the radios ramp up their power ready for it & the beep boppidy bop beep that you hear is the handshake as it ramps up.\nTurning the phone 90˚ may help, by shifting the induced magnetic field out of alignment with the circuitry that's picking it up.\nThe only alternatives would be to move it well away from any other electronics, or switch it to Airplane mode.\nThis answer gives some simple background as to how induction works; it's the same for radio circuitry as audio.\n", "Q: Broken $PATH variable I was trying to add something to my $PATH variable, but I think I made some sort of typo. \nNow, I am trying to fix this, I want to remove what I added, but when I type e.g. open .profile, it tells me -bash: open: command not found\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Just use the full path to open:\n/usr/bin/open .profile\n\nOnce you've fixed your path, your shell will be functional again.\n", "Q: Code to fix: WindowServer[250]: _CGXGLDisplayContextForDisplayDevice: No matching context for device (0x7fcfcaf18220) - disabling OpenGL I need help implementing the answer to WindowServer[250]: _CGXGLDisplayContextForDisplayDevice: No matching context for device (0x7fcfcaf18220) - disabling OpenGL by inserting the following into wherever it goes:\n?

Using the airport I don't see the shared folders on my synology(DSM 4.2) in finder, except by connecting through the IP. This also means timemachine doesn't work using the airport network. Synology has fixed ip in network. Using the linksys wifi network or networkcable everything works fine. Same problem for my sonos system that isn't discovered  through the airport network except after switching to the linksys network first.\n\nA: Your AirPort Extreme will need to \"control\" the network in order for this setup the way you expect. The Linksys would have to be configured as a bridge with the AirPort Extreme as the router/DHCP server.\nDo not that the way you have things setup currently, Time Machine will still work; however you will need to connect to the server/disk by IP address.

I'm a math phd student, who currently owns the mid 2009 13\" MacBook Pro (2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 2 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 memory and NVIDIA GeForce 9400M 256 MB graphics).\nI use my laptop mainly for surfing the web and watching tv shows/movies, but also as a research tool (e.g. Solving differential equations numerically and plotting various functions using Mathematica and MATLAB)\nI'm really excited for the upcoming MacBook. It seems to be an improvement to my current Mac on every aspect except for the processor: It reads \"1.1 GHz dual-core Intel Core M processor Turbo Boost up to 2.4 GHz/1.2 GHz dual-core Intel Core M processor Turbo Boost up to 2.6 GHz\"\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this laptop suited for my needs?\n\n*How often does this Turbo Boost kick in? If it does so often, I'll definitely get this one.\nThank you!\n\nA: For the quotidian tasks you mention, your computer is adequate, although I would immediately increase RAM to 4GB, a rather trivial expense.\nMathematica & MATLAB, and other CPU-heavy apps such as Strata Design 3DCX or FinalCut Pro X, have the ability to run multiple cores in parallel. In most cases, ordinary apps will run only one core of the CPU. Other apps, such as Photoshop will take advantage of multiple cores for a subset of its available operations which can benefit from parallel processing.\nMathematica, in particular, does not run most of its calculations on multiple cores, but offers operations which provide parallel computation.\nIf the MacBook is in OK shape, (i.e., you treated it decently,) the best options would be to increase the RAM, and if you choose to do so, install an internal SSD. At 6 years of age, the internal HD is closing in on its eventual demise.\n\nA: I was advise against the upgrade that you wish to do. I would go as far as to say that it would be a downgrade. Look at the names, you have a MacBook Pro and you are thinking of buying a simple MacBook. The MacBook still only has two cores, the same as your machine has and only runs 10% faster. \nOK, your model doesn't have the turbo boost, but to be honest, it is not worth it, anyway. It only works on a lightly loaded Mac CPU - on a more heavily loaded CPU, it causes the CPU is warm up and once it reaches a critical temperature, it turns itself off. So while the marketing-speak would lead you to think that it will hurry along CPU intensive tasks, such as running Mathematica and MATLAB, the truth of the matter is that it will not. It will only really have use on a truly single-threaded process, and not many of those exist in the examples you give.\nThe cheapest option, as suggested by IconDaemon would indeed be a RAM upgrade, your MacBook Pro can actually take 8GB. That would not only give you a significant performance boost, as there would be less swap/disk activity, but it would also increase your multi-tasking ability, both in speed and number of simultaneous applications. Add to that an SSD, and it will not only boot faster, applications launch quicker, but switching between apps could be quicker, and disk intensive applications, such as Photoshop would be arguably quicker. Pretty much as IconDaemon has already said.\nHowever, if you really want a new machine, I will add that if I were you I would go for a second hand (cheaper than new) quad-core i7, such as those from (late) 2011. You could get a 2.5GHz Quad Core i7 17\" MacBook Pro for the price of the new MacBook that you have your eyes on. Blisteringly fast.\n", "Q: VeraCrypt - Encryption of Host Protected Area on my Macbook Pro 13\" I have a MacBook Pro 13\" Model : MGX82xx/A with Windows installed only (no Mac OS X on a different partition, no Boot Camp used (manual driver installation after windows installed.) and a copy of VeraCrypt 1.0f1 installed.\nInside the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard I have selected the options to Encrypt the whole drive.\nI am being prompted with a yes/no Question - Encryption of Host Protected Area\nWhich states the following\nAt the end of many drives, there is an area that is normally hidden from the operating system (such areas are usually referred to as Host Protected Areas). However, some programs can read and write data from/to such areas.\nWARNING: Some computer manufacturers may use such areas to store tools and data for RAID, system recover, system setup, diagnostic, or other purposes. If such tools or data must be accessible before booting, the hidden area should NOT be encrypted (choose 'No' above).\nI would rather encrypt the Host Protected Area just to be sure, but do not want to damage my MacBook permanently if Apple reserve this space for whatever reason I do not know.\nCan I encrypt this area?\n\nA: Download a decent but free partition tool for Windows like MiniTool Partition Wizard Free Edition 9 and check for a HFS+ volume at the end of the disk. The size is ~650 MB and the GUID type: 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECA.\nIf it doesn't exist anymore - after installing Windows - go ahead and encrypt the whole drive.\nIf it exists, try to boot to Internet Recovery Mode with cmdaltR to check if it works with your network setup. If you have been successful (you will see a little spinning globe and boot to a recovery screen), reboot to Windows and delete the Recovery HD-partition. Expand your Windows partition and encrypt the whole disk with VeraCrypt afterwards.\nUsing only Windows, the Mac Recovery HD partition on your disk device is almost useless.\nBooted to Internet Recovery Mode you will always be able to reinstall a current Mac OS X given that you have a decent internet connection.\n", "Q: How can I add an Old English dictionary to Dictionary?

I was all excited to use Dictionary to help me through each word, and was kinda surprised when it didn't know practically any word in it at all.\nIf I open Dictionary and search a word (such as HWÆT), it does actually return some related words because their origin is the Old English word.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Adding dictionaries is possible.  Finding the one you want may not be. See https://web.archive.org/web/20190218202438/http://clasquin-johnson.co.za/michel/mac-os-x-dictionaries/\nFor info on creating dictionaries for dictionary.app, see\nHow can I create a dictionary for Mac OS X?\nHow to add wiktionary as a source to the default dictionary.app?\n", "Q: Which version of Mac OS X was the first to support RTL (right-to-left) languages? Apple – Press Info – Mac OS X Hits Stores This Weekend (2001) listed seven languages for 10.0. From an archived Apple knowledge base article Mac OS X 10.6: Changing the direction of text I know that Snow Leopard included support for right-to-left and bidirectional text. From the knowledge base: \n\n… When using certain right-to-left writing systems such as Arabic, Hebrew, Yiddish, Persian, Pashto, and Urdu, you may need to quote words from left-to-right writing systems, such as English. When right-to-left text is mixed with left-to-right text, it is called bidirectional text. …\n\nHowever: \n\n\n*\n\n*I can't tell which version of the operating system introduced support for RTL. \n\n\nApple - Mac OS X Snow Leopard - Technical specifications doesn't list Arabic or Hebrew amongst the languages, so (by implication) whilst operating system localisations at that time did not include those languages, the OS did support RTL. \nAnother archived article, Hebrew & Arabic Language Kit: System Direction Issues, reminds me that for less recent versions of the OS, Apple's installer offered language kits (more recent installers include those languages by default).  \n\nI tried searching domains such as mellel.com, redlers.com and www.apple.com/pr – e.g. https://duckduckgo.com/?q=languages%20%22Mac%20OS%20X%22%20site:www.apple.com/pr/ – couldn't find an answer. \nIf it helps: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellel states that development of Mellel began in 2002 (and I recall Mellel being renowned for RTL support). \n\nA: It was introduced in 10.2, Jaguar, and greatly improved in 10.3, Panther. See this article from MacOSXHints for evidence and more details.\n\nA: I think Apple support for RTL may go back to OS 7.1:  See\nhttp://www.macintouch.com/m85_multilingual.html\nIt was definitely part of OS 9/Classic.  For more info see my old page here:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46870715/s/jmlingos9.html\nAs Mike Scott mentioned, RTL was missing in 10.0 and 10.1.\n", "Q: Timing individual slides in Keynote I have a self-playing slideshow in Keynote, with 20 second transitions (each slide is shown for 20 seconds).\nThe last slide plays a movie, which is longer than 20 seconds. How can I set the transition to longer than 20 seconds for the last slide only?\n\nA: You might want to consider exporting the slideshow into a Quicktime movie and present that way instead of through Keynote. If the contents don't change much, or at all, this is easiest. You can use iMovie to splice the two movies together. Make sure to set the movie to loop.\n", "Q: JetDrive 725 - SHould I use TRIM enabler? I just installed a JetDrive 725  and it is really nice!\nAs I am using Yosemite, TRIM can not be enabled that easily, and the TRIM Enabler is needed. Now there is a certain risk when using it, as kext-signing needs to be disabled.\nNow my question: is it worth enabling TRIM? Is it be really that beneficial? Any experiences with it?\n\nA: I've had a 960GB JetDrive 720 since September 2014 and have been running Yosemite since release. I found that enabling trim on Yosemite caused instabilities, and the system would lock up very regularly. I was in regular contact with Transcend about this for a while. I like to think that the removal of trim from the JetDrive toolbox on Yosemite was down to my insistence, but we will never know for sure!\nTurning of trim has solved all my problems. I did that in January 2015, and have not had any issues since. I work with a lot of virtual machines and this can be quite I/O intensive and I have seen no downsides of not enabling trim. I do boot into the recovery console about once a month to run Disk Utility to verify disk but I've not had any problems so this seems overcautious on my part. \nOS X 10.10.4 and later\nApple has included a command line tool that enables trim. If you're running 10.10.4 or later, be sure to save all open documents as the following commands will result in a system restart.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal\n\n*Type sudo trimforce enable. There will be some scary warnings about data loss, but this is standard CYA legalese. You will be prompted about whether you are sure twice.\n\n*This will reboot your system. After the reboot, TRIM is now enabled.\n\n\nA: Never had a JetDrive, but I wouldn't use cindori's enabler, I'd use Jet's own - \nThere's no data on whether they do it the same way as cindori\n\nTake control with JetDrive Toolbox.\nExclusively developed by Transcend for JetDrive SSDs, JetDrive Toolbox monitoring software leverages S.M.A.R.T. technology to analyze its health status. Additionally, it can enable TRIM support for your JetDrive in OS X®, maintaining optimum write speeds and maximizing the lifetime of your SSD.\n\nhttp://www.transcend-info.com/Support/Software-181/\n…later...Actually, the more I read, the less certain I am that their TRIM function will work on Yosemite. \nCindori's works for me on an 840 EVO, with the caveat of the kext signing disabled  - but frankly I have no clue what it's actually doing & if it helps in any real way.\n", "Q: Will my A1549 iPhone work in Japan & Philippines? I have an unlocked \"T-mobile\" iPhone 6, model A1549. Next month I'm visiting Japan and the Philippines, and I'm trying to figure out if I'll be able to get away with pre-paid SIM cards or if I'm going to have to lug around rented Wi-Fi hotspots.\nAccording to Apple, it won't work in either places. \nhttps://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/\nBut according to this list: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LTE_networks#Asia\nIt seems that at least some bands are supported, like au does bands 1 and 18, Docomo does 1 and 19, and Softbank does 1 as well. In the Phillipines things look a little better with all three of Smart's bands (5,3,1) showing up as supported.\nIf that's the case then I'm confused why Apple only lists the A1586 as being compatible with the Philippines. Can anyone with more experience chime in?\n\nA: Even if LTE doesn't work where you are traveling, the iPhone 6 model A1549 will work on the following 2G/3G/4G network frequencies.\n\n\n*\n\n*UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n*GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\n*LTE (Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29)\n\n\nYour phone is unlocked, so any carrier's SIM card will work and you can connect to WiFi to download the latest carrier settings that will properly configure the radio for all deployed cell towers and frequencies that the handset can communicate with.\nSo, your question basically boils down to picking a price point and picking a specific carrier with coverage where you actually will be traveling. The good news is you can get a cheap SIM or two and then pick the one that works best to reload data and minutes once you know more about the conditions on the ground when you arrive.\nMy experience is the specifications are very conservative and you end up getting better/faster/more LTE coverage than is advertised as every carrier that can support iPhones gets more revenue from travelers even if the handsets in that country are sold primarily the device that speaks all the frequencies of the A1549 as well as it's own. I would love to be in on the marketing and engineering talks that led up to choosing models, but can only guess being on the outside of Apple.\n\nA: You won't get 2G coverage in Japan, as it never used GSM, but 3G should work fine. That means you may lose signal in rural areas where there's no 3G coverage.\n", "Q: File sharing/AFP skips \"connect as\" I have two Macs, a Lion and a Yosemite. I have several accounts on each one, both user and admin. I activated file sharing on both Macs and selected AFP. I can connect from any account on one Mac to any account on the other one Mac as expected, with one exception.\n\"As expected\" means: Select go->\"connect to server\" in the Finder menu, then enter one of the users names on the other Mac and its password when prompted, then choose which of the folders on the other Mac to mount.\nThe exception is that in one of the accounts the Yosemite Mac (\"xyz\" - unix name) I do not get the \"connect as\" prompt.  It connects directly as the user \"xyz\" (same name) on the Lion Mac, without giving me a choice or asking for a password.  It only asks me which folder I want to mount.\nI signed out of iCloud in account xyz on the Lion Mac, changed the password, and deleted the keychain, restarted, etc.  Still, no \"connect as\" prompt.   \nNow, if I sign out of iCloud in the account xyz on the Yosemite Mac, too, I do get the expected \"connect as\" prompt. Sign in again, no prompt.\nThus there must a permission buried somewhere on the Lion Mac that grants access to the incoming connections via my Apple ID. \nHowever, a brute force search (recursive grep) revealed no trace of my Apple ID. \nWhere can such a permission be buried and how can I reset it? \nI tried to replicate this (unexpected) behavior in other accounts, using new Apple IDs, but I was not successful.  I always got the expected user name/password prompt.\n\nA: Could be a number of things.  A few that come to mind:\nIf you're using Directory Services (e.g. Open Directory/Active Directory), the device could be authenticating using Single Sign-On (SSO).  This would most likely be if you setup Server.app or if it is a device from your work/office.\nPotentially, you could be connecting as Guest.\nTo authenticate as a different user:  afp://<username>@server_address\n", "Q: Change CSS style in Safari on all sites I am looking for a Safari extension that allows me to change any CSS on any website.\nThe things I want to do is change the white background to black and the black text to white, I also want the links to be green.\nIs there a extension that allows me to do this?\nThis is the OS X safari and not iOS.\nI have looked at this one but don't know how to use it.\nThanks\n\nA: You don’t even need an extension; Safari has a built in setting in the advanced settings to use a custom CSS for all webpages:\n\nYou need to create your own CSS file, but that’s a completely different beast. Something that will work nice on some pages might not on others, but I’d create a file named whatever.css and have it contain something like this:\n* {\n    color: #ffffff !important;\n    background: #000000 !important;\n}\na {\n    color: #00ff00 !important;\n}\n\nand then load it into Safari via the preferences. To reload any changes to the CSS while Safari is open, you need to select None Selected and then re-select your custom file.\nYou’ll probably find lots of people on the web that have put lots of effort into similar CSS files. Good luck!\n\n", "Q: How to connect a Mac Book Pro to a LaserWriter II NT I have an Apple LaserWriter II NT from the late 80's.

Using OS X 10.9.5 I got this message after logging out and back in with different UID. Screen is frozen except I can move the mouse courser around just cannot select anything. Display sleep mode does work. How long does this take? Is there a key combination to stop optimization or reboot?\nFor more context please see link: What is happening when my Mac is being optimized after an OS X update?\nAgain, the screen is frozen including clock. Can move mouse and trackpad cursor but cannot select anything. Keyboard works only to wake machine.\nOk, so I tried the hard reboot option and that seems to have worked thus far. Then tried two soft restarts and no problems either. Been using Mavericks over a year now and never had a problem, so I''m  gonna run my antivirus software and backup before deciding on what to do with spotlight or the problematic user profile.\nFunny, I've waited for Yosemite and iOS 8 to mature and was just preparing my machines for the upgrades.\n\nA: What you describe is far worse than the normal optimization phase.\nIf your Mac is so sluggish that the cursor movement and launching of apps is unworkable (delays more than 60 seconds per action) and persists past a reboot, you'll need to get the hardware checked as the storage system is likely failing due to software or hardware failure.\nTo troubleshoot this:\n\n\n*\n\n*back up all files you care to ever see again\n\n*disconnect the backup drive (and test restore to another Mac if that costs less in time and $ than you'd spend to recreate the files or compensate you for the loss - i.e. wedding and/or baby pictures, etc...)\n\n*Reinstall a clean OS - import no data, set up no network, no Apple ID, no iCloud. Run that system until it's idle in activity monitor and there's no delay launching apps from spotlight.\n\n*Test opening any three apps you care from Launchpad\n\n\nIf this OS is slow, troubleshoot the hardware further.\nIf this OS is fast:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect to the internet\n\n*update all the software\n\n*install any critical software you need to work/test (this rules out a software conflict with the software you were running when the machine was stuck)\n\n*open Activity Monitor and be sure the system is idle and performs properly\n\n*now decide to import your user files, connect to iCloud and Dropbox and any other tools that can cause slowness and external dependancies. If you don't want to set things up by hand, you can wipe this test OS and reinstall and choose to restore your backup in one shot.\n\n\nGood luck - troubleshooting hardware/software isn't a hard concept, but being organized, limiting change, and testing after each step is what makes it sometimes tedious and worth outsourcing.\n\nA: Short answer: Yes but you don't want to.\nLong answer: If you must, go to system preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy and add Macintosh HD. This will prevent Spotlight from indexing, causing the Windows Effect (it never completes indexing and it slows down progressively) whereas Spotlight takes a short while to index (and does not back off like Windows does) but from then on runs much faster.\nEdit: Just saw your question edit. Spotlight shouldn't be causing this. Hold the power button until it shuts off, turn it on. If it's still frozen, try safe mode (hold shift while turning on). If it still persists, try starting Recovery (command+R during startup). If it does not persist in Recovery, reinstall. If it does, reset SMC and PRAM.\nEdit again: Something is wrong with my connection, because different details are missing from your question each time I look.\nI'm stopping for now until I get home. Try safe mode, like before, while logging in, and if that unfreezes it, remove login items from system preferences -> users and groups -> the user you're logged into, and remove launch agents from the user's library. If nothing works, I'll be editing my answer again when I get home and can see your whole question\n\nA: As others have said, optimizing for performance and indexing for Spotlight search should not lock up your machine. In fact, on most machine it's barely noticeable. \nI would suggest seeking professional help rather than trying to pin down the cause over a 'web forum' like this. The cause could literally be anything. You could have a failing hard drive, bad RAM, bad peripheral device, any of an unlimited number of random software issues. It literally could be anything.\nBut what it is not, is normal. I would say that it probably has nothing to do with the optimizing, and these two unrelated events just happen to be happening at the same time. \n", "Q: How can I speed up the way OS X takes a window into full screen I click the green circle at the top left of my screen so my window can go into full-screen mode.\nThen I have to wait while my Mac performs some unnecessary animation to show me that I'm going into full-screen mode.\nCan I eliminate that animation and go into full-screen instantly?\n\nA: Take a sip of your tea - it's finished ;) \nafaik, you can't bypass it. \nMy guess is it's to mask the amount of 'effort' it takes to do the transition, smooth zoom rather than lumpy pseudo-instant transition with bits of broken screen til it's finished.\n\nA: You can try this,\nSystem Preferences > Accessibility > Display\nAnd turn on \"Reduce motion\".\n", "Q: Are MacBooks Laptops, Notebooks or Netbooks Are MacBooks (not just the retina MacBook) Laptops, Notebooks or Netbooks?\nThis is what I think.\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro - Laptop (High power and a lot of I/Os\n\n*MacBook Air - NoteBook (Medium power and a few I/Os\n\n*MacBook - Netbook (Low power and 1 I/O\n\n\nAm I right or wrong?\nIf I am wrong could someone explain to me why?\n\nA: They're all just marketing terms.\nLaptop - generic, applies to anything with a screen attached on a hinge\nThe most basic distinction from a non-portable Desktop, traditionally with a separate monitor & keyboard.\nNotebook - initially referred to HP laptops \nNetbook - originally very low-end devices, powered by the Intel Atom, some running Windows, some on unix\nThe lines have blurred over the years - Wikipedia has an article on it, but I'd still say most of the distinctions are really artificial\nThe 'book' part is the only consistency - implying it can only be a 'book' if it's roughly a standard clamshell design, with a screen & keyboard on the inside when closed.\n\nA: Only two things I had to add here:\nThe official Apple Style Guide has the following: \n\nlaptop computer \nAvoid in favor of portable computer, which is preferred, or notebook\n  computer.

In the Mail app I use 'Forward as Attachment' a lot, with no problems. \nHowever, I just forwarded an App Store email receipt as an attachment, and the recipient couldn't open the receipt. OS X identifies the attachment as a generic document (rather than an email) and can't find an app to open it. So far, this has only happened with the App Store receipt. \nIs this problem likely due to something odd about the format of App Store receipts? If that's the case, I'll simply export those receipts to PDF and attach those files. Or is there something fundamental about attachments in Mail that I don't understand?\n\nA: App store receipts are multipart mails, first part is text/plain, second is text/html. So in theory forwarding them should work just fine, in practice I see the same behavior you are seeing.\nSo either forward them directly (not as attachment) or print a PDF first (which might be kind of hassle depending on how often you need to do it).\n\nA: A iTunes receipt is simply html [I don't have an actual App Store receipt to compare, but I would imagine it's the same]\nThe header of the receipt itself is\n\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\n  Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE\n  Content-Disposition: inline  \n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"><\\html><\\head>\n  <\\meta http-equiv=3D\"Content-Type\" content=3D\"text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-=\n  1\">\n\n…which is almost impossible to write out in markdown ;-) Ignore all the back slashes\n", "Q: MacOS Messages App Won't Send to Non-Apple Phones On my mac I used to be able to send to other mobile devices from my iMessage but now it won't send to phone numbers.

It does not affect my use on the computer at all. So my question out of curiosity is, is this normal for a single weeks usage? If not, what can I do about it?\n\nA: The Activity Monitor provides individual app network usage for the current, but it also provides the Cumulative usage for all app using Network.\n", "Q: Turn on and off MacBook Pro Retina connected to a Thunderbolt Display monitor I would like to know if there is a way to turn on and off a Macbook Pro Retina connected to a Thunderbolt Display monitor when it is closed.\nShould I open my MacBook Pro Retina each time I need to turn on my computer?\nIs the only solution to not turn it off and putting it into sleeping mode?\n\nA: You can bring up the power menu by pressing Control-Eject. You can also directly sleep (Command-Option-Eject), shut down (Command-Option-Control-Eject), restart (Command-Control-Eject), or turn off the display (Shift-Control-Eject) using the keyboard.

Hello StackExchange!\nAfter a couple years of using my macbook pro, performance has deteriorated with each update to OSX. I've tried a few things to improve it, and with no results, I decided to get a 128G SSD and a drive caddy for the CD drive, and install a clean install on it.  \nUsing the SSD as my main boot drive, and wahla, great experience. Now, I just need my old stuff. Migration assistant isn't ideal because:  \nA) the SSD is 128G, and the HDD is 500G. Lots of applications.\nB) I don't want to blindly copy over batches of filesystems, mostly because it's likely that I will copy over whatever caused performance deterioration in the first place (most likely my tinkering).  \nSo, my questions are:\nWhat's the best way to access and organize the files and applications on my HDD?\nCan I just copy over specific applications? How do I copy their settings?\nAre there things I should remove from the HDD? Like the old User Account?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you want to put your most-used files on the SSD and the less-frequently-used files on the HDD, you could make your own Fusion Drive. I'm paraphrasing the instructions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a Time Machine backup of everything. THE FUSION DRIVE-MAKING PROCESS WILL WIPE BOTH DRIVES!\n\n*Make a bootable OS X USB drive. If you can't, that's fine, but doing so will let Recovery HD live on the SSD. If you don't care about that, you can skip this step.\n\n*Boot into your brand-new bootable drive (or Recovery HD, if you don't care if Recovery HD lives on the SSD or the HDD).\n\n*Open Terminal and run diskutil list\n\n*Take note of the identifiers (the \"disk#s#\" designations) of the drives you want to use as part of the Fusion Drive. If you're in a bootable drive, you can use the entire HHD, but if you're in Recovery HD, you'll have to only use the partition that is neither EFI nor Recovery HD.\n\n*Enter the command diskutil coreStorage create [arbitrary name that you won't have to look at anywhere but in Terminal] [the disk identifiers, separated by a space]\n\n*When that process is done, one of the last lines of the output should be Core Storage LVG UUID: [long string of letters and numbers]. That long string is your Logical Volume Group's UUID, and you'll need it for the next step.\n\n*Now run the command diskutil coreStorage createVolume [the UUID from the last step] jhfs+ \"Macintosh HD\" 100%\n\n*Once that's done, your computer will officially have a single \"volume\" named Macintosh HD! Now you can reinstall OS X on it and restore it from your Time Machine backup, and it'll automatically migrate files between the SSD and the HDD based on the frequency of their use.\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Only sync photos to icloud when plugged in? I noticed that on icloud.com, when i add a reminder, it automatically gets sync on my phone when i turn on my wifi. Which is great and i really love that feature. \nBut that got me thinking, are my photos being synced too? Wouldnt that consume lots of data uploading it and also the battery? \nAlso, since im already here, why cant i access photos on the icloud.com website? Only on the windows explorer\n\nA: For syncing photos to iCloud, you can turn it off by going to Settings > iCloud and search for Photos and then turn off My Photo Stream.\nIf you want to access photos uploaded on iCloud, you need to turn on iCloud Photo Library (Beta) (in the same settings) so that it will automatically upload and store your entire library in iCloud to access photos and videos from all your devices.\n", "Q: Use MacBook Air as a monitor for Win7 Desktop PC Not sure if this is the right place to ask: but i have a Win7 machine and i want to save apartment space by foregoing the monitor, and use my existing MacBook Air screen as a temporary monitor when i reboot my Win7 machine.\nDoes that work?\n\nA: According to Apple's documentation notebooks do not support Target Display mode.\nHowever, if you run any kind of VNC software on your Windows machine you can use the Windows desktop from your Mac using the Screen Sharing application. No additional software is needed on the Mac end.\nIf your Windows machine won't boot to the desktop the VNC software will not run, so you will need a temporary monitor here. And you will need to install the VNC program somehow. \nIn short, Windows computers really expect to have a keyboard, monitor and mouse connected.\n", "Q: MBP with Serial ATA hard drive vs PCIe-based flash storage I am not sure how much logical my question is but I am planing to purchase MBP for the first time and looking at the options I have in place, I am all confused.\nI am looking at these 2 options\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro with 1TB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm and 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM\n\n*MacBook Pro 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory 128GB PCIe-based flash storage\n\n\nthere is some difference between the processor, but I am not much concerned with that.\nI will be using the MBP for the development which includes a development editor (Eclipse), a tomcat server and some other tools.\nMy only concern is about the Storage as with the second option, it seems to be quite on the lower side.\nCan any one suggest me what is the other difference between these 2 MBP (other than Retina display) which  can be critical in taking the decision (with the fact that I will be using it for development most of the time).\nMacBook Pro 13-inch\n2.5GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz\n8GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM — 2x4GB\n1TB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm\nSuperDrive 8x (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW)\nBacklit Keyboard (English) & User's Guide\n\n13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display\n2.7GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz\n8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM\n128GB PCIe-based Flash Storage\nIntel Iris Graphics 6100\nForce Touch trackpad\nBacklit Keyboard (English) & User's Guide\n\n\nA: The only measurable difference aside from storage space is that the SSD version will be slightly more secure from data loss from the occasional fall. SSDs don't suffer from disk drive failures of scratched disks. But if your not clumsy, that's not a problem. Go with the 1TB drive. 128gb is pitiful in this day and age.\n\nA: If you want the latest and fast technology buy the 5th Gen I core. Because you are getting a faster hard drive, processor, graphic card and memory. For and add 200 dollars. And I would update it to an I7 core.\nRemember when you are buying a laptop the hard drive and memory can be upgrade. But The mother broad and processor can not be upgrade if you want a faster computer. So if you are on a budget I would go with less memory and hard drive space.\n\nA: The first one has an external drive, the second hasn't.\nBiggest difference is the storage, number one has a HDD which can store more data, but is very slow and can get easily damaged trough shock\nThe second has a SSD, which can store less data, but is way faster and shock-resistant.  \nFor more information, please provide the exact model name, for example: MBP Mid 2013, 2,4ghz  \nIt also seems very unusual for me, that a MBP with an i5 has an external drive and a HDD, is this an upgraded old one from eBay or so?\n", "Q: Can I transfer content from an existing iPhone to a new iPhone which is using a new (different) Apple ID? I am trying to cut myself off from the family shared AppleID. I've just bought myself a new Macbook and have set up a new Apple ID. I have also just got a iPhone 5 to replace my dying 4.\nMy question is, can I back up the contents of my iPhone 4 and then bring that content onto the iPhone 5 with the new apple ID. I understand that I'll lose the apps that would need to be purchased again, I guess I'm more concerned about the contacts, notes, and photos.\nAny advice would be much appreciated!\n\nA: I'm a little hesitant to post this because I can't try it right now and there is, as always, a chance that it won't work. But, because you are willing to repurchase apps, the transfer should be fairly achievable. \nI would first restore from a backup of your old iPhone to your new iPhone. If you have already setup the new iPhone then you would need to wipe it and start over which would erase any data that you have created since getting the new phone. Through this process, you will sign in with your old Apple ID. After everything is restored, I would delete the iCloud account off your phone. It should ask you whether you want to keep notes, contacts, calendar, etc. choose to keep all of those items. Sign into your new Apple ID and create a backup of your data. \nAgain, as I'm sure you are aware, you will still have to work through your apps and repurchase or download all of them again. Apps like Evernote are easy because your data is in your account and you would just have to sign back in. Other apps like games are notorious for losing data. \n\nA: For contacts, you can export contact information as a vCard and then import a vCard.\n\nA: I don't know any good way of doing so. What comes to mind is you could restore the backup of the old phone and sync data with apps on the computer so that it has all the contacts and such locally. Then wipe the new phone, set it up with your new Apple ID and no backup, then sync it with the same computer. I think then it'll put all that old information on your new phone, which will put it in the new ID's iCloud storage.\n\nA: Just restore your new iPhone from a backup of your old one, then sign it out from the old Apple ID (you need to do this in several places in the settings app, AppStore, find iPhone, iCloud....)\nSign it in to your new Apple ID. You shouldn't have any problem with contacts, mailboxes etc. the only thing you'll probably lose is all of the application sandboxes, but if you turn on family sharing before you do it hopefully you won't even lose those\n", "Q: where is the jitsi log?

Recently bought just released Bang-Olufsen H8 headphones (wireless, BT 4.0, atpX A2DP). These paired perfectly with iPhone 5 and my MacBook Pro 15\" early 2011, however, sound drops out on the MBP with little to no \"provocation\" of head turn; forget about range/direct line of sight distance--can't get more than 2' away without sound drop occurring. Avg raw RSSI is approx -72.  At first it was thought that b/c MBP was BT 2.1 and the phones were 4.0 they were incompatible. After I modified the MB appropriately with new Broadcom Airport/Bluetooth card to enable BT 4.0 connectivity and found no change at all in sound drops/range, I discovered through conversation with Bluetooth expert that BT is backwards compatible so he wasn't surprised at all with continued sound drops despite modification to MBP.  If the sound drops for more than a second or two, the audio somehow speeds up to sync with the place where the sound should be. \nB&O's \"stellar\" customer service told me:  \"I received feedback from Denmark, In principle a Bluetooth 4.0 enabled product with A2DP Bluetooth profile should be able to send music to the BeoPlay H8. Practical tests have shown a very differentiated market picture. Most newer computers with updated software and adequate hardware should be able to connect to BeoPlay H8, but we are not able to recommend or support this setup.\"  I'm sure I can get them to regret that statement, but I'm much more interested in getting the BT headphones to work with my MBP. In my research so far I've found that these phones behave similarly with both iOS devices as well as OS X.  There appears to be no rhyme or reason why this is. For me, I have no problem using them with my iPhone 5; not so for others around the globe.\nQuestion is:  Is it the MBP antennae or is it the B&O H8 antenna?  Which begs the second question:  why is the performance so random--worldwide even--for wireless phones, these H8s in particular?\nThanks so much for your help. \n\nA: I have a Macbook Pro 15\" 2011 and an IPhone 6 plus. \nThese headphones worked perfectly with the iphone 6 but would stutter with the macbook which has an older bluetooth adapter. \nI had a spare usb bluetooth 4.0 adapter lying around the house which I bought for very little money off amazon and with that connected the headphones work flawlessly again.\nSome have said that its either the mac or headphones and it may be a combination of both but in my case it was the mac.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I own both the H5 and H8 and both devices have connection issues with my 2011 and 2014 macbook pro. I have noticed that the signal stutters when i rest the palm of my hands on the macbooks, but no problems when i am not. When connected to an iPhone 7 i get stellar performance; i can walk from the living room to the toilet and still get crisp performance even at 15 meters and through a concrete wall.\nThe \"empirical data\" leans towards the macbooks being the problem.\n\nA: I recently bought the h8 headphones as well and was looking extremely looking forward to them. I have the same problem though with the bluetooth dropping out. I believe it is the weak signal from the h8's not the mac (i am on a 2013 mac pro). I have a pair of harman/kardon headphones I had been using previously with the same computer over the last year, without ever experiencing bluetooth problems. I am trying to talk with B&O as well to hopefully find a resolution. Otherwise I will have to very regretfully return the headphones.

I need to install the newest version of Perl on Macbook running Yosemite.  It currently has Perl5.18 built in.  I understand that the system sometimes needs this version and it shouldn't be altered.\nI did successfully install the latest version of Perl but I can't find it using Finder or Terminal.

However, I don't see a Software Update option.\nHere's what I do see:\n\netc... then ...\n\nHas something changed?\n\nA: I assume you're using an operating system greater than 10.7 (10.8 - 10.10)?  With Mountain Lion (10.8), Apple moved the software update process to the Mac App Store application.\nPrior to 10.8 Software Updates were handled in the manner the link describes.  As such System Preferences had a Software Update section for managing timing of update checks.\nFollowing 10.8 this is no longer found in System Preferences.  Instead you should open the App Store and click on the Updates tab. Alternately the Apple menu has an option for App Store which, if updates are available, shows the number of updates waiting.  (see picture)\n\n\nA: The link you provide does not concern version of OSX where the updates are fully handled by the AppStore (OSX >= 10.8). \nThat being said, use the AppStore to update your apps :) \n", "Q: What is the meaning of the \"§\" symbol (on the upper left corner of the mac keyboard)? The title says it all, but I'll repeat it here:\nWhat is the meaning of the \"§\" symbol (on the upper left corner of the mac keyboard) as highlighted  in the image here?\nApparently, this is not printed on mac keyboards sold in the US, though it is on models sold in Europe (or Israel, in my case).\n\n\nA: It's a Section sign, and is used in Minecraft for color formatting codes.\n\nA: \"§\" is the section sign, as answered by @Lizzan.\nExcerpt from Wikipedia:\n\nThe section sign (§) is a typographical character used mainly to refer to a particular section of a document, such as a legal code. It is also called \"double S\" and \"sectional symbol\".\n  It is also sometimes used to link to a footnote where the asterisk (*) is already in use on a given page. \n\n\nA: As noted, it is the “section sign” symbol. I had no idea it was on some keyboards! On my American Apple keyboard, I can type it as ⌥6 (Option-6).\n", "Q: Partition on External Hard Drive not showing in Finder My external hard drive is partitioned into three parts - but somehow I made one of the parts go away/stop showing up in the Finder. I ran a set of recommended commands in terminal, and this is what I came up with:\n\n\"Rachel Reboot Backup\" is the one that I'm trying to get to show up again in Finder/be restored. Any advice? Disk Utility says it is mounted, and it doesn't appear to be marked hidden. I'm not sure what I did to it.\n\nA: Onyx offers the option of hiding and revealing files, folders and volumes. You'll want to select the Utilities section and then Visibility. This may help with your visibility issue. If you can regain visibility you should be able to select the mounted volume and bring up its info (command + i), then tick the \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" box.\nYou could also try logging in as Root and see if that gives you visibility of your missing partition.\nReally important bit first, as Root user you have the power to delete files that are hidden/protected under normal circumstances - be careful before deleting or moving anything as you could render your system unusable.\nWith that out of the way, you enable Root account access by using Directory Utility. This can be found in System/Library/CoreServices or System/Library/CoreServices/Applications, depending on your OS.\nFirst you need to \"Click the lock to make changes\". Then, from the Edit menu, select \"Enable Root User\". You will be prompted to create a password for the Root account. Once that's done you can log out of your own account.\nNow, log in with the username Root and the password you've just created.\nRemember, as Root user you now have the ability to break everything if you're careless - so take your time, do what you need to do and then log out as soon as you're done\nYou should be able to see straight away whether you have visibility of your errant partition. Hopefully you do. If so, see if you get the option on the info page (command + i) to \"Ignore ownership on this volume\". If it does, tick it. If not, you could then try hvtuananh's suggestion of changing ownership with the command sudo chown RachelNicholsIII:staff /Volumes/RachelReboot Backup.\nIf any of that helps then logout and back into your usual account, then disable the Root account using the option in Directory Utility as previously outlined.\nOnce more, be careful what you do when logged in as Root!\n\nA: Backslash escape character is needed when typing the Volume name (which contains a space) in the terminal.  I mean that your disk is called \n\"RachelReboot Backup\"  \n\nSo we need a \\ before the space in the middle of the name. \nOpen your terminal and type:\nsudo chown -R `whoami` /Volumes/RachelReboot\\ Backup\n\n", "Q: Avoid Unwanted/Blank Text Annotations in Preview.app When opening a PDF in Yosemite's Preview.app, I can select text using the Text Selection tool from the Markup Toolbar.  However, if I don't click directly on the text, a blank text box will appear.  For some reason Preview thinks I want to add an annotation everywhere I click even though I have not selected the Text tool.\nThis is a problem in that it signals an edit to the document, thus changing the modification date and creating an auto-saved version with no meaningful changes.  \nIn previous versions of OS X, I could have solved this problem by using: defaults write com.apple.Preview ApplePersistence -bool no.  Yet this does not seem to have an effect in Yosemite.\nAny workarounds?\n\nA: I might state the obvious. When it's the first (accidental) edit you make in a document, Undo/Command-Z will not only remove the involuntary text box, but will also revert the document state back to 'unchanged'.\nAfter test addition: You may have to click on a 'safe' zone outside of the text box for Undo to function. Thus creating additional 'edits', you have to Undo-away. My experience is, that after two or three undos the 'edited' tag disappears behind the filename in the window title.\nJust tried it and had one additional observation:\nThe only way I found to get the text box to appear was clicking on or near a line in the pdf. That's a feature not a bug: Preview assumes you want to fill out a form.\nHope this helps.\nEerk\n\nA: Change your active tool (in the Tools menu) from \"Text Selection\" to \"Rectangle Selection\". Once you have done so, clicking or dragging in the PDF will create a (temporary) rectangular selection box. This action isn't treated as an edit, so it won't prompt you to save the document when you close it.\nSelecting this tool is not \"sticky\" across documents, but you can add the \"Selection\" button to your toolbar to make it easier to activate. The button acts as a toggle.\n(Frustratingly, hyperlinks don't work while the selection tool is active. You will need to switch back to text selection to activate them.)\n", "Q: App store using incorrect e-mail address as username - iPhone 6 I upgraded my 4s to an iPhone 6 yesterday at the Sprint store.

Luckily they didn't take my external drive, where I have a Time Machine back up of all my data, which is extremely important to me (mostly, unfinished music productions projects in Ableton)\nSince new MacBooks ship with OS X Yosemite, would I able to restore my Time Machine backup on a new laptop?\n\nA: Yes, the migration assistant can migrate from an older version. However it cannot migrate from a newer version.\nBackup of 10.9 --> System on 10.10 works\nBackup of 10.10 --> System on 10.9 does not work\n\nA: It's the other way around, your Time Machine OS has to be same or newer than whatever computer you are installing it on. I bought a 2018 laptop, running the latest OS, and was not able to restore my circa 2012 OS time machine. Apple told me that I have to buy a computer that originally came with the same OS as my time machine, or it won't work.\n", "Q: Remove licenses from deleted user on OS X Server's VPP managed distribution We buy apps using Volume Purchase Program with managed distribution through OS X Server's profile manager.\nOne of employees left, so I removed his user account from OS X Server. However, the licenses for apps we bought him are still unavailable to re-assign to other users, and I can't remove them from his account manually because it has been deleted.\nViewing the app's info page in Profile Manager shows that we have 13 - 3 = 10 licenses in use, and only lists 9 people who currently hold licenses to the app:\n\nIs there anything I can do to reclaim that license?

We commonly know that system updates will fix the kernel defects that have been discovered or not previously disclosed, to make the OS more secure.\nHowever, what if I accidentally deleted some kernel files, will a new system update recovers the kernel files I deleted?\n\nA: System updates (on any system) only modify targeted files which need improvment or removal.\nThey might accidentally repair a file you have damaged.\nThey might also accidentally damage a file you have fixed. But this isn't their target.\nA full install will of course reinstall any file you removed.\n\nA: Most likely not.

Should I continue looking for 'trim enabling' software?  It doesn't seem to exist.  Does the PPC architecture have a built in feature that manages SSD space?\n\nA: You can look here[1]. The members of this thread seem to agree that writing 1s (FF) to unused space by the OS allows the GC on the disk to do its job, effectively the same as TRIM. \nUnfortunately they devolve into insulting each others' knowledge of SSDs and Mac chipsets in general before doing anything useful. One of the commenters claimed there was a utility to write FF to unused blocks for PPC macs, but I've been unable to find it. \n[1]: [http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1953430]\n\n\nA: There's no way a PPC can have any clue what an SSD is, nor any OS or driver that runs on it - they are 10 years apart in architectural terms.\nI'd be happy enough it recognises the drive at all. \nI do have to ask, how did you achieve it?

The website distributes its software for free, but bundles it with malicious files/adware and are payed per install. Even secure websites can sometimes acquire malware, so you should always scan whatever you download.\nWhen you locate the free program, Google it and find out how to completely uninstall it, for some malicious files cannot be removed by deleting them, as they spread.

In other words, we can view the conversation on our iMessage and on our email that we added the new iCloud email to?\nIf not, how can we have our conversations automatically copied to an email in order for us to that not have to screen shot every Conversation which is quite cumbersome?\nThanks\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, it is possible to have several iCloud email account on your single iPhone 5. You cannot have multiple Apple ID's on the same phone, but can have many email accounts.\n\n*No, you really cannot iMessage from multiple iCloud email accounts. That said, it is technically possible, but would require going into the Settings app every time you wanted to message from a different email account and would prove to be quite cumbersome to setup. Even then, they could easily message your other iCloud accounts that were linked to messages. This could quickly result in your having several message threads from the same recipient - an unfortunate situation.\n\n*Yes, you could technically set up a rule that would forward emails received from the Coworker to another email. Then you could set up that email to automatically tag or mark emails from that iCloud account as read or whatever was needed. It would not be possible with iMessage.\n\n\nHonestly, it sounds like coercing iCloud and iMessage into what you need is a little too much for what it was designed for. While it may be possible to figure a solution out, it is more likely that you could find a third-party solution that would suit you well. Case in point, Google offers Gmail and Hangouts which would allow for emailing and instant messaging - all for free and with associated apps if desired. There is chat history and emails can be archived forever.\n", "Q: A new device showed up on facetime which I don't own I got a notification saying a MacBook Pro is using facetime with my Apple ID, but I don't have a MacBook Pro. How do I verify what device this is and where it is coming from? Should I be concerned about this?\n\nA: The idea of those notifications is to alert you to the possibility of unauthorized usage on your Apple ID. Obviously, I get them any time I restore a computer, load up a new device, or just sign out of Facetime (or Messages) and back in, but for me it makes sense as I can relate it to a particular event. \nSince you do not have a MacBook Pro, you certainly have reason to be suspicious. An Apple ID can expose a large amount of information to a nefarious user. \nIf I were you I would reset my Apple ID password and enable 2-step authentication. \n", "Q: What are the search parameters to get Xcode 4.2?

Not sure how I did it, but iPhoto is gone from my computer, along with all of my 800+ photos. How can I get my photos back? I reinstalled iPhoto and signed in, but it is empty.\n\nA: Assuming you didn’t delete your iPhoto Library, but just iPhoto\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall iPhoto from the Mac App Store [you did this, go to 2]\n\n*Hold down the option key while opening iPhoto to select a different default library. The current default is the empty library. We want to track down your original library. \n\n*Click “Choose library...”\n\n*By default, your iPhoto Library is located in /Volumes/<HDNAME>/Users/<USERNAME>/Pictures/. Assuming you haven’t deleted the library itself, or moved it to a different location, your original iPhoto Library will be located in your pictures folder. It will be labeled iPhoto Library_2.iphotolibrary, iPhoto Library.iphotolibrary~old or something of that nature. I don’t know what the exact name will be. You will be able to tell the new from the old simply by examining the size (800 photos will be atleast a couple GB’s). Select the old library. \n\n*When iPhoto opens, your original library should be present and intact. If it’s not, you’ve just selected the current default library. Repeat steps 2-4 in this case. \n\n*Once you have identified the correct original library - using step 5 - you can now safely delete the empty (false) iPhoto Library from your pictures folder. Your original iPhoto library is now your default. \n\n", "Q: Does a bootable OS X drive need more free space than the installer? I made an 8GB partition on my HD to serve as a bootable OS X Yosemite drive, but it seems to still have 2.63GB free after the bootable drive-making procedure. Does the bootable drive need that space to be able to function properly, or can I bring it back into my startup disk partition?\n\nA: I just made an installer image for OS X 10.10 to install in a virtual machine and it's only 5268873216 bytes or 4.90702 GB in Base2, in Base10 it's 5.27GB.  So you could have made it smaller.  Not sure if you can resize it, you can try and if not delete it and start with a smaller partition.  BTW There does need to a just a bit of free space as it's written to during the install.\n", "Q: I have to turn my Apple TV on to make it discoverable by laptops/phones Whenever I want to share my screen to my apple tv, I first need to find the apple tv remote and turn it on.  I used to be able to, at anytime, go to the displays dropdown and select my Apple TV to share to.  Now, my ATV only shows up when I turn it on first.\nI see the setting \"sleep after X\" on my ATV but I don't think this setting is the solution.\nIs there a setting I'm missing?\nMy macbooks and iphone are all running the latest software, and no programs see it at all until I turn it on. ( itunes, beamer, display port, popcorn time )\n\nA: In my experience, the \"sleep after X\" is the solution. If I can't see on my apple tv the power diode on - the device is at sleep and I will not be able to use it as a target for airplay. \nIt should be said my apple tv is only connected through wifi. I wonder if connecting it through ethernet would make any difference (although I suspect it wouldn't). \n", "Q: Jailbroken iPod Touch (5th generation) erase all content & settings problems.

Anyway, like i've been told, I boot his macbook into target disk mode and connect it to my macbook via thunderbolt cable. After I unlock his hard drive it just doesn't show in my finder window. Is there something wrong on my end? Some sort of human error? Mind you the macbook is going in to get it's motherboard, fan and hard drive replaced. I figure it's due to one of those but just incase I just thought i'd reach out. \n\nA: You mention \"unlocking\" the drive which would suggest your brother is using filevault (the drive is encrypted). If the drive/file system is indeed damaged, I find it unlikely you will be able to recover data. \nIf your brother happens to be using an \"old design\" MacBook Pro with a non-ssd harddrive, you can still pull the drive out quite easily and connect it externally to your macbook to have a look without the motherboard being a factor. You will not loose warranty by doing this, but do consult  ifixit (the best source of Apple repair guides online) to do this properly.\n", "Q: Use keyboard for accessing Emacs Menu I am using the \nbrew install emacs\n\nversion of gui-based emacs.

Opening a tab in Safari displays it with a \"chrome remote\" icon on the other computer.\nHas one of you ever seen this feature?\nBoth Macs are using the same iCloud-Address.\nBtw: There is no Chrome \"iCloud Tabs\" Extension installed, but like I said this problem happens on Safari too.\n\nA: If you really mean by  automatically opens in task bar as a Browser icon displays a the little icon on top of it in the Dock (Handoff app icon in Dock ), and when you click it it opens the same page you are viewing on the other Mac.\nthen this is nothing to do with iCloud.\nThis a feature called Hand off. Have a read here\n\nWhen your Mac computers and iOS devices are within Bluetooth range of\n  each other (about 33 feet or 10 meters), they can automatically “hand\n  off” what you’re doing from one device to another. For example, you\n  can start writing an email in Mail on your iPhone, then instantly pick\n  up where you left off in Mail on your Mac.\nHandoff works with several apps that come\n  with OS X Yosemite and iOS 8: Calendar, Contacts, Mail, Maps,\n  Messages, Notes, Phone (iOS only), Reminders, and Safari. It also\n  works with Keynote v6.5, Numbers v3.5, and Pages v5.5 for Mac, and\n  Keynote, Numbers, and Pages v2.5 for iOS. Third-party apps may also\n  work with Handoff.\n\n", "Q: iPod classic hard drive upgrade I was reading online that you can replace an iPod classic hard drive, my question is how do you manage to duplicate the iPod OS onto the new hard drive?\nHow do you mount the iPod classic hard drive to take a backup? What kind of connectors do you use? Is there any way to mount the iPod hard drive onto a Mac, so that I can use the Disk Utility and make DMG's of the software and EFI?\n\nA: Yes, you can replace the hard drive in an iPod Classic. There is no need to replicate anything on to the drive as all the OS is stored in firmware separate to the drive. Once there is a blank drive in the iPod the firmware will take over. Instructions are here at iFixIt.\nMounting the Classic to take a backup is another question entirely. Since you can't actually get to the OS to back it up the only thing you need to backup is the music and I assume you have a copy of that already. If you don't then I recommend Senuti to recover a copy of your music and playlists to your Mac.\n", "Q: VPN Tracker 6 won't work on Mac OS X Yosemite Equinux VPN Tracker 6 won't start on Mac OS X Yosemite.

What's using storage? I have deleted all my e-mail accounts from Mail from the iPhone -- iCloud, my work account, etc., and have reset the phone (powering off and then back on) a couple of times. \nIn Settings/General/Storage, I still show 186 MB of data being used by mail. Is the Mail app itself 186 MB? If not, how can I free up some of the space being \"used\" when there are no accounts at all on the phone? \n\nA: I struggled with this and spent a whole day trying to figure out why my mail app on my iphone suddenly took up 2.5.gigabytes of storage!  I did all of the suggestions on various websites to no avail.  I did however finally FIX IT.  I deleted all of my mail accounts and then DELTED THE MAIL APP.  Presto!  This seemed to be the key to fix the problem.  I was able to recover 2.5 gigs of storage back to my 16gb iphone.   I then reinstalled the mail app and started over again.  This seemed to work for me.  Another thing to try is to download one of the many (and good) third party email apps.  Hope this helps you all.\n-Patty\n\nA: Took a look at my storage settings and can see that mine is using 179 MB of space with all my accounts still in there so I'm guessing that you are correct about it being mostly application. \nUnfortunately, I don't think you can get rid of the app if the phone is not jailbroken so if you are running out of space, which I guess is the issue, then you will have to look elsewhere for room.\nHave you check the Camera Roll in that area? That is usually a big culprit of being a space hog. I upload my photos to Google+ to back them up and delete them from my phone regularly. Not the best solution but keeps the phone memory usage low.\n\nA: in iPhone go to Settings->General->Storage&iCloudUsage->Storage->ManageStorage.  and see what is using storage.\n", "Q: Can I force external microphone detection after mic is plugged in Background: I use a Henge Dock for my MBPr with a headset for things like Skype. Because the Henge Dock uses an extension cable to make the audio 'Combination Output' (TRRS) port accessible, the microphone is only detected if it's plugged into the extension BEFORE the MacBook is docked. This is a very common issue and well documented.\nProblem / Question: I leave my MacBook docked most of the time, but I use my headset on multiple devices each day. This means that to get the headset mic to work each time, I either have to un-dock/dock, or restart... not ideal! I would like a way of toggling the headset detection. It must be a software related function that can probably be accessed through a script. \nAny ideas? Thanks!\n\nA: I've been struggling with the same issue as you and I've come up with two solutions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dedicated headset that stays connected to the system (not really an option for you).\n\n*Connecting my headset and briefly putting the system to sleep via the Apple menu. I literally wait for the screen of my Thunderbolt display to turn off and immediately wake it back up. If you require a password to wake the system and have it set to immediate, changing it to 5 seconds allows you to immediately sleep/wake the system without having the reenter your password.\n\n\nThat's the best I've come up with so far. For what it's worth I think the issue we're seeing is how headphone jacks work at an electrical level and how the system itself handles enabling and disabling the port when a cable is detected. My understanding is that headphones work on a closed loop system so when we disconnect the mic from the extension we're breaking that loop and the only way to fix it is by having the port disabled and reenabled (and only the system can do that when it detects there's no cable inserted).\n", "Q: Using iMac 21.5 mid 2010 as an external monitor of Macbook Pro Retina late 2013 15\"? Can I connect iMac 21.5 mid 2010 as an external monitor of Macbook Pro Retina late 2013 15\"? How can I connect them?\nI read some articles that say it can be done with Mini DisplayPort-to-Mini DisplayPort like http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/connect-a-macbook-to-an-imacs-display-with-target-display-mode but I’m not sure if the author is referring to the 27 iMac only or all iMacs mid 2010.\nHas anybody had some experience in connecting these?\nHere’s my iMac details:\n\n\n\n\nA: I've tried this and yes it does/can work, depending on your setup. So far I've managed to hook a 2012 MBP 13\" to a 2012 21\" iMac via Thunderbolt, and the cmd + F2 function works once logged in.\nHowever, I've not managed to connect to a 2011 iMac (non-Thunderbolt model) using the same MacBook and Thunderbolt cable - I don't have a DisplayPort cable to hand to see if that works or not so right now I can't verify if yours will work or not. \n\nA: I found another way of doing this and it does not require any additional cables.  It can be done wirelessly and with our downloading any (non Apple) software. And yes, I've done this using a Mid 2010 21.5 inch iMac which alegedly does not support scree sharing.

At the bottom select your AppleTV from your Air Display menu and tick \"Show mirroring option in the menu bar when available)\n\n*Go back to your old Mac and from the Screen Sharing software option click on the option with the arrows pointing out under Scaling (it's on the left) and on the drop down menu from Displays select (Display 2: 1680 x 1050).  You might need to point the mouse to the top to the old Mac's screen for the Screen Sharing software options to re-appear as they disappear after a while.\nFollow these instruction and you'll be all with wireless screen sharing. \n\n\nThis is a good way to extend the life of your old iMac which otherwise would probably either end up recycled or left in the loft doing noting.\nI hope this will work as well for you as it does for me :-) \nps. the only issue is that this does not cover the total surface of the screen.

I might have to bring my Early 2013 MacBook Pro Retina in for service as the screen shows some strange smudging (I just post it here as it looks quite strange...).\nBut I replaced the internal SSD with a JetDrive 725 recently. Will my my AppleCare Protection Plan still be valid, or should I just put the original in again?\n\n\nA: When I purchased my early 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina Display, as well as a previous MacBook Pro seven years earlier, I specifically asked about changing the HDD and RAM in the older one and the SSD in the newer one myself and in both instances I was told that it didn't void the warranty as long as there was no evidence that the work done by myself was the direct/indirect cause of a subsequent issue.  The problem with such a response is having to prove on my part that a subsequent issue was not the direct/indirect cause of the subsequent issue if Apple challenged repairing it under warranty.  The sales person and tech at the Genius Bar both said that Apple expects that some Users would upgrade parts like HDD/SDD and or RAM where applicable and said it doesn't directly void the warranty in doing so, except with the aforementioned caveat.\nSo I waited until the older one was out of warranty before I upgraded both the HDD and RAM.  The newer one I maxed out at the time so I doubt I'll pull the 750 GB SSD any time soon or within the warranty period.\nGood luck with Apple!\n", "Q: the max number of icloud accounts you can set up on iphone 5 I recently had my iPhone stolen, it was recovered but both of my apple ids were altered and I can not use them.  the person who stole the phone must have set up one or more accounts because when setting up new account it error messaged maximum number of free accounts activated.

This is especially true if you're loading anything ONLY onto that Mac, as the company likely has no obligation to allow retrieval of the data if you are terminated.\n\n\n*\n\n*Should we link our personal stuff with our work computer ?\n\n\nSee my last note.  Typically it's not a good idea.  You'll inevitably end up with some personal data on the work Mac but in general I would try to avoid it.\n\n\n*\n\n*What do I need to consider ?\n\n\nConsider the right to data on the Mac.  They are providing the Mac to you as a tool for work, unless otherwise agreed on as some sort of benefit.  Consider that their IT team has the right to all of the data on the Mac, whereas you only have the right to your specific data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Admin see messages, emails, browsing history on other account ?\n\n\nEmails?  Absolutely.  Browsing history? Absolutely.  Messages?  I assume iMessage/instant messenger, they can absolutely see the history (unless cleared) but may or may not be able to use the actual messaging accounts.  Typically though where there is a will, there is a way.  IT folks are very good at finding ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do they have even have the right to see other people personal stuffs ?\n\n\nYes.  Because it is stored on their equipment.  Were you give any paperwork when you were hired?  It likely included about statements data ownership with company owned equipment.\nSource: I'm the Mac admin for a large nonprofit, overseeing roughly 200 Macs across multiple locations world wide.  We have relatively continuous turn over and as such we regularly access user accounts when people leave or if they are under investigation for improper activity.  It pains me to see some of my users using their Mac as they would a home computer, storing photos, music, etc on them because they will likely lose all of that if/when their employment is terminated. Long ago, to try and make this clearer to the end users, I added a usage agreement (our standard legal data statement) that they have to click through to log in.  It clearly states that the Macs are for work use and that the organization owns ALL of the data residing on the machines and our servers.  This is pretty standard practice throughout the enterprise.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: If they own the hardware then you have no rights whatsoever beyond what they might extend to you and they can do whatever they so please.  I would never under any circumstances mix and or access anything personal from a work computer!\n\nA: First things first: Don't! \nI had a similar situation a while ago – but since I already knew what is possible, I didn't even consider installing or running or loading anything personal on that machine. \nAdditionally you should be aware that literally everything you do online can be monitored – even everything you see on your scren. So back then for me it was also not an option to check in to private webmail, facebook or whatever pribvate online accounts you might have. The least taht can happen is that this could be considered 'wasting work time'. And I suppose very few employers are willing to sponsor your private / social life in such a way in the long run.\nTo avoid unpleasant 'misunderstandings' you should probably reduce to using your smart phone for checking private mail etc. during lunch breaks.\nps. just imaging a friend asking you if you could 'play ill' for some extended weekend trip or the like –– not a good idea…\n", "Q: Is it more memory/processor-efficient to open many windows in one desktop, or to make all these windows fullscreen? I have many, many windows that must be open all at once (VM, Email client, browser, IDE, source navigator, issue tracker, notebook, etc...), and have often bumped up against my MacBook's 16GB of RAM. Would it be more efficient to have these all in 1 or 2 desktops, or to have as many as possible fullscreen in their own desktop?\nMy logic here is that if they're all in 1 desktop (or 2 with a 2-monitor setup), then the Mac doesn't have to track which desktop each is on, and can use that memory for other things. On the other hand, if I have many fullscreen windows, then it doesn't have to worry about what may be in front of / behind those windows, because it will only be them and maybe a preferences dialog, so maybe it wouldn't care at all about windows on other desktops, or in other fullscreens.\nIntuitively, I also feel there must be a performance hit from having so many virtual desktops open. I don't know how Mac OS handles it, but I feel like there's probably duplicate objects there (perhaps each has its own menu bar, dock, icons, etc.)\n\nA: To expand on patrix's point in comments above, essentially OS X keeps track of every open window regardless of where it is, because there is a process(es) running each window. It also manages RAM usage, taking from the poor (less recently used open programs) and giving to the rich (program currently being used). Even if a program has an open window on the same virtual desktop, if needed, OS X will cull RAM from that program to feed the currently active program.\nIt's theoretically possible you would incur a graphics performance penalty for having everything on one desktop, especially if you have transparency enabled, but otherwise, there aren't really any system implications. So, basically, do whatever works best for your workflow.\n\nA: OS X has a feature called App Nap that slows down any apps that aren't front-and-center and aren't running a background task for you. I don't know what your setup looks like, but I think your logic about the computer not having to worry about the non-fullscreen windows sounds right. You should run an experiment and see what happens!\n", "Q: Open application from terminal and remain linked to the process (like Linux) so when CTRL+C is sent to terminal the application closes too I have an application (closed-source tool not developed by me) which requires another process to exist before executing properly.  When I quit this application, I also want that custom process to be killed.  My solution is to have a shell script \"launcher\".  I can handle creating shell script menus, the on-close event, and opening/killing the processes.  The problem is that I can't seem to figure out how to open an application from Terminal but keep Terminal locked on that application so that when I close the Terminal window or send CTRL+C the application closes.

Wherein I do not want to allow any user/admin/root to delete my security agent application normally.\nIf user/admin/root try to delete the .app file then OS should show password dialog. If user knows the password then only it should be deleted.\nAny pointer on this would be helpful.\n\nA: Disclaimer\nThis answer is not intended as security advice for regular users. Setting your Mac's securelevel to 1 could potentially cause certain software or hardware drivers to malfunction, so I advise doing your own due diligence and independent research and testing to determine whether there could be any undesirable consequences to performing these steps.\nSection 5.4.2 of the below-linked article about BSD's features related to security restrictions on the super-user is a good place to start. http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/other/puis3rd/0596003234_puis3-chp-5-sect-4.html\nIn case that link breaks in the future, the most important section of the article lists the effects of setting kern.securelevel=1:\n\nWrite access to the raw disk partitions is prohibited. (This forces\n  all changes to the disk to go through the filesystem.)\nRaw access to the SCSI bus controller is prohibited.\nFiles that have the immutable flag set cannot be changed. Files that\n  have the append-only bit set can only be appended to, and not\n  otherwise modified or deleted.\nThe contents of IP packets cannot be logged.\nRaw I/O to the system console is prohibited.\nRaw writes to system memory or I/O device controllers from user\n  programs are prohibited.\nSome access is denied to the Linux /proc filesystem.\nAdditional kernel modules cannot be loaded.\nThe system clock cannot be set backwards. In addition, it cannot be\n  set forward more than a maximum of one second, and it can be set\n  forward only once per second (effectively, the clock can be pushed at\n  most to double time).\nThis list is not comprehensive.\n\nTLDR: setting kern.securelevel=1 could have more consequences than what's described in the below steps. Be careful.\nThat said, I have tested out these steps on a regular iMac with OS X 10.10.2 and did not notice any problems as a result. In the past, securelevel 1 was the default setting for OS X, and manpages in OS X 10.10 still indirectly indicate that 1 is the default setting (they say you must reboot in single user mode to remove schg, which requires securelevel 0).\nHowever, in reality, securelevel 0 has been the default setting since OS X 10.5. When the online community learned that Apple quietly changed the default to 0, some sysadmins on Apple Discussions threads called it \"unconscionable\" of Apple to do this. I've also found some security guides online that say setting kern.securelevel=1 is an important step to take for securing your Mac. YMMV.\nAnswer Summary\nAs long as you set a firmware password on a Mac, you can make any file on that Mac unable to be deleted by anyone, just by using this simple Terminal command:\nsudo chflags schg /path/to/file\n\nNext make sure your Mac will always boot to securelevel 1 by doing:\nsudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nOnce in vi editor, type i to enter insert mode, then type kern.securelevel=1. Next hit enter, then colon, then type wq and hit enter.\nLastly in Terminal type:\nsudo chflags schg /etc/sysctl.conf\nsudo sysctl kern.securelevel=1\n\nNow that securelevel is 1 and the schg flag is set, the file cannot be deleted unless the system is rebooted into single user mode.\nIf a firmware password has been set, you need that password to get into single user mode. Further you need it to get into target disk mode or change the startup disk. \nWith the schg flag set, even root cannot delete the file. Nobody can modify it from the Finder or Terminal. It will appear locked in the Finder, but the locked checkbox will always remain grayed out, no matter what, even with an admin password. In the Terminal, sudo rm /path/to/file will now fail, saying \"Operation not permitted\". Also, sudo SetFile -a l /path/to/file will fail with, \"ERROR: Unexpected error. (-5000)\". :D\nTo delete this file, someone will need to use the firmware password to reboot into single user mode, then unset the schg flag using this command:\nsudo chflags noschg /path/to/file\n\nAfter that it can be deleted.\nUPDATE: Critical Extra Steps Necessary for Answer to Work\nUpdate added Wed. 18 Mar. 2015 ~1:20 PM PDT: it came to my attention in the comments to this answer that someone with sudo access on the system could delete the protected file by renaming the /private/etc directory, then copying all its contents except the sysctl.conf file into a new /private/etc directory, and restarting. This would cause secure level to revert to zero.\nTo prevent this, after performing the above steps, you should also perform the following commands:\nsudo chflags schg /private\nsudo chflags -h schg /etc\n\nThe first command makes the /private directory and its subdirectories unable to be renamed. The second command makes the root-level symbolic link to /private/etc impossible to rename or delete. (The -h argument makes chflags act upon the symbolic link itself, instead of acting on the target of the symbolic link.) \nMain Caveats\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're on a Hackintosh or Mac Pro with an unofficial PC graphics card that has not been flashed with official Apple firmware or something functionally identical to that, this trick won't work. I am not sure if they can boot to single user mode, so if you establish the sysctl.conf file, and set it to schg, it may be like that forever. Which means any files set to schg can never be deleted.\n\n*There may be some physical ways to reset the firmware password by removing RAM or delete the file by removing the SSD/HDD and attaching to another computer.\nExplanation of Answer\nTo set a firmware password for your Mac using the steps shown when you google, \"how to set a firmware password on a mac\". Briefly the steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot in recovery mode\n\n*Select Firmware Password Utility from the Utilities menu and set the password\n\n*...\n\n*PROFIT!\nExplanation of Caveats\nNote that on Macs with removable RAM, a hacker may be able to reset your firmware password by changing the amount of RAM, then clearing your PRAM a bunch of times. So on Macs like that, take appropriate physical security measures to prevent manual access to the computer's internal components.  \nSuffice it to say you must get to securelevel 0 for chflags noschg to work, and normally the only way to get back to securelevel 0 is to reboot in single user mode. Again this might be impossible if your Mac lacks Apple firmware. If you're paranoid/unsure, can see your current securelevel by typing sysctl kern.securelevel in Terminal; it should always be 1 after the steps have been followed unless you're in single user mode!\nFurther notes\nAs far as I know, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the only way around a firmware password (other than resetting it through the RAM removal trick) is to remove the primary hard disk or SSD from the computer in question, and access it from another computer using a SATA to USB adapter, or something similar. (Government agencies and/or Apple might have a secret, classified backdoor... but if they're after you, then you probably want to delete files, not prevent their deletion :D.)\nSo, technically speaking, setting schg only really solves your problem with 100% infallibility if you're on one if the newer Macs without replaceable RAM and without a replaceable hard drive (i.e. a Retina MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, etc.) and you set your EFI password, because those are the only Macs without removable RAM or a removeable SSD. (Of course if someone takes out your drive just to delete a file, again, you probably have worse problems, like, dude where's my hard drive?)\nThe 21.5\" iMac's lack of \"user-replaceable\" RAM makes it a lot harder to circumvent the EFI password and steal RAM, which is probably why Apple made it that way, as it's intended heavily for use in schools where kids can and will circumvent any security measures :D (I know because in my day we used to hack right past AtEase on System 7 to play Marathon...)\nOn non-21.5\" iMacs you can prevent the RAM-removal/firmware-password-reset trick by investing $40-50 in a Maclocks-brand lock for iMac. It goes into the security port and has a metal plate that covers up the power socket where the release for the RAM hatch is. With that physical lock in place, someone would need a diamond saw or similar to delete your schg-protected file... and if people are taking diamond saws to your computers then you have a lot worse problems to worry about than a file getting deleted, like, dude, where's my computer?\n", "Q: How to set ⌘ + H to enable show hidden files I want my Mac to show hidden files when i hit ⌘ + H (like ubuntu).

The WiFi status indicator on the toolbar hasn't changed, holding option while clicking shows that it thinks it's fully connected, shows the signal strength info I would expect, says the internet is \"reachable\", etc.\nHowever, pinging any domain/IP fails, and even pinging the router itself fails.

Other e-mail clients I have used in the past did this automatically.\nI have poked around a bit in the preferences and in the menus but I haven't found anything to enable such a feature.  How do I enable Apple's default mail app to show me the information in the overview of my messages? (My mail window comes up with mailboxes/folders on the left, followed by a list of e-mail summaries (sender, date, subject, and the first few words of the e-mail) to the right of that, and on the right is the actual contents of whatever message is selected.  I don't see any indication of priority anywhere.\nTechnical note: the sender is setting the following headers to indicate priority:\nX-Priority: 1 (Highest)\nX-MSMail-Priority: High\nImportance: High\n\n\nA: My recommendation is to use Apple Mail's rules to customize how you want these displayed—you can make them stand out even more than a simple !! in the message list by setting up a Rule in Preferences:\n\nIn this case, specify that you want to apply the rule to messages with high priority. Then choose the formatting that you want. I chose to list messages with a red background.

Awhile back, a pair of headphones I owned broke off inside of the headphone slot on my Mid-2012 13\" MacBook Pro. I followed some instructions suggested by people online which involved using a bit of superglue with a toothpick to get the stuck piece out of the port. Unfortunately this didn't work, and I'm now stuck with the piece of headphone in my MacBook. \nNaturally, OS X will not play any sound. When trying to adjust the volume I am presented with the \"system problem\" icon. (A speaker with an X under it, or something similar). Basically I'm assuming it's detecting an issue with the audio port. So in OS X I'm left with no sound unless I use Bluetooth headphones.\nToday, I installed Windows 8.1 using Bootcamp. After installing the Bootcamp Support Software, I was surprised to hear that I could play sound through my MacBook's speakers. I have looked online in the past trying to find a way to override the headphone port in OS X. The general consensus seems to be that it's simply not possible, because the speakers are disabled on a hardware level by the piece of headphone. Obviously this is not true, since Windows is able to play sound.\nAny ideas as to why this might be, or how I can actually go about bypassing the broken headphone port? I really appreciate any help that's provided. Thank you!\n\nA: So with a lot of time and hard work on behalf of a much more patient friend of mine, I was able to get the stuck piece of headphone out of my Macbook. I can now use my speakers, however the headphone port itself is not working. (There may have been some super glue in it from when I previously tried to remove the piece, and it required a lot of digging and scraping to get it out)\nUnfortunately this does not answer the original question I asked, but it would appear that there is absolutely no way to make OS X play sound, even though Windows has no issue playing sound. This is very unfortunate. Good luck to everyone who was in my situation, and thank you to everyone who posted their advice in the comments. I appreciate it! :)\n", "Q: Pages question on Apple yosemite How can I get rid of the Right hand column (with Margin, layout info) on \nthe Pages.

Today my app's metadata was rejected by Apple.\nReason -\n\"8.1 - Apps must comply with all terms and conditions explained in the Guidelines for Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights and the Apple Trademark List\"\nYour app does not comply with the Guidelines for Using Apple's Trademarks and Copyrights. Specifically, your app marketing screenshots show the iOS home screen and native iOS app icons.\nI asked them why almost all other apps could use iPhone on app screenshots but I can't?\nOn that they answered: \nOn occasion, there may be apps on the App Store that don't appear to be in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines. We work hard to ensure that the apps on the App Store are in compliance and we try to identify any apps currently on the App Store that may not be. It takes time to identify these occurrences but another app being out of compliance is not a reason for your app to be.\nPlease remove any likeness of Apple trademarks from your app.\nMy screenshots look like:\n\nI'm rather confused by the rejection reason because a lot of other apps (e.g. https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id915637540, https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id637855838 (very similar to mine), \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id461953674, https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id284815942) use similar screenshots, apparently without problems.\nI would really like to submit the app with the screenshots as they are, what is the recommended course of action to reconsider a submission?\n\nA: If you step back, you might succeed in arguing \"but officer, all the other drivers were speeding\" in defense of your situation if the officer hasn't heard that argument 100 or 1000 times already.\nInstead, realize that you are swimming against that tide now and Apple is changing the requirements and wording on what is acceptable marketing for app screen shots.\nSee these changes at: http://www.appstorereviewguidelineshistory.com\nApple is the seller and there are actual legal consequences if a consumer asks for a refund since the product being sold is different than described. Specifically, Apple markets your app with those images as \"screenshots\"\nIf you look at the kickstarter app every single image is one that you would see if you pressed the home button and sleep button and released both while the Kickstarter app was running.\nNone of the images you submitted are screen shots of the app. They might be screen shots of marketing materials or a web site, but that's not what Apple is selling.\nAnd yes - you are blatantly in violation of the marketing agreement and using Apple's trademarked design for promoting your product, so stop doing that right away,\nIf you look at the current review guidelines and Apple's marketing agreement with developers, I'd say you'll want to adhere to several items in particular:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the preamble - If your App is rejected, we have a Review Board that you can appeal to. If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.\n\n*From the marketing agreement 2.4 - Never display the iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch Home screen or any icon or image that you do not own.\n\n*Also from the marketing agreement 2.7 - Do not surround the product with a highlight.\n\n*Also from the marketing agreement 2.10 - Screenshots should display only the actual screen content from your app that a user will see when the app is running. Do not incorporate Apple product images into your screenshots on the App Store.\n\n\nI wouldn't recommend taking this to the review board, since this is so clearly wrong on several fronts (using Apple's home screen and iPhone image as well as not using actual screenshots where screenshots are requested).\nLastly, if you really want to use Apple's images you could contact their legal and licensing teams and get written permission to use Apple's icons and design beyond what the standard agreement allows. You'll probably have to pay for it, but my guess is that some companies have gotten Apple to budge on this since they co-market products. Think AT&T and such buying national media but it's not impossible that some apps in the store also have Apple's blessing to use a home screen.\nCheers and good luck with your app.\n", "Q: How to install Xcode 4.2.1 for OS X Lion 10.7.5 These instructions say \"install xcode\", but then say \"once you have xcode installed\".

For posterity, I thought I'd at least mention this to anyone else that there's an extra thing to do to install XCode.\n\nA: Yes, you can install it in /Applications.\n\nA: After downloading the Xcode.dmg, double-click the image to mount it (if it's not already mounted automatically).\nYou will find a pkg file inside. .pkg is the file extension for software packages in OS X (and iOS). If you double-click the package the related app \"Installer\" will open it and you may install it.\nLater Xcode images (e.g. Xcode 4.6.3 - also for Lion) already contain an app bundle: Xcode.app. To \"install\" it just copy/drag it to the Applications folder.\n", "Q: How to set the Display aspect ratio to 16:9 explicitly when using a VGA adaptor Background\nI was presenting at a venue where the projector supports 1280x720px resolution (16:9) via VGA cable (I've previously used the same room and equipment on an older 2011 MacBook Pro running Mavericks).\nYesterday I used a newer 2014 MacBook Pro Retina running Yosemite, and was unable to set this resolution - the closest I could choose was 1280x1024px.\nWhen the MacBook is mirroring to a projector via VGA cable, the > System Preferences  > Displays panel looks something like this:\n\nIn my case the only options were 1280x1024px and 800x600px (this image is from the web - I didn't get a screenshot at the time).\nMy question\nIs there anywhere, other than the > System Preferences > Displays dialog, where you can explicitly set/force the output resolution?\nMy only options were 1280x1024 or 800x600, yet I'm positive the projector supported 16:9 since I've used it before.\n\nA: In the monitor/display settings just press the Option key when selecting the \"scaled\" option. Then additional resolution options will show up.\n\nA: I had the same problem yesterday. I needed to do recording on Windows (a Parallels VM) in 1280x720 (16:9), and Parallels always resets my Windows resolutions to whatever Macbook sees even when I use the config options Parallels say should not mess with that.\nI wrote this exact command with cscreen:\ncscreen -x 1280 -y 720 -r 60\n\nWhich allowed my Macbook to show this resolution in the series of resolutions I see in Retina Display Menu (RDM) - I had to quit and reopn RDM, no log off or reboot required.\nThen I just selected it from there, reverted my Parallels to the original setting of following whatever Macbook uses (I think I needed to reboot the VM), and it just worked.\nUpdate Regarding RDM\nI have been using RDM for years now. I've tested it on latest macOS to date on Macbook Pro 2018 (haven't checked on ARM Macbooks but it should work).\nIt's also available on Homebrew:\nbrew install --cask avibrazil-rdm\n\n\nA: Displays under System Preferences is it from the OS X built-in UI side.\nThere are third-party utilities like Display Menu that offers additional resolutions.\nThere is also cscreen if you want to do it in Terminal or incorporate it in a script.\n\nA: Display menu doesnt do 16:9 on a Retina MBP...only 16:10 and 4:3\n", "Q: Yosemite turns on \"reduce transparency\" at every login or wake after battery failure Recently, I was using my rMBP on battery power, with about 20%-30% remaining battery, according to the battery indicator. It suddenly shut off, and would not power on (not even showing the \"battery low\" screen) until I plugged in. After starting back up again, Yosemite now keeps enabling the \"reduce transparency\" option when I log in or lock the computer.\nA SMC and NVRAM reset was done, and I also tried repaired the filesystem and file permissions. Both actions did not help.\n\nA: are you using Duet? If so, that is the problem.\n", "Q: Iphone 4s says i have no storage available My 6gb iphone 4s says I have no storage left.When I only have 2 apps on this iphone. This iphone was found and it has been jailbroken and erase all content and settings does not work. I've tried it several times but the loading circle never goes away even after I left it for hours. I need help to restore it to factory settings. I do not have access to a laptop so I cannot use iTunes. Help is greatly appreciated. \n\nA: If erase all content and settings fails to restore the storage then you either have a hardware failure (Flash storage needs to be restored/repartitioned/erased) or a software failure (iTunes is needed to reload the software).\nYou'll need to take the phone to someone with iTunes and/or experience repairing and testing the iPhone unfortunately.\n", "Q: Mac OSX : How to protect daemon process from stopping by root/admin I've a security daemon which performs many security related tasks. Daemon plist is part of /Library/LaunchDaemon/com.xyz.securityservice.plist also KeepAlive flag is 1.\nThe daemon I've currently can be stopped using this command - sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemon/com.xyz.securityservice.plist\nI wanted to restrict security daemon from unloading by this command.\nI do not want anyone to unload/stop this daemon. One can stop security daemon only if he has security password(not system password) or if we send some private notification to daemon to stop itself. Daemon will observe this private notification.\nPlease suggest any pointer on this.\n\nA: I'm not a developer or a guru in all of the available keys with launch daemons, but that is kind of a tall order as by design, root can do anything.  I'm thinking you would basically be creating a security \"virus\" that would have a helper mechanism reload the daemon if it gets unloaded.  \n", "Q: Problems with the command delete function in applescript I have an applescript that I am using to clear out a huge folder. I can select all of the files but how can I indicate the \"command delete\" key while keeping all of the files selected? Basically after the \"command a function\" if I try to preform the \"command delete\" function it deselects all of those previously selected files.\n\nA: keystroke \"backspace\" using command down \n[might be delete rather than backspace - auto-deletes are not something I want to be playing with on my first coffee of the day] ;)\n", "Q: Mobilesync>Backup eating up Disk space My PC is always recently showing low disk space despite me eliminating files.

Thank you for your answer.    \n\nA: Yes. So long as you keep the structure intact you can move it elsewhere for safe keeping.\nYou could also trim it to only the most recent backup if you wished.\nIf your backups are encrypted, the only way to identify is by the date of each folder, otherwise the date should be in each folder title.\n", "Q: iPhone randomly turning off? My iPhone 5 frequently and randomly decides to turn itself off. When it is about to go, it freezes, shows the 'turning off wheel/circle' and then goes black, with the exception of a tiny red dot in the middle. Then after a few seconds it goes completely black. My lock button is also broken so without a charger and a powerpoint, I am unable to revive it!\n\nA: You're very likely to have a dying battery. \nYou might be eligible to Apple's iPhone 5 battery replacement program. \n\nA: Go to Apple's site and search IPhone 5 battery or power button. It will ask you for your serial number and tell you where to find it. If yours is included in recall they will send you a box with freight paid both ways, fix with no charge. \n", "Q: Keystrokes in right top corner A friend of mine has a setting turned on on his macbook. As you can see in the screenshot below, the shift, function, control, alt and command keys show up in the top right corner when pressed.

All we want to do is disconnect the iCloud account from the 4s, and switch this off on her phone as when we are deleting some of the contacts that are in the 4s, which are the same in the 5s,\nit's deleting in both phones, so we do not want to delete the account and clear the 4s in case this happens with the 5s. \nWe have also deleted the 4s account that was showing on the 5s, so they were not connected but the same thing is still happening. I have also turned of the iCloud backup on the 4s, but still has made no difference. Can you please help?\n\nA: You need to completely wipe & reset her iPhone 4 & set it up with her own new account. \nYou can then set up Family Sharing, which will provide parental controls & also allow her to re-download any apps/tunes etc that were previously purchased by any of the family members.\nContacts, etc will need to be set up again from scratch.\nGame progress will also be lost.\n", "Q: Siri stopped working Since iOS 8.1 Siri stopped working for me. The sound and wave animation appear, but it seems the microphone does not register my speech, or it is not processed by Siri.\nI have read various \"solutions\" and tried to troubleshoot it, but I am running out of ideas.\nI have tried, turning Siri on and off again :), restarting the phone and resetting different settings (including the network settings). Nothing seems to work.\nAny ideas, how can I resolve this?\n\nA: I have iPhone 5s and iOS 8.3 and my siri stopped working after replacing broken glass. My current workaround is to use the headphone microphone.\nI think iPhone when using SIRI does some sophisticated background noise reduction. For that it uses additional microphones I think for iPhone 5s and up there are three all together.\nTry to use the iPhone supplied Headset microphone I am certain this will work for you. This is my current workaround and it works all the time..\n\nA: I think it's a microphone problem. Test it by recording a video of using the front facing camera. If you can hear yourself then it's probably a software issue but if there is no noise then it's probably a hardware problem with the front facing microphone\n\nA: The Siri mic is the one that is used during speakerphone operation, and not the one that is used during normal talking on the phone operation.\nTry calling someone and changing to speakerphone.  If they cannot hear you, then the problem lies with that microphone.\nWhat model iphone do you have?  On iPhone 6 (and up I believe) there is a very small microphone to the left of the phone-speaker (the end that you would hold up to your ear when talking on the phone normally).\n\nA: Reset all settings and then do a hard reboot by holding home and power buttons. This fixed it for me\n", "Q: Screen capture app that captures a window even when minimized? I'm looking for a mac app that captures the screen (video) on specific app window (for example, Safari), and keeps recording what that window sees even when minimized to the dock for example.\nOr even if a finder window is over it (without recording that finder window).\nAnyone knows an app that can achieve what I'm talking about?\n\nA: You are making the assumption that windows are always updated when minimized. This is not the case. This also applies to apps present on other spaces. \nIn other words, this is not possible. \n\nA: use debut video capture software, works for mac, for the feature you want, not for windows though.\n", "Q: How to fix Samsung printer JobAccounting2 module printing crashes?

The problem is, as soon as I've entered the first operation, Spotlight expands and opens over some/all of the source of my numbers.\nIs there a way I can add an opacity to the Spotlight overlay so I can see through it to the windows below?\n\nA: As there's no answer to this, in the new El Capitan there is a slight opacity (although not to see through). However, they have now given us the ability to move spotlight which solves my original issue.\nIf anyone has a way to replicate this functionality (or my original functionality) in earlier version, please post; but for now, this is your only answer.\n", "Q: Can extensive creating, copying and erasing files eventually ruin a HDD? The HDD of my Early 2011 MBP broke, and I'm considering if it's because of the heavy workload I put it through by installing, deleting, downloading, copying and erasing files, over and over. \nI thought about it, and logically it would make sense that this would eventually wear down a HDD, but since I'm not an expert, I was wondering if I was right in this assumption, or if I was just unlucky with my HDD?\nAlso, I'm using my new computer now, and I'm worried the same might happen to it eventually, if I don't take preventative measures early on.\n\nA: Everything eventually wears out, it's just a matter of time and a fact of life.  Since it's an unknown as to explicitly why your HDD failed it can only be said that normal/excessive usage leads to normal/excessive wear and tear which does contribute to the eventual failure.  The only thing you can do about it is to ensure that you always maintain proper and current backups so in the event it fails you do not loose important files.\n\nA: Short answer, yes….\nThe more you use it the more wear it takes.\nThat, however, is not the whole story - otherwise the solution to making it last forever would be simply to never use it.\nKeep it as a museum piece…\nAs this would be a somewhat counter-productive use for your shiny new computer, the more practical option would be to ensure you have a good backup strategy - for the time it does go wrong…\n...because it will eventually go wrong, even if it takes 2 years or 20 years in practice.\nTime Machine for 'in house' backups & something like Backblaze or Crashplan, or at minimum, iCloud, for off-site backups.  \nAs the adage goes, \"Any data not stored in at least three distinct locations ought to be considered temporary\"\n\nA: Yes excessive use can wear down an HDD but you probably won't using it excessively. Excessive would be if you were writing, deleting, and editing tens of gigabytes a day. Perhaps tens of gigabytes a day.\nI don't know about the particular HDD brand and model in your 2011 MBP but a spontaneous 5% failure rate per year for HDDs isn't uncommon (spontaneous meaning the thing is just on and spinning). If your model had a failure rate like that it only had an 80% chance to last for at least four years. In other words, it failing before the fifth year is expected 20% of the time. (It failure exactly in the fourth year has a likelihood of ~4% if my napkin calculation is correct.)\n", "Q: FileVault is off, but still prompts for boot password I have an iMac running Mavericks that was previously administered by the user, and it still requires a FileVault password when the system is rebooted, however FileVault is off.

On my old laptop, I used a shared Apple ID to purchase music on iTunes. It was a little tedious because it was connected to my sister's bank account, so I had to send her money before each purchase I made, so that her account wouldn't overdraw.\nThat laptop died, and now I have a new one with a new Apple ID connected to my own bank account. However, some of my purchased songs were lost, so I temporarily logged into iTunes with my old Apple ID to re-download them. Right when I was about to download, iTunes warned me that I would need to associate my new laptop with the Apple ID, and that after you associate a device with your Apple ID, you can't associate that device with another Apple ID for 90 days.\nI really don't want to be stuck on my old Apple ID for 90 days, is there a better way to do this?\n\nA: There is no way to lift the 90 day hold without contacting Apple support. You might not get much traction there, but it's worth a try.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204074\nTurning on iTunes Match, Family Sharing, or Automatic Downloads, or when you download past purchases on your computer, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, that device becomes associated with your Apple ID.\nYou can avoid most of this by having a backup (eliminating the need to download past purchases) and the other items are easy to not inadvertantly turn on.\n\nA: I had the same issue due to the family now using a single itunes match account, with each of us having our own previous Apple IDs with downloaded music. I wiped one of the old computers not realising it was the only copy of my daughter's downloaded music. So a solution:\nInstall/open itunes on a spare machine anywhere that doesn't need it routinely - pc/mac - login with the Apple ID you wish to download the music for, then download all the previous purchases. Copy the downloaded files to a usb/shared drive/any other shared resource and drop them onto iTunes on the computer that has the iTunes match ID logged in. When you try to play them, you'll need to authorise the computer to play the music. Sync to the cloud, which matches them with iTunes match. Delete the local copy in iTunes of the files then redownload them from the cloud, which associates them with the iTunes match ID. Simple! (well not quite, but yes is effective)\n\nA: You could install OS X in VirtualBox on your Mac, and login to your old Apple ID on the virtual Mac, and thus bypass this restriction. VirtualBox has functionality for sharing folders between your host Mac and the guest Mac (the virtual machine) so you could copy out the purchases that way. Kind of heavy duty, but it would solve your problem.\n", "Q: MacBook Late 2008 SSD Upgrade I have the late 2008 edition of the unibody MacBook. It has a built-in HDD which became unbelievably slow. The other tech-specs are:\n\nNow, since its not too bad regarding the processor and the memory is ok too, I thought about speeding it up a bit by giving it an SSD.\n[#1] Do you think this SSD will work for the MacBook? Or do you have another recommendation?\nEDIT\n[#2] I found an even quicker one for just 10$ more, might that one work as well?\n\nA: Yep it'll be compatible, your HDD is a SATA II. \nBut because of the SATA2 limitation (~300MB/s) you won't be able to use your SSD at full speed. \n\nA: Yes, that drive will work for your Macbook. However, keep in mind that your machine uses a SATA II interface. This means that the maximum throughout is 300 MB/s. Though SATA III drives, such as the one you link to, are backwards compatible, there’s no benefit to spending the extra money. You are better off finding a SATA II SSD. Either way, you will notice a drastic improvement in speed and performance. \n\nA: I have that same model and have a 240GB SSD from OWC in it.  Have had for probably two years.  It works very well and since you just need a 3G model you can get one for like $125.00 or so.\n", "Q: Is it possible to find out whether iPhone has MLC or TLC NAND by serial or batch number? Is there any way to check whether the phone has MLC or TLC, just by serial number or batch number?\nI will be buying iPhone 6, Space Grey, 64GB. From what I have read, 64GB version could be TLC or MLC.\n\nA: You can't figure out the type of NAND from the serial number.\nHowever, Apple is dropping TLC NAND, so it most likely has MLC NAND (however, I can't tell you for sure without you buying it.)\n", "Q: Able to answer—but not make—iPhone calls on Mac Background\nAmong the many promising features of OS X 10.10 grouped under the label \"Continuity\" is the ability to make and answer iPhone calls from the Mac.

Is it possible to have configurator do this?\n\nA: If you deployed a Configuration profile that mandates a password requirement, you will need to remove that profile via your MDM or Apple Configurator.\nIn the Profiles section of either Prepare or Supervise, ensure that none of the configuration profiles that are being deployed contain a payload requiring a passcode.  \n", "Q: Yosemite: How do increase font size of Eclipse globally? Please do not mark this question as duplicate. There are some similar questions, but they are stale. They are about old versions and none of their suggestions solved my issue. (eg: How to increase font size of Eclipse globally?)\nI am using eclipse Kepler on Yosemite. I want to change all of my front size in eclipse larger. I am using a 1080p monitor, and it's quite painful to see those small fonts. I found a way to change the package explorer font and java editor font, but I want to change others too. I want to change the fonts in the opened tabs, outline, task and possibly all other views. Is there a way to change them globally? If not, is there a way to change them one by one? I checked \"General - Appearance - Colors and Fonts\". There is no way to change the fonts on those views.\nHere is what I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*change the Colors and Fonts from eclipse preference. It can only change the editor's font.\n\n*remove \"-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts\" from eclipse.ini. It has no effect at all.\n\n*modify \"eclipse kepler/plugins/org.eclipse.platform_4.3.0.v20130605-2000/css/e4_default_mac.css\". I learned how to modify the fonts in package Exploer. I just need to add:\n#org-eclipse-jdt-ui-PackageExplorer Tree,\n#org-eclipse-ui-navigator-ProjectExplorer Tree {\n  font-size: 14px; /* <-- Desired font size */\n}\nModifying the css may be a way to change the fonts of other views, but I don't know how.\n\nA: Solution for Eclipse Oxygen at MacOS High Sierra (Dec 2017)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal and run commands:\ncd /Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.2.1.v20170809-1435/css\n\nvim e4_basestyle.css\n\n\n*Add a style:\n* {\n    font-size: 14;\n}\n\n\n*Restart Eclipse to apply changes.\n\nA: This does work for me on Yosemite and Eclipse Neon 3. But the font increase is very minimal, I did not even notice it the first time. I'd estimate it went from 4pt to 6pt. It still helps though, because before it was almost unreadable. After, it was small but readable. Take a before/after screenshot to compare.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Eclipse folder, e.g. ~/java-neon/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse\n\n*Edit eclipse.ini\n\n*Delete all occurrences of -Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts (should be two of them).\n\n*Restart Eclipse\n\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Preferences, search for \"text Font\", and you should arrive at\n\"General-Appearance-Colors and Fonts\".  \n\n*Click \"Colors and Fonts\" on left if it's not already hightlighted.\n\n*On the right, expand the \"Basic\" Folder, and double click \"Text Font\".\n\n\nThis is the default setting that the text editors and console use. It won't change the package explorer or other eclipse widgets.\nWhile you're there, you may be interested in trying out this font. I find it to be much more readable:\nhttp://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html\n", "Q: Focus the folders area in save dialogs Is there a shortcut to focus the folders area in the save dialogs? I've found the followings shortcuts, but I would like to be able to just focus the currently selected folder.\n Cmd ⌘  D Changes focus to your Desktop\n Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧  A Changes focus to your Applications directory\n Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧  H Changes focus to your Home directory\nEdit: In other words, when the save dialog is open, you can press tab 8 times to focus the folders area. But I would like to know if there is a shortcut to get the same result quicker.\n\nA: It looks like there is no shortcut to do this, which is a shame. If you're trying to do it slightly quicker than pressing tab 8 times, you could hold ⇧ and press tab 5 times to get there in the other direction.\nA somewhat more direct way is to use the third-party Shortcat utility (currently in free beta), which enables keyboard selection of graphics UI elements. \nIn the save dialog, you can trigger Shortcat (by default, ⇧-⌘-Space) and then start typing the name of any folder that's visible in the folder list. As soon as the folder is highlighted (and no other UI elements are), press return. You can then navigate from there with the arrow keys. \nAnother built-in method that's so close, but yet so far, is to press ⌘-⇧-G, then start typing the path of the folder you want. (Instead of ⌘-⇧-G, you can also press ~ to start from your home directory, or / to start from the root.) While typing the path, you can use tab (or stop typing for a moment) to autocomplete folder names.\nThis would work quite well if the folder list automatically updated to show the directory corresponding to the path as you entered it, but unfortunately it doesn't update until you press return. Then if you want to continue navigating, you have to press ⌘-⇧-G again to continue from where you left off.\nA final possibility is to use a scripting/macro utility (like BetterTouchTool, or FastScripts) to make a global keyboard shortcut that presses tab 8 times for you. Seems a bit inelegant, though.\n", "Q: Messages font size can't be changed in Yosemite I noticed in Yosemite, Messages has two menu options under the View menu, \"Make Text Smaller\" and \"Make Text Bigger.\" But unfortunately neither option does anything at all. Is this a bug? Do I have something in my settings preventing this from working?\n\nA: Under 10.10.2 when you're typing inside a message to be sent those menu options function and increase/decrease the size of messages that appear above the text input. The text input itself doesn't actually change text size though.\nIn Messages > Preferences there's a slider that does the same thing. \n\n\nA: In Yosemite Messages.app, selecting Text size: Other... brings up the Fonts picker window, which lets you select any font and size you desire:\n\nOnce you choose the font you want, it appears in the Text size selector:\n \n", "Q: Can you use the Apple Watch with an iPod touch?

If I can use it with a iPod what features will I loose or what will the ones be available.\n\nA: From Apple's website: \"Apple Watch works with iPhone 5 or later running the latest version of iOS, which introduces the Apple Watch app. So make sure everything is up to date\"\nNote: While it does say \"Requires iPhone 5 or later.\" in the footnotes at the very bottom of the http://www.apple.com/watch/technology/ mentioned by Matthieu Riegler, nonetheless it's important to note that both the iPhone 5 and later must have at least iOS 8.2 or later.  So an iPhone 5 still running iOS 7.x will not work with the Apple Watch.\n\nA: On every page about the Apple Watch, it's stated at the bottom of the page that Apple Watch : \n\nRequires iPhone 5 or later.\n\nThis means no iPod touch. \n\nA: No, you cannot use Apple Watch with an iPod touch. The Apple Watch app is also not available on that device.\n\nA: You can still use it. The only thing the phone allows it to do is call, receive texts, check distance you've gone (GPS) or some other key features like camera.

I always block SpotlightNetHelper because from my observation it apparently by default it sends data to Apple during login. Spotlight itself does by default attempt to make an outgoing connection for example if you search for \"google.com\". During that process you'll see other websites showing up through the Little Snitch dialog because it also picks up anything embedded within that websites page. I selectively deny these outgoing attempts, although you can permanently block any/all of them if you choose.\n\nI find it easier to manage all the connections in Little Snitch.\n\n\nA: An Apple tech supervisor told me how to stop Spotlightnethelper. She had me go to system preferences, then spotlight, then uncheck \"Definitions\" and \"Spotlight suggestions\" in the list, and then below the list is another button to uncheck that says \"Allow Spotlights suggestions and look up\".  Then she had me shut down the computer.  Then do a PRAM reset by hitting power, then immediately hitting I think cmdaltPR all that the same time until I heard two start up tones, then release those four keys, and that seemed to do the trick.

I've taken all photos off so that's not the problem, but just need my calendar as I run my hairdressing business off it, and I cannot see all my appointments. Does anyone know if there is a way to do this on my PC?\n\nA: iTunes on your PC can make a backup of your device quite easily - especially if you have the two devices paired before the fall.\nIf you haven't paired it, you'll need to have at least the digitizer working to tap to trust the computer once.\nOnce that's done (and iTunes will prompt you), you can use the PC to back up the entire phone and/or choose to synchronize the calendar data with the PC.\nBest of luck and you probably could call AppleCare for free to arrange a repair and get help backing it up before he repair starts.\n\nA: You should be able to look at your calendar events through iCloud at icloud.com\nOnce you login with your Apple ID click on Calendar and check to make sure all of your events are there.\n\nA: Try plugging in your idevice and open itunes.

Now the keyboard works completely as expected with both my Mac and the Windows computer configured with Norwegian keyboard layout.\n\n\nA: When you are in the Windows RDP app you should be able to type in the Alt-Code for \"\\\" (Alt-92) no matter which input source you have set.

I'm trying to add a Canon MF8050cn to print from OS X Yosemite that works fine from Windows 7 machines.  I installed the Canon 8000 driver Mac_MF_Ver1040_00.dmg for Macintosh.  I can ping the printer successfully at 10.1.10.18 from my Macintosh.  In the Add Printer dialog on the Macintosh, I enter the static IP address of the printer and Internet Printing Protocol and use Canon MF8000 Series, however, when I click Add on the dialog, it gives the error:\nUnable to verify the printer on your network.\nUnable to connect to '10.1.10.18' due to an error.\nWould you still like to create the printer?\n\nChoosing Continue gives a printer that when you print to it gets the error Printing - The printer is not responding.\nHow can I configure this printer for access from my Macintosh?\n\nA: Yo have to download and install the Canon Drivers.\nYou can find the drivers for your printer here.\nFrom the printer manual:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the software:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Bonjour connection:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*TCP/IP connection:\n\n\n\n\nA: I was having this same problem with a Canon Printer and OSX El Capitan 10.11.2. I found out from Canon's website that I needed to specify Line Printer Daemon (LPD) as the Protocol instead of Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) which was selected by default. After selecting LPD, there was no \"Unable to connect to ... due to an error. Would you still like to create the printer?\" message, and my print jobs finally worked.\n\nA: As with many modern printers, you'll probably have an easier setup if it's set to auto-IP configuration, getting an IP address from your router rather than you manually choosing one. A manual setup should also work but as it's not working for you under OS X you may as well let Bonjour do the hard work - as far as I know IPP isn't supported on your printer so this may explain the error you receive.\nYou then want to install the printer driver using the Bonjour protocol as this will detect the printer regardless of its allocated IP address. In the Add Printer dialogue box your Canon should appear in the \"Default\" list, with its network name in the left column and \"Bonjour\" in the Kind column. All you should need to do then is select the appropriate driver from the Print Using pull-down menu, and the unit should be good to go.\n", "Q: 32-bit or 64-bit version of Microsoft Office on Windows 7 64-bit bootcamp? I wanted to ask which version I should download and install. First, I need to tell you that I use Windows 7 64-bit bootcamp on my Mac. I access it mostly via a virtual machine (VMWare). My Macbook has 8GB RAM and an about 3.1 GHz processor. I have about 10GB of free space on my bootcamp. Which version of Microsoft office should I install, 32-bit or 64-bit? Does 32-bit even work on my bootcamp?\n\nA: The Microsoft support page describes the limitations of the 64bit office.\nThey are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Solutions using ActiveX controls library, ComCtl controls won’t work.\n\n*Third-party ActiveX controls and add-ins won’t work.\n\n*Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) that contain Declare statements won’t work in the 64-bit version of Office without being updated.\n\n*Compiled Access databases, like .MDE and .ACCDE files, won’t work unless they’re specifically written for the 64-bit version of Office.\n\n*In SharePoint, the list view won’t be available.\n\n*If you have specific add-ins that you use in the 32-bit version of Office, they may not work in 64-bit Office, and vice versa. If you’re concerned, check your current version of Office before installing the new one. Considering testing the add-in with 64-bit Office, or finding out if a 64-bit version of the add-in is available from the developer.\n\n\nIf these limitations do not apply to you (they seem quite advanced and/or obscure to me) then you should choose the 64bit option.\nThe 32bit version will work as Microsoft is usually quite good in support of older windows versions and architectures, but there is really no benefit to it.\n", "Q: How do I post a screenshot from Mac OS X Lion on askdifferent?

Recently I installed Adobe CC, and ever since, I've been having issues with my admin password. My computer no longer recognizes it. So I'm effectively unable to update or install programs, or change any settings. Somehow it shifted from requiring a login password at start up, to logging in automatically, and then I get the message \"accountsd wants to use the login keychain.\" The admin password works in this case. I reset my keychain, but that didn't solve the problem. I tried to repair the keychain, but that requires an admin password and in this case it doesn't work. I'm at a loss.

However, when I turn off iMessage in Settings > Messages, she starts responding to me, implying that regular SMS messages work. I am wondering whether the iMessages that I've sent have disappeared forever or will she start downloading the undelivered iMessages them when she attains wifi access?\n\nA: My guess is that you both need to be on wifi, or you need to restart BOTH of your devices.\n", "Q: How to display favicon on my Safari Tab? I want to display favicon on my Safari Tab : \n\nI am using Yosemite 10.10. \nI've tried Glims, it doesn't seem to work with Yosemite. \nI'm wondering if there are other way around to tweak this natively or with a third party tool.\n\nA: This is not possible with current version of Safari 9 or 9.1. \nIf, like me, you do really want this feature, please use Apple Safari feedack form to send feedback to Apple. \nThey do listen to customer feedback, I can assure you, and when it comes to features like this, the number of requests is essential.\n\nA: There now is a solution to this: I have created Faviconographer, an app that will overlay Favicons for Safari tabs. It's still a workaround compared to a native Safari feature, but it works surprisingly well.\n\nA: Safari 10.0.2: favicons are shown when pinning the tab.\nThis answers your original question, even though is not what you wanted to ask :)\n\nA: As of Safari 12.0 it's now possible. In Preferences, you can now show favicon in the new Tabs settings:\n\nShow website icons in tabs\n\n\n\nA: As of Safari 8, favicons no longer show up on the tab bar, to my disappointment.\nOne solution is to use SafariStand & EasySIMBL. Once installed (see instructions on the SafariStand site), open the SafariStand settings and check \"Show Icon on Tab Bar\". This will return favicons to the tabs.\n\nA: You can't. But a workaround is to use this Safari Extension to add emoji to the tabs instead of favicons.

This post seems to go over pretty well the Terminal logout commands. Couple that with the system time, date, is what you'll want and choose whichever output works best for you. Past that, it's somewhat unclear if you should be able to log in as a user again (just put a password on that account with no admin privileges) or if you want to have an admin log a user with no password in. The latter is probably slightly more difficult to do, but assuredly not impossible.\n", "Q: Options for Replacing 60w Magsafe Power Supply For the second time in four weeks I've had to re-solder the mag safe cord back on to the power supply. This time, unlike the first, the cord broke on the negative terminal on the circuit board itself. I was able to put a dab of solder back on the terminal to keep the power supply working, but the connection is weak, and I'm not sure how long it's going to last (I repack my charger a few times a day when I'm in school). \nTo that end, my question is this: would it be possible to solder the proprietary end of the (i.e. the magsafe cord) of the a/c adapter to a generic 60w adapter? I'm no electrician, but it seems as though nearly all 60w power supplies would be more or less equal in the whole scheme of things, but I could be wrong, and I don't want to fry my laptop. \nHas anyone tried this? \nThanks in advance\n\nA: No, you cannot just arbitrarily solder the cord from the MagSafe Power Supply on to a generic 60w power supply as the output voltage and amperage need to be matched as well.\nThat said, since you're having issues where it's connecting to the power supply I have to assume your starting off by wrapping the cord to tight around its ears.  You're not supposed to bend it tight at it base!  Start wrapping it by allowing it to stay sticking straight out from the power supply, as in the picture below, and then start a bend to wrap it around the ears.\nMy previous MacBook Pro which I had for 7 years I wrapped it as in the picture and never had and issue with it.

Will this keep me good for the next couple of years? I am looking at this as a long term investment. \nUsers who currently have these specs how is it? \nI will also say another factor in me buying a Macbook Pro was to start development for iPhone applications.\n\nA: I may be an Apple cool-aid drinker, but the answer is still yes.\nI code for a living on a PC but have never personally owned a PC. I am deeply engrained in the Mac experience and every day at work I miss the subtle, simple, and elegant nuances of MAC OS. I've cussed Windows about some thing every day for 14 consecutive years.\nMy Mac experience from a user perspective is that Mac hardware has longer useful life. My average is about 7 years. We'll see as the Mac becomes less upgradable.\n2008 iMac(Core 2 Duo, 6GB RAM): OS upgraded 4 times now, starting w/ OS X 10.5 now running Mavericks (OS X 10.9.5) just fine. It will run Yosemite.

Windows 7 emulation is satisfactory, but only after I upgraded from 4 to 6GB of RAM.\n2012 MacBook Pro (i7, 8GB RAM): Replaced original hard drive w/ an SSD, moved that drive to the CD bay, put the CD player in an external enclosure. OS X upgraded twice, running Mavericks just fine. This thing cold boots to Parallels -> Win 7 -> visual studio faster than my PC at work. Much faster. I have no performance issues.\nP.S. I hope your SSD is 6G SATA, and not 3.\n2009 iPhone 3GS: Cannot upgrade to iOS 7, but still syncs (via iTunes) with Mac running Mavericks.\nLast \"code camp\" I went to every presenter doing web or Visual Studio specifically were all using MacBook Pros.

At that time, release the power button, but continue to hold the home button, which should start your phone in recovery mode and show an iTunes/USB Plug icon on the screen, which indicates for you to plug it into your computer with the USB data cable (computer with iTunes installed on it and open.)\nOnce you plug in the USB data cable to your phone/computer with iTunes, it should detect a phone (your phone) in recovery mode, and you should be able to fully recover your phone by restoring the latest iOS version to it.\n", "Q: Use iPad as output device without iTunes? I have an iPad with limited capacity. I waste a lot of time using iTunes on my MacBook Pro to delete content from the iPad and then sync'ing new content from the MBP. Not only does it waste time, I have to select movies and TV shows in advance.\nQueston: How do I use the iPad as an output device to watch the material from the MacBook Pro? In this case, the MacBook Pro will simply be my personal storage device.\n\nRelated: I'll be doing this while flying, so things like spacious desktops and internet connectivity are out of the question. The MacBook Pro will be under the seat, and the iPad will be on the tray table. \nThe MacBook Pro clam shell is too big to fully open on the tray table, so I can't watch movies on it or operate programs like iTunes. And the cable for the iPad to the MacBook is too short to physically tether it.\nAbout the only thing I will be able to do is turn on both devices, and use apps like Videos and iTunes on the device.\n\nRelated: the iPad Mini is running iOS 8.2 (fully patched). The MacBook Pro is running OS X 10.8.5 (fully patched). I have an iTunes account but it won't be accessible. I don't have an iCloud account and I don't want one (I have actively refused it since the iOS 6/7 days).\n\nRelated: years ago I tried to solve the problem by writing my own program to play the movie I was licensed (purchased under my iTunes account, all the hardware authorized under my account, etc). But Apple has some serious anti-competitive practices in effect such that only their programs can play the content. See Playing Movies from ITunes using MPMoviePlayerController? on Stack Overflow.\n\nA: What you call anti-competitive is kind of the point of DRM -- if it could overridden by simply writing a new program, it wouldn't be much of a stopping point.\nIn any event, you don't really say except at the bottom, but the implication is that you are trying to watch content purchased from iTunes. Is that correct? If so, you may be much more limited. If it's not purchased content, there are more options.\nNext you will need a way to essentially broadcast content to the device. For years I used Air Video. You need to download the app to your device to act as the receiver, and the server app to your MacBook to act as the, well, server. Note the above app does not support DRMed content, such as items purchased in iTunes, but it does support most everything else you can throw at it.\nThen, while on the plane, you will need to set up a direct WiFi connection. On your MacBook, go to the WiFi menu bar icon, click on it and choose Create Network. Give it a name, choose a channel, and enable a password for it.\nOn your device go to Settings > WiFi and tap on your new network. Enter the password, and you should be able to stream content using the Air Video client on your iPad.\n", "Q: On reboot system asking for keychain password for local items I reinstalled OS X Yosemite, I am now using a new admin password (I also changed my iCloud account password.) Upon setting up iCloud, it reused the iCloud data.\nEverything is running fine BUT on each reboot I am asked to enter the \"old iCloud password\" for all system agents using the \"Local Items\". \n___________ wants to use the \"Local Items\" keychain. Please enter the keychain password\n\nand it only accepts my old iCloud password, not the new one ...  \n\nA: Keychain password & login are only the same until you change one, then you need to change the other separately\nSource: OS X: Keychain Access asks for keychain \"login\" after changing login password\n\nNote: This doesn't happen if you change your account password using Accounts preferences.\n  If you want your default keychain to be unlocked automatically when you log in, synchronize your Keychain Access and account login passwords by doing this:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Keychain Access (you can get to it by choosing Utilities from the Go menu in the Finder).  \n  \n*From the Edit menu, choose Change Password for Keychain \"login.\"\n  \n*Type the former password of the account that you are currently logged in to, then click OK.\n  \n*If you entered the correct password, a new window appears; enter the original password again in the Current Password field.\n  \n*In the New Password field, type the password that matches your current account password.\n  \n*Re-enter the newer password in the Verify field, then click OK.\n  \n\n\nA: I am amazed how much hassle changing my Apple ID password causes me, but the solution I've used for this is from Npalamidis on the Apple forums:\n\n1.- Opening KeyChain app\n  2.- Locking the Keychain by clicking the lock on the top left corner.\n  3.- Unlocking the Keychain, as soon as I typed my Admin Password it asked me to \"Reset my iCloud KeyChain\" I clicked yes because I didn't\n  have setup my icloud keychain yet.\n  4.- Restart computer.\n  After performing this steps the computer restarted flawlessly and without \n  asking for the \"Local Items\" password.  \n\nI locked and unlocked all the keychains because there wasn't one listed called \"local\" but following Tetsujin's answer I'll try just the login one next time.\n\nA: The other solutions didn't work for me.\nFor the first one, changing the keychain password, I found the keychain was using the right password, so I was changing the right password... with the right password? It still used the old password on restart.\nThen I saw another keychain called 'Local Items' and I thought that might be it, I clicked it, unlocked it and it disappeared (all fairy tale like). Then I didn't know what to do; the second solution didn't work under any circumstance, the icloud keychain simply wouldn't lock.\nWhat worked for me was to reset the keychain from Keychain Access > Preferences, which is fine since you get a backup of your old keychain.\nAfter resetting I changed the password of the new keychain and Voilla! it was finally the old pesky password getting changed. Now all is good!\n", "Q: Why would I want to turn on iTunes Match on an iOS device? I'm a bit confused about iTunes in the Cloud vs. iTunes Match. \nMy understanding is that iTunes in the Cloud allows me to have my songs in the cloud. I can see all my songs by turning on \"Show all music\" on my iOS device.\niTunes Match allows me to add music to the Apple cloud that was not bought in iTunes. I have enabled that on my Mac to add music I buy from Amazon.\nBut why is there an iTunes Match switch on the iOS device? I cannot buy music on iOS and add it to iTunes and turning on \"Show all music\" already gives me all songs.\n\nA: I agree that they make it confusing in their advertising. I think part of the problem is that they have blurred the lines quite a bit recently, leaving one key difference: music purchased with iTunes vs. that purchased elsewhere. iTunes Match uploads your music and puts it on all of your devices regardless of where you purchased it, while iTunes on iCloud just does that with music you purchased from iTunes.\nFor example, I have a number of songs that I purchased from Amazon, and they consequently don't sync to my iPhone even though they are on my computer. This would apply to music ripped from CDs as well.\n\nA: Show All Music shows both music that exists on your local device, and music that exists in your personal Apple cloud, whether it is from iTunes in the Cloud (meaning purchased from iTunes) or iTunes Match (meaning not purchased from iTunes, and assuming you have subscribed to iTunes Match).\nThe iTunes Match option lets you enable or disable the iTunes Match music library on a particular device, without affecting your subscription to the service overall. If you subscribe to the service but turn off this option on a device, you will not have access to any songs in iTunes Match, and the only music on your device will be items purchased from the device and music synced directly to the device from a computer. Turning it on will replace the music library on the device with the iTunes Match cloud library (but will not download tracks unless you specifically choose to do so; otherwise, it will stream them from Apple's servers).\nSee the iTunes Match on [iDevice] article on Apple's website.\n\nA: iTunes Match is a subscription service that allows you to sync your music collection across all devices that you add to the service.  Songs are either \"matched\" or \"uploaded\".  Matched songs appear much like they do if you have purchased them, in fact if you delete a matched song from your device, the copy you download will be the full DRM-free 256kbps version of that song from iTunes.\nWithout the subscription service, Apple still makes all previous purchases available to you. It knows you have purchased them and allows you to re-download them. In this sense you are getting part of the iTunes Match service but it only works for songs purchased from iTunes.\nShow All Music does exactly that.  It shows all your music whether on the device or in the cloud.  Turn it off and you only see items that have been downloaded to your device. This is really handy when you are offline.  Nothing worse than trying to use your iPhone to play songs that are still in the cloud when you are in airplane mode.\nSo to answer your question, you need to turn on iTunes Match to be able to see your non-downloaded songs that were not purchased from iTunes or did not \"match\" songs in the iTunes store. Once you have downloaded everything you can turn iTunes Match off if you like, but every time you turn it on again it \"replaces\" the music on your device with what is in iTunes Match.\n", "Q: Cannot delete songs from iPhone On my iPhone I see a list of songs I cannot delete.\nHere's what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to settings -> memory usage -> iTunes -> delete all music\n\n*Disable iTunes Match\n\n*Disable show all music\n\n*Connect to iTunes on the Mac and manually remove all synced songs\n\n*Swipe to delete does not work\n\n*The songs do not show any sort if cloud icons\n\n\niTunes shows 3.3GB of Audio on my device which I cannot get rid of.\nAny other ideas what to try?\n\nA: I finally fixed it by restoring from an iCloud backup. But I read that this does not seem to work for some users. \nI personally think, iTunes' quality is really bad and I'm tempted to move over to Amazon's music service but I love the Apple ecosystem and they probably have other issues.

I have tried numerous things including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting directly from disc ('C' key)\n\n*Booting into safe mode (Shift key)\n\n*Booting into Startup Manager (Option key)\n\n*Booting into single-user mode (Cmd + 'S')\n\n*'su' and 'sudo' from a command-line terminal (user is not in the sudoer's list)\n\n*Making various changes via 'System Preferences' (asks for admin account)\n\n\nThere appears to be only 1 account - the standard account I am logging in with. There appears to be no admin account of any kind.\nThe attempts to boot with the various keys depressed appears to have no effect whatsoever. The normal boot sequence runs. The DVD is ejected during this boot sequence.\nOnly holding down 'shift' prevents iTunes auto-running after login. (Which means the keyboard works, I guess!)\nThe only thing I haven't tried (I think) is to use an old Ubuntu CD (Disk Utility asks for admin account) to wipe the drives and see if we can force a boot from the install DVD that way. But that seems a bit drastic, and is permanent if it doesn't work.\nIs there anything I haven't tried, in order to regain control of this Apple hardware?\n\nI have tried all of the solutions found at these questions:  - \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro won't boot into safe mode or from DVD\n\n*Constantly ejecting OS X install disc when trying to boot\n\nUpdate:\nBy physically unplugging and removing the hard drives, the computer is forced to boot from the installer DVD. Obviously at this point there is nothing to install onto, but it proves that both the DVD player, and the DVD do work.\n\nFurther Update:\nBy physically unplugging and removing only one hard drive, I have discovered there's an entire 2nd install sitting there. This install, same user account / password does have admin rights.\n\nA: Give this a try.  If you can get to single user mode you can remove the file that OS X checks for during boot to determine if the Mac has already been setup.  If it doesn't find the file then it boots to the setup assistant, which allows you to create a new admin user.\nTry resetting PRAM:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown the Mac\n\n*While holding ⌘+option+P+R, power on the Mac\n\n*Continue holding all four keys until the Mac has chimed (restarted) twice, then release the keys and allow it to boot normally\n\n\nIf that fails, or you still can't boot to single user mode, give this a try.  Resetting NVRAM:\n\n\n*\n\n*While holding ⌘+option+O+F, power on your Mac, after a few seconds you should be greeted with the Open Firmware screen.\n\n*Type and click return: reset-nvram\n\n*Type and click return: `reset-all'\n\n\nHopefully by now you can boot to single user mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to single user mode (⌘+S while powering on)\n\n*Type and hit return: /sbin/fsck -fy\n\n*Type and hit return: /sbin/mount -uw /\n\n*Type and hit return: rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\n*Type and hit return: reboot\nThis should boot your Mac to the setup assistant.  From here you can create a new user account, which will automatically be designated as an administrator account.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: For the sake of completeness, rather than add endless updates to the question, I have now achieved an reinstall from scratch.\nOnce I discovered there was a second install on the other hard drive, I reconfigured the arrangement of the drives so that the Mac booted from the other. This took a few trial-and-error permutations with the disk cabling, and the little SATA pin connector thing, which tells it which is master, which is slave. (Hardware is not my strong point)\nOnce it was booting into the other install, but with both disks running, I was able to achieve a complete erase of the other disk. (The one with no admin access.)\nI then put it all back to how it was, and of course, it couldn't boot from an empty disk. The installer DVD then kicked in, and installed me a fresh OS from scratch.\nRebooting into the new install (on the disk I'd just erased) I was then able to erase and re-configure the install which had allowed me to do all this, and we're done. I've no idea how it got into that state. Sigh. Going for a cup of tea now.\n", "Q: iOS available space doesn't add up Am I going mental, or does the number in the following image make no sense at all? my top 10 apps seem to account for barely ~15GB, so why is my used space so high?\n\nSo, I'm calling this a bug. The \"other\" section of my phone is taking up 40GB of space. I figured I'd just take a backup and restore my phone but due to there being no available space, I couldn't take a backup through iTunes. So I deleted my Spotify music, and the 40GB \"other\" grew almost instantly to take up the remainder of the space. I tried putting my phone into airplane more, but the button didn't put it into airplane mode - I had to restart and do it (I also temporarily lost use of my lock button and home button). I used a 3rd party tool to take a backup and deleted all my photos, and the storage has stopped growing at 42GB. Here's my iTunes screenshot for giggles:\n\nI tried updating my iOS, nothing. I checked using iMazing at my phones directory structure (it allows you to view folder sizes) and none of my folders had 40GB, the total amounted to what my phone was reporting (~15GB).\nI have no idea why it's doing it, so I'm going to go for a full restore from my newly created backup.\n\nA: Is this device older than 2 years and has never been reset? \nI can't tell you exactly what to do but this article quotes some possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you happen to send and receive a lot of messages with multimedia? that could be clogging up some of your storage especially if you set the settings to delete messages to never.\n\n*How much space do you seen take by the Other category? Other may include:\n\nIf you've ever connected your iPhone to iTunes, you're well aware of the \"other\" stuff taking up space on your device. This data contains things like Safari's browser cache, your email, Siri's cache, reminders, notes, stocks, weather data, emails (including attachments), text messages, iMessages (including images and videos), app data, etc.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Check voicemails?\n\n*Try to reset Safari Cache and data.\nEDIT: OP indicated that the issue is indeed with the \"Other\" category, this article has some tips on how to try and locate and free up space taken by various elements that make up this category.Also check this Apple forums thread. Download any mentioned software there after doing your own DD.\nHere's what \"Other\" includes, in full:\n\nBrowser cache\nMail cache\nMail messages\nMail attachments\nSafari's Reading List\niTunes Backups\nCrud resulting from jailbreaking your iDevice\nGame data\nSaved data files\nCall history\nNotes\nMedia\nVoice memos\n\n\nA: So, after a call with Apple support, they advised trying to take a backup and restore (after they suggested doing a \"clear all settings\", which failed). Problem was, over the weekend this happened again and I couldn't even take a backup as the phone kept disconnecting due to the space issue. Thankfully I took a backup last week which I was able to restore from.\nBasically, the only way to solve this issue was to do a complete restore from a previous backup. Absolute joke really!\n\nA: I had a storage issue with my phone and learned a trick- If you manually change the date on the phone to sometime in the past (I went back about two years) you suddenly have all of the photos and videos on your phone that you thought were deleted a long time ago. Go through, delete them again, and you could free up a substantial amount of space\n", "Q: iPhone 4s change Apple id A friend has given me his old iPhone but it still has his Apple id on iTunes and the cloud and won't allow me access.

Sign in with your account and you will then be able to add your own apps, music etc.\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the SSH_AUTH_SOCK path? I would like to have the ssh-agent socket inside my home directory, but currently it is created inside /private/tmp.\nI see that the agent is managed though launchctl and this plist: /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist, but I don't know how to modify this file to have the socket, for example, at ~/.ssh-agent.sock.\n\nA: I ended up with the following plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>org.openbsd.ssh-agent</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/usr/bin/ssh-agent</string>\n        <string>-l</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>Sockets</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Listeners</key>\n        <dict>\n            <!--\n                 <key>SecureSocketWithKey</key>\n                 <string>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</string>\n            -->\n            <key>SockPathName</key>\n            <string>/Users/myusername/.ssh-agent.sock</string>\n            <key>SockPathMode</key>\n            <integer>384</integer> <!-- 0600b8 in decimal -->\n            <key>SockPathGroup</key>\n            <integer>0</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</key>\n        <string>/Users/myusername/.ssh-agent.sock</string>\n    </dict>\n    <key>EnableTransactions</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe only downside is the need for an hard coded username. If somebody know how to solve this as well...\nI just overwrote the default file at /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist, then I executed the following commands:\nlaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist\nlaunchctl start org.openbsd.ssh-agent\n\n\nA: You could do this basically in two possible ways without tweaking plist files:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you always use bash in the Terminal and you want to enable that, set the path to your socket global in /etc/bashrc for all users:\nexport SSH_AUTH_SOCK=${HOME}/.ssh-agent.sock\n\n\n*Set the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable in the user's .bashrc script. Same way as in no. 1.\nSo whenever a user logs in with the command-line and has bash executed, the user always has its AUTH Socket set in the home directory. You may have to do it for other shells in similar ways AND you always have to ensure that the agent directory exists. Of course I cannot guarantee that this will work with GUI clients aka CyberDuck as well.\n\nA: I end up with a .bashrc script:\n# Predictable SSH authentication socket location.\nSOCK=\"$HOME/.ssh/agent_sock\"\nAGENT_ENV=\"$HOME/.ssh/agent_env\"\nif ! ps -x | fgrep -v fgrep | fgrep -q $SOCK;\nthen\n    rm -f $SOCK\n    ssh-agent -a $SOCK > $AGENT_ENV\nfi\neval $(cat $AGENT_ENV)\n\nAnd sounds like this wont work for GUI as well. \nUpdating plist is too painful on El Capitan (Reboot to recovery & SIP disable -> reboot -> edit plist & test -> reboot to recovery & SIP enable -> reboot), so for those who is OK to have this solved for shell only - this is a working solution.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro is slow, will adding RAM help? I have an early 2009 13\" MacBook Pro. I have used it a lot and at the moment and for a while now it is quite slow. I need to use various applications like Mathematica (for which it is quite slow if I use it now), Latex, web browsers, and a few other programs. Right now compiling Latex documents or running easy Mathematica code takes a long time and sometimes even will crash the computer for a couple of minutes.\nI don't want to buy a new one since my University will buy me one when I begin my PhD next Fall but I still need to do work.

Upgrading to an SSD will give a more substantial speed boost overall - apart from dramatically improved OS and application startup times, any applications writing to and reading from a swap-file will also see considerable speed improvements. Your Mac only supports SATA II but the speed improvement will still make the investment worthwhile.\n", "Q: Can receive but cannot make outgoing calls on an iPhone 5S My iPhone 5s which I bought a year ago shows \"Call Failed\" whenever I hit \"send\", it doesn't matter which number I'm dialing.

One of the things the management want is the ability to import analog video (ie, from a VHS) directly to the iPad (please don't ask why). \nI've seen devices like this for sale: www.elgato.com/en/video/video-capture \nBut this device connects via USB 2, and an iPad doesn't have USB. Probably the iPad would lack the needed drivers to connect to it even if a USB converter was used.\nAre there any devices which would connect directly to an iPad and allow for the import of analog video?\n\nA: None that I'm aware of. Why couldn't the iPads be updated over the air to all download the same pre-converted video? It would take much longer and be extremely redundant to perform this task in the way you describe, over and over again for each iPad, even if a device that could do this existed.\n\nA: I don't think you can record directly to the iPad, but you could do it in a 2-stage process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Record from the analog video source to an SD card. There are various screen grabbers and mobile video recorders that can record to SD cards or similar devices.\n\n\nSomething like this perhaps, though I'm not sure about the video codec being iPad compatible. I think it also needs external power (no battery). I've not looked extensively, and don't know exactly what your analog output is either (RCA? S-Video?)...\nIf you can get a converter from your analog source to HDMI (which will probably need power too), there are definitely some good options, often marketed as video game screen capture devices. I've used this one (or something very similar) and it's worked quite well, with no computer required, it records straight to SD card.\n\n\n*Import the video files from the SD card to the iPad. For this you just need the Apple lightning-to-SD adaptor. There's also a version for the old 30-pin adaptors if you're on older iPads.\n\n", "Q: Restore whole system on 10.10 with time machine I realized that I somehow deleted some very important files on my computer.

This is also the case when I write some test code and execute the C system command open(\"/dev/cu.xxxxxxxx\") and freeze the program. \nUnder the old BSD roots, this seems to be standard behavior. When I attempt this on a Debian box, the baud-rate sticks. This hints to me that it's system dependent, but is there a way to get the baud-rate to be the default/stick forever?\n\nA: For anyone who stumble upon this (yes, another...), here a shell solution (Bash at least):\nThe 'trick' is to open a file descriptor for the serial port before using stty. And keeps it open during all the reading/writing.\nExample:\nexec 3<>/dev/cu.xxxxxxxx           # open a file descriptor\nstty -f /dev/cu.xxxxxxxx raw 19200 # configure the serial port\ncat /dev/cu.xxxxxxxx               # do stuff...\nexec 3<&-                          # close the file descriptor\n\nThanks to @crasysim for his comment on the same question.\n\nA: For anyone who may later stumble upon this, I was not able to find any trick to help keep a set baud-rate \"stick\" using stty -f /dev/cu.xxxxxxxx 19200. I ended up writing a simple little C program that would open() and sleep() indefinitely while I performed any other bash magic, which effectively emulated what I originally wanted.\n\nA: I was having a similar issue and the answer you posted got me thinking about whether there was a way to run stty and then another command before stty exited. This is essentially what piping does albeit with the stdin and stdout linked together which is irrelevant in this instance.\nFrom my experimentation, the following will allow you to change the cu config and then access it with those settings.\nstty -f /dev/cu.xxxxxxxx 115200|cat /dev/cu.xxxxxxxx\n", "Q: Iphone5S calendar not showing entries over 30 days old I Phone 5S not showing calendar entries over 30 days old. \n\nA: By default, the iOS Calendars app only synchronizes and retains the last months’ worth of events on your device, regardless of how much data is stored in whatever cloud or desktop calendar application you’re synchronizing with. \nThis can be changed in the Settings app; under the Mail, Contacts, Calendars section there is an option near the bottom to set how much of your calendar data you want synchronized and retained on your device, with options for two weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months or everything regardless of how old.\n", "Q: Backup And Restore iPhone Text Messages I have an iPhone that I need to wipe because I need to send it to Apple for the Lock Button Replacement Program.\nThe only issue is I need to restore my iPhone and I don't want to lose my text messages and iMessages.

I'm on Yosemite, using vi mode in bash (set -o vi in .bash_profile) and I want to have the prompt indicate if I'm in edit or command mode.  I looked around and found that this feature has been implemented in bash 4.3 (see https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/116385/46076) and can be turned on by setting the variable show-mode-in-prompt to on.  I installed bash 4.3 using homebrew following these instructions.  Now, when I execute bash --version I see GNU bash, version 4.3.33(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin14.1.0) and brew info readline returns readline: stable 6.3.8 (bottled) so it looks like I'm using the correct versions.  However, when I execute set show-mode-in-prompt on or add it to ~/.inputrc based on the readline manual, the prompt still doesn't change based on the vi mode.  What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Looks like I didn't do anything wrong and an additional reboot is all that was needed.\n\nA: In my situation, although bash --version shows 4.3.42(1)-release, echo $BASH_VERSION still showing 3.*, then I realize the default bash haven't been changed, please refer to this link: terminal - Update bash to version 4.0 on OSX - Ask Different\n\nA: put bind 'set show-mode-in-prompt on' into bash_profile ;) don't thanks me.\n", "Q: Force stuborn drive to unmount I have a single partition disk whose filesystem will not mount properly.

Is this indicative of a hardware issue in the drive as opposed to just a corrupt file system? Is there anything else I can try?\n\nA: The issue persisted across multiple macs but Windows 7's Disk Management tool didn't seem to have any issues creating a new partition table. Afterwards the drive worked as expected on OS X.\n", "Q: Two Login Screens with different accounts on both I have a user that was having an issue with his mac where only 1 administrative account was showing up.  He'd log in, then have to log out and could see the other two accounts (his personal account and another administrative account).\nI checked filevault but his personal account was the only one enabled to use filevault, so I removed the 1st administrative account that was the only one showing up on reboot.  After removing the account (and home folder securely) we reboot the mac.\nThe 1st administrative account is still the only one showing up, but now once we log into this account, instead of showing the desktop, it takes us to another login screen with his personal account and the other administrative account.\nWhat do I need to do to remove the first login screen?  \nI believe he is using yosemite\n\nA: The first login prompt is for File Vault and shows the administrators that can unlock the machine, the second prompt is to actually login to the device and thus can be any user including guest.\nTo remove the double login process you will need a single administrative login account.  This account needs to be new or the password reset using the following method:\n\nSettings > Security & Password > Change Password ...\n\nAlternative is to completely remove File Vault and thus one could login to the non-administrative account.  File Vault 2 is an all or nothing affair.\n", "Q: Photos sync from iphotos to iphone I downloaded all my photos from iPhone to Macbook Pro, and now that I have a new iPhone, I want to download from my iPhoto's photo album to my iPhone. \nHow do I do that? \n\nA: Connect your new iPhone to the MacBook, then in iTunes, click on the device and click on Photos to select what is copied to your phone.

It was the only model available.\nIs there any way to add the band/s that are missing in order to use LTE?\nVia software or a carrier update hack?\n\nA: No. The missing \"bands\" are physically missing hardware (antennas).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2010 all of a sudden slow So literally out of the blue, my MB Pro is giving me the rainbow for minutes at time for 99% of the things I try to do.\nI maxed out the memory to 8GB last year, and that made a huge improvement, but like I said, this afternoon it went from being a really productive machine to acting like a 10-year old computer.\nI'm thinking my hard drive is about to die considering I plugged in for a time machine backup and it says 14 hours for a 210GB backup. Is that right?\nA solution would be great, but just knowing what could possibly be going on would be a relief as well.\n\nA: There are quite a few causes for the SBOD (spinning beach ball of death), but you'll have to narrow them down to figure out what you need to do.\nPossible Reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are maxing out your CPU\n\n*You are maxing out your RAM\n\n*Your hard drive is full\n\n*You have malware\n\n\nNow, with what you put in the question, I think the most likely answer is that your hard drive is full. To check, you can do the following:\nGo to \"About This Mac\"\n \nThen click on the Storage tab:\n\nIf you have less than 2 GB free, it's likely that's the problem. If you have plenty of space, then the most likely cause is the CPU. But if it is the CPU, there is probably another underlying problem because it wouldn't start so abruptly. Try to think of anything you might have downloaded around the time it started to slow down.   \nTo figure out what's plaguing the CPU:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Activity Monitor (/Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app)  \n\n*Sort by \"% CPU\"\n\n\nThen you can google around for the specific process screwing up.\n\nA: If you're content with your current computer, upgrade to a SSD. I did this with my 2011 MBP and it's like I've got a new computer. I was always encountering a beachball doing anything and now I never do unless Yosemite acts up.\n", "Q: Apps stuck in pending update status? I used my MacBook Pro and iTunes to download updates for my mobile apps. I then sync'd and the apps were updated. I verified they were updated through the device's Settings app.\nHowever, when I visit App Store on the mobile device, the apps are shown as Pending Updates status even though they are up to date (see image below).

I've rebooted the device several times, and it has not cleared the incorrect status problem.\nI also cycled App Store in the Notifications center with no joy. The App Store app still claims the apps are pending updates.\nHow do I clear the Pending Updates status?\n\nThe MacBook Pro is running OS X 10.8.5 (fully patched). The iPad is running iOS 8.2 (fully patched).\n\n\n\nA: iOS 9.2 \nOption 1:\nTry going to Settings -> iTunes & App Store -> and under Automatic Downloads, toggling the Updates switch next to the App Store logo. Now keep the Settings app open, ensure the App Store is closed, and reopen it. If this works, switch back to the Settings app, and toggle Automatic Downloads for Updates back on; if this doesn't work, still switch back to the Settings app, tap your Apple ID, and sign out of the App Store. Restart your iOS device (for safe measure), then sign back into the App Store with your Apple ID.\nOption 2:\nBackup your iOS device. Delete the apps pending updates, and reinstall them. This will force the apps to be flushed from the App Store as they no longer exist on your iOS device, but you'll also remove any data contained within the apps. You can easily reinstall the apps by opening the App Store, going to Updates -> Purchased, and downloading the apps from there.\n", "Q: Abort OS X download initiated through App Store? I started an OS X Yosemite download. I did not want to download it or install it; rather I just wanted it to show up under purchases so I could install it in the future after Apple removes it from the App Store. It will avoid problems like Where can I get a copy of Mavericks after Yosemite has been released?\nThe Pause button is not available (its greyed out), so I can't pause or stop the download.\nHow do I abort the download now that the \"purchase\" has been made?\n\n\n\nA: You could just go to the Applications folder on your Mac, and find the App that is downloading, and delete it from there.  Once you do this, it should pop up a box asking you if you want to cancel the download.  Just select yes and cancel it.\nI've done this before and it worked fine.  Usually, I just let it fully download, then uninstall/remove the App with an App called Clean My Mac, or App Zapper.  Both are great apps for uninstalling/removing Apps and other stuff from you Mac completely/fully.\nHope this helps :)\n-James\n", "Q: How do I install and run MySQL? I installed MySQL:\n\nbut MySQL certainly isn't on the path when I open a terminal, nor do I see it in applications, as I seem to recall Windows handles MySQL.\n\nA: My favourite way to install and run MySQL is via the Homebrew package manager. With Homebrew installed it's as straightforward as:\nbrew install mysql\n\nThis gets you the server and the command line connection tool. It's setup to run with no password, so it's not suitable for production use, but it's perfect for developing with. Homebrew takes care of putting everything you need on your PATH for you, no digging around in .app bundles for binaries.\nOnce installed, to connect:\nmysql -uroot\n\nTo have launchd start mysql at login:\nln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nThen you can start it with:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist\n\nOr if you don't care about having it start on machine boot/restart, you can just run the server directly with:\nmysql.server start\n\nThe configuration file it reads will be in at /usr/local/etc/my.cnf.\nBonus: having Homebrew on your system puts you one command call away from installing all kinds of other packages. It's a reasonable package manager without a lot of fluff and cruft.\n\nA: The mysql installer works just fine, I've used it many times. \nHowever, it will never appear in Applications as it is not a GUI application.\nAnd it won't appear in your terminal path unless you put it there. Mysql lives in /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql. If you also install the Mysql preference pane you can start and stop mysqld via System Preferences.\nThere is absolutely no need to drag in an entire package manager (homebrew / macports / fink) for something that has an installer. That's like calling a moving company to put your dishes away.\nAlso consider that package managers typically require XCode as well - that's an additional 6+ Gb to install. Oracle's installer is 172Mb.\n", "Q: In-app purchases of an app downloaded from a different country A few months ago, I purchased a number of applications from iTunes US using a US-based credit card even though I'm not from the USA; from the PH, actually. (I used AmEx Virtual Pay offered by my local telco provider)\nNow, I recently moved to Japan and upon seeing these iTunes cards on the convenience stores, I am really tempted to buy some. (I don't have a JP-based credit card and I cannot, should not, must not use my PH-based CC to do purchases).\nWhich brings me now to my problem, I want to do some in-app purchases on the apps I purchased on the iTunes US using (possibly) the iTunes card JP. Is this possible? Will changing just the country of my iTunes work? Since I'm thinking that even though the app was downloaded from a different country, after all, I'm still using the same account.\nI understand that if I decide to download new paid apps, I could just change my country to Japan and use the iTunes card, but will this work with in-app purchases?\nLet me know if my question's unclear.

I saw this helpful answer, but cannot find the Software Update.app file when I search for it on my Mac (Yosemite) to insert it into the iCal event.\nSo how can I schedule software updates on Yosemite?\n\nA: How are you searching for it?  If in Spotlight, don't. The Software Update.app bundle is exactly where the reference states that is it!  Its fully qualified pathname is /System/Library/CoreServices/Software Update.app and you can see it in Finder by starting in the root of the Macintosh HD or if in iCal when selecting the file to open, make sure you start navigating to it from the root of the Macintosh HD (or whatever the name of your HD is).\n", "Q: Move Notification Center to the left Is there a way to move the OS X notification center, or at least the notification alerts, to the left side of the screen?\n\nA: Simple answer: No. The UI clearly states there is only one location:\n\nand there appear to be no preferences one can set through the UI, or anywhere else, for that matter, to move it elsewhere.\n", "Q: Photos album disappeared I am using iPhone 5 (32GB) updated to iOS 8.1.2. \nRecently I opened the Photos app and saw that my all albums are gone but the photos are still visible in Moments. \n\nI checked my iPhone Usage section but found out that my photos are on iPhone with space taken of 2.2GB.\n\nI had all photos on my iPhone before sometime but after sometime all my photos were disappeared.    \nI have tried to force close the photos app, hard reset the device but non of them worked for me.

The second partition starts too early and is probably too big.\nYou probably have to fix both partition. This will only work if you partitioned the drive with Disk Utility in Mac OS X.\nPreparation:\nBackup your Mac and then detach all external drives.\nDownload  and install wxHexEditor. Enable the root user and log-in as root.\nHint: While working with wxHexEditor don't use copy and paste. Enter everything manually! You might accidentally write directly to your disk.\nWhere does the EXFAT partition start and end?\nFirst you have to determine the starting block of your EXFAT volume:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal and enter diskutil list. Get the Identifier of the disk to repair.\n\n*Open Calculator. Open wxHexEditor. Check that you work in read-only mode (\"Options\" -> \"File mode\" -> \"Read only\"). In the menubar go to \"Devices\" -> \"Open disk device\" -> choose the appropriate diskNumber.\n\n*Hit the search button (marked with the red circle in the picture below) and enter EXFAT (exactly like in the picture). Please try to arrange the wxHexEditor window like in the examples below with straight red lines.\n\n\n*My EXFAT entry (see picture below) is at offset 210763776. Now you can calculate the start block of the volume with: OffsetBytes/512 = NewStartBlockEXFAT. The start block in my example is 411648.  \nIf you get a significantly smaller starting block (=<409639) stop here, because you probably didn't partition your disk with Disk Utility previously.\n\n\n*The ending block of the EXFAT volume can't be determined easily; we have to guess it (somehow). The problem is the variable gap between partition 2 and the second GPT table. In your case it has 1679 blocks, in my example it has 2015 blocks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Method 1 (maximal size in the \"unallocated space\" between the block containing the EXFAT string and the second GPT table):\nThe maximal volume size is StartBlock2ndGPT-NewStartBlockEXFAT. The size has to be dividable through 8. Reduce the size until you get a size dividable through 8. \nExample: In my case the maximal size would be 7813779423 (StartBlock2ndGPT) - 411648 (StartBlockEXFAT) = 7813367775 (which isn't dividable through 8). The biggest size dividable through 8 is 7813367768.\n\n*Method 2 (minimum size containing all occupied blocks between the block containing the EXFAT string and the second GPT table):\nYou might jump to sector 7814037135 (the first block of your secondary GPT table) with the arrow button (the second button left of the search button) and search backwards and match case disabled with \"Find some bytes\" to get the last occupied sector. This may take a while. Make a note of your finding (if you have one in a reasonable timeframe). Divide the offset through 512 to get the sector number. The sector number should be smaller than 7814037135. Now calculate the provisional minimal size of your volume: StartBlockEXFAT+1-LastOccupiedSector. The result must be dividable through 8. To get size add blocks until the size is dividable through 8.\nYou may stop the process after 5 minutes without result because then the last occupied block number is probably smaller than 7807917625 assuming the process searches 10 MByte/s (the last ~3 GB of your disk). Use Method 1 then.\nBoth results probably lead to a wrong size of the EXFAT volume, but this should be repairable. It's more important to get the proper start block. Additionally method 2 may deliver incorrect results if the disk has been completely filled with data previously using a different partition layout and hasn't been zero-filled afterwards.\nRestoring the \"old\" GPT\nHere i assume the identifier of the disk containing the EXFAT volume is disk0.\n\n\n*\n\n*First you have to unmount the disk\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\n\n\n*Check the partition layout, then remove the two partitions:\ngpt -r -vv show /dev/disk0\n\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\ngpt remove -i 1 disk0\n\n\n*Since the (Apple-)EFI usually has a fixed size we can easily add it with:\ngpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk0\n\n\n*With the start block of the EXFAT partition and Size (the volume size found with Method 1 or 2 above) we can also add it:\ngpt add -b NewStartBlockEXFAT -i 2 -s Size -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 disk0\n\n\n*Remount disk0 with:\ndiskutil mountDisk disk0\n\n\n*Quit Terminal, Calculator and wxHexEdit and open Disk Utility.\n\n*Check your EXFAT volume for errors.\nIf you run into problems (e.g you can't find the proper EXFAT volume size), have doubts or questions immediately stop and contact me with a comment @klanomath!\n", "Q: Does A New Installation Contain Personal Information?

I know how to change type and creator codes using either ResEdit or -- since the System 7 I'm using is emulated on OS X -- using SetFile -c and -t from OS X. But, seemingly, the initial choice of default application makes the Finder behave a certain way for all files similar to the one double-clicked; it doesn't change the type and creator codes.\n\nA: I don't have a System 7 Mac to test this on and my memory is a bit hazy - only partly helped by web searches - but I think you want to go to the Mac OS Easy Open control panel and click Delete Preferences.\nIf you don't have this control panel or something similar then you could also try deleting any likely-looking preference files in the Preferences folder in your System Folder, then restarting; or deleting the hidden Desktop DB and Desktop DF files from the root of the disk, then restarting if it's the startup disk, or ejecting and reinserting it if not. \nNote that all these methods (if successful) will delete all application associations for unknown files, and deleting the desktop files will delete or reset a load of other stuff such as window view settings and possibly Finder comments.\n", "Q: To install pgfplots for OSX Yosemite?

Additionally there are some technical restrictions.\nSo none of them will run directly in VMware Fusion, Parallels or VirtualBox.\nTo get an image of the MacBook3,1 running in one of those three you would have to update it to Snow Leopard Server 10.6.8 or Lion 10.7.x first. The easier and cheaper way is probably to set up a vanilla Lion VM and migrate the content of the MacBook.\nThe only way to get the PowerMac G5 possibly running I know of is outlined in this guide. You would have to migrate the contents of the PowerMac as well.\nProbably it's easier to choose the simple way and use the same approach as with the MacBook: vanilla Lion VM and migration.\n\nA: Virtualization tends to run OSes of the same processor type. So you can run Windows (for Intel CPUs) on Apple's Intel Macs, and Windows for ARM in Parallels on Apple's M1 ARM Macs.\nRunning code for a different CPU tends to require 'emulation' (simulating the CPU's instructions somehow), or 'translation'. Both require significantly more processing effort than virtualization.\nIntel CPUs are themselves now being phased out in favour of Apple Silicon, which runs Intel code in its own translator (Rosetta2).\nPPC Macs are between 16 and 26 years old, making them fall into the 'vintage', 'retro' or 'hobbyist' computing categories.

Finder windows are just the start to this dream tool of mine.  Would love to be able to pull up everything right where I left them: files, applications, emails, etc.  Almost like having a different computer for each project.\nI've researched the heck out of this and have found nothing like this.  Spaces doesn't do it.  There's lots of tools for managing windows but none that will pull up a set of windows and file locations based on a preset.  \"Finder Window Manager\" is an old piece of software that sounded promising, but it didn't work at all given what I'm looking for.\n\nA: Apple's solution for this is to use Mission Control (if you need multiple desktops) and Finder Tags for each file/project.\nFrom there, you can use finder's tag filtering and/or smart folders to assemble your views.\nAlso, saving these to your Favorites and removing things you don't use make quick access to these \"views\" possible across finder and other app open/save dialogs.\nLastly, look at Divvy to automate window placement - it's very scriptable and you might use LaunchBar or another tool to speed actions if spotlight isn't action oriented enough for your automation.\n", "Q: Disable Application During Class I'm teaching a class on Sunday and my wonderful but occasionally rebellious students love to quietly play Minecraft during class.  Is there a way I can disable the Minecraft application during class time?\nMy students range in age from 8 to 12.  I'm taking them through game design with Unity 3D so they are getting a little scripting experience in C#.  Most of them have some basic programming ability.  I know a couple of the students around here have set up Minecraft servers at home.\nThe students use standard accounts on our computers which are running OS X 10.8.  We have never employed parental controls in the past but I'm open to that as an option if it will work.\n\nA: Parental controls allows you to exert more control over standard accounts and could restrict that app easily for you. In practice, I prefer other levers.\nWhether it's worth the time to setup vs. getting out and moving around the class (or having an assistant sit in the back of the class and keep an eye on screens) is debatable.\nAssuming you don't already have an MDM/imaging workflow and this is just a bunch of computers that you go to one by one to manage I'd just move the Minecraft app outside the student directory and set up ssh keys / use Apple Remote Desktop to place a link to the app in each user's ~/Applications folder if and when you want them playing that app or game.\nThat method is very useful for other problems, has low cost of tools and might be a nice introduction to things like munki/autopkg/etc... for improving the management of this lab of Macs.\nYou can also leverage Apple Remote Desktop to monitor all the screens in the classroom. I'd take an old iPad and use Duet Display so that my Main screen(s) were devoted to the work I was doing as opposed to cycling through screens to see who needed their screen locked due to minecraft violations.\n", "Q: How to simulate Airplane mode? I'll be overseas and don't want to be racking up roaming or whatever other charges.  Typically I would use the Airplane mode, but I still want to be able to take photos that have the geo locations recorded.\nSo I want to know whether turning off Settings/Cellular/Cellular Data will take care of what I want (e.g. remove the chance that I'll be inadvertently charged for something)?  It says Cellular Data...does it mean I have to turn off Cellular Voice somewhere or does this do the trick?\n\nA: Just remove your SIM. Then there's no chance of incurring any cellular charges, as you won't be able to connect to any network, but wifi and GPS should still work. (If you have a CDMA phone with no SIM then you can't roam anyway.)\n\nA: As the name suggests, turning Cellular Data off will not disable calls. However, I do not really see a reason to also disable calls. As long as you do not make any calls yourself and do not answer any incoming ones, there won't be any roaming charges - even if your phone rings.\nAlternatively you might want to talk to your mobile phone provider; these days they often offer very reasonable data and/or voice roaming packages.\n", "Q: Unable to properly boot Power Mac G5 running Debian without a screen connected I’ve got Power Mac G5 running Debian 6 in headless mode as a media/home server.\nWhen booting it without an attached screen, the fans ramp up from the idle speed to maximum over a couple of minutes. The red interior warning light is not lit.\nThe server is ping-able the entire time, but startup utilities such as SSH and other are never started; or at least they aren’t reachable.\nIf a screen is connected until the login-prompt appears, it works just fine. Connecting a screen after booting does nothing; it must be connected the entire time.\nI do not know, nor am I able to test if this is a problem when running Mac OS X.\nHas anyone experienced this before? And if so, is there a solution to this?\n\nA: \nThe server is ping-able the entire time, but startup utilities such as\n  SSH and other are never started; or at least they aren’t reachable.\n\nThat happens because while a system might be pingable, that only happens at the most “embryonic” levels of any system booting into existence. This is why simply pinging a server is not the best way to determine overall system service state. And the reason services—such as SSH—are not starting is because the system is hanging due to it not knowing how to deal with being without a monitor attached; the keyboard should not play any factor in things. \nWhat you are looking for is a way to run that Power Mac G5 as a headless system. To my knowledge, this can be done if Mac OS X is installed, but this cannot be done if another OS—such as Linux—is running.\nThat said, you can “trick” the Power Mac G5 to believe a display is installed by using a “headless dongle” which is a fairly common/simple hardware item in the server world. Most of these devices are based on VGA display settings and if you look at instructions—like these for a Mac Mini server—the concept is quite simple. By placing a 75-85ohm resistor between pin 1 and pin 6 on a VGA connecter on a machine you can “trick” the machine into believing a display is connected.\n\nIn your case, unclear on whether your Power Mac G5 has native VGA output or not, but if it does, then just find a 75-85ohm resistor, stick it between pin 1 and pin 6, and you should be good to go.\nIf your Power Mac G5 has a DVI connector, then you’ll need to get a DVI-to-VGA adapter and then set the 75-85ohm resistor on that. But the overall concept is the same.\nThere are also some online tutorials—such as this one for a “VGA dummy”, this one on Instructables and this one as well—that are a bit more elaborate. Heck, look at these instructions here from a user running Ubuntu on a Mac Mini who faced similar issues as you describe; note he used the three resistor setup:\n\nWhy do all of those tutorials require three 75-85ohm resistors for pins 1 & 6, 2 & 7 and 3 & 8 instead of just one for 1 & 6? Not clear myself. But the general concept of these devices are the same: A simple piece of hardware that “tricks” your computer—regardless of OS—to believe a display is attached to it.\nAlso, if you are running a server on hardware that uses an HDMI connector, you can use one of these similar dongles which runs around $15-20 (U.S.) a piece and works great. Allows you to have true HD resolution on a headless machine when you remote into it. Pretty sure your Power Mac G5 does not have an HDMI connector, but worth mentioning here for reference.\n\n", "Q: How to force Mac (Yosemite) to use USB Bluetooth instead of internal? I'm on an older Mac Pro, and I bought the ASUS USB-BT400 so that I can use Yosemite's Handoff feature. The problem is, I don't know how to disable the internal Bluetooth and force my machine to use the USB Bluetooth instead. I searched around but didn't find anything that worked.\n\nA: To force your system to use an external Bluetooth controller instead of the internal one, open Terminal and type: \nsudo nvram bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior=always\n\nthen reboot. To revert to the default OS X behavior, type:\nsudo nvram -d bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior\n\nYou may need to turn off (or un-pair) Bluetooth accessories that are currently using your internal Bluetooth controller, as they can prevent the dongle from being detected by the Continuity Activation Tool.\n\nA: Continuity Activation Tool is a great app for doing all of the command-line stuff necessary to enable Continuity, and it claims to be able to work with USB dongles.\n", "Q: my photo stream has gone After doing the recent iOS 8.2 update, my photo stream has disappeared.\nI have checked all through my phone and on the icloud and my photo stream is ticked.\nAll I have left is 3 folders: one says All Photos, one says Videos, and one says recently deleted.\n\nA: There are three current components to Apple's online photos.\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Photo Library (Beta)\n\n*My Photo Stream\n\n*iCloud Photo Sharing\n\n\nI think from your wording you are referring to the smaller parts and not the entire Photo Library in the cloud. The photo stream FAQ is quite good:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201317\nIt mentions that you have a 30 day rolling window to save files that get stored in the stream. If you lost photos before that time - you can get help from this article:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203511\nBasically, you can use another iOS device or a PC/Mac to access the stream and see if the corruption is in the stream or on the device.\nIf you have backed up the photos, you can restore that iOS backup (or PC/Mac Backup) and get things back based on how recently your backups run.\n", "Q: VLC player does not remember last played position I have been using MplayerX and recently thought of trying out VLC for watching movies. I noticed that the VLC player does not remember the last played position of the video. If I quit VLC and play the same video again, it plays it from the beginning. \nIs this feature not provided by VLC? If not, is there any workaround to get this working?\n\nA: The current, stable releases of VLC don't offer this. However, you can go to the VLC nightly build site to download the latest version of VLC 3, with an updated Yosemite interface and H.265 support. Most importantly for you, though, they have added resume support.\nFrom http://nightlies.videolan.org, you just have to click on Mac OS X Intel, and then click on \"last\" in the list.\nVLC nightlies have no support from the VideoLAN team, so you have to be careful. However, in my experience, VLC 3.0 has been pretty stable.\n\nA: There is a plugin available called VLC srpos that will save and restore the playback position of the last played files. It is available here. There are numerous threads on this subject, I came across the plugin on the VLC forum, using a well-known search engine ;-)\n\nA: I can confirm \"kilometers\" answer.

I have an Arc Touch Mouse SE (Bluetooth edition of the Arc Touch Mouse) and though I remember long ago it worked for the most part in 10.9, it doesn't seem to work in 10.10 and I'm trying to determine if it's one of the 'mods' I've installed that are to blame.\nHere's how it works right now: I have to delete it from Bluetooth preferences if it exists already, and manually pair the mouse to get it to work. It will work until I turn either it or Bluetooth off, then it'll refuse to connect until I repeat this process.\nI've done, for testing, a clean install of 10.10 on an SD card to see if it's something I've installed that interferes with Bluetooth. It seems to work perfectly on this clean install.\nAlso, and this may be related, the mouse does not show up in USB Overdrive. It's not present on the list, and the settings I had set do not do anything to the mouse's behavior.\nI suppose I should start by listing everything that shows up in the bottom pane of System Preferences. I wonder if there's anything else I have that might interfere with Bluetooth that doesn't show up here.

About three months ago it started running really slow, so I renstalled the OS with a recovery partition. For a few weeks it ran very well with an overall very seamless experience. \nYet, as of two days ago, suddenly it started running extremely slow again. When I use vim and save a 200 line text file it takes about a minute average. When I want to click an icon or menu bar, it's not unusual to delay even highlighting the widget for 30 seconds. \nI thought it might be the hard disk drive, so today I changed to a brand new SSD. This, however, had no effect.\nThe computer runs at this very slow speed even when system monitor says that there are 1.5GB RAM left and 97% idle CPU.\nDoes anyone know what the issue might be?\nRight now I’m trying to run the recovery partition again, yet even booting from it has already taken me longer than writing this.\nEdit\nI have only used about 30 GB of my startup disk.\nI am not aware of any malware, yet, I canot be sure.\nI have 4 GB of RAM (DDR3 1600MHz)\nCPU is i5 2.5 Ghz\nUpdate\nI got it into recovery mode, and even here it's painfully slow, even if I select a disk i disk utility, it takes quite some time to even highlight the name.

The repair was very easy and the effect is just as one could wish for.\n\nA: Hard drive cable failure is almost guaranteed to be your problem. We have a deployment of around 70 2012 13\" MBPs for staff members, of which around 10% have had a hard drive cable failure. I had a suspicion you were going to say you had the same model from the symptoms you described.\nThe symptoms on our problem MacBooks are exactly the same as yours with the MacBooks running excruciatingly slowly on the most basic of operations. Replacing the cable has restored full speed without any further work needing to be done. Simply re-seating the cable's connector on the logic board has worked on a couple of occasions - in the short-term - but these have generally slowed down again, sometimes completely failing.\nThe odd thing is some of these MacBooks haven't been subject to any abuse and the cable has showed no signs of damage. However, the simple fact is that replacing the cable has worked.\nThe cables are available online (genuine cables can be had at a reasonable price on a certain auction site) and can be changed in under 10 minutes. The fiddliest part is disconnecting and reconnecting the IR receiver/status LED as there's a tiny latched connector to undo, but otherwise it's an easy fix.\n", "Q: Mail shows 100% usage for Gmail account, doesn't rebuild For some reason Mail shows me 100% account usage on my Gmail account.

I have an iPhone 4s that works with Virgin Mobile USA. Since carriers must unlock phones now I'm wondering about unlocking this one. But I haven't been able to determine if it would actually be worthwhile. Specifically, whether I'd be able to use the phone with a different carrier.\nThe phone is an iPhone 4s, marked on the back as an A1387, and identifies itself in settings as an MD236LL/A. This is a CDMA refurb model, obtained from an Apple store after the original phone got dropped in a puddle.\nWhat I'd like to do: (a) use the phone with some other US-based carrier while at home, and (b) when traveling outside the USA, use the phone with a local SIM and GSM network.\nI've tried searching for unlocking info but I'm getting conflicting answers about whether either of the above are possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some sites say that since the 4s is a \"world\" phone that after unlocking it would work on both domestic (US) GSM networks as well as CDMA networks like Verizon.\n\n*Some sites say that although it's a \"world\" phone, it's tied to CDMA when in the USA. While traveling it would work with a GSM network using local SIM but in the USA it could not use a GSM network.\n\n*Still others say that \"world\" means nothing here, that it's strictly CDMA and can't use GSM at all.\nCan anyone clear this up? I know I can legally get the phone unlocked, but would doing so get me either of the things mentioned above? Virgin Mobile USA's site isn't helping me. They have a chart listing types of unlocks for different phones, but from past experience with them I pretty much assume they're either lying or just plain wrong about most things.\n\nA: iPhone 4s, both the CDMA and GSM models, has GSM hardware built-in. The only difference between the two models is whether the device supports CDMA, and in that case, which network it supports. A device sold by Virgin Mobile, which piggybacks on Sprint's network, may work in CDMA mode on the Sprint network once unlocked, though you would need to confirm this with Sprint. It cannot be used on Verizon's network. In GSM mode, it can be used outside the US on essentially any network. It cannot be used on US-based GSM carriers (T-Mobile/AT&T).\nThe iPhone 4 CDMA model (sold at Verizon) was not compatible with any GSM network, US-based or otherwise. That may be where the confusion lies.\n\nA: For anyone else with an iPhone on Virgin Mobile USA, it might be possible to move it to Ting without unlocking it. I say \"might\" because although my wife just did so, there was a lot of confusion along the way with Ting support telling us both that the phone would and would not work with their service at different times (their \"bring your own device\" check said it was \"guaranteed\" to work, but it didn't work immediately). Eventually the switch happened, and it seems to work fine. We never requested an unlock of the phone. I think it worked because both Virgin and Ting use Sprint's network. It's worth a shot if you'd prefer to ditch Virgin but I don't know if it'll work for everyone.\n\nA: Ymmv. My experience is as follows: called Virgin mobile to unlock iPhone 4s subject to their policy and 12 months of continuous service. They stated that iPhone 4s does not support an over the air update for domestic sim unlock and provided the msl code for use by other carriers to activate the device. \nBased on research the msl code is essentially useless for unlocking purposes but some people reported that the virgin mobile iPhone 4s is sold able to use foreign SIM cards. \nTravelled to Canada and put in a local SIM card, the iPhone attempted to activate and failed indicating that the phone is locked based on activation profile on the phone which needs to be unlocked by the carrier. I'm pretty sure the carrier refers to virgin mobile in this case. \nFinally called Virgin mobile again and was told that this will not be possible on the iPhone 4s. While we need to take that with a grain of salt, nevertheless I've reached a dead-end attempting to use this phone with a foreign sim. \n", "Q: How to update all the drivers to latest version(bootcamp) How to can I manually update all the drivers. I see my Nvidia card's support software always says new update available. Is it safe to update drivers from Nvidia site, some other sites(for other drivers) or Apple releases special type of drivers for there hardware and only those will be supported? \n\nA: The important Apple drivers which Windows invariably doesn't have updates for are Facetime camera, Apple keyboard/trackpad/mouse, and the IR receiver.\nBeyond these you can update any drivers that MS has to offer through Windows Update, and I've had no issues with downloading video drivers directly from nVidia. Always create a restore point so you can backtrack if you install something that doesn't work as well as it should, link to MS help page here.\n\nA: To my knowledge there are no special drivers required for Boot Camp Windows.  At least for the graphics adapter I did it myself on my Mac Pro without degradation, disruptions, blue screens or similar.\nAs with installing any low-level software, it is advisable to create a backup beforehand, so that you can roll back, should something not work as planned.\n\nA: The most important driver upgrade IMO is graphics drivers.

You can name the drive when directly attached, but not the backups within.\n\nI want to name my backups so I might not flash something else that I\n  don't want.\n\nNot entirely sure what you mean by that, but if you meant backing up items already backed up, then you will need to understand that Time Machine is an incremental backup system and does that for you automatically.\nThe following official document (and its links) may shed some light on this as well: Mac Basics: Time Machine backs up your Mac\n", "Q: Configuring Apple Mail with Gmail Aliases I am trying to use AppleMail and trying to configure to using gmail alias.\nMy primary email address is sid@mydomain.com and I have configured this in Apple Mail and able to send / receive messages properly. This primary email has an alias on my google apps for business sid-sales@mydomain.com\nWhenever someone sends an email to sid-sales@mydomain.com, I receive it on sid@mydomain.com and on the Apple Mail. So far good.\nNow, I want to configure Apple Mail so that I am able to send emails using both my primary email and the alias (and with different names). So, I want to have two email configurations -\n- Sid <sid@mydomain.com>\n- Sid from Sales <sid-sales@mydomain.com>\n\nI am not able to get this working. I tried adding both the emails separated by a comma in the Accounts section. After doing this, both the emails appear in the From field and I can choose from one but the receiving side is always getting my email from my primary email address. So, if I choose sid-sales@mydomain.com in the From field, the receiver still sees sid@mydomain.com\nI also tried changing the plist file by adding EmailAliases - I was able to change the Name but the email address is still sid@mydomain.com\nCan somebody please help me with this? I tried searching a lot on the internet but I am not able to find anything which will solve the problem.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail->Preferences\n\n*Select the G Suites email account\n\n*In \"Account Information\" tab, click \"Email address\" and choose \"Edit Email Addresses...\"\n\n*Click \"+\" and add the second alias email address. If it is setup properly in G-Suites it works in Apple Mail.\n\n\nA: None of the other solutions worked for me right now with Apple Mail 9.3 on OS X 10.11.4. Just to make sure, my situation is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a primary email address xyz@somedomain.com as a Google Apps account\n\n*I added a domain alias otherdomain.com to that account\n\n*I want to send from xyz@otherdomain.com and have the receiver see this in the \"from:\" field (notice that this is slightly more complicated than in the original question, but includes the original question's case!)\n\n\nAfter a lot of experimenting, this did work (both parts required, it seems).\n\n\n*\n\n*On the Gmail end: \n\n\n*\n\n*For the primary email address xyz@somedomain.com, I went to Gmail online, then (under the top right tool icon) Settings > Account.\n\n*There I clicked: \"Add another email address you own\".\n\n*In the window popping up, I entered my (same) name and, under \"Email address\", the full alternative xyz@otherdomain.com\n\n*I left \"Treat as an alias.\" unchecked.\n\n*Clicking the \"Next step>>\" button, I left the default top selection (the one that says \"easier to set up\")\n\n*I saved this.\n\n*(Back in the main Accounts screen, I checked \"Reply from the same address the message was sent to\", but that doesn't seem to be relevant to the root problem we are trying to solve here)\n\n\n\nUsing \"Compose\" still in Gmail online, I was able to change the from field to xyz@otherdomain.com and confirm that the receiver saw this as the \"from:\" field (as well as in the raw mail data).\n\n\n*Now in Mail, in the settings for xyz@somedomain.com I just added an alias in the \"Alias:\" field right under \"Description:\". Now Mail shows the alternative email address in the From field when composing emails in Mail, too, and the recipient sees xyz@otherdomain.com as the true sender (checked in the raw mail data again).\n\n\nNotice that without the Gmail modification from Step 1, adding an alias to Mail just resulted in an additional line \"X-Google-Original-From: xyz@otherdomain.com\", which Mail wouldn't recognize as a sender in any form.\n\nA: You need to configure these as 2 separate accounts in Mail. For some reason, to get it to work you will need to add the alias as an IMAP account rather than the standard Gmail account. \nWhen you authenticate for the alias, you will need to use the actual/original email address, not the alias email, in the authentication settings. \nI've been using this setup without  a problem for many years with several different accounts, without problems.\n\nA: I know this is a 4 month old question, but I wanted to add that if you're using your own domain with Gmail (and you've configured your aliases in Gmail settings) then there is another solution.\nSimple open the account in Apple Mail, and in the email address box add as many addresses as you want separated with a comma. e.g. email1@email.com,email2@email.com etc.\n\nA: In Mail Version 14.0 (3654.100.0.2.22) it's very simple:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Mail and in top menu bar go to Mail > Preferences...\n\n*Click on your added Google account\n\n*In \"Account Information\" tab click \"Email addresses\" drop-down select and click \"Edit Email Addresses...\" to add all aliases and names you've already added in your gmail settings (all settings) > \"Accounts\" tab > \"Send mail as:\" then \"Add another email address\".\n\nI have tested the above solution and it's working perfect / sending emails as my alias.\n\nA: I think this is not a problem of Apple Mail and your configuration, but more with Gmail. Are you able to send a mail from your alias via the Gmail website and is the sender address correct?\nIf no, this may help you. Afterwards sending via your mail app should also work.\n\nA: Try to \"Add account\" and then select the last option \"Add another email account...\" and put your Gmail alias and password. \nIt worked for me ;)\n\nA: I have found that following the steps in this article worked (MacOS Yosemite, Mail 8.2).\nBasically in the account settings, add all your aliases as a comma separated list to the Email Address field:\n\n", "Q: Missing songs after 8.0 update and sync I did the iOS update a few months back and noticed that the songs I had downloaded in May and June 2014 were missing. Since the computer I used that had iTunes was stolen in July 2014, I had no way to access iTunes. Finally tonight I was able to plug in my phone to iTunes on the computer. The playlists showed up with the missing songs in them. I then selected sync hoping they would be moved to my iPhone 5, Instead my playlists are now empty. Is there a way to get my songs back?\n\nA: Everything must first be on iTunes before it can be put on the iPhone. If the playlists and songs are not on iTunes on this new computer, it won't work, and syncing will only erase what you have on the iPhone, as it apparently has. \nIn this case, all you can do to recover is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore from a backup previous to trying to sync music to this new computer, recovering the previous, imperfect iPhone state, or \n\n*Ideally, get the playlists and songs all loaded and working in iTunes first, then you can sync them to the iPhone. \n\n", "Q: To install Shotwell in OSX I install the first dependencies of Shotwell  successfully\nbrew install libGphoto2 vala libgee \n\nSome discussion about this issue in this thread but the accepted answer is misleading, since it is about how to install pyexiv2, not gexiv2. \nI run ./configure and get\nDetected libGPhoto 2.5.x - using 2.5-aware code path.\nConfigured.

You can follow here: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/37944\nBeyond that there are various dependencies of shotwell that aren't easily available through brew, for example rest and gudev which don't appear to exist anywhere for OS X. I'll have a go at creating formulas for them depending on how the first one goes.\n", "Q: Wiped my version 1 IPad and it won't load Facebook now Facebook says it needs IOS version 7 to run, I had Facebook on it before I wiped it. Can I get an older version of Facebook back?\n\nA: iOS will let you download the last compatible version if you already have the app in your purchase history.\nYou can add the app to your purchase history using iTunes on your computer, since iTunes is version-agnostic. Once you've downloaded the app on iTunes, it will be in your purchase history and attempting to download it again on your device should prompt you to accept an older version of the app.\n", "Q: Can't update Java due to apparently newer version already installed I'm trying to update Java on my MacBook (OS X 10.9.5). When I download the most resent version (v8 update 40) from java.com and try to install it, it pops up an error box saying\n\nYou are trying to install 1.8.40.27, however 14.9.0 is already installed\n\nand that's it.

Through the hub I can see she is connected using 5 GHz but I am connected using 2.4 GHz. How can I make mine use 5 GHz, at least as a preference?\n\nA: iOS decides automatically whether 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz connection is best if an access point supports both.\nYou can change your BT Home Hub settings to broadcast two separate access points. Open the hub settings → Advanced Settings → Wireless → 5 GHz Wireless and disable “Sync with 2.4 GHz”.\n            \nThis allows you to specifically connect to two separate access points depending on whether you wish to connect over 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz.\n", "Q: How to quit an app in OS X Yosemite I have this annoying BitTorrent app that won't quit. I first tried right clicking and force quit from dock. It does show 'App not responding', however, on clicking 'Force quit' nothing happens, and the app persists in the dock with the black dot below:\n\nSo I next opened 'Force Quit' from Apple menu, and clicking it launches the list of processes open, and sure there I see BitTorrent. However, same here, on force quitting it, nothing happens, the app name is still there in the list of open apps.\nSo I next open Activity monitor, and check if it is there. However, as you can see, it is not there:\n\nHowever, if I switch to the energy tab, I see BitTorrent there, but it shows as disabled, and consequently I am unable to quit it by clicking the cancel button at the top left (which is disabled):\n\nSo I login to my terminal, and type top to see whether the app shows up, and it doesn't. \nThen I try launchctl list to see which things were launched by Apple at startup, and spot something like com.bittorrent.BitTorrent.307036. So I run sudo launchctl remove com.bittorrent.BitTorrent.307036, and still nothing happens, the app remains frozen in the dock.\nFinally, I tried killall -9 Dock and it does nothing. This is happening quite frequently off late. Last day it happened to my Outlook app, I had to restart to get rid of it. How do I solve this problem?\n\nA: Your last screenshot is showing the apps that were running in the past 8 hours. You can try running ps -e | grep -i bittorrent in Terminal.app to confirm, but it doesn't appear to be running at this time. Relaunching the Dock should make the icon disappear, unless it's a side effect of autotermination:\n\nIn Lion [and subsequent versions of OS X], an ostensibly \"running\" application may have no associated process (because the operating system automatically terminated it in order to reclaim resources) and an application may have a process even when it doesn't appear to be running. Applications without processes. Processes without applications. Did Lion just blow your mind?\n\n\nA: I would suggest uninstalling the BitTorrent, and then using a light weight torrent such as uTorrent instead. \nIf you can't uninstall using the normal methods, use AppCleaner ( http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/ ) - this should sort it for you and force the app to close without harm.\n\nA: Type into Terminal:\nkillall \"Program Name\"\n\nReplacing \"Program Name\" with the name of your program\nAlternatively you can get the pid of the program and kill it that way.\nGo to Activity Monitor and select the \"Memory\" tab and find your program and note it's PID.\nGo to Terminal and type:\nkill \"pid\"\n\nReplace the \"pid\" with the actual PID of your program.\n", "Q: Can I jailbreak an iPhone 4S with iOS 8.2?

I've been thinking of getting a Mac Pro to do some serious graphics work.  However, I don't have the funds to get it along with a Retina display at the same time. The display, keyboard, speakers, etc. would have to wait a few months.  \nIf I get the Mac Pro, can I run it through my MacBook Air? If so, would this also work for a Mac Mini, as I might end up with that instead? \n\nA: I'm going to elaborate on the answers given so far (the answer + associated comments above) in case you or someone needs more details. \nScreen Sharing is what Apple calls the VNC / remote desktop technology built into OS X for many years now. I'm assuming your machine is running 10.10 Yosemite. Instructions for earlier versions of OS X are similar.\nScreen Sharing allows the Mac--in this case the Mac pro sans monitor--to display on another machine on the local network; for you, your Air. Screen Sharing is configured in the Sharing pane of System Preferences. System Preferences can be accessed from the Apple menu at the top left of the screen, for example.\nYou may need to borrow a monitor or get help at an Apple store near you. I'd be surprised if they didn't let you borrow one of their monitors to configure your Mac Pro for Screen Sharing. \nHere is what you need to do from your Mac Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run System Preferences.\n\n*Click on \"Sharing\" in the third row.\n\n*Click the check box next to \"Screen Sharing\".\n\n*Notice the green dot and \"Screen Sharing: On\" to the right of that check box. Underneath that note, it says: \"Other users can access your computer's screen at vnc://x.x.x.x/ [though the x's will be replaced by numbers] or by looking for \"[Your Mac's Name]\" in the Finder sidebar.\"\n\n*Take note of your Mac Pro's Name. Note that you can change your Mac's name at the top of \"Sharing\" in System Preferences if you want to.\n\n*Make sure that both your Mac Pro and your MacBook Air are connected to your home network.\n\n*Move to your Air.\n\n*Go to the Finder (by clicking the smiling Finder guy on the Dock or by clicking on the Desktop background.\n\n*Press the COMMAND key + n to open a Finder window.\n\n*Look in the sidebar, the leftmost part of the window that shows a list of folders, disks, etc. Locate \"Shared\", a header that will only show up if a machine on your network is sharing files (and / nor Screen Sharing).\n\n*Under Shared, you should see the name of your Mac Pro. Click it. You should see a button near the upper-right corner of your Finder Window.\n\n*Click that button. That should launch the Screen Sharing application that will allow you to interact with your Mac Pro. Type in the username and password that you set up as your user account on your Mac Pro. Note that screen refresh will be slower than a real monitor and are dependent on the speed of your network.\n\n\nGood luck! I hope this helps. I use VNC / Screen Sharing between my Mac and my iPad all the time. My Mac is usually in the basement, so if I need to look at something quick, it's often easiest just to use VNC (I use Remoter VNC) on the iPad. (For your case, might I humbly suggest that you consider buying a used monitor temporarily. You could probably get one for $50 or less and it would most likely be a better experience.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: I put in a lot of detail. I am not trying to insult your intelligence. I just didn't want to skip over any steps that might cause confusion.\n\n\nA: To get things right, you want your Mac Pro being without monitor and use the small 13\" screen from your MacBook Air for that reason AND you want to do graphics work? Despite my personal opinion, that for serious graphics work a 13\" display is a good laugh, Retina display or not and that most work in Photoshop is done by the GPU and not the CPU, there are several technical solutions for your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Apple Remote Desktop on your Mac Pro and access it by your MacBook Air.\n\n*Get a public available Remote Desktop software like VNC and VNC Server which maybe better than ARD.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that you also need to install the graphics software on your Mac Pro, therefore for installing you would need a keyboard and a monitor. Nowadays Full HD monitors do not cost $800 any more but $100, even in 27\" with Full HD. The keyboard could also be from Logitech instead of Apple, saving you some bucks.\n\nA: I'm afraid not, the Air wouldn't work as an external display. Also, the Air isn't retina.\nYour best bet may well be to run your Pro through an HD TV, which although isn't quite as nice as a Retina display, it is certainly better than a normal display.\n", "Q: Bash automatically creating () and ()! files I noticed that the Yosemite system has been creating files with names just \"()\" and \"()!\" in places where I recently made bash commands and want to know why. I can't even delete them use rm as after I press enter the cursor just moves to the next line like a unfinished command. I tried google but I guess the keywords () is too general to give me back a meaningful answer.\n\nA: Bash, by itself, will not create files like this. These files are probably created by you accidentally through incorrect typing/pasting of commands.\nYou can remove the files using rm:\nrm '()' '()!'\n\n", "Q: Automatically Move Files Created In Folder I have a project I've inherited from an ex-employee that is missing the source, so I am attempting to debug from the temp files it creates in a directory. The issue is that it creates and deletes some of these files so quickly I cannot move them to another folder.\nI've tried AppleScript or Automator to automatically move files, however it doesn't seem to work on files created by the app, but does work if I move files into the directory in Finder.\nI've also tried a looping shell script that does a mv *, but it also doesn't catch all files.\nIs there some other way to automatically move files to another directory before they are deleted, or prevent the files from being deleted in the first place?\n\nA: Try using a feature of OS X called \"Folder Actions\".\nRight click on any folder and select \"Folder Actions Setup\".\nIt will gives you a whole list of options. These options come with the operating system. If you would like to modify a script you can double click it and make a duplicate. You can edit your script to do what ever you want. For example, I could code the script so that once an item has been added to the folder, it would play a sound or send me an email. It's quite useful.\nOnce you have coded your script you need to move it to the correct path. Go to Finder and select \"Go\", then press \"Go to Folder\". Type in this path: /Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/. Drag and drop your script to that folder. You may be prompted for a password.\nNext, go to the folder that you want the script to be applied to. Right click and your new script should be listed. Select it and hit Attach.\nThere you go!\nHope this helps.\nMore Information on Folder Actions here\n\nA: I have a feeling that what ever you try will not register the files before the app can delete them if your saying it is already too fast.\nBut you could look at launchAgents/Daemons\n\nlaunchAgents/Daemons\nMany kinds of tasks that do not require user interaction are most\neffectively handled by a process that runs in the background. You can\nuse a daemon or service to:\n\n*\n\n*Provide server functionality, such serving web pages.\n\n*Coordinate access to of a shared resource, such as a database.\n\n*Perform work for a foreground application, such as file system access.\n\n\nApple provide a comprehensive guide here\nYou should be able to create one and watch the folder with it. The Launch agent can run commands and scripts which you add to its Program Arguments.\n", "Q: iOS 8.2 iPad mini iCloud login stuck at \"Verifying\" All of a sudden today my iPad stopped syncing iMessages.

It has largely been fantastic for gaming in Windows 7 — I've played through Bioshock Infinite, Dishonored, Dark Souls and others all without many problems and with a good performance and quality.\nHowever, some games give me a really odd glitch when certain settings are enabled. Spec Ops: The Line, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and Borderlands 2 (so far) have all displayed odd red lines/artifacting, and though I can sometimes remove them by fiddling with settings, I was hoping someone would know if there is any root cause of this.

Since the edit changed the hash, that may be the problem.\nTL;DR: It is not possible unless you patch the binary in some way.\n", "Q: IPhone: too much disk space is used for unknown reason Here is a full list of all applications installed on the device:\n\nI have already used Battery Doctor (and other apps) and cleaned cache. So what is 7.2 gb used for?

Instead of having a text box at the bottom of the screen I can type into, the conversation simply goes all the way down. When this happens, the text box still appears in every other conversation; I can also still send messages in that conversation from my iPhone. It disappears only on my Mac, and only on that one conversation. The problem persists when I shut down Messages and start it back up. Sometimes the text box comes back, and then later disappears again, on a pattern that I have not been able to discern.\nAny thoughts?\nMessages 8.0\nMac OS 10.10.2\n\nA: From another site, try disabling and then re-enabling the account in question as follows. \nWithin the Messages app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the conversation that has the problem (I don't know that this is necessary, but I did it anyway)\n\n*Go to Messages->Preferences...->Accounts\n\n*In the box at the left hand side, select the account in question -- it will probably be your Apple ID with \"iMessage\" below it\n\n*Then over on the right, make sure \"Settings\" (and not \"Blocked\") is selected near the top\n\n*Still on the right, underneath your Apple ID, uncheck \"Enable this account\"\n\n*At that point, back in the main Messages app you should see the text box reappear at the bottom of the conversation\n\n*Then re-check \"Enable this account\"\n\n\nDone.\nP.S. This was done on OS X El Capitan (Version 10.11.1), and Messages app version 9.0 (5084)\n", "Q: Is OSX 10.6.8 too old? Constant slow/lockup w/ FireFox, which constantly draws high %CPU rate I switched to FireFox when Safari started to have massive problems.  Firefox is not much better.  Mozilla forum responses keep blaming AddOn incompatability.  But mostly I'm running security & privacy enhancers (DoNotTrackMe, Ghostery, etc)\nI have a DSL line.\nI've got an MBP 2.66 Ghz Core i7, wish I could install more than 8 GB memory.  I tried a PCI card, but it causes a kernel panic (Delkin Devices ExpressCard 34 PRO SSD PCI Express)\nI want to keep >100 tabs open.  Closer to 200.  Used to be able to do that with Safari.  What has changed ?\nFF was working adequately until the last security update.  Now its just constantly showing anywhere from 20% to 80+ %CPU usage. It can take many seconds to open a new blank tab, and then 10-20 seconds before it accepts input (trackpad click on the URL box, or keyboard entry).\nSeems like every other FF update screws it up.\n\nA: The problem seems to be that you want to keep 200 tabs open. Try reducing this number and the computer should perform better.\n\nA: You could also have web browser addons installed that have memory leaks/eat up memory/cpu.  Try disabling addons, and see if you still have the problem.  If the problem is resolved by turning off browser addons, you can turn them back on, one by one, until you find out which one/s might be causing it, at which time you can remove/uninstall those specific addons from the browser.\nAlso, if possible, you should definitely upgrade the amount of RAM in your Mac/Computer.  Either way, adding more RAM should help everything run faster/smoother.\nBest of luck!  Hope this helps :)\n-James\n", "Q: VMWare Fusion 7: File Not Found I screwed up big time when I tried deleting my Windows 7 VM on VMWare Fusion 7 on my Macbook Air. I put the VM in the Trash and emptied the trash. Now when I try to create a new VM, I get File Not Found. I tried moving VMWare Fusion into the Trash so I can uninstall it and then reinstall it but it's not working. How do I fix my problem so I can install a more recent Windows VM?

(Or do effectively the same thing in the Terminal, with ps aux | grep vm and then kill -9 on each of the appropriate process numbers, if you're command-line-oriented.)\n\n*Go find your VMs in Finder.\n\n*Restart the VMWare Fusion application.\n\n*Drag each of your VM packages to VMWare and drop it on the now-empty left pane of the Virtual Machine Library window to re-add the the VM to the list.\n\n*Test-start each of them to make sure you didn't break anything. [This is the paranoia option, here.]\n\n*Restart VMWare to make darned sure it writes out new config files.

I've been using the beta iCloud Photo Library for a week and a bunch of photos got duplicated and I'd like to wipe all the photos out and start over.\nI have backups of all the photos and have turned off iPhoto Cloud Library on all iOS devices. When I log into the web app - it still shows dozens of albums and I can delete all the photos, then go to deleted items and then purge them, but the ghost albums are still there messing things up.\nI've turned off the library entirely and you can see there is a 30 day waiting period. \n\nIf I click on albums, there are pages of them and no delete button anywhere. If I turn on the library on an iOS device, data starts flooding back as if I wanted to recover the photos.\nI don't want to recover anything, I want a clean wipe and clean slate.\nCurrently, there are 7807 photos in the deleted album and no way to mass delete them. I have 31 albums that show up in iCloud and no way to delete them.\nIs there some way to accelerate this or must people wait a month for a corrupt library to eventually be purged to start over?\n(I have tickets open with AppleCare after carefully reading the FAQ and it's escalated to engineering, but I was informed that it might be a week or two before it gets seen :-( Perhaps someone has a better idea to clear things out or noticed something I've missed.)\n\nA: Photos on the Mac makes this trivial to accomplish.

Turn off icloud backup on your device and wait 30 days. Or find yourself a mac and click on Apple Logo> System Preferences > icloud> Manage... > Photos > Delete. You get the storage back right away and can still reverse it in 30 days. And notice I said mac, for PC icloud software does not have that option at least as of 05/01/2018.\n\nA: Answer: Yes\nHere is how:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iDevice/s (iPhone, iPad, etc), go to Settings > Photos & Camera > and turn off the \"iCloud Photo Library (Beta)\" option.\n\n*Once you have turned iCloud Photo Library off on any/all of your iDevices/iOS Devices, go to https://www.icloud.com/#photos, and delete any/all photos you want to delete on there.\nAfter that, your iCloud Photo Library should be cleared/wiped out.  \nNote:  If for some reason you turn the \"iCloud Photo Library (Beta)\" option back on in iOS, and the old/deleted photos are still there, just delete them off of the device/s first, then repeat the steps I mentioned above.\n\nA: What is the delete button is disabled, not clickable \n\n\nA: This might work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't disable iCloud photos syncing yet\n\n*Go to Photos on macOS, Cmd + A to select all photos, delete and empty the trash.\n\n*Wait til this change syncs across all your devices\n\n*Disable iCloud photos syncing\n\n", "Q: iPhone 6 - Phone call keypad not recognized Recently, when I am on a call that requires pressing a number on the keypad (for instance: to select an option or join a WebEx), I can press the appropriate button and I see the press respond and hear the tone, but the other end of the line does not recognize that the number was pressed.\nI thought it was only WebEx, but two other calls did the same thing today (one of them being an Apple support call).\nHow can I fix/debug this?\nI tried searching Google for \"iPhone 6 numeric keypad not working\" but came up empty. Is there another term I should use in my search?\n\nA: As an update, I have not had this happen since upgrading my phone to iOS 10, so I can only assume that it was a bug with previous versions of the operating system.\nAside from that, I have not found a \"solution\".\n", "Q: Make OS X Dashboard Widgets appear in Desktop Dashboard Widgets would be much more useful as MenuBar apps, but some aren't.

Am I able to recieve or send text messages from a android user if I don't save their number and my airdrop is turned on to \"contacts only\"?\n\nA: AirDrop and text messages have nothing to do with each other.\nAirDrop lets you use your iOS device to send or receive files from nearby users who also have iOS devices.\nText messages are just that - text messages. You use the Messages app to send or receive text messages to or from any cell phone number.\n\nA: Yes.\nAir Drop is a way to share files with people who are nearby. \nText messages are separate. You should receive those from anyone who sends them to you.\n\nA: I don’t think this will work with android users. I believe the only people you can see regardless of what is checked are iOS or OS X users.\n", "Q: Integrate Lightning (Tunderbird AddOn) into Yosemite's Notification Center I currently went from Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard to 10.10.2 Yosemite. I am kind of impressed of the \"new\" Notification Center\" and asking myself if there is any way to integrate Thunderbird's Lightning Calendars and Tasks into this.\nIncoming mails are integrated like a charm. However, my calendars aren't.\nI could use Apple's Mail and Calendar Apps for sure, but I'd rather use Thunderbird for seamless integration in my Linux-Windows-Mac-based Workflow.\n\nA: This has probably crossed your mind already, but you could sync all your Lightning calendars with the native Calendar app too (and just keep them unchecked in Calendar if you don't want those events shown in that app). That should take care of notifications, although you wouldn't be able to interact with them without launching Calendar.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make iPhone forget the data belonging to one app? I recently downloaded an app (Rival Knights) which I already had on my iPad, but not on my phone. It gave me the option to write over my saved data and I declined. However now, I've changed my mind and want to start again.\nI've tried deleting and re-installing the app, completely resetting my iPhone, deleting the app from my game centre, and making a new apple ID, however none of these have worked.\nIs there any other way I can make my phone forget the app so I have a chance of starting again?\n\nA: Many apps store data in the iOS Keychain. If the app is deleted the information from the Keychain is NOT deleted from the device. Generally, information such as login info, token, etc. is stored in the Keychain, but nothing prevents the developer from storing other arbitrary data there.\nThe only way to get around this is to use the Settings to reset the phone data or do a factory reset of the device.\n\nA: If you delete the app, all the data from that app gets deleted.\nThat is how the phone forgets that app.\nIf the app uses Game Center or another log in to retrieve game state from servers online, then you'll need to temporarily sign out of Game Center and possibly iCloud to remove those files from the phone as well.\nI'd start by signing out of Game Center and delete/reinstall the game.\nIf that doesn't work, you can either check the specific game / contact that developer and/or sign out of iCloud documents or inspect that data store to see if that game has cloud files.\nOnce you have a clean start, you will know how to force a change to the cloud to reset the progress to be new.\n\nA: I had a similar issue on my iPad. I think I fixed it!\nI wanted to reset the game and realised simply reinstalling the game from the App Store didn't mean starting new game. Here's what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete Rival Knights app.\n\n*Reinstall the Rival Knight app from App Store\n\n*Go to iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage > Backups (at the top) \n\n*Tap This iPad (or iPad name) > Backup Options\n\n*Tap 'Show All Apps' in Backup Options \n\n*There is then a list of the apps on your device and the option to switch off the data back up for individual apps. Find Rival Knight app and you can switch off the data back up.\n\n*A pop up window asks \"Do You Want to Turn off Rival Knights Backups and Delete the Data from iCloud?\" Choose \"Delete.\" \n\n*Go back to your home screen and play Rival Knights, you will be playing a brand new game!  \n", "Q: Syncing an iPad to my desktop iMac I have an iPad which I would like to sync with my desktop Mac.

Not the /Volumes/backupdrive/Shared Items/Backups, but the actual Backups.backupdb you see in backing up locally. Where does it store that data? I know an external machine backups successfully to it often, but the data doesn't seem to be anywhere. Any ideas?\n\nA: Since OS X server is just an app that runs on top of the standard OS X, you would open the Time Machine system preference pane to see where the server itself is backed up and which files may be excluded. (This is exactly the same as non-server app Macs, but Time Machine knows how to kick off server data snapshots as needed.)\nIn my case, I exclude the large backups and back up the small backups all to the drive XXX Backup A.\nThen you can see that each of the machines either back up to the service destinations of Small Backups or Large backups.\n\nAnd the storage lineup for this server is:\n\n\nA: /Volumes/backupdrive/Shared Items/Backups/Other-Machine-Name.sparesebundle\nMount it and you will see the familiar backup structure.\n", "Q: Missing iOS iMessage showing in OSX Messages This is the second time this has happened to me in the past couple of days so it starts to bother me: somebody sends me an iMessage, that I never get on my iPhone (4S iOS 8.2) but I do get on my Macbook's (OS 10.10.2 Yosemite) Messages application (v8.0). Even days later the messages are not appearing on my iPhone.\nDo you have any idea why this is happening and how I could manually force a synchronization?\n\nA: It can happen if your phone is outside good reception area for iMessage - carrier signal dropped to GPRS/Edge etc. \nThe Mac picks it up, the system considers it delivered.\nThere is no further attempt to send it to your phone.\nIt used to happen to me a lot when I was working in a low-reception area.\nIt won't re-synchronise.\nSee How to tell Messages \"I'm not at home\"? for a similar experience.\nIt doesn't happen if your phone is set to airplane mode, or off altogether.

Don’t change the country of your apple-id. Apple will screw it up, throw away your purchases or something of the kind. You can move an apple-id to a new country store (and back again), but it seems like an afterthought from Apple. You will only be able to see/access your purchases from the country store presently associated with the account.  \nStick with what you have for the moment. If you really need a new apple-id / iTunes account in the USA; Make a new one. Your old apple-id and purchases can live alongside the new on the new i-device and in the same iTunes library. \n", "Q: Keynote document can't be opened although its size shows normally and how to repair it?

Apple Support had me verifying stuff on the Disk Utility then it cut off. Can anyone help me? I can't download anything till this is sorted.\n\nA: A few of things for you to try...\nFirst, try starting in Safe Boot by holding the Shift key when you hear the startup chime. If you manage to successfully boot in this way and you can access the internet, download and install OS X 10.6.8 Combo Update V1.1. Restart and see what happens...\nIf that doesn't work - and you have the original discs that shipped with your Mac - start your Mac from disc 1, OS X Install Disc. Once it has started up find Disk Utility from the menu bar and select Repair Disk. When that has done select Repair Permissions. Finally, restart and see what happens...\nIf you installed from a retail copy of 10.6, follow the same steps above.\nIf you don't have the original discs, start your Mac and hold command + S to boot into single user mode.

Is there any way to automatically download or sync all photos backed up from my phone to Google+ to my Mac?\nI know there is an upload tool, but I want the reverse.\nCan they be viewed from Picasa somehow?\n\nA: You can download all Google+ photos in one go using Google Takeout.\n\nA: The solution by Johnathon Sullinger has caused photos to sync using Google Drive, which counts towards your 15GB limit. Ended up having to delete and re-upload using photos. So sync cannot work both ways without counting towards drive storage limits as far as I can tell.\nAlso, at this point in time, Google Photos only end up there if you give permissions from both accounts, which you wouldn't want unless you're only uploading from Google Photos.\n\nA: You can automatically download your photos from Google Photos (I believe Google+ photos end up there, correct me if I'm wrong) fairly easily. It requires a few different steps to get it set up though. Once it's setup, the sync is done for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*First you have to install the Google Photos Uploader for OS X. \n\n*Next you have to install the Google Drive sync app to sync your Google Drive on your Mac.\n\n*Next open Google Photos via your browser and go to settings. From within settings, enable the Google Drive option.\n\n\n*Open Google Drive from your browser and select the Google Photos option. Ensure the settings pane for Google Photos on Google Drive has the Create Google Photos folder enabled.\n\n\n*Lastly, ensure the newly created Google Photos folder in your Google Drive is selected on your Mac's Google Drive settings for sync.\n\n\nAt this point, your photos will sync from your mobile device and desktop to Google Photos, be linked to Google Drive, and sync back down to your desktop for you to pull in to what ever app you want.\nNote, as pointed out by @Jer, this will count against your Google Drive storage whereas if you just stored them in Google Photos, you can make use of the unlimited storage. I pay $10 a mo/ for 1TB of Google Drive storage and this works great. I organize all my photos into subdirectories, tag them and manage them via Adobe Lightroom, with Google Drive automatically syncing them to Google Photos on my phone. It also lets me easily select a folder I've organized via Lightroom and share it with other people via Google Drive, instead of having to build out albums and share via Photos.\n\nA: Starting July 10, 2019, Google Photos and Google Drive will no longer automatically sync. We’re making this change to simplify how things work between the two services. You can read more about the changes in our blog post. \n(https://support.google.com/photos/answer/9316089)\n\nA: Here are the facts... it IS bi-directional, and it does NOT count against your Google Drive storage if you are syncing to/from Google Photos and not simply uploading photos into a random folder.\nIf I take a picture on my camera, it automatically uploads to Google photos once I'm on wifi. It automatically shows up in my \"Google Photos\" folder on Drive, AND it shows in my offline Google Drive's \"Google Photos\" folder on my Mac.\nIf I drag a photo into my offline Google Drive \"Google Photos\" folder on my Mac, it automatically uploads to sync with my Google Drive \"Google Photos\" folder in the cloud, and it shows up in Google Photos online.\nAnd my Google Drive shows that I've used \"5.2 GB of 15 GB\" allotted storage, but my Google Photos folder contains about 86GB (yes, eighty-six).\nIf you set it up right, this is how it works.\n\nA: Google+ Auto Backup for MAC. I have been running it on my MAC with current OS and it works well.\n\nA: I just did this:\nFIRST, create a folder on your desktop and name it (mine is \"G+ Pix\").  You will need this folder for step #5.\n1) Open Google+ Photos to see your list of pix. Select the group of pictures you want to export by clicking on the check mark in the upper left hand corner of the pic. Using the \"shift\" key on your keyboard helps you do multiple selections at one time. These pix will remain in G+, because you are downloading copies of the pix. I selected by date in order to keep the download times manageable.  It was easier to keep track of what I had selected, also.  I had 900 pix to move!!!\n2) Select the download button found with an underscored arrow at top right of the Google+ menu bar.\n3) You will see this group of photos being downloaded as \"Photos.zip\" in your download\n   menu at the top right of your MAC screen.\n4) When download is complete, the file will read \"Photos\" with a blue folder to the left of it. This downloading process can take awhile, depending on the number of pix you export and the level of picture quality you determined when sending pix to G+, initially.\n5) Double-click this file and your pix will appear in list form.  Highlight this entire list by using the \"shift\" key on your keyboard for multiple selections, and move the list to your designated folder on your desktop. From this desktop folder, you can now manipulate them as your please. \nMultiple Selection Tip\nSelect first picture\nHold down \"Shift\" key as you selected last picture.\nAll items should now be blue and will transfer as one group by holding down the curser on the list as you slide them to the desktop folder.\nAnyway, this worked perfectly for me.  You have to play the game, man! Ugh!\n\nA: Google has purposely blocked this by not releasing bio direction sync on any platform even the phones wont sync downloads they just show up in the viewer and you have to select them to download a copy to your phone. Google photos is for auto upload only not auto download. \nUntil people demand this service and another vendor provides it google will never allow it. \nThe other solution is to install a android emulator, install google photos and click on the photos you want to download. Not sure if a emu exists on the mac tho.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro or iPhone 6 won't connect to 5GHZ Asus Router I have an ASUS RT-N65U using a custom firmware (3.0.3.7-075) from https://code.google.com/p/rt-n56u/downloads/list\nSo I can change SSID options for 2.5GHZ and 5GHZ but I can't connect to the 5GHZ variant. In my Mac says connection timeout. On my iPhone it immediately shows \"can't connect\". \nI'm next to the router, because I'm testing so I don't know what else to do.\nI can change MTU, Channels, etc... Any suggestions?\n\nA: When flashing custom firmware, you need to be very careful. Some firmwares can cause hardware-software communication issues, so when you think a setting has been changed, it may not have been. DO NOT send it in for repair. You've probably already voided the warranty. Try to go back to your original firmware and see if it works. \n\nAny communication errors will be present in the kernel. \nEDIT: By the way, if your router has a USB port, try to see if there are any errors when you try to connect to the Internet that way.\n\nA: try switching the channel to something < 149 on your 5ghz radio.\n", "Q: Move disk to new hardware? I've got an OS X Snow Leopard Server config on a Mac Pro 1,1.  I can't upgrade any further on that hardware.\nHowever, I've got a spare MacPro 3,1 and wondered if it would be \"simple\" to just move the disks to the new hardware?\nI thought I'd ask first just in case the disks get updated with something which means I can't go back to the old MacPro.\n\nA: Checking the specs of the the MacPro1,1 you should be able to upgrade to 10.7.5 if you upgraded it to at least 2 GB of RAM and you don't need Rosetta (for PPC-apps).\nSince the preinstalled system on the MacPro 3,1 was 10.5.1 and both are equipped with a SATA (3 Gb/s) internal HD-interface, there shouldn't be any problem to move the \"old\" disks.\nYour disks won't be updated with anything, except you initiate it yourself.\n\nA: As 10.6.8 is supported on both Mac Pros the simple answer is yes, you can transfer your disks over to the newer Mac Pro and your installation will work as it did before.\nAssuming you don't do something silly like accept the free update to Yosemite (which is supported on the Mac Pro 3,1) you will be able to move the disk back to the older machine if you need to. As long as you stay with 10.6.8 there are no updates that will break the ability for your 10.6.8 startup disk to boot the older Mac.\nHaving said that, if the newer Mac Pro is of a reasonably higher spec - and you want newer server features such as Profile Manager - you may want to think about performing a clean installation of 10.10 (as well as purchasing the latest iteration of OS X Server), then migrating the data over from the older machine. The only cost is the purchase of OS X server, and that's not exactly going to break the bank.\n\nA: My Snow Leopard 10.6.8 disk from my old MacPro 1,1 is now on my MacPro 5,1.  Yes, it boots.  I don't use it much anymore, but since there are 4 HD bays, I just keep it there.\n", "Q: Is a bootable USB drive with Yosemite OK for different macs? This might be obvious, but probably worth a question: I took my MBP (Early 2011 15\"), downloaded Yosemite and created a bootable USB device from which I later clean-installed the OS.\nCan I use this same USB device with a different MBP (i.e., Late 2011 13\"), or do I have to download the installer again from that macbook app store?\nI got worried for a second thinking that it might need different drivers, or something like that. Second MBP does not even belong to me, so it will be used with a different Apple ID (i.e., different from the one through which I got my Yosemite).\n\nA: The Yosemite Installer package contains all the divers for all supported models.\nYou are good to go for multiple uses on multiple systems.\n", "Q: How to take screenshot in Boot Camp? I have MacBook Pro Retina running Windows 8.1. I do not have a PrtScr key. Also, shift+fn+f11 key combination doesn't work. What is the shortcut to take screenshots?\n\nA: Use the Snipping Tool that ships with Windows, it's made for that exact purpose. The Windows help page is here, info found using this search tool ;-)\n\nA: ⇧ shift+fn+F11 is the correct keyboard shortcut to emulate a Print Screen in Windows, however this shortcut requires the Boot Camp drivers to be installed and be running in Windows. Make sure you have the drivers installed correctly and check whether the keyboard is configured to require fn in Boot Camp Control Panel.\n\nA: If you hear the click sound when taking a screen shot the the shot has been taken and it is in your Clipboard. \nTo get it, open any application (like paint or other) and use the \"Paste command\" to see it/modify and save as a file in a location of your choosing.\n\nA: The fn+option+shift+F11 (and also fn+shift+F11) will only work if you have the following setting in Boot Camp Control Panel turned off (untick the checkbox):\nKeyboard tab > Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\nExtra tip:\nfn+shift+F11 = Captures the full screen\nfn+option+shift+F11 = Captures the current active window\n\nA: now win10 support shift+win+s hotkey to take a  screenshot, I give up this task by  using touch bar of windows in macbook.\n\nA: I just messed around using Bootcamp Windows 10 on Mac laptop, the issue is not the control, it is the setup: \nFirst, set up OneDrive\nPress FnShiftF11P\nPrompt will ask you if you want to save screenshots to OneDrive: Yes\nFor future screenshots use the original command of FnShiftF11\n", "Q: Mac asking for multiple \"login\" keychain app passwords but won't accept them I have a 2012 MacBook Pro. My husband reset the password for iCloud and iTunes and now I cannot get access to my computer. I can put in the password at login then nothing but a black screen with popups saying \"login\" keychain for multiple apps like calendar, messages, address book, etc. The password for iTunes and iCloud is not being accepted.\n\nA: If you mean annoying popups such as:\n\nX wants to use the \"login\" keychain. Please enter the keychain password.\n\nyou need to type your correct keychain password (usually it's the same as your login password, unless you've changed it).\nIt happens, because different mentioned services (see the list via: sudo launchctl list) trying to access your credentials which are encrypted and stored using Keychain (e.g. in ~/Library/Keychains/) and your login.keychain file is encrypted with different password than specified.\nIt's not likely you can fix it without specifying the right password, however you can try the following options (which can give you some clues):\n\n\n*\n\n*You may want to disable specific services from accessing your keychain, e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo launchctl list\n\n*sudo launchctl stop <job label>\n\n\n*Run Keychain Access from Utilities and invoke Keychain First Aid from the menu to verify consistency of your keychain configuration.\n\n*Run Disk Utility and invoke Repair Disk/First aid in case there is any temporary glitch (from corruption of the file).\n\n*Check your ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain, such as size, the last modified date and time (which can lead you to specific changes on that date) or any potential backups in that folder or somewhere else (login.keychain).\n\n*Try unlocking your keychain file from the command line:\n$ security unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\n\nUsing -p you can specify the password on the command line, so if you have list of potential valid password, you can write small brutal-force script.\nTry the same on older login.keychain files if you've to verify that it worked.\n\n*Try dumping the content of keychain from the shell, e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try security dump-keychain command which can be used to dump the contents of a keychain.\n\n*Try keychaindump command which can read keychain file by hunting for unlocked keychain master keys located in the memory space of the securityd process, and uses them to decrypt keychain files.\n$ sudo ./keychaindump ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\n[*] Searching process 16 heap range 0x7feec8c00000-0x7feec8d00000\n[*] Searching process 16 heap range 0x7feec8d00000-0x7feec9000000\n[*] Searching process 16 heap range 0x7feeca000000-0x7feeca400000\n[*] Found 4 master key candidates\n[*] Trying to decrypt wrapping key in ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\n[+] Found master key: XYZ\n[+] Found wrapping key: XYZ\n\n\n*Try the EnCase's dumpkeychain application, which works similar as above, see: Examining Mac OS X User & System Keychains.\n\n\n*Restore your ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain file from Time Machine or somewhere else, and unlock it manually (security unlock-keychain <file>).\n\n*In Keychain Access Preferences try Synchronize login keychain password with account, however if you're not remembering your password, it rather won't help.\n\n*The last resort would be to do Reset Default Keychain in Keychain Access Preferences which would revert it to factory defaults and create a new empty \"login\" keychain and your current default keychain will be moved aside, but not deleted. That means all remembered passwords are gone unless you've some of them remembered in the web-browser, but you can start storing them from scratch.\n\n\nA: Picking apart a failed keychain can be really problematic and fraught with persistent pop ups demanding passwords. You also run the risk of locking that account online with all the failed log in attempts.\nDo you have a backup of the system from before the damage was done? If so, copying any new files (spreadsheets, photos, etc...) off the drive and wiping and reinstalling is often easiest.\nIf that's not an option, consider starting a backup. That will give you peace of mind that no matter what you try, you'll not lose any more files and data.\nI would read how to make a new admin user - but don't delete any users yet, and if that is something you care to try - you can start backup and secure the files even if you need to wipe the account and just restore the files.\nIf you don't think you're up to making a new admin account - seek help - first from AppleCare or a local Apple store and/or someone that's tech savvy / local technician as fixing this will require some tools that could inadvertently lose your data.\n\nA: I had something very similar happen today on a virtual new install of Yosemite. I usually leave my MacPro running so I was surprised to see it was turned off this morning. I turned on the computer and logged in and checked some email and then logged out to run some errands. \nWhen I returned some aspects of the login screen looked a bit off, but didn't pay to close attention.  Login generated the series of pop up keychain access requests. I clicked cancel everytime and noted the following sequence of requests subjects: First little pig said, \"give me access to CalendarAgent\" second wanted \"com.apple.iCloudHelper.xpc\"  ; next pig wants \"minilauncher keychain login; next pig says, \"give me access to MessageAgent; next wanted \"accountsd\" that was the miss spelling; next wanted \"cloudd\";; loop starts again. \nI forced shutdown and did a \"SafeBoot\" no annoying piggies, but some anomiles and could get System Prefs for Display to function properly no option to rotate.\nI checked the Security Prefs and the firewall was on, I unlocked and made some adjustments to apps allowed to access, I was surprised to see that iTunes was blocked, changed to allow and then turned Firewall on and locked it. Went back to display but no joy. \nDid a shutdown command under black apple. Let machine sit for a while. Unplugged MacPro power cord waited, replugged and did a normal startup.\nLogin screen seemed somehow more normal. Signed in; went to display pref and reset to my standard settings for a dual monitor one landscape/ one portrait at different resolutions.\nComputer seems to be working normally. I didn't really do anything other than the SAFEBOOT which does do some background tests and some resets/adjustments. \nMy best advice is to never give in to any requests you don't understand or seem out of place. First try SAFEBOOT, then a reset of PRAM, and a reset of the SRM which is the unplug from power. \n\nA: I came across this same issue on El Capitan, and had already searched and tried all suggestions on here.\nMy solution was to disable FileVault under System Settings > Security & Privacy and everything works fine again.\n", "Q: \"Add To Wish List\" in the Mac App Store? Does anybody know if there is a way to \"add to wish list\" some apps at the Mac App Store and get noticed when their price drops just as in the iTunes Store?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: There is no default mac app store wish list, all though, there are some 3 party applications and websites that allow you do track apps prices and add them to a wishlist.

This is my first iPhone, and though I've searched using Siri, Google, and the Stack Exchange search, I've been unable to find a solution to my problem\nWhile using the built-in keyboard, I noticed the smiley face button that brings up the smiley emoticon keyboard. In addition to the 4 other emoticon keyboards along the bottom, I noticed that there is an varying array of dots along the top of each of the emoticon keyboards.\nI'm use to to this indicating that there are other \"pages\" of whatever I'm looking at, and I only need to swipe left or right to see them. But swiping across the emoticons simply selects one icon after another, leaving the unseen emoticons unseen.\nFor the \"face\" icons, I see 1 black and 8 grey, I assume that means there are 8 other face style icons I can choose from, maybe smiling, or angry, or sleepy.

Won't work in normal start up, will start in safe mode, but cursor shows strange black lines (see attached photo). These lines follow the cursor around.\n\nRunning Yosemite\n\nA: Yeah, your video card is bad.  The good news is that your iMac can run pretty well without a video card; it'll be fine for everything but the most demanding video games.  \nSo what you need to do is move the video driver out of the way, so the kernel doesn't try to load it.  Do an \"ls\" in /System/Library/Extensions (\"sudo ls /System/Library/Extensions\") and look for something that looks like the name of a video card: on my system it's called ATIRadeonX2000.kext.  Now move that file somewhere else (like, to your home directory).  Reboot (into normal, not safe mode) and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: Why does my iPod Touch show Spotlight differently? I have an iPod Touch 5th gen (latest). After I upgraded to iOS 8.2, the Spotlight display looks like the following. Instead of the icons fading out to nearly invisible (as it does on my iPad and an iPhone 4S I tried), the icons are shown in chunky black and white.\nWhat's going on here? Why does this happen on my iPod Touch, but it works correctly on both older and newer hardware? Is this simply a bug in iOS 8.2? Does this happen for anybody else?\n\n\nA: I had this happen when I ran a beta version of iOS (8.0 beta 3 iirc). A reboot sometimes fixed it, but it kept coming back. The next beta fixed it for me.\nTry rebooting, and check your accessibility options for greyscale (I have it in the triple-click home button menu, which I guessed was the culprit). Try disabling all accessibility options.\nIf you really want this gone and the above answers don't work, try a factory restore.\n", "Q: Does Parallels 10 fix the Fn keys issue? In order to use the Fn Keys on Windows VMs with Parallels 9 you have to set them as standard function keys on Mac OS, which requires you the press the Fn key to access the special functions (brightness, playback, volume etc.).\nDoes Parallels 10 fix this, allowing you to use the special keys on Mac and the F keys on Windows?\n\nA: parallels can't 'fix' this issue, because the Fn+FKey combination is done in the keyboard itself, before being sent to the OS.\nThe Fn key itself does send a key code, but the combo doesn't.\n", "Q: Pairing multiple iOS devices with one bluetooth keyboard I have a Keys to go Bluetooth keyboard that I use with my iPad. When I turned off the Bluetooth of my iPad, and paired the keyboard with my iPhone, it worked fine with the iPhone.

I could make the re-paring to my iPad only after my forcefully un-paring the device manually with my iPhone.\nI just expected that the Bluetooth keyboard can connect any devices nearby, but this may not be the case.\nIs this expected behavior or Bluetooth keyboards? Is this specific to iOS devices? \n\nA: Whilst you can pair one master with many slaves, as far as I'm aware, you cannot connect one slave to many masters simultaneously.\nYou need to un-pair & re-pair each time.\nThere is a rather complex guide to piconet & scatternet technology at the Bluetooth Developer Portal\nBluetooth v4.0 spec distinctly says it cannot be done, however v4.1 says it can - so it may depend on which version is used in the device.\nhttp://9to5mac.com/2013/12/05/bluetooth-4-1-will-bring-more-reliable-automatic-connections-multiple-roles-more-via-software-update/\n", "Q: still unable to find google drive on the sidebar of mac I still cannot find locate Google drive on my mac sidebar.

After that it should install fine.\n", "Q: How can I sleep my iMac's internal display when it's not in use, but not my attached tv (playing video) I've got a 2015 iMac running Yosemite, attached via HDMI to a 1080p TV, in extended desktop mode that I use simultaneously as a video server/media player and an occasional work machine.\nIn short, I'd like to sleep the internal display but not the external on demand.\nMore detail: I'd like to be able to run a video player (Plex) in full screen mode on the TV (Screen 2), but set the internal display (Screen 1) to automatically sleep if I'm not doing anything else on the computer but playing video on Screen 2.\nApps like Plex have an option to blank the other screen, but that doesn't work here, as I'd like to be able to use Screen 1 some of the time. I used to make this work on my old Mac Pro by simply turning the computer monitor off but leaving the TV on, but that's not an option with the iMac.\nSomething akin to an off switch (or hotkey) for the internal display (that doesn't disable the desktop) would be perfect, as I often remotely control Screen 1 from another computer while video is playing on Screen 2.\nHave tried SwitchResX, which is great, but it doesn't seem to have the right combination of settings/features to meet my goals (or I've failed to figure them out).\nAny advice would be appreciated.

I have the same problem whether it's WiFi or through ethernet cable, I have full signal but not getting online. Every other device connects fine; android phones and tablets,xbox one, iPhone and other macbooks, all online and browsing the net.\nI have had no problems connecting to other networks with my macbook pro before and I just tried at a friend's house to check, with no problems.\nA little something, that may be a clue to someone: when I open network diagnostic tool, my macbook pro connects for something that seems like a microsecond and it tells me I'm connected to Internet and everything seems fine.\nMy IP is 192.168.0.5 subnet mask 255.255.255.0 and IPv6 is set to automatic.

To get the MAC-address of a Wi-fi interface, open System Preferences -> Network -> Choose \"Wi-fi\" -> Advanced -> Hardware -> MAC Address on the Mac without internet access.\n\n*On the Mac without internet access disable all interfaces in the network preferences pane except the Wi-fi interface by choosing the interface and clicking on the little gear -> \"Make Service Inactive\". You might have to unlock the lock in the left bottom corner first.\n\n*Choose the Wi-fi interface and click 'Advanced'\n\n*Choose the TCP/IP settings, choose to configure IPv4 manually and enter the proper IP-address, netmask and gateway address (enter the IP-address found in step 2 as gateway address). In your example  this should be any address not already in use in the range of 192.168.0.2-192.168.0.254 as IP-address, 255.255.255.0 as netmask and 192.168.0.1 as gareway.\n\n*Choose the DNS tab next to the TCP-IP settings.\n\n*Enter 8.8.8.8 as DNS server. This DNS server is a public one from Google.\n\n*Save/apply the settings\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*Flush any existing routes by entering route -n flush several times.\n\n*Flush DNS cache with dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder. You have to enter your admin password to complete the task. This works with Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) only. If another OS X is installed use the appropriate command.\n\n*Now ping the gateway address and the DNS server with ping -c 5 192.168.0.1 and ping -c 5 8.8.8.8. The command sends 5 pings to the specified address. To stop pinging - if you didn't include the -c  option - just enter ctrlC.\n\n*If you get a successful answer, quit Terminal. If you didn't get an answer, enter ifconfig en1 and re-check the proper settings of your Wi-fi interface. en1 should be your Wi-fi interface.\n\n*Return to the network preferences and reenable all other interfaces. Check that the Wi-fi interface is on top of the list. To reorder the list click on the little gear -> \"Set Service Order...\" and rearrange the interfaces.\n\n*Now open a browser of your choice and try to connect to an arbitrary site.\n\n*If you have internet access now, you may replace the Google DNS server with DNS-servers of your ISP or simply add them.\n\n\n\nThis guide didn't solve the problem.\nAfter some very deep investigations (kudos also to John Keates) we found out that a misconfigured dnscrypt/dnscrypt-proxy was the culprit.\n\nA: After inspecting your configuration, it seems two factors might be in play here:\n\n\n*\n\n*DNS\n\n*Firewall\n\n\nA quick way to confirm a working internet connection but bad DNS is going to a website by using it's IP address rather than it's domain name. For example: http://91.198.174.192 which is a WikiMedia Foundation address. It should say something like \"unconfigured domain name\".\nFirst, let's fix DNS. Go to System Preferences, Network and click the lock in case the panel is still locked. Next, go to your active network interface (probably Wi-Fi or AirPort), click Advanced and then the DNS tab. Clear out everything in there. The light-grey items are not mutable and you can just leave them in there, they are supplied via DHCP. Press OK and then Apply.\nInternet could work at this point. If so: yay! If not, continue.\nFirst, we need to know if DNS is now set correctly. The easiest way to do this is by opening a Terminal window (yep, the spooky app with letters only), and typing: cat /etc/resolv.conf\nThis should produce an output similar to this:\n#\n# Mac OS X Notice\n#\n# This file is not used by the host name and address resolution\n# or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by most processes on\n# this Mac OS X system.\n#\n# This file is automatically generated.\n#\ndomain something\nnameserver 192.168.123.1\n\nThe numbers after name server and the name after domain may vary. It is, however, important that nameserver does not get the number '127.0.0.1', because that won't work. If the number there is not 127.0.0.1, it's fine, and DNS is now set correctly.\nNext, delete any extensions that no longer have their apps installed, such as the Handsoff extension that controls network traffic. I'm not sure what the exact name is, but it's located in either /System/Library/Extensions or /Library/Extensions. The first dash \" / \" means the root, or beginning of your hard drive. In most cases that's \"Macintosh HD\". If you are not sure how to get to the begin \"/\", use Finder -> Go -> Go To Folder form the top menu in Finder. Clear out the box, type a single slash (\" / \"), and press Go.\nThe extension might be called something like \"com.metakine.handsoff.driver\". Deleting that extension and then rebooting will clear out that problem. Internet should work after that.\n\nA: hey ive found out to fix mine. someone put a parental control on my router, if you unblock your device it should fix it!\n\nA: Check if the date in your computer is correct.\nThis worked for me. Somehow it changed, and after i fixed it, the problem was solved. Cheers!\n\nA: My customer's MacBook Pro 6,1 got this symptom when it was updated to Sierra 10.12.4. After trying almost all steps above, and failing to fix after a 3-1/2 hour reinstall ('remaining' timer counted down from 5 minutes!) there was still connectivity with pings but no traffic getting through to Firefox, Safari, Mail or system connections (no App Store or updates). \nThe discussion of Extensions led me to the System>Library>Extensions folder where I found a 2010 copy of the AppleAirPort2.kext file. All I had to do to regain full connectivity was delete this file (backed it up of course) and reboot the machine! NOTHING ELSE WORKED. This fix worked first time. HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE...\n\nA: I had the same lost internet problem when upgrading to Sierra.

Then added a DNS server in the Network Prefs and did a terminal check with  cat /etc/resolv.conf  and Bingo!  everything checked out.  \nBooted Safari and was online for the first time in days.

Click Preferences... in the pop-up menu. In the pop-up window, click Accounts then change Full Name to how you'd like your name to appear.\nThis will change the name that appears on emails you send through the iCloud.com website and the Mail app on OS X. If you are using another desktop mail client, you will need to configure that separately.\n\n\nA: As of OS X 10.9.5, this can no longer be done through the Apple Mail on your desktop.

If I tried changing the display name in the mail app, the settings popup would just hang.  I had to force quit the mail app. \n\n\n*\n\n*applied.apple.com was correct\n\n*icloud.com email settings was correct\n\n\nIn fact, if I changed the name in applied.apple.com, it would show the change in the mac iCloud preferences but still not in the mail app.\nTo fix the issue, I had to delete the mail account, which, since it was the iCloud account, had to delete the iCloud account in preferences.  After that was done, I re-added the mail account in the mail app which added the account in preferences and re-copied all mail/docs/reminders/etc and synced everything back again.  Only this time the display name in the mail app was correct.  And now new email has the right display name.\nNow in the mail app accounts, the display name is grayed out whereas before, it would let me type over it even if it wouldn't actually save the changes.  Now if I change the display name at applied.apple.com, it shows in the mail app account.\n\nA: Changing my name in my iCloud account didn't fix the problem for me as it still read incorrectly via email. I actually had to change it on my phone:\nSettings > iCloud > Mail and change the name.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Changing my name in the methods mentioned above did not solve the problem. Emails would still be sent with the old name but only from devices where I had set up with the old name.\nThe solution was to go to Settings > [Your Apple ID] > iCloud Mail.\nYou'll notice you still have the old name under the \"ICLOUD ACCOUNT INFORMATION\" section.

I'm running heavy virtual envs. on my macbook, and my current 8gb ram is way not enough.\n\nA: Realistically the speed difference between 1866 and 2133 isn't going to make a significant impact on your overall system speed. It's a 266MHz difference but this does not affect overall performance in the same way a 266MHz CPU speed bump would.\nYou say you are running virtualised environments, so upgrading to 16GB - whatever the RAM speed - will have more of an impact than the RAM speed itself.\nIf you're looking for the maximum performance from your setup you do really need to be running an SSD in addition to the 16GB RAM, if you're not already.\n", "Q: Disk Utility message \"Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required\" Finder crashed on a external drive which caused an abrupt eject.

If you don't use it I'd remove it completely. If you do use it, I'd remove it and reinstall it.\nGiven that the problem only appears within your own account I'd focus first on the items that are set to run within your own account rather than things that run under all accounts. One that stands out is AirServer. That could be something that is loading into the WindowServer and resulting in these CGContextErase messages across all applications. I'd recommend removing that and seeing if the messages cease.\nIf that doesn't resolve the problem I'd try removing other extensions, one or a few at a time, until you find the culprit. Starting with the ones you don't need or ones that hook into the system in a significant way (Default Folder X is another example). Given that you don't see the problem in another account, you could also try running EtreCheck under another account and comparing the two results.\nSomething else that might help locate the culprit is selecting one of the affected processes in Activity Monitor, then clicking on the Info button and selecting the \"Open files and ports\" tab.

I complete everything as on my previous iPhone, but there is no 'done' button.  Checked online and it says to press 'add' once complete.\nI do this, but then the whole entry is lost without saving. What do I have to do to persist my appointments?\n\nA: You may be inadvertently saving the event to the wrong calendar. Often email accounts, such as Gmail automatically enable a calendar when being set up. If the event shows up only on your iPhone, and nowhere else, chances are your default calendar is set to something that you are not used to checking.\nWhen you create an event, scroll down to where you can see the menu item \"Calendar\". Tap that, and choose one of your iCloud calendars. If the event then shows up on iCloud, and your computer, you have chosen the correct calendar.\nIf this is case, you will probably want to change your default calendar by opening your Settings.app, scrolling down and selecting \"Mail, Contacts, and Calendar\". At the bottom of this screen is a section titled \"Calendars\". Change the \"Default Calendar\" to reflect the one that worked correctly.\nhere\n\nA: When you create a new event, scroll down half way through the field and you will find a field called \"Calendar\". Tap this to find out which calendar your events are being written to.\nThen back at the main screen click on \"Calendar\" at the centre of the bottom bar. This will take you to a list of all your calendars where you can choose which calendar you want to show or hide. My guess is that the calendar you are writing your events to is hidden. Just tap the calendar(s) you want to appear or click \"Show All Calendars\" near the top of the screen to show them all.\nYou can change which calendar is the default by going into Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Then in the Calendars section, tap Default Calendar, then select a new default calendar.\n\nA: You must have the desired calendar checked in the calendars list (center bottom of day). Even if you only have one calendar, this is not checked by default.\n", "Q: How to identify file type for a bulk lot of files and attach suitable extension to each I have just over a thousand (1000) files whose suffix/extension has been changed by a database engine all to the same thing (eg. fileName.abcd where .abcd is on every file regardless of whether it is a jpg, pdf, or whatever else).\nThe goal is to convert all the files to PDF but I first just want to sort the various file types into separate folders.\nI use Mac OS X and figure that there must be a Terminal script that would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Identify the file (Perhaps with 'File' command?) and then...\n\n*Append the appropriate extension which would then...\n\n*Allow me to manually sort and place them into seperate folders for further processing depending on their file type.\n\n\nUsing the Terminal 'File' command on a file with the database suffix, typical results are quite wordy like this, which at least shows the Mac can identify the file types even though they have the 'wrong' suffixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01\n\n*PDF document, version 1.3\n\n*Rich Text Format data, version 1, ANSI\n\n*etc.\n\n\nSo, I only need a script that would tag the files so I can use Automator to rename the files later with the appropriate suffix.\nI note that if in Terminal I type 'File' and after that I drop or copy multiple files on to it, and hit return, then Terminal correctly identifies them all in the same order, but it isn't useful unless it at least tags each file type differently.\nI figure this initial task is too difficult for Automator but would love to be proven wrong.\nAny assistance in doing this would be appreciated.

I erased my MacBook Air hard drive - which came with Yosemite OS X - because I wanted to roll back to Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8), since Yosemite was giving me problems with my files from the previous MacBook Pro.\nI deleted the drive using Disk Utility. While partitioning, I forgot to make a GUID partition table. I tried installing Mac OS X on an USB-stick. It's not showing my drive, but just my USB Mac OS X installer. When I click on it, it shows the stop sign.\nHow can install Mac OS X without using the Internet Recovery for Yosemite \n\nA: If you're trying to boot from a USB OS X installer and it shows up as a bootable device but then proceeds to show the stop sign and halt, this indicates the installer will not run on your Mac as your system is unsupported by the startup files on the installer.\nAs klanomath points out, if it shipped with Yosemite it's unlikely to support Mountain Lion. Your Mac may support Mavericks (which is more akin to ML than Yosemite) depending on the model family - and obviously also depending on whether you can get hold of the installer for 10.9. If you can get hold of a fresh copy of the 10.9 installer from Apple this will be the last iteration, 10.9.5. Importantly, this last version will boot all Mavericks-capable Macs up to and including all 2014 models. If this includes yours then Mavericks should install as long as it's 10.9.4 or later.\nYour existing drive won't show at this stage as it doesn't have an OS X installation to boot from, even if it's correctly partitioned. \n", "Q: How do WWDC presenters paste text during demos? During demos in the WWDC videos, the presenter will often paste code into Xcode to save having to type it in. How are they pasting each different snippet without switching to another app to copy it?\n\nA: Apple used custom code called \"Demo Monkey\" whose source code is available on GitHub.\n\nA: You can create custom Xcode snippets. Snippets can include from one method to whole program.\nCheck this article on NSHipster, for me is one of the best explanations of this that I found.\n\nA: They could be using an app that binds keyboard shortcuts to multiple clipboards, such as CopyClip.\n", "Q: websites don't open on a specific wifi connection (probably DNS issue) I have a cable broadband which works flawlessly; I am using the same to ask this question from my Android. \nBut it doesn't work on my MacBook (10.10.2). \nBasically, no websites open, although I can ping all the websites, sometimes Google websites open fine, but that too only in Chrome (not in the incognito mode though). \n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried Safari, it had the same problem. \n\n*I have tried removing and adding the wifi connection. \n\n*I have tried flushing the unicast and multicast DNS cache with the recommended commands. \n\n*I have tried adding Google & OpenDNS servers to network settings for this wifi connection.\n\n*I have verified that the wifi connection works fine on Windows and Android devices. \n\n*I have reset the wifi router. \n\n*I have verified that the MacBook works fine with all other wifi and other kinds of internet connections. \n\n*I have tried connecting the MacBook to hotspot (Bluetooth) with Android, but still the websites don't open. \n\n\nAny help will be truly appreciated, but please, don't suggest things I've already tried. \nUpdate:\nThis gets fixed when I cold restart the MacBook. Also, to clarify, all other internet services work fine e.g. Skype, Dropbox, Box apps seem to work. So, it is probably something to do with the DNS, as pointed out by Buscar웃 too.\nI use DHCP with this wifi connection. The network settings show several DNS servers automatically populated by DHCP. I can override them though, by adding new DNS servers, but still the problem persists (as I mentioned above in point 4).\n\n\nA: Some users have reported similar problems with 10.10.2\nLooking true you attempts, I would suggest following additional steps.\nReset WiFi settings:\nTurn Off Wi-Fi from the Wireless menu item\nFrom the OS X Finder, hit Command+Shift+G and Copy/Paste the following path:\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/\n\nSelect following files: \ncom.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n com.apple.network.identification.plist\ncom.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist \nNetworkInterfaces.plist \npreferences.plist\nand move them to Desktop (do not delete for now). This forces OS X to recreate all network configuration files. \nRestart WiFi and check.\nSolution 2:\nIf your Ping works (your WiFi connection is fine), then check and modify your DNS server (responsible to connect you to the right website). I would add Google DNS in system preferences- Network -Advanced -DNS and it is the 8.8.8.8\n\nA: Try going to wifi icon, open network preferences, check ask to join new networks.

The battery recently failed and, using only the power adapter, with the battery removed, the status bar gets stuck at 50%.\nIs it only a battery issue, or is this a different problem?\n\nA: Follow those instructions for single-user-mode, then when you are done, type \"exit\" and copy some of the first few lines of the output - on paper if you need to. I'm mentioning this because I skipped the exit step a few times, but more interesting things might come up there. When I brought the lines with me and showed them to the Apple tech (genius) he recognized them right away and knew what had to be done (clean OS install). Back up what you can and what you know is good; my hard drives were fine, but I didn't want whatever was causing the problem.\n\nA: Yosemite startup hanging at 50% is something we've seen a good few times, and a couple of users got so fed up with it being a recurring issue they asked for a roll-back to Mavericks. \nThe first thing to try is boot into single-user mode (Command + s at startup) and run a disk check with the command /sbin/fsck -fy. Once that's done try starting in Safe Boot mode (hold Shift at startup). Hopefully you'll get a successful boot by this point, but there have been a few occasions when only DiskWarrior could restore normal operation.\n", "Q: Can I use a large external hard drive both as installation media and backup drive? I am planning to upgrade my Mid 2010 13\" Macbook Pro to Yosemite from Snow Leopard, on a new SSD hard drive.\nBeing more experienced now with UNIX/Mac, I want to have a clean install to get rid of the beginner cruft I had built up. My idea of a backup is simply a basic copy/paste of my Home folder (about 130GB). Here's my plan:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Disk Utility, partition my new 500GB external hard drive into two parts. One for my Home folder backup, and the other for the installation media.\n\n*Copy my Home folder to the backup partition on the external hard drive.\n\n*Use createinstallmedia on the other partition. Tutorial here.\n\n*Install my new SSD.\n\n*Plug in my external hard drive. Hold down Option key when turning on the computer, and proceed from there.\n\n\nDoes that sound like a good plan? My apprehension is that the two-partition setup on my external hard drive might corrupt my backup data, given that I also set it up as a bootable installer media.\n\nA: I can speak from experience - I've got a 32GB USB drive, 8GB of which are a Yosemite installer and 24GB of which are normal storage. It works perfectly!\n", "Q: Unable to boot up my Mac. Getting a flashing folder with a question mark I currently own a 15 inch MacBook Pro with retina display model ( early 2013) . My Mac was working fine and all of a sudden my Mac won't boot up. I see a flashing folder with a question mark symbol on my screen.\nI took my Mac to a technician who diagnosed the issue and said flash disk has to be replaced. He said  \"Reseted SMC and PRAM. Still same issue. Tried to erase the SSD by booting with known good OS. still same issue. tried to erase the SSD using terminal mode same issue. tried to repair the SSD found not getting repaired. Reseated the SSD and tried to erase the SSD still not able to erase the SSD\".\nIs there any other way to fix this issue without replacing the SSD? \nOr could you suggest any other SSD for this model of Mac?\n\nA: Take a look at EveryMac's Retina MacBook Pro page here. There is valuable information regarding compatibility (or lack thereof) of SSDs between different models, options for 3rd-prty upgrade offerings and lots of stuff you generally need to know about SSDs for Retina models.\nDealing with your actual problem at hand, SSDs aren't difficult to test, and any decent technician should be able to diagnose the issue. If your technician says it's died then by all means get a second opinion but SSDs have the capacity to fail like any other electronic or mechanical component.\nIf you're an EU resident you may have a case for a free replacement from Apple as EU-wide consumer law forces companies to offer a 2-year minimum warranty period. Getting them to honour a warranty may not be easy but it's another option. You never know, you could get lucky and find someone sympathetic to your plight who's willing to swap out the defective SSD.\n\nA: The flashing folder with question mark means that it cannot find the OS to boot to.  When you boot from a CD/Flash/USB Device it means that your MacBook is still functioning and the problem is limited to the drive and its related subsystem.\nSo, you are down to two distinct components that could be the problem with your Macbook:  the SSD or the SATA controller.\nThe SATA controller is part of the whole logic board and cannot be individually replaced so if that is the problem, you will need a new logic board.\nWhat the tech is saying is a little \"half-arsed\" in my opinion.  He is basing his diagnosis on the fact it is the easiest thing to replace.  To know this for sure, he needs to swap out your existing SSD into a known working machine and/or a known working SSD into your machine.  That will tell you if it is your machine's logic board or its SSD.\nThrowing parts at a problem is just expensive and fool hardy.  Depending on the age of the MacBook and your AppleCare warranty, this all may be covered.  If not, it will be a moderate cost to replace the SSD (if possible) and almost monumental to replace the logic board.\nIf it is the SSD and it can be replaced, now would be a good time to upgrade to a larger size.  \n", "Q: Could the Java Updater (com.oracle.java.Java-Updater) be the source of all my kernel panics? In the past few months I've been getting more kernel panics than usual. This is on my late 2012 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 Mac Mini, running OS X Yosemite (OS X 10.2.2) with 16 GB of RAM. \nLooking at the console logs following the last panic, I can see that immediately before the crash, com.oracle.java.Java-Updater had been spamming my log. Here's a sample: \n3/20/15 11:58:45.317 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.oracle.java.Java-Updater[77795]) Could not find and/or execute program specified by service: 2: No such file or directory: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Resources/Java Updater.app/Contents/MacOS/Java Updater\n3/20/15 11:58:45.317 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.oracle.java.Java-Updater[77795]) Service setup event to handle failure and will not launch until it fires.\n3/20/15 11:58:45.321 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.oracle.java.Java-Updater[77796]) Could not find and/or execute program specified by service: 2: No such file or directory: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Resources/Java Updater.app/Contents/MacOS/Java Updater\n3/20/15 11:58:45.321 PM com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.oracle.java.Java-Updater[77796]) Service setup event to handle failure and will not launch until it fires.\n# CRASH HAPPENS HERE!!!\n3/20/15 11:58:46.037 PM sample[77799]: assertion failed: 14C109: libxpc.dylib + 75491 [876216DC-D5D3-381E-8AF9-49AE464E5107]: 0x8d\n3/20/15 11:58:46.037 PM sample[77799]: assertion failed: 14C109: libxpc.dylib + 34510 [876216DC-D5D3-381E-8AF9-49AE464E5107]: 0x8d\n3/20/15 11:58:46.065 PM sample[77799]: assertion failed: 14C109: libxpc.dylib + 34510 [876216DC-D5D3-381E-8AF9-49AE464E5107]: 0x8d\n3/20/15 11:58:47.076 PM sample[77799]: assertion failed: 14C109: libxpc.dylib + 34510 [876216DC-D5D3-381E-8AF9-49AE464E5107]: 0x8d\n3/20/15 11:59:17.000 PM bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1426910357 0\n3/21/15 12:00:33.000 AM syslogd[17]: Configuration Notice: ASL Module \"com.apple.AccountPolicyHelper\" claims selected messages.

I need Java for a few programs I run, so deleting it isn't an option, unfortunately. \n\nA: These message aren't being produced by Java. Launchd is part of OS X that manages scheduled jobs, amongst other things. The messages you are seeing here are launchd trying (unsuccessfully) to launch the Java Updater. It appears that the Java Updater is either partially or completely missing from your machine.\nIf you check the folder /Library/LaunchAgents/ on your Mac you should find a file called com.oracle.java.Java-Updater.plist. This file instructs launchd to run Java Updater once a week at a specific time.\nIf you need Java I would recommend uninstalling Java and then installing Java again from scratch. If you are using the Java Development Kit rather than the Java Runtime you can find uninstall instructions here and the install here.\nHaving said all this, I wouldn't expect this to cause kernel panics. This is simply a piece of software being repeatedly called to run and repeatedly failing. As klanomath mentioned you might want to check the kernel panic logs. You can find them in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports. They'll be called something like Kernel_DATE-TIME_COMPUTERNAME.panic.\n\nA: Looks like it.\nIt seems as if Java Updater is being called, but the executable isn't there. Perhaps you need to redownload Java, or find some other way to get the executable again.\n", "Q: Multiple Wi-Fi APs: Use same or different SSID? I have multiple Wi-Fi access points in my house. What's the best practice, should I use the same or different SSIDs?\nI currently have different SSIDs because I like to know which AP I'm logged in to. But handover takes ages. Would that work better/faster when using just a single SSID?\nMy clients are mostly iPhones and iPads and the APs are non-Apple (AVM Fritz!Box and Digitus).\n\nA: You can have the same SSID for multiple APs, this is how our campus network is set up, but there is a caveat that's worth knowing. When moving between APs we've noticed OS X has a tendency to \"stick\" to the first AP it has joined even if it's in the presence of another AP offering a stronger signal. Cycling the wi-fi can help with re-association to an AP with a stronger signal, but the fact is it doesn't always switchover automatically. Unlike Windows which allows you to tune the aggressiveness with which it searches for better APs, OS X offers no easy control over its wireless behaviour.\nThis may seem like a non-answer but you may find you have as many issues (albeit slightly different) with a single SSID when compared to a network with multiple SSIDs.\nMy advice would be to try it for yourself and see how it works for you. Be prepared for some experimentation with setting wireless power levels on your APs so you can have some overlap between APs, but not so much that OS X will doggedly stick to the first one it finds.\n\nA: I've changed the setup to use the same SSID for all APs and I observe much faster handover times, at least on my iOS devices. Haven't done yet any tests with Macs though.\nSo far I haven't reduced power levels as @ScunnerDarkly suggested because I'm satisfied with the results right now.\n\nA: It seems like you are pretty up on WiFi, so I won't go into all the inner workings.  However, you did mention that the \"handover takes ages.\"\nThe handover is handled by both the device AND a controller.  There is a setting (and generally not accessible by users) at what threshold the adapter begins looking for another good network.  It is taking ages because it takes that long for the signal to drop off.  Once it does, your device connects to next available, strongest network.\nSimply speaking, the controller helps with this process by monitoring signal strength of the connected device and then kicking off the low ones to force a rejoin.  \nSince those controllers cost mega $$$, it is much easier to just toggle Wi-Fi on/off.  Setting your AP SSID is now just a matter of preference.\n\nA: This Apple documentation (linked from this one) suggests, for a roaming network, to \"configure the Wireless Network Name, security, and password on each Wi-Fi base station to be exactly the same\".\n", "Q: Greek letter shortcuts in Keynote 6.5 I recently switched to Keynote for writing scientific talks. I use tons of greek letters and need a fast way to type them in. I have seen on other questions and forums that people just change the auto-correct settings to replace things like \\lambda with the Greek letter. However, in Keynote 6.5 I cant seem to find the auto-correct settings to do this. Its looks like they moved it out of the preferences menu. Anyone know where this is, or have another solution?\n\nA: Using the Keyboard System Preference, in combination with the Greek keyboard, I was able to get this to work.\nOpen System Preferences > Keyboard\nSelect the Keyboard tab and check Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar. The flag of your default language should now appear to the right of the Date/Time menu item.\nSelect the Input Sources tab > Add Greek keyboard\nSelect the Text tab > select then add \\lambda to the Replace field\nFrom the Character Viewer menu bar item, choose the Greek keyboard > Select the With field and type the 'l' key. This should insert the λ character in this field.\n\nFrom the Character ViewSwitch back to the default keyboard.\nNow, whenever you type \\lambda you will see this replacement pop-up:\n\nRepeat with other characters.\n\nA: Another way is to modify whichever of  /System/Library/Input\\ Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/PlugIns/PAH_Extension.appex/Contents/Resources/Keyboard*.plist your keyboard is using.  See also How to add characters to the press and hold character picker in OS X Lion?\nUnfortunately, this requires disabling SIP, and you should save a copy to install again every time an OS update cancels your changes.  I updated mine to allow me to easily do pīnyīn along with a few other Polish/greek/French characters.  But changing the one in /Library (not SIP-protected) didn't work, and the one in /System/Library was overwritten by the next O.S. update.\n", "Q: Need app to read Eudora mail (that mailbox file format) I was unable to successfully copy my 20 years of Eudora emails to Thunderbird.  The process is difficult to follow & just seems to hang.\nThere must be a simple app that will allow me to open a Eudora mailbox folder, and select an email from an index list, and read the contents.  Its just a \"flat file\" with a marker to separate each email.  And maybe a separate toc (table of contents) file with the header data and a pointer to the location in the flat file.\nAnd somebody please create the tag \"Eudora\"\n\nA: Please download Eudora Mailbox Cleaner, and install it.

Why is my Macbook Air MagSafe Pin becoming extremely hot? \nI fear that my laptop will burn out.\nCan anyone help me on this?\n\nA: This can happen when the MagSafe cable is failing, generally at the plug end. As the cable strands break down due to mechanical wear, the power being supplied has to be carried by fewer strands. These strands invariably begin to heat up and become oxidized, increasing resistance and therefore generate yet more heat. This is why your MagSafe is getting hot.\nIf you're handy with DIY, repairs to the MagSafe connector are possible (at least with the old white plastic MagSafe connectors). Another option is to crop off the old connector and splice on a replacement cable and connector - these can be found at the usual internet retailers. Finally, you could simply buy a replacement power supply.\nSadly, Apple show no sign of environmental responsibility with their designs and the MagSafe power supply is no exception. They can only be opened with brute force, invariably resulting in something that can no longer be regarded as \"safe\". You're lucky in that it looks like your cable has failed at the connector end, which can be replaced. It's just as common for Apple adapters to fail at the adapter end, which is almost always goodnight Vienna for the adapter.\n\nA: The previous answer doesn't explain why the same connector doesn't get hot with another laptop. So, the reason for this heat might be inside the connector on the I/O board of the computer. \n", "Q: How can I activate an iPhone 5s locked to another person's iCloud account? I bought a used iPhone 5s and unknowing to me it is locked to an iCloud account with a gmail address (p*****@gmail.com).

Please what can I do to activate it because i don't have a clue where the previous owner lives. Please help me because I used my savings to purchase the phone.\n\nA: Sorry but there isn't a way to remove the previous activation without the previous owners iCloud details. That would defeat the purpose of these anti-theft measures.\nApple provide instructions here on how to remove the activation lock. You will need to contact the previous owner. Please speak to whoever you bought the iPhone from.\n", "Q: How to disable spotlight for Alfred I use Alfred instead of spotlight but sometimes I accidentally press cmd + space( Spotlight Shortcut ) instead of double shift( Alfred Shortcut ). I want to disable Spotlight( shortcut + not run it in background as well )  so might not open it. Also, does Alfred use spotlight file indexing if yes then I might not want to disable that but if no I would like to disable that as well. \n\nA: In the \"System Preferences\" app select \"Spotlight\" from the top row. Now, uncheck the box titled \"Spotlight search keyboard shortcut:\"\nI set the Alfred keyboard shortcut to Command-Space, which works a bit like Alfred on stock Yosemite machines.\nIf you want to keep the ability to search Spotlight with a keyboard shortcut, you could also change the shortcut using the popup menu to the right of the checkbox.\n\n", "Q: Archive/set some photos in Photos.app not to be synced with iCloud Photo Library I want to use iCloud Photo Library just to get photos I take on my phone to my computer. My Photo Stream would work fine if it was reliable. Now I have more than 5GB of photos so I have to pay at least $1 a month just to sync photos unless there is a way to download only or archive some photos not to be synced with iCloud Photo Library (yet still viewable in the app).\n\nA: You can export original photos out of Photos on the Mac and then delete them.\nAt that point, they go into the Recently Deleted album. You can then manage things so you don't exceed your 5 GB allowance.\nBoth iOS and Mac preferences allow you to measure and see the storage allocation.\nThen you can have a second Photos database on the Mac to store all the \"offline\" photos. It won't be the \"system library\" and it won't receive photos automatically from the cloud. You'll have to import photos manually to that second (and all other) libraries.\n", "Q: How to set a Calendar alert for AFTER completion of an event? I would like to set calendar alerts to happen at the scheduled completion time of my events - whatever that may be.  I can't seem to figure out a way to do this.  You can create alarms that go off before an event starts, at the start time, or a fixed number of minutes after start time.  But is there a way to set an alarm that triggers AT OR AFTER the completion time of an event, without having to specify the exact date & time?\n\nA: Just enter an alert at a customized time (which is equal to end of the event).\nThis works for iCal 5 (Mac OS X 10.7):\n \nand also for iCal 7 (Mac OS X 10.9). It looks a bit different though:\n\n\nA: It seems possible now to add an additional alert and choose a time after the event's start time. So if you need to pickup your kids after a 2hr game, and it takes 20mins to get there, under custom alert choose 100 minutes after\n\n\nA: Well there doesn't appear to be any actual proper solution to this, so I have resorted to simply putting an alert in at the pre-set duration of the event.  Definitely not what I was hoping for but... it's the best that I could come up with.  This gets me an alert at the end of the time block, but unfortunately won't automatically adjust if I alter the duration of a block.\n", "Q: Unknown item \"Nike + ipod\" in Settings I wish to know what the purpose of item \"Nike + ipod\" is in the Settings app on my iPhone?\n\nA: It's ready for you to connect to a Nike exercise wristband.\nIt's a core structure & can't be deleted.

But not sure when this was made...\nEdit:\nIt says it is MacPro 1,1\n\nA: There is only one available 2.66 GHZ Quad-Core Intel Xeon Mac Pro, which actually is powered by two 2.66 GHz dual core Intel Xeon 5150 processors: MacPro1,1\nThe maximum OS is Mac OS X 10.7.5, if the RAM was upgraded to at least 2 GB.\n\nA: It is possible to upgraded a MacPro1,1 to Yosemite, but it is a bit of work and not perfect. You will have to add a third-party new boot loader software, and most likely upgrade the graphics card. A number of OS X -- mostly minor -- features will not be available.\nThis is almost like building a Hackintosh, but Apple will not consider you as violating OS X's license. \nFor full details see: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1740775\nRemember, the setup could break when ever you do a minor system update. So you would want to carefully research an upgrade from 10.10.1 to 10.10.2\n\nA: Your \"G5\" is actually a Mac Pro, judging from your serial number (VERY useful info, thanks) according to appleserialnumberinfo.com, link here.\nAssuming the info is correct, yes you can upgrade to the current OS X, Yosemite. The best way to check is to go to About This Mac from the Apple menu, and select the More Info option. In Hardware Overview you will find a model number. If yours is MacPro 3,1 then it will support Yosemite.\nBear in mind you'll want upwards of 4GB RAM (8GB or more, ideally) if you want to get the most out of both the hardware and OS.\nEdit - As klanomath points out, it looks like your Mac Pro is more likely to be a Mac Pro 1,1 - given the CPU configuration - and so your OS ceiling will be 10.7.5\n\nA: I don't have sufficient to add comment so I'll add an answer:\n\"OBS, Mac Pro\" on Apple's web site means it's the original Mac Pro released in 2006, this is the official name used by AppleCare and GSX.\nAs such, the officially supported OS X version for the Mac Pro is 10.7.5.\nUnofficially, this Mac Pro can be hacked to run later OS X given a proper graphic card upgrade.\n", "Q: Different Spotlight preferences per boot volume In my Mac Pro, I have two boot volumes — one stable with Mavericks and one for testing Yosemite.  When running Mavericks, I want Spotlight to ignore the entire Yosemite volume, and vice versa.  But Spotlight privacy preferences seem to be shared between the two systems.\n\nA: Spotlight indexing and searching (or the respective privacy setting) is volume based and not system based. So turning off Spotlight on one volume is enforced, whether you boot from one or the other system volume.\nSo the only possibility I see is the following solution:\nDon't mount the respective alternative volume while booted to one. Or mount it read only (Spotlight will not index it then, but will search it).\nExample (while booted to Mavericks):\ndiskutil info /Volumes/NameOfTheYosemiteVolume\n\nLocate the volume UUID, select and copy this number.\nOpen Terminal and run the following command to edit the \"fstab\" file (you will be prompted for your password):\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nThen add \nUUID=UUIDFoundAbove none hfs rw,noauto\n\nor\nUUID=UUIDFoundAbove none hfs ro,noauto\n\nor\nUUID=UUIDFoundAbove none hfs ro\n\nThe first of these will prevent the drive from being mounted, but if you do mount it using Disk Utility or another means, then the drive will be read and writable.\nThe second of these will prevent the drive from being mounted, but if you do mount it using Disk Utility or another means, then the drive will be read-only.\nThe third option will make the disk be treated as read-only, but it will still show up automatically in the Finder when you start your system.\nWhen finished with the edit, press ctrlo followed by Enter or y and Enter to save the changes, and then press ctrlx to exit the editor.\nTo undo these changes, simply run sudo nano /etc/fstab in the Terminal again to edit the fstab file, and delete the lines you added.\nAfterwards revert the Spotlight privacy settings to the default settings.\nThis should prevent the Yosemite volume being mounted after a restart.\nAs a result Spotlight shouldn't index or search the volume, if you have chosen one of the first two options.\nNow boot to the Yosemite volume and repeat all for the Mavericks volume.\nThe drawback of this solution is that you probably have to hit the alt/opt button while booting to select an alternative start-up volume, because the respective PrefPane shows only your current one.\n", "Q: 16G memory or an SSD to upgrade a Macbook? I'm deciding on whether to spend the money to upgrade my RAM or add an SSD to my Macbook Pro.  Here's the stats...\n\n\n*\n\n*Early 2011\n\n*MacBookPro8,1\n\n*i7 2.7Ghz\n\n*8G RAM\n\n*STBD1000400 Seagate Hybrid 1TB drive\n\n\nI could spend about $130 on either...\n\n\n*\n\n*16G RAM\n\n*250G Samsung EVO 850 SSD (replacing the DVD drive)\n\n\nThe machine is mostly used for coding, compiling, web browsing, watching movies and listening to music.  It is rarely CPU bound.  The OS and applications and home directories should fit easily into 250 gigs with my media going onto the 1TB drive.\nThoughts?\n\nA: I would go with the SSD.\nFirst you can check to see how much benefit you would get from upgrading the RAM. You can look at the Activity Monitor.app memory section. The last several versions of Mac OS X have a graph describing \"Memory Pressure\", which is a way of describing how hard you are pushing the RAM. The OS will naturally try to make use of ALL of the available RAM, so don't be surprised if you see that your are using it all up. What you want to note is if you have \"High\" memory pressure, this means that you could benefit from adding more RAM. \nModerate Memory pressure can often be just as well addressed with upgrading to a SSD to speed up swapping to disk. Low Memory pressure will mean that there is no significant benefit to adding RAM.\nThere are a number of downsides to adding RAM:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will double the amount of disk space used by swap files. \n\n*You will double the amount of disk space used when you put the system to sleep and the RAM is stored to disk. (This is in addition to the swap space) \n\n*You increase the time to put the system to sleep.\n\n*You will shorten the battery life, while the system is sleeping but still powering the RAM\nOn the SSD side, it is really all benefits. If you are RAM constrained SWAP is much faster. Everything that reads/writes to the drive will be much faster. Boot/wake times will be a fraction of the current times.\nThe only downside of SSD's is that when they fail, the usually fail catastrophically without warning or ability to recover. But that is why you have a backup.i\nFor myself, I have the same MacBookPro8,1 with an Intel i5 with a 500GB SSD and 16GB of RAM. I am a very heavy user of RAM for some of my development tasks. I would much rather be reduced on RAM than not have a SSD. Last year, I had to have the motherboard replaced and ended up using a MacBook Air with only 4GB RAM and an SSD for a week. I was actually impressed how well that MacBook Air stood up to what I threw at it even when the RAM pressure was getting fairly high, I am sure that I would not have felt the same about system with a spin disk hard drive. \n\nA: Agree.  SSD upgrade will make everything you do on that laptop faster.  More memory will only kick in as a boost from time to time.  If you do a lot of compiling, all those little include files will hit the SSD sweet spot and you'll feel like you have a new computer.\n", "Q: External Drive showing only in system profiler I have had a 1TB Western Digital Ultra external hard drive for nearly year.\nOut of nowhere it will not show in disk utility but it does show in system profiler. I have a Macbook pro mid 2012 running Yosemite 10.10.1\nI have of course tried searching myself but found no clear answers.\nI tried verifying the main disk and found nothing wrong. Other external drives work fine with this port and cable. Could it be a hard ware failure? Thanks for the support guys I'm just trying to identify possible causes.\nDetails given by system profiler:\nMy Passport 0741:\n\nProduct ID: 0x0741\nVendor ID:  0x1058  (Western Digital Technologies, Inc.)\nVersion:    10.22\nSerial Number:  575831314139335031333539\nSpeed:  Up to 5 Gb/sec\nManufacturer:   Western Digital\nLocation ID:    0x15200000 / 4\nCurrent Available (mA): 900\nCurrent Required (mA):  896\n\n\nA: If disk utility does not even see it the electronics in the drive may have failed. System Profiler may show a drive there but if disk utility cant access it, well... \"Houston we have a problem.\"\nIf it IS an external you could try unplugging any other USB devices and/or trying another USB port and possibly even a different USB cable. If you can easily open the case without voiding the warranty you could check cabling there as well. But that might be a waste of time. Drive enclosures are pretty reliable these days. \nFailing that you might try a 3rd party disk utility. But I am not sanguine about the prospects. If Disk Utility doesn't even see the drive there is a good possibility nothing else will. It may be time for a new drive.\n", "Q: How do I open a new Terminal window in the same directory as the current window When I have a Terminal window open, ⌘N opens a new one.\nIs there any way to get the current directory in the new window to automatically be the same as it was on the window where I pressed ⌘N?\n\nA: The problem is that Terminal doesn't know anything about what directory you're in.\nBut the shell does! So you can type:\nopen -a /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app .\n\nand it will open a new window on your current directory.\nIf you want to do this a lot, put the following in ~/.bashrc:\nalias openhere='open -a /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app .'\n\nThen, all you will have to type is openhere to do the same thing.\n\nA: In Zshell, I need to do both this setting\n\nand I need this in my .zshrc\n# http://superuser.com/a/315029/4952\n# Set Apple Terminal.app to resume directory... still necessary 2018-10-26\nif [[ $TERM_PROGRAM == \"Apple_Terminal\" ]] && [[ -z \"$INSIDE_EMACS\" ]] {\n  function chpwd {\n    local SEARCH=' '\n    local REPLACE='%20'\n    local PWD_URL=\"file://$HOSTNAME${PWD//$SEARCH/$REPLACE}\"\n    printf '\\e]7;%s\\a' \"$PWD_URL\"\n  }\n  chpwd\n}\n\nI've tried without one or the other to no avail.\n\nA: To accomplish this within a new window, go to Preferences within Terminal.app.\nWithin the General tab, you can adjust the behavior (you likely want to select Same Working Directory) for both new windows and new tabs.\n\n\nA: If you hit ⌘T in the Terminal, it will open another tab, which will be in the same directory as before :-).\nYou can easily switch between the tabs using keyboard shortcuts too like\n- ⌘-Shift-[ and ⌘-Shift-]\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: I cannot see a particular USB printer from AirPort Extreme I have an older AirPort Extreme (UFO, Version 5.7).\nI can connect an Epson MX330 printer to the USB port of the AirPort Extreme and it appears on the AirPort Utility \"Printers\" tab, and I can print to it.\nI can connect a Ricoh Aficio MP C4500 directly to a MacBook Pro (10.6.8) USB port, and it automagically downloaded and installed the driver and will print to the Ricoh.\nBut when I plug the Ricoh into the AirPort Extreme USB port, it does not show up on the AirPort Utility \"Printers\" tab, and of course, won't show up on any AirPort connected device, either.\nI have tried re-starting both the Ricoh and the AirPort Extreme while they were connected.\nAny clues on how I can get this $20,000 printer to work with AirPort Extreme like the Epson that came free with my MacBook Pro does?\n\nA: Plug it in via Ethernet, not USB.\nAny printer with built-in networking support (Ethernet or Wi-Fi) is best connected to the network via its network port. That's the most natural, best-supported, most reliable, most fully-featured way for your devices to discover and print to it.\nWhen base stations first supported USB printer sharing in 2003, it was kind of a hacky workaround for the printers of that time, which were often USB-only. It's still a hacky workaround today, but luckily most people don't need to use it anymore as most printers (even the free-after-rebate consumer models) added networking by about 2005.\n", "Q: I updated my phone using my husbands itunes acct. and now i've lost all of my contacts and pics and his are on my phone I updated my phone using my husbands itunes acct. and now  lost all of my pics and contacts and his are now on my phone.

I like a very lean Mail system and have been searching for a way to hide the Archive folder in Mail. Is this possible? If so, how?\n\nA: So here's kind of crappy workaround, but as for me it worth it. The solution requires one external useless email, say useless@mail.com, maybe fresh generated or some old one. \nStarting settings: You have several mail boxes that is shown in Archive parent mail box. So the Archive box shows as extendable one, e.g. with the arrow that allows to expand it to see included mail boxes.\n\n\n*\n\n*In some useful mail account, say useful@mail.com, in the web interface create some additional folder, like \"arch\" make sure that it available by imap.\n\n*In the \"System Settings\" -> \"Internet Accounts\" add some additional useless email account.\n\n*Check that it shows in mail.app\n\n*In the Mail \"Preferences\" -> Accounts -> useful@mail.com choose \"arch folder as the Archive one.\n\n*In that point you're should have extendable Archive folder in mail.app (like any other Folder which have subfolders).\n\n*Expand Archive folder to see what subfolders it have.\n\n*Select the one that are from useful account, hit right click and select \"delete mail box\". \n\n*After mail.app have been reload its state you should have non extendable Archive folder again. (If this is not true — make steps above till it will be). And the only one mail box in it is the useless one.\n\n*Completely delete useless mail account from system.\n\n*Restart mail.app and there's none Archive folder.\n\n\nA: Simple answer: you can't hide the Archive folder from within the UI, or by any other method so far as I can tell. I haven't poked around in any .plist files or anything, though. Perhaps a .plist spelunker has a handy trick.\n", "Q: MacBook keeps showing question mark on startup I am using MacBook 2010 with OS X 10.6.8. Today when I started my laptop it kept showing the Apple logo longer than expected. Then I read online to hold the shift key while booting. Doing that it started showing a folder icon with a question mark and it keeps showing untill the laptop gets shut down. Right now I don't have any disk utility tool either.\nHow do I solve my problem?\n\nA: Sounds like your hard disk could be on its way out.\nA folder icon with a question mark means that the Mac can not find a valid Operating System on the disk (or the OS which was on there has become corrupted).\nBooting with your finger on shift boots the Mac into, what is called, Safe Mode (or Safe Boot). That is to say no extra software is loaded at boot time, only the essentials, as well as some checks being performed. Quoting the Apple web site for Safe Mode:\n\nStarting up in Safe Mode does several things:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*It verifies your startup disk, and attempts to repair directory    issues if needed.\n  \n*Only required kernel extensions are loaded.\n  \n*All user installed fonts are disabled while you are in Safe Mode.\n  \n*Startup Items and Login Items are not opened during startup and login    on OS X v10.4 or later.\n  \n*In OS X 10.4 and later, font caches that are stored in    /Library/Caches/com.apple.ATS/uid/ are moved to the Trash (where uid\n  is a user ID number).\n  \n*In OS X v10.3.9 or earlier, Safe Mode opens only Apple-installed    startup items. These items are usually located in\n  /Library/StartupItems. These items are different from user-selected\n  account login items.\n  \n  \n  Together, these changes can help resolve or isolate certain issues on\n  your startup disk.\n\nYour best bet is to start your Mac using an install OS X CD (or USB stick) or an external disk drive containing another installation of Mac OS X, and run Disk Utility (or preferably Disk Doctor) from that and/or reinstall the OS. Better still, maybe seriously consider replacing the hard disk, if it is getting old, and failing.\nAlso, it maybe worth copying off any data that you require (or do not  wish to lose).  However, saying that, you can always use your [time machine] backup to recover any lost files. You have been making regular backups, haven't you?\n", "Q: iCloud photo sharing limit reached -- new photo app I'm running the 10.3 beta on my iMac, using the new photos app.  I imported about 1,300 pics I took over the weekend (live performance) and want to share them online with some people.  \nFirst thing I did was create three new albums, one for each of the performances, on my computer.

So why aren't the photos uploading, and is there a way to override this strange sharing limit?\n\n\nA: There are multiple absolute and rate limits on iCloud photos. See this article for details:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202299\nCurrently, if I had to guess, you hit one of the 24 hour limits and need do nothing but wait for the time to pass:\nMaximum combined number of photos and videos from all contributors per shared album, per hour: 1000\nMaximum combined number of photos and videos from all contributors per shared album, per day: 10,000\n\nHowever, if you continue to have issues or are getting multiple notifications like your screen shot indicates, there could be a fault in the waiting loop code and you'll want to reach out to AppleCare to have engineering look at your account in particular.

If the device isn't accepting the apple id password, try reseting it from iTunes too. iTunes is more reliable and you can reset without the device password (not the apple id password) on iTunes.\n", "Q: Remove table from a pages document I have added accidentally a table to my pages document on iCloud web interface.

The disk cache seems to be the cause. The command sudo purge only helps a little bit. In some older versions of OS X, my MacBook worked fine because it had (just) enough RAM for running Xcode (with big project) without constantly swapping.\nThis is the memory usage after compiling my project once. The memory usage of Xcode can grow few hundreds more MB after few hours of usage.\n\n\nA: This isn't directly answering your question since I don't know of a way to disable the file cache mechanism in OSX. That being said, I can't think of a good reason WHY you would want to do so in the first place? What makes you so sure it is because of the file cache?\nThe file cache is a dynamic thing in that it gets larger as you do more I/O with your disk, but gets purged and shrinks as soon as an application needs RAM to get something done. What lives in the file cache is copies of recently used files with the idea that if you need them again shortly thereafter, the I/O will be much faster since it is already in RAM. While this is similar to the RAM cache function of the older MacOS, the big difference here is that it is completely dynamic and grows to make use of unused RAM in your system and will shrink as soon as ANYTHING needs RAM. In other words, it isn't locking up your memory and shouldn't be the cause of any slowdowns on your Mac.\nThat all being said, there is somewhat of a balance between how OSX manages your RAM. I have seen that there are small delays as things go in/out of the \"compressed\" state and in general the idea is that once something is compressed, it will stay there until there is a real need otherwise. The bigger cause for a delay would be if you were using swap since that is the slowest form of memory, but your screenshot even indicates 0 bytes dedicated to swap. Compression and swapping aside, I wouldn't be surprised if there is some overhead and delay as a result of shuffling all this around when all of your RAM is being utilized. However, the question might be more around what applications are freezing up when you're in this situation. Perhaps even your disk is near capacity and you're rather experiencing the fact that HFS+ is much slower when the disk is near full?\nIn general, you might have some short term benefit from purging or disabling the file cache, but I would hazard a guess that it would actually degrade your performance since you wouldn't get the benefit of a filesystem cache.\n\nA: If sudo purge didn't help, try disabling dynamic pager, e.g.\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist\n\nWarning: This completely disables the Mac OS X paging ability, so use it only when you've huge amount of RAM, but your Mac is still using swap files. If your system has SIP protection, you'll have to disable it first (not recommended).\nYou can also remove swap files manually from /private/var/vm/, e.g.\nsudo rm -f /private/var/vm/swapfile*\n\nthen restart the computer.\nSource: Mac Virtual Memory – What it is, the Swap Location, and How to Disable Swap\n\nTo disable memory swapping completely, set vm_compressor to 1, e.g.\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"vm_compressor=2\"\n\nor set it to 4 to default, see the other values (from vm_pageout.h):\n#define VM_PAGER_DEFAULT                0x1 /* Use default pager. */\n#define VM_PAGER_COMPRESSOR_NO_SWAP         0x2 /* In-core compressor only. */\n#define VM_PAGER_COMPRESSOR_WITH_SWAP           0x4 /* In-core compressor + swap backend. */\n#define VM_PAGER_FREEZER_DEFAULT            0x8 /* Freezer backed by default pager.*/\n#define VM_PAGER_FREEZER_COMPRESSOR_NO_SWAP     0x10    /* Freezer backed by in-core compressor only i.e. frozen data remain in-core compressed.*/\n#define VM_PAGER_FREEZER_COMPRESSOR_WITH_SWAP       0x20    /* Freezer backed by in-core compressor with swap support too.*/\n\nTo check your current value, run:\nsysctl vm.compressor_mode\n\nTo back to normal, delete boot args by:\nsudo nvram -d boot-args\n\nrestart and reset your NVRAM.\nSee: vm_compressor=VM_PAGER_DEFAULT in Yosemite caused freeze when physical memory was full\n", "Q: What are the risks if you install an app that's not from the App Store? On my iPhone (iOS 8.2), I installed an app that wasn't coming from the App Store. I chose to trust it because a serious news website had spoke about it, but now I'm a little bit worried of what this app might have done.\nAre the apps like this one still prevented from accessing my personal content?\nCould they install anything without my authorization?\nNow that I've deleted it, is it okay or is there still a risk anyway? \n\nA: With the improved Masque attack, it is possible to perform many actions, including full kernel and user memoryspace traversal, which would include any sort of temporary or permanent backdoor against jailed iOS, including version 8.2 (i.e., this does not require a jailbroken device). When combined with a shim, this can be a devastating attack against other previously-installed apps, perhaps even without memoryspace access. Futher combined with OS X DLL hijacking (another new attack), things get really clever.\nToday, as of March 2015, nearly anything is possible. The entire security of the iOS platform has been undone due to Enterprise certificate attacks (i.e., improved Masque), repackaging apps (e.g., Theos), library shimming (i.e., the load operation), and lazy binding abuse. This could lead to function hooking on a jailed device, which could lead to subversion of many concepts, including subversion of the KeyChain, TouchID, and much more than forensics tools are currently capable of (even assuming a lockdown certificate is set and no recoverable lockdown cert or backup is possible on, say, jailed iPhone 6 with iOS 8.2).\n\nA: Apps not from the app store are not as safe but they still can't access any of your information without your consent. The chances they would install malware is slim because iPhones are very secure. Though it is less popular, side loading apps from your computer is a lot more risky as there are no checks in place to protect your phone. Once you have deleted the app you are definitely safe.\n", "Q: How to uninstall this blank icon? A few days ago I tried to uninstall an app and now it won't reinstall.

I have done something stupid and need help:\nI have 3 external drives attached to my Mac and in an attempt to make the partition names more meaningful, I renamed them using finder/get info. My user account was located on one of these drives, the other 2 are for TimeMachine. Now of course, I cannot access the user account because I forgot to change the path in System Preferences.\nBy starting in recovery mode I can see the disks, but Disk Utility does not appear to allow me to change the name. Worse still, I cannot remember what the name of my drive that contains the user account should be. I suspect it can be sorted out from the command line, but my skills do not extend that far.\nAny chance someone can provide some guidance on how to rename the partition and how to ensure the user account path matches.\n\nA: The fastest way to solve your problem is probably adjusting the path of your user directory in the yourusername.plist (assuming following current path of your user folder: \"/VolumeNameContainingYourUserFolder/Users/yourusername\"):\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery Mode.\n\n*Open Terminal.app in the menubar (Utilities -> Terminal)\n\n*Enter df to get the paths/names of your main system volume and the volume containing your user folder. You may have to move around with cd and check the content of folders with ls if you don't remember the full path of your user folder.\n\n*Change your working directory to the folder \"users\" deep inside /private:\ncd /Volumes/NameOfYourMainSystemVolume/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/\n\n\n*List the content of the folder:\nls\n\n\n*Locate your username.plist and convert it to xml:\nplutil -convert xml1 yourusername.plist\n\n\n*Then modify the file with vim* (please consult online resources how to work with vim first!)\nvim yourusername.plist\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Modify the string \n/Users/yourusername  \n\nor\n/Volumes/WrongVolumeNameContainingYourUserFolder/Users/yourusername\n\nto\n/Volumes/VolumeNameContainingYourUserFolder/Users/yourusername\n\nin the key \"home\" at line ~90.  \n\n*Save the changes and quit vim.\n\n\n*Convert the plist to the original binary format:\nplutil -convert binary1 yourusername.plist\n\n\n*enter exit and quit Terminal\n\n*Reboot to your main volume, log-in with your account.\nOptional: Enable the root user temporarily. Log-out of your user account and log-in with root.\nMake any necessary adjustments like renaming the volume containing your user folder (or other user folders) again and changing the path(s) to the user folder(s) of your main user (other users) in System Preferences accordingly.\nLog-out and log-in with your common user again. Finally disable root.\n\n*: It's much easier to use nano or pico instead of vim, which has two different modes: command mode and insert mode. While testing the solution in a Recovery HD of a virtual machine, i first tried nano yourusername.plist, then  pico yourusername.plist. Both commands gave me an error: Can't find nano/pico. So I decided to use vim, because I was too lazy to find out if nano or pico are present in the Recovery HD at all. You may try nano instead: Use it like an almost common text editor by moving around with the arrow keys and adding or deleting text as usual. After finishing your edit, hit ctrlo to write the changes to disk and ctrlx to exit nano.\n", "Q: Mac Pro won't start from DVD, crashes while trying I have a Mac Pro 10.6.8 which will not start.   \nI wanted to re-install my Mac Pro (Intel dual core 2.66) which is currently running Mac OS X 10.6.8.\nI inserted the retail Mac OS X 10.6 install disc, and held down the C key on my keyboard to boot the machine.\nThe disc can be heard spinning up, and the grey Apple logo appears. However, the Mac Pro crashes on start up from DVD, what can I do?\n\nA: Assuming your disc is clean and damage free it looks like your optical drive may be at fault. If your disc does have any obvious defects (check for scratches etc. on the label side, these can cause totally unrecoverable data loss) you know where the fault lies. Has the drive had any sort of regular use or is it a while since you used it?\nIf you have access to another Mac you will be able to copy the 10.6 DVD onto an 8GB USB stick using Disk Utility's Restore function, which will then boot the Mac - if the optical drive is at fault.\n", "Q: Confused by location of spinning circles on iphone6 I am trying to upload my entire iPhone 6 content to the icloud.

I am storing various passwords (e.g. for remote email servers) in my keychain.\nFrom the command line, when logged in locally, I can retrieve these via:\nsecurity unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\n<enter password>\nsecurity find-internet-password -s smtp.gmail.com -a foo@gmail.com\n<dumps keychain attributes, not including password>\nsecurity find-internet-password -s smtp.gmail.com -a foo@gmail.com -g\n<dumps keychain attributes, including password>\n\nHowever, the results cannot be achieved when run remotely (ssh'ing in to the\nbox from somewhere else):\nsecurity unlock-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain\n<enter password>\nsecurity find-internet-password -s smtp.gmail.com -a foo@gmail.com\n<dumps keychain attributes, not including password>\nsecurity find-internet-password -s smtp.gmail.com -a foo@gmail.com -g\n<nothing printed, to stdout or stderr>\n\nMoreover, the return value of the final command (using -g) is 36.\nI've dumped the output of set from a local login and compared it to a remote\none, and the missing environment variables are:\nApple_PubSub_Socket_Render\nGPG_AGENT_INFO\nSECURITYSESSIONID\nTERM_PROGRAM\nTERM_PROGRAM_VERSION\nTERM_SESSION_ID\nXPC_FLAGS\nXPC_SERVICE_NAME\n\nWhat am I missing?

It does not prompt for a password. It worked remotely.\nsecurity unlock-keychain -p \"enter password\"\n\nA: security -i unlock-keychain\nworks for me in MacOS 10.13.4 High Sierra.\nAfter investigating karthick's solution, I found this.  The -i makes the command interactive and prompts you in the terminal for your password.\n\nA: In reproducing this to investigate, I notice that I have my keychain configured to “Confirm before allowing access.” So when I perform the find-internet-password locally with the -g flag, I get a dialog box stating security wants to use your confidential information stored in “smtp.gmail.com” in your keychain. If I click “Allow” then it works, if I click “Deny” it fails similarly to the ssh case, with a return code of 51.\n\nWhen I try the command remotely via ssh, the -g immediately results in failure, with the status of 36 that you are reporting.\nI suspect that this is because, when you ssh in, there is no way for the system to pop up a dialog box allowing you to confirm that you want to allow the security command to access this information.\nI was able to get the command to work while connected by ssh by first clicking the “Always Allow” option when running the command locally. This updates the permissions in Keychain so that I no longer need to respond to the dialog (even locally), which allows it to work remotely too.\nI don’t know if this will be entirely helpful to you, however, as I think it means you will need to preemptively grant the security program access to any keychain items you may want to access remotely. It may be possible to write a script to do this?\nIf you are experimenting with this manually and later want to revoke this access, you can go to the affected item in Keychain Access, choose Get Info and look at the Access Control tab.

OS: OS X 10.10.3 (Yosemite)\nMachine: Macbook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012)\niPhone: 5s on 8.2 (12D508)\nSo I import all photos/videos off of my iPhone to Photos on a daily basis after upgrading from iPhoto and it works well overall, so far.\nThe problem is that, while Photos does give me the option to \"Delete items after import\", the option becomes greyed out after some imports and there are some items that get left behind on the iPhone (they are successfully imported but do not get deleted).\niPhoto would let me delete already-imported photos, but Photos does not. I also do not sync Photos using iTunes.\nI have two inconvenient workarounds to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all photos in Photos app, check \"Delete items after import\" and click \"Import Selected\" again. This may or may not create duplicates -- I'm not sure.\n\n*Manually delete each photo on my iPhone like a cave person\nSo my question is this-\nIs there a more automatic way to do this (without duplicates), since I'm doing it on a regular basis?\n\nA: I'd go for the 'not quite cave-man' approach - though still a bit manual...\n\n*\n\n*Launch Image Capture.\n\n\n*Plug in iDevice\n\n\n*Select any/all photos you wish to delete\n\n\n*The Delete button is at the bottom of the window [the 'no-entry' sign]\nAfter comments - the button is still there in Yosemite.\nUpdate Nov 2015 - the button is still there in El Capitan, though it is now black & white, not red.\nPicture updated to Image Capture 6.7 after further queries on the button not being there.\nUpdate July 2016, as people are still missing this bit...\nIf the Delete button doesn't appear, eject & re-plug the phone.\n\n\nA: i noticed that the 'delete upon import' option does not show when plugging in an iphone to a new computer for the first time. a simply eject and reopen seems to fix this\ni just ran into this problem with both my partner and i\n\nA: Your workaround #1 is probably simplest if the photos you’ve already imported are interspersed throughout your camera roll. Full instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Photos, check the “Delete items after import” box on the import page\n\n*Select all the photos in the Already imported section, and import them\n\n*Open the “Last Import” album, select all the items, and delete them\n\n\n\nIn step 2, you’re creating duplicates of all the previously imported items. In step 3, you are deleting all those duplicates. Meanwhile, step 2 deleted all the items off your iPhone.\nIf you don’t see the “Delete items after import” checkbox, refer to Austin’s advice to unplug/replug your device, or restart the app. Also this answer only applies if you do not use iCloud Photos - I don’t know what the particulars are, but it sounds like using that service complicates matters.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s, iOS 8.2, Fingerprint sensor is suddenly not working. I have the iPhone 5s with iOS 8.2, and the fingerprint sensor suddenly stopped working.

I thought it wasn't working as well. Took 4 times to finally set it up after upgrade. Realized it was just realllllly delayed. If you hold your finger longer it will unlock, etc. it's prob a bug I'd imagine and hope it will be resolved in 8.3 when it comes out in April. Cross your fingers. In the meantime don't give up on trying to set it up again. Just go slow with the setup and it dies take a while but it should work eventually.

And people always get my mail from that one account no matter what I set in the From field when writing. Do you have any ideas what is wrong, what should I do? By the way, I'm using Yosemite OS.\n\nA: Solving this could actually be as simple as changing one of the preferences: \nApple mail > preferences > composing\n..check if \"Send new messages from\" is set to \"Account of selected mailbox\"\n\n", "Q: How to decrease trackpad tracking speed on demand? I'm using separate magic trackpad and (still, but that's not a requirement) Mac OS 10.9.5. I'm looking for some convenient and free way to decrease tracking speed on demand, for example via additional gesture or a keystroke. \nI'm a developer, so, quite often I need to precisely move cursor one-two pixels aside while inspecting layouts, picking colors, moving panels here there and currently with magic trackpad that's terrible. \nOne of good options I'm looking looks like this: scrolling while holding a key produces slow and precise mouse pointer movement.\nTried to search, but not very successfully:\n\n\n*\n\n*MagicPrefs: nothing like that, but, seems some plugin may achieve that.\n\n*SmoothMouse: nope.\n\n*SteerMouse: paid, does not support Apple Magic Trackpad.\n\n*ControllerMate: paid, looks like this is what I need, but I didn't manage to achieve what I want (too much time spent).\n\n*iMouseFix: nope.\n\n\nAs an option I could make some script up and bind it to the keys, which will change tracking speed or an entire app, but I'm not sure about that and consider that as a last resort. Don't like additional mouse option for precise movements, also I rarely use macbook's built-in trackpad, so I need something universal.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool is the free tool of your choice:\nWith a simple modifier key you may decrease or increase tracking speed temporarily after configuring the different speeds:\n\nTo toggle cursor speed, create a new gesture (optional with a modifier key) or a keyboard shortcut (no screenshot here - just choose the keyboard menu instead of the trackpad menu) and choose the predefined action -> Other Mouse Actions -> Toggle Mouse Speed. \n\nI don't own a Magic Trackpad but this works at least with my MacBook Pro trackpad.\n", "Q: Can't add a new ID to Volume Purchase Program Customers I have an app that I sell using Apple B2B / VPP. When logging into iTunes connect to add a new Apple ID (for a new customer) I am finding that clicking \"Add Apple Id\" is doing nothing (e.g. the page reloads, but I can't add a new Id).\nPresumably this is just a short term issue with the iTunes connect website? (I've been having the problem since yesterday). \nI've tried using Firefox, Safari, and Chrome; and connected on a few different networks to rule out my router.\nIs anyone else seeing the same issue?\n\nA: Apple website is broken and has been since 3/13.  I opened case#769729461 for this.

My use case is to record myself playing guitar from two angles simultaneously.\n\nA: You can use Livestream app for OS X and iOS.\nThere are maybe standalone apps, but I figured out fairly simple way to do this.\nThe setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Mac will be handling the image processing using Livestream's Producer app\n\n*Your iPad will be just sending video to your Mac throught Livestream's App for iOS.\n\n*Start the stream on your iPad\n\n*Open your iPad's stream in browser on your Mac (and make it fullscreen and mute audio)\n\n*Start stream on your Mac.\n\n\nYou will have nice ability to choose source of video - Webcam or ScreenShare (in this case your iPad stream) or both using 2D or 3D effect as show on the image bellow.\n\nP.S.

I am experiencing a massive memory leak in Mac OS X 10.10.2 (14C2513). I have 16 GB of RAM and the used memory rise to circa 15 GB in ~3 hours. Top applications usage is relatively low, circa 200 MB per application (10 top applications).\nI solved it only shutting down the system.\nIs there any update for this?\n\nA: OS X (and all modern operating systems) is designed to use all of the memory that's available, for file caches if it has no better use for it. That's not a problem, since memory used for file caches is still available for applications to use.\n", "Q: How do I force macOS to always save file extension? When saving a file without an extension not even OS X is able to open that file anymore. Still it is very easy to accidentally save a file without an extension.\nExample: When using Firefox and you save an image with the \"Save image as...\" context menu, the whole filename including the extension is marked for renaming and as soon as I entered a custom name the extension is gone and I have to reenter it.\n\nHow do I solve this problem?\n\nA: Apparently this is the way Firefox handles the \"Save as...\" action. When using Chrome or Safari  there is no issue.\nThere is a bug report since 2008, but the status is still 'NEW'.\nThe only solution I see at the moment is to select the name (unnamed.png) and only edit that part in the text area.\n\nA: You can hide common filename extensions, so in the save dialog no filename extension will be shown.\nIn a finder window, open preferences from Finder menu. Uncheck Show all filename extensions.\n\nA: Another option...\nWhere the option exists to Save As you can always drag images directly to your desktop, or to a folder on your dock (assuming Firefox isn't running fullscreen). The dragged files are saved complete with their file extensions. This would offer an immediate workaround to your problem until Firefox's save behaviour is corrected, assuming the devs ever get around to fixing it...\n\nA: Sadly in my opinion Apple went a little too far the other direction on this. When I try to save a .img file from a website, if I have \"Show all file extensions\" turned off in Finder> Preferences> Advanced, then it automatically renames the file with a .dmg extension, which is NOT the same thing and most applications that work with .img files don't understand or allow selecting a .dmg file in their file browser.\nLuckily the fix is simply to check the box for \"Show all file extensions\" and then just make sure you don't remove an existing extension when downloading from a website, if a download doesn't have an extension, you can add .pdf as the Preview application can handle almost every type of text/image/pdf/video out there, and if it can't, then you probably need to use a command line tool like file to guess at the type of file it REALLY is. file --help in Terminal will get you started.\nOne thing to note is that file extensions are primarily for humans, computers can use \"magic\" file headers or a mime type examination to figure out what program can handle a file, but humans think we know best, which is why we want to manage or override \"file handlers\", but often things \"just work\" if we don't go messing with them too much.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make iTunes write rating on the file itself? I'm on Yosemite (10.10.2) and using iTunes (12.1.0.50).\nI read that iTunes saves the rating of the songs on its own database, not the audio files tags themselves. Is there a way to make iTunes to write the ratings on the files? Because if I move the audio file to any other place, the rating won't be recognized.\n\nA: If anyone else needs something like this I wrote a quick piece of code using Qt 5.4 and taglib 1.14.0 that reads the iTunes database and writes the play count and rating into each mp3 file. You'll have to build it yourself or download the binary; it seems to work for me: https://github.com/carlonluca/ITunesEmbed. Backup your library before using it.\n\nA: I would say it simply can't be done.\nYate Music Tagger [$20] is about the most comprehensive in- & out-iTunes database cataloguer I know & even that can't do it. It can carry the tags, but not in the tune file itself, it uses a separate CSV.\nIf you need tag portability, it might be the tool for you, though, as it can carry the data between different iTunes & phones.\nInfo at https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Yate_Music_Tagger\nhomepage at http://2manyrobots.com/yate/\n", "Q: Is there a way to send Google Notifications to the Mac OS X Notification Center or to Growl? Is there a way to send Google Chrome Notifications (you know that annoying little bell in the menu bar) to the OS X Notification Center? Instead of receiving notifications in different positions and styles (native OS X Notifications, Growl, Chrome Notifications), I would like to see them in one place - the OS X Notification Center.\nIs there an easy way to configure this, or a tool that can help with doing this?\nUpdate\nI've found Hiss, which allows to send Growl messages to the OS X Notification Center, which is great, since it minimizes the number of notification styles.\nIn addition to the question above, is there a way to send Chrome Notifications to Growl? That might allow to use Hiss to finally route them to the OS X Notification Center.\n\nA: On Chrome 57 for the Mac, go to chrome://flags/ and find the Native Notifications settings, enable them and restart Chrome.\n", "Q: Is there a Byte-By-Byte Duplicate File Removal app for Mac? (not SHA-1 or MD5 hash!) I recently switched to Mac and spent way too many hours on PC trying every duplicate removal app, eventually discovering that byte-by-byte checking was necessary to get accurate (safe) results, and finally then settling on AllDup as the best app for this purpose. \nMac options seem more limited and I have not found any that do byte-by-byte checking, they don't even necessarily state on their website what algorithm(s) they use! Any tips? Must also work on Yosemite. \n\nA: You could do worse than to try dupeGuru, available from Hardcoded Software, I've had very good results with it. It presents numerous options for fine-tuning your search and will perform byte-checking comparisons.\nIn addition to the standard dupeGuru there is a music edition as well as a picture edition for more specific media searches. It's free so give it a go with some test files and see what mileage you get.\n\nA: Try to instal this one https://www.cleverfiles.com/duplicate-file-finder-remover.html\nIt's a good freeware alternative to some paid programs. \nThis app scans your Mac for all kinds of duplicates and does this really fast. It also features flexible auto-selection rules, so you won't need to scoop through the duplicates manually.\n\nA: I think the duplicate finder Gemini 2 is such an app you are finding, it can find duplicate files by contents(byte-by-byte checking) and file name, it even can sort out the similar photos in your photo library. Works quite well for me so far, you are going to give it a try.\n", "Q: Can't Add Printer with lpadmin I am trying to add a Pharos printer to a Mac, running Yosemite, and the command isn't working. The problem is that the printer queue has a space in the name. The genius that set it up didn't think that would ever be a problem. The command is:\nlpadmin -p \"Pharos Printer\" -E -D \"Pharos Printer\" -P PHAROS_PRINTER.PPD -v popup://pharos.domain.com/Pharos%20Printer\n\n%20 and quotes, or a combination of the two haven't worked yet. Anything else I can try? The above command works on printer queues that do not have spaces in their names.\n\nA: I know that in the Terminal, you can escape the space using the \\ character. So, what I would write is: Pharos\\ Printer.\nThat way Terminal knows that a space character is incoming.\n", "Q: Enable horizontal scroll for TextEdit in Yosemite (Mac OS X 10.10.2) Is enabling horizontal scroll for TextEdit (for Mac OS X 10.10.2) possible?\nAfter going to Preferences and checking or unchecking the box labeled \"Wrap to page\", the text still wraps to the next line once it reaches the end of the TextEdit window.\nWasn't horizontal scrolling possible in previous versions of Mac OS X? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.\n\nA: TextEdit doesn't work based on a page format. Since it doesn't know how wide your page is, it can't know when to wrap. You'll have to rely on something like Pages if you want to create a document based on a specific page format.\n\nA: In TextEdit, the \"opposite\" of 'Wrap to Page' is Wrap to Window'\nIt's never done text that extends beyond the visible area, left to right -\nfor that you need something like BBEdit, or its freeware little brother TextWrangler.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force clockwise pane rotation in iTerm2 with the shortcut keys? I've often found that when using iTerm2, I'll have like 3 or 4 panes open in one tab.  And the shortcut keys for moving between them Cmd + ] and Cmd + [ are very useful, but unpredictable.  The reason is because \"next\" and \"previous\" panes are determined by the order in which panes had last focus.  So if I have 4 panes open in a window shape, sometimes Cmd + [ may circle around them clockwise, sometimes counterclockwise, and sometimes neither.  And I can't remember which pane had the 3rd last focus.\nThe problem is correctable by simply clicking on each pane in clockwise order and then using the shortcut keys, but this is kind of annoying to have to do each time.\nIs there a setting where I can lock the shortcut keys into clockwise (and counterclockwise) rotation only?\n\nA: I posted about this on the Google Groups for iTerm2.  The program author has now added to the program the option to rotate clockwise.\n", "Q: How do I use Back to My Mac (to time capsule) in a multiple Airport configuration? I have an Airport Extreme with an attached USB drive that I've been accessing via Back to My Mac using these instructions (see the section with the text, \"...access files on a hard drive connected to an AirPort Extreme...\").\nRecently I extended (over Ethernet) my Airport network using an Airport Express upstairs. i.e.\nAirport Extreme with USB drive (downstairs) <--Ethernet--> Airport Express (upstairs)\n\nI used these instructions (see the first post by Bob Timmons) to extend my network.

I'm trying to find out what the \"Quick Website Search\" checkbox does technically. My guess is that it prefetches data or somehow sends my search terms to siri or another apple online processing engine, but I'm unable to locate specific documentation or files on the system that control/cache these search results.\n\nThe help page is vague about how this works in practice and I'd like to understand the mechanism a bit more finely grained than \"lets Safari record information\" and instead know where that information is stored and what \"searches within a website\" actually means in practice.\nAn answer for Safari on 10.10.2 would be ideal and a practical example of how it searches within apple.stackexchange.com (which is shown in my Manage Websites list of sites that are enabled).\n\nA: If you develop a website you can add a file called an OpenSearch specification that identifies the site as having searchable content.\nYou can see the apple.stackexchange.com OpenSearch specification here. The important bit is the following line that tells browsers the format for submitting search queries to the site.\n<Url type=\"text/html\" method=\"get\" template=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q={searchTerms}\"/>\n\nThe first time you visit a site with an OpenSearch specification Safari adds it to that list you can find under \"Manage Websites\". So if you start typing into the search bar something like \"apple chrome hanging\", Safari will see that you have apple.stackexchange.com in your list of quick searches and offer Search apple.stackexchange.com for \"chrome hanging\".\n\nNothing to do with Siri or Apple's servers. It all happens on your own machine. It's just a way to submit searches directly to other websites instead of having to open the particular site, click in their search field and type your query there.\nYou can find Safari's store of Quick Website Search information in /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Safari/SearchDescriptions.plist.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force OS X / Finder to use Windows File naming conventions? We have a number of Mac workstations (OS X Mavericks) which connect to a fiber attached SAN.  This SAN is also accessed by a number of Windows workstations.\nWindows file naming conventions (and path depth rules) are stricter than OS X's.  This means the Macs can cause problems for the Windows workstations if they name files or folders in ways which Windows doesn't understand.\nAs such, is there a way to enforce Windows file naming conventions on OS X?  Thus preventing the Mac clients from screwing up the Windows ones.  I'm thinking some kind of Finder plugin or script that prevents users from naming a file or folder in a way which Windows can't cope with.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: I'm not sure such a plugin exists, but A Better Finder Rename is a very powerful app which, in addition to a million and one ways to rename files, has a function to translate OS X filenames for Windows NTFS/SMB compatibility:\n\nI used it a few years ago to process ~35,000 PDF files made on a Mac, but which needed to be stored on a SMB server.

My first thought was BitTorrent Sync, but it seems it can't sync system folders. Is there any way to do this or I'm stuck with playing only on one device?\n\nA: You could install FTP on the device, and set up a AppleScript that copies the data from your iOS device every 15 minutes.

I have two MacBook Pro laptops, a 17-inch MBP and a 13-inch MBP. The 17-inch MBP is connected to an Elgato EyeTV HD Video Capture Recorder (and thence to a cable TV set top box). I use that to grab video off of my STB and to record live TV. The 13-inch MBP is my general purpose laptop, and I also want to use it for iOS and Android development.\nEventually I know I will get a RAID unit from Synology or a Drobo (in order to do automated redundant backups of the media on my 17-inch MBP and on the array of external HDDs that are connected to it), but not immediately since I'm trying to save money and pay down credit card debt, etc.\nMy question: without using sneakernet to copy the multi-gigabyte files over, or using remote control software like TeamViewer, or a LAN, is there a simple and cheap way to play back videos stored on my 17-inch MBP on my 13-inch MBP? Sort of like how you can use AirPlay or Google Chromecast to stream media from your phone to your TV or something?\n\nA: If the video is already recorded, you could just share the video folder with the other Mac. If you connect to the 17-inch MBP from your 13-inch and log in as the 17-inch MBP user, you can have access to all the users files. You can open the videos on the 13-inch MBP and play them in e.g. VLC player. Or you could share one folder only and set it to read only.\n\nA: Try VideoLAN, A/K/A VLC. It has video streaming capabilities and, best of all, is free!\n\"On Mac OS X 10.4 or later, VLC is able to grab video and audio from EyeTV applications and therefore all EyeTV-compatible capture devices. The user needs to install a plugin to EyeTV.app in order to use this feature. Guidance is provided in the User Interface.

How do you remove icons from the Menu bar?\nI'm running OS X Yosemite and I tried Command + Click + Drag to get rid of them but it isn't working. \n\nA: It depends which icons you are trying to remove. There are two types; software that uses the NSStatusItem API that Apple publicise for third party developers and software that uses their private undocumented NSMenuExta API.\nThe icons that represent operating system features can be removed by holding down the cmd ⌘ key and dragging them with the mouse. For example, the AirPlay, Time Machine, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi icons. These are implemented using NSMenuExtra.\nOther icons, the ones that represent applications you may need to close the application to remove. For example, Dropbox and Plex. Apple provide NSStatusItem for developers to implement them, but unfortunately it doesn't provide all the features of NSMenuExtra, for example dragging to uninstall is only available through NSMenuExtra.\n\nA: In a few cases, you can do this:    \nSystem Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items  \nIf the app that puts your troubling icon onto the menu bar is listed here, remove it.  Then logout & back in.\n\nA: I had the same problem where CMD+drag wouldn't remove an icon. I realized that Bartender app was causing this problem.\nFor anyone experiencing this issue (and using Bartender):\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Bartender \n\n*CMD + Drag any menu icon out of the menu\n\n*Re-open Bartender\n\n", "Q: Late 2011 MacBook Pro Cannot format HDD I have a Late 2011 MacBook Pro with 750GB HDD.

OS X: 10.9.5\n\nA: I had a very similar issue after replacing my LCD screen on a late 2012 iMac. Fan was running at high RPM and had high CPU Kernel_task usage. I narrowed it down to a Temperature sensor you must move from the old LCD screen to the new replacement screen. if you forget to do so the CPU speed and Kernel_task are affected slowing down your system.\n\nA: There are many things that go wrong with high kernel task usage. Usually this is related to faulty or heavy process which overusing system resources (such as indexing storage, running VMs, too many tabs in the web browser or some other background processes). \nHere are some methods which help to investigate OS X kernel usage issues:\nBasic methods\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Console.app and check on 'All Messages' to see if anything unusual currently is happening.\n\n*Use Activity Monitor to read system memory and determine how much CPU, RAM and Disk is being used.\nAlternatively run top in Terminal and hold Space to refresh - easier to find the cause problem (swapins/swapouts/disks?).\n\n*Run sudo fs_usage in Terminal to report system calls and page faults related to filesystem activity in real-time (I think this is the best option from all other). Then hit Control-C to stop it.\nAction: Consider killing apps which appears frequently on the list, but you're not using them.\nLearn more at: How do I debug an out-of-control “kernel_task” process?\n\n*Run sudo syscallbypid.d (or syscallbyproc.d), wait a bit, hit Control-C. Now check which process generated the most system calls in that given time (last column) and if you recognise it, consider kill it. If not, Google it and learn more about it.\nAdvanced methods\n\n\n*\n\n*Use sysdiagnose command (can be triggered by hitting Shift-Control-⌥-⌘-. (period) to quickly gather system-wide diagnostic information helpful in investigating system memory/performance issues (will appear in /var/tmp) either by you or Apple guys. During analysis, try to not do anything, when done - consider uncompressing the generated file and analyse the logs.\nSee: How do you get system diagnostic files from OS X?\n\n*Run footprint to gather detailed memory information on a per-VM-region type level and swapped bytes:\nsudo footprint -a\n\nOlder version:\nsudo footprint -all -categories -swapped -collapseSharing\n\n\n*Use spindump to profile entire system, it'll generate /tmp/spindump.txt file (including kernel and its extensions).\n\n*Use vm_stat to show virtual memory statistics. E.g.\nvm_stat 1 # to display every second.\n\n\n*Use zprint to check information about kernel usage, it's possible by:\nsudo zprint -t -s | head -n20\n\nIt'll show the most wasting kernel zones.\n\n*Use newproc.d to snoop new processes as they are executed, creatbyproc.d for files:\nsudo newproc.d\nsudo creatbyproc.d\n\nNote: On newer OS X (10.11 or above) this may not work when integrity protection is enabled (check by csrutil status). \n\n*Try sar - system activity reporter which can sample and report various cumulative statistic counters maintained by the operating system.\nFor more useful debugging tools, check for dtrace scripts (grep dtrace /usr/bin/*). If you know the faulty process which causing the problem, you may use dtruss to debug it.\n\nActions\nHere are some suggestions which can help you with the operating system issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Free up some inactive memory. In order to do this, you've to flush cache first and force disk cache to be purged:\nsync && sudo purge\n\n\nsync - force completion of pending disk writes (flush cache)\npurge - force disk cache to be purged (flushed and emptied)\n\nIts function is basically to terminate all the I/O pending operations which are using disk cache and then to free all the occupied disk cache, so it should free disk space to ease paging out and swapping out of main memory. It is safe to use, as it does not affect anonymous memory that has been allocated through malloc, vm_allocate, etc.\n\n*Use some 3rd party apps to clear up some overused memory such as iBoostUp, SystemPal, etc.\n\n*You may also disable temporary Spotlight:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist \n\nAnd consider other services by:\nsudo launchctl list | grep ^[0-9]\nsudo launchctl bslist | grep ^A\n\n\n*Quit your web browser and check if that helps. For example using Chrome is very resourceful, especially when there is some front-end processing going on in the background (e.g. Javascript) or advert-like animations are constantly rendering the content.\n", "Q: Mini Thunderbolt to VGA not showing video on external monitor but Mac says it is The external monitor used to be working before, but now, there's no video being sent. The monitor is sleeping when I connect, even though the mac says it's connected.\nI am using a SyncMaster390b as the monitor.\nI tried turning it on and off and reconnecting everything, but still no luck.\nAny help?\n\nA: The problem that you are facing is simple to fix. Actually there is no inbuilt Thunderbolt to VGA drive inside a MacBook/Mac mini. So what you should do is install a Mini DisplayPort to VGA Firmware Update v1.0. After installation restart the system, then connect your thunderbolt to VGA connector. It will work perfectly fine.\nHere is the link for the driver where you can download it:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL799?locale=en_US\n\nA: I'm guessing it's actually a mini-DisplayPort to VGA adapter you're using. Is it a 3rd-party item or genuine Apple? Either way it's quite common for these to be recognised by the host Mac and yet not output anything to the display. The reason for this is quite simple, mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort/DVI-D/HDMI connections are digital and pass straight through to the connected display, the only difference between them is the form factor of the connector. Mini-DisplayPort to VGA adapters have a digital to analogue converter in the main body, and while the host Mac may be able to communicate with the DAC (as it would if connected to a digital display) it will be unaware of any faults downstream of the DAC. If there is an issue with the DAC (or the post-DAC analogue section) the result is frequently that the Mac thinks a display is connected, and will show mirroring and extended desktop options in Display Preferences and yet output nothing to the display.\nGenuine Apple units are more reliable but more expensive. We've many (cheap) 3rd-party units around our campus, and we've had many fail after a few months, giving the same symptoms as you describe. Assuming you've checked the VGA cable is securely connected the other tests you can try are as follows...\nHook the display up to a Windows laptop if you can. Even relatively modern ones have a VGA connection. This will let you test the cable and display function.\nIf they both check out then you need to either try the adapter on a different Mac, or create an OS X installation on an external disk to make sure it's not your OS X install that's having issues. Having said that, it sounds like your Mac is correctly identifying and communicating with the adapter as you've already stated it thinks a monitor is connected.\nA quick look for your model didn't bring up any obvious results but many Samsung's have a DVI connection. If yours does, get a mini-DisplayPort to DVI adapter as they're far more reliable.\n\nA: Same issue... I have a SyncMaster 2232bw plus. used for about 1 year. one day the video just stopped beeing sent. first thing i did was to buy another mini display to vga adaptor. nothing happened. i have 2 macbook pros, one with mountain lion and a brand new with yosemite, none of them sending signal to the monitor. but when i connect it to my friends imac... it works perfectly. oh, and both macbooks recognize the monitor. \nI'm trying to find the monitor driver, but there are only windows versions.\n\nA: With all the research I have done and how many people are having this same issue (myself included), the problem is either with the Apples operating system or the Macbook Pro itself just do not detecting VGA connected monitors after sleep mode. The ONLY solution is to restart the computer and/or in my case what worked as well is to unplug the VGA to Thunderbolt, plug into my sons Macbook Air, then remove and replug into my Macbook Pro retina. \nMy DVI to HDMI works flawlessly but my second monitor (VGA to Thunderbolt) does not. As another test to prove my theory, I connected my sons second monitor with DVI to Thunderbolt and that too works flawlessly as a second monitor on my set-up...even after sleep mode over and over again.\nSolution is to not use VGA for MacBooks!

Apple DOS was written onto every floppy disk and took up about 10kb of RAM.\nSome trivia for your project: \n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple ]['s documentation included a fold-out circuit diagram of the computer's electronics. Just in case you needed to repair it.\n\n*The documentation also included the complete source code (6502 Assembler) of the operating system. Maybe 30 pages. Assembler at the time was a 1:1 representation of the machine code.\n\n*I wrote Apple (on paper - no internet back then) asking for the Integer BASIC source code for comparison. They wrote back and said they would be happy to send it, but they don't have a copy. Wozniak apparently wrote Integer BASIC himself, compiled it with a pencil and the Motorola 6502 data sheet, and typed in the resulting hexadecimal opcodes by hand. All bow to the Greatness of The Woz.\n", "Q: Change accessibility setting on Mac using terminal I would like to grant accessibility permission to some apps on Mac using Terminal as per this intruction\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202866 which is the accessibility tab in System Preferences\nOr this\nhttp://mizage.com/help/accessibility.html\nI would like to do that using Terminal so I can setup to install apps (i.e: BetterSnapTool) for many Mac at the same time, given I have admin privilege and this should be applied only on Mavericks and Yosemite\nDoes anyone know how to do this?\nThanks \n\nA: klanomath's answer looks good, but if you're like me and aren't as familiar with SQL, want more granular control (enabling/disabling individual apps instead of all at once), or want a clearer interface to work with, you should check out tccutil.py.\nUsing tccutil, the command you'd want to run to enable an app is\nsudo tccutil -e app.bundle.identifier\n\nFor example, if you wanted to enable BetterTouchTool, the command you would run is\nsudo tccutil -e com.hegenberg.BetterTouchTool\n\nI'm assuming that if you wanted to enable BetterSnapTool the last part would just be com.hegenberg.BetterSnapTool but I don't have that installed on my computer so I can't verify.\nYou can easily find the correct bundle identifier by running sudo tccutil -l after you've installed the app and it's asked for accessibility permissions (just look for the identifier that maps to the app you want to grant permissions to). If that doesn't quite work (like if the bundle identifier isn't what you expect it to be), you can find it by viewing the app bundle's contents, finding the Info.plist file, and finding the value for the CFBundleIdentifier key.\n\nA: EDIT: please note this stopped working in OS X 10.11 El Capitan (also see first comment here)\nThe accessibility permissions are stored in a sqlite database file at /Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db.\nSince sqlite3 is shipped by default with the later Mac OS X', use it to modify the settings.\nThe db scheme looks like this:\nsqlite> .schema\nCREATE TABLE access (service TEXT NOT NULL, client TEXT NOT NULL, client_type INTEGER NOT NULL, allowed INTEGER NOT NULL, prompt_count INTEGER NOT NULL, csreq BLOB, CONSTRAINT key PRIMARY KEY (service, client, client_type));\nCREATE TABLE access_overrides (service TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL);\nCREATE TABLE access_times (service TEXT NOT NULL, client TEXT NOT NULL, client_type INTEGER NOT NULL, last_used_time INTEGER NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT key PRIMARY KEY (service, client, client_type));\nCREATE TABLE admin (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, value INTEGER NOT NULL);\n\nThe relevant table name is \"access\" and the relevant field name is \"allowed\".\nIf allowed contains a \"1\" the app is granted permission to control the computer, if it contains a \"0\" the permission is not granted.\nWith the command\nsudo sqlite3 \"/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\" 'UPDATE access SET allowed = \"1\";'\n\nyou can toggle permission on for all apps listed.\nWith the command\nsudo sqlite3 \"/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\" 'UPDATE access SET allowed = \"0\";'\n\nyou can toggle permission off for all apps listed.\n", "Q: Log into the desktop remotely and automatically I have an OSX machine I'm trying to automatically run applications on remotely via SSH.  Everything works great, as long as the user is already logged into the computer.  If I log out, or reboot the computer, my application fails until I log in again.\nIs there any way to trigger a desktop login over SSH?  I'm looking to avoid needing to manually intervene via Remote Desktop and the like.  In case it matters, I'm running Mavericks presently, but will be upgrading to Yosemite soon.\nI could, in theory, configure it to login automatically at boot, but I'd prefer a scripted solution I can run, assuming such a thing is possible.\nI also found this article from 2005 suggesting this is possible with osascript, but it fails on Mavericks:\n$ osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"USERNAME\"'\n_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL.\n36:55: execution error: An error of type -10810 has occurred.

In the Finder windows, the iCloud Drive and Downloads icons are missing from my sidebar. I use CleanMyMac 2 could that have deleted the icons by mistake?\nI have rebooted the icons are still gone.\n![This is what it looks like.][1]\nYosemite 10.10.2 MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)\nHow can I get these icons back? Any idea what caused them to go away in the first place?\nUpdate:\nCan't I just drag the iCloud Drive icon into the info panel and change the icon like that? If so where can I find the original icon from?\n\nA: This generally happens when you've used a utility that changes your sidebar icons to colorized versions. iCloud Drive and Downloads do not use the standard icon format. These products are based on a SIMBL plugin called ColorfulSidebar that does not recognize the non-standard format. Even if you've changed the icons back to the non-colorized versions, the routine that changes the icons may still be running. You have to totally disable the software that colorized the icons.\n\nA: It looks like that you've used incompatible version of CleanMyMac 2.

I assume you are doing a BIOS boot for Windows. If you are doing an EFI boot, then this script will probably not work. BIOS booting is the traditional way that BootCamp installs Windows on Macs. I added an additional button to allow changing the default operating system to Windows.\nYou are aware that you can hold down the alt/option key at startup to select which operating system to boot to? I also assume, you know that the default boot operating system can be selected from the System Preferences in OS X and the Control Panel in Windows?\nYou can also install the free rEFInd boot manager.

To compile one file You don't need so much speed on one core.\n\nA: Something to consider here is that software builds are often I/O intensive rather than CPU intensive. Increasing disk speed or bus speed would help a bit here, but probably not significantly. The details, of course, would depend on the details of your project. Because disk I/O would be the bottleneck, I'm not sure if the distinction between higher clock speeds or more cores would be at all significant.\n", "Q: iMessages no longer mirrored on iPhone when phone is unavailable (and other device isn't) The usually behavior for iMessages has always been (or always seemed to be striving towards) to mirror messages, even after they have been received by another device.\nFor instance, if my Macbook is turned off, and I receive iMessages on my phone, those messages will then be added in bulk next time I turn my Macbook on.\nI like this behavior.\nHowever after a recent iOS update (I can't pinpoint which one), this behavior has stopped being the case on the iPhone.\nFor instance, when I go to sleep, I put my iPhone on airplane mode - but my Macbook stays on in my office. During my sleep, if it receives messages, these will never make it to my iPhone, even after it is taken off airplane mode. This contrasts with prior behavior (before, when I woke up and turned airplane mode off, I would receive all messages that had been sent while I was asleep).\nHas anybody notices this behavior? Is there something to do about it? If it's a bug, how I can best report it?\n\nA: I had the same problem of text messages which used to mirror on my MacBook suddenly stopped. Apparently, in a recent IOS update, they added the ability to turn this feature off. This worked for me: On your iPhone go to Settings:Messages:Text message forwarding and make sure your computer is listed and it's turned on.\n\nA: I've actually noticed the opposite until recently - I used to lose all 'backlog' if my phone couldn't receive the message at the appropriate moment (I even tried to work round it - How to tell Messages \"I'm not at home\"?) \nHowever, your issue is slightly different, you are intentionally 'removing' your phone from any possible reception for several hours.\nThat suggests an obvious workaround - use Do Not Disturb instead.\nThat way, all messages, phone calls etc would be 'seen' by your phone, but it wouldn't light, ring or buzz until you switched that back off again.\nI set mine to Do Not Disturb on a regular schedule every night - so I can read my book (on my phone, of course;) as I fall asleep, without messages bothering me until the morning.\nFull info & setup instructions - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Mid 2012 crashing after SSD upgrade I recently upgrade my MBP from mid 2012.

It has to do with TRIM technology, OS X, and MBP.  Your drive may not be fully compatible.\nMac Won't Boot - About Yosemite and 3rd Party SSD\nTo verify that your newly installed HDD works you can do two things:\n1)  Download, burn, and boot Ultimate Boot CD.  There are a number of HDD utilities you can run that will test out your drive for you.  Since you are no longer booting OS X when you boot this CD, you are bypassing any software issues you may be experiencing from Apple and OS X.  \nThere is a USB Flash Boot Drive option instead of a CD (I personally use this). \nThis will tell you if your drive is good and it is communicating with your hardware.  If it fails at any point, then it is a safe bet that you have a hardware issue.  If everything passes, it's on to step 2.\n2) Install a pervious version of OS X; Mavericks or Mountain Lion will do.  If your computer boots, then the problem lies with Yosemite and the compatibility with the new drive.\nDo a Time Machine Backup First  This way you can restore all your files after this procedure.\nDo a fresh install of ML or Mavericks.  Let it wipe and partition the drive.  If everything boots properly, you have narrowed down the problem to Yosemite.    Which means \na)  Yosemite isn't compatible with your drive\nb)  Your TRIM utility doesn't work.\nAt that point, you have two options:  downgrade to ML or Mavericks or get a new drive with TRIM and buy a USB enclosure and make this drive an external USB HDD.\n", "Q: Can't create kext cache under / - owner not root When I plug in my usb memory card reader nothing happens.

Why is “Spotlight Web Content” using so much (32.56 GB) virtual RAM and CPU (up to 122.41% apparently)? More interestingly, how can I prevent it from doing so?\nI am running this MacBook Pro with 4GB RAM and OS X 10.10.2 Yosemite.\nI found this in Acticvity Monitor when my Computer was close to not responding anymore and killing it solved that problem. It shows the process had quite a high number of errors, as well (27443815).\n\n\n\nA: The Spotlight Web Content process is part of Spotlight Suggestions. When you start to type in Spotlight or the Safari address bar, Apple sends what you are typing out to their servers to suggest possible web matches and pre-fetch web pages based on what the system thinks you might be looking for.\nFor example, if you start to type N E, it may pre-load netflix.com.\nAs far as why it using so many resources, that's difficult to say. Is this the first time this has happened? It may have crashed. Keep an eye on it and see if the issue reoccurs.\nYou can also disable Spotlight Suggestions and that should stop this thread from appearing altogether.\nGo to System Preferences > Spotlight and uncheck Spotlight Suggestions and Bing Web Searches. Then, in Safari, go to Preferences > Search and uncheck Include Spotlight Suggestions.\n", "Q: Why do Chinese EarPods not work with German MacBook Pro? I own this MacBook Pro, which was bought in Germany, and I am currently residing in China, where I accidentally switched headphones with a Chinese friend. Both are official Apple EarPods, mine came with my iPhone 5, which I also bought in Germany, and hers came with her iPhone 6, bought in China.\nAt first I did not notice our headphones had been switched, because they look the same. However, when plugged into my MacBook, the sound was just not right, as if the trebles had been removed from the music, resulting in songs without singers. When I tried with my iPhone and my other friend’s MacBook Air (bought in China), there was no problem whatsoever. I was worried that the headphone jack hardware itself had been damaged, but other headphones worked, so I concluded that both headphone jack as well as EarPods themselves were usable, just not together.\nLater I asked the Chinese friend if I could see her EarPods and tested them with my MacBook—again, no problem whatsoever. I then inspected the headphones closely: They sure do look the same, but the insulating plastic rings between the conducting rings at the plug itself are white on my German EarBuds but black on the Chinese ones. This is the only difference I could spot, even though I felt like the Chinese ones just did not fit 100% into the socket, thus resulting in some wrongly connected conductors leading to the strange sound.\nSo why do the Chinese EarPods not work with my German MacBook even though it is supposed to be the same standard?\n\nA: According to this post from Apple's official Chinese-language discussion forum, the EarPods that come bundled with iPhones sold in China comply with the OMTP standard which uses black rings, which is the official standard for 3.5mm earphones in the country whereas those from other countries and the standalone EarPods sold in China use the CTIA standard, with the white rings.  \nThe channels used by the two standards are different: the order of the rings on the OMTP standard are :Left audio, right audio, microphone, and ground; whereas  the CTIA standard have the ground and microphone sockets switched over, so, given that information, we can safely conclude a German MacBook Pro is incompatible with the OMTP standard, however all Apple 3.5mm EarPods should be compatible with all iPhones, as indicated by the question and the linked forum thread.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro, gets stuck at boot screen and the graphics look weird I have a 2011 MacBook Pro i7 and I have upgraded the memory to 8 GB and the HD to an SSD 500GB. The other day I had it running for 3 days non-stop and when I tried to use it it was frozen. I reset it and when it went to the boot screen the graphics looked funny like 16bit color mode, and it got stuck after a couple of seconds. I removed the hard drive and I noticed that I can access all the files and I backed them up. I downloaded Yosemite and I tried to install it from an USB stick but after loading for a while the screen turned gray and it froze. I'm a bit baffled as what might be the problem? Do you think it's the hardrive or is the hardware failing? I'm attaching screenshots of the bootup srceens.\n\n\n\nA: Unfortunately you may have hardware issues if yours is an \"Early 2011\" model, many owners have reported symptoms similar to yours with the culprit being failed ball grid array solder on the graphics processor. There's some info here. The article has a link for a utility that will allow you run solely on the integrated Intel HD3000 graphics so at least you'll be able to continue using your MacBook (in theory at least, we do have an Early 2011 i7 15\" on campus but so far it's not had any problems).\nUltimately the fix will either be a replacement logic board or you can try any one of a number of companies offering to \"re-ball\" or \"re-flow\" the solder on GPUs. Any company offering Xbox 360 or PS3 repairs should be able to do this. \nHere is a link to the \"MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues\" for your Mac model.\n\nA: Does your system come up normally if you hold down the shift key while powering up?  (That puts you into \"safe mode\".)  If so, there's a simple software-only fix.\n", "Q: MacBook Wifi dies, computer needs to be restarted I've been having a problem where my wifi dies frequently, and won't turn on again until the computer is restarted.  By \"dies\" I mean no wifi networks are visible - when you click the WIFI icon, it asks if you want to \"Turn on Wifi\" even though you never turned it off.  If you click \"turn on wifi\" nothing happens.  So I've been restarting the computer a lot. It's a 2013 Macbook Pro running OSX Yosemite, but the wifi problem existed before upgrading to Yosemite. I believe it's a hardware problem. \nHas anyone else had this issue, and if so, how did you resolve it?\n\nA: Solution that avoids having to restart the computer:\nGo to terminal and type\nsudo ifconfig en0 down\n\nAnd enter your password. This will cause the WIFI card to restart and (for me) the connection to be restored.\n\nA: Get your Airport Card replace or you risk your data.\nThis problem is only going to get worse over time, later causing the Mac to lock up then to a point the Mac will hang during boot.\nEvery force shutdown you risk losing your files on the delicate HFS+ file system.\n", "Q: my Mac and my iPhone show wrong time zone I set my Mac to receive the date and time from time.europa.apple.com, and my iPhone is set to find a time zone automatically. But they both show me incorrect time. one hour later. Well,  I live in St-Petersburg, Russia, and some years ago we had this \"timezone changing\", to not differ from Europe, but later we returned back to the previous. So is the Apple server set up incorrect, or do I have to change something?\n\nA: The server has nothing to do with the time zone. It supplies the time in UTC+0, and it is up to your devices to use their knowledge of your time zone to work out what the time is where you are. For your Mac, in the Date & Time preferences, check where your Mac 'thinks' it is:\n\nThe same applies for your iPhone:\n\nIf it is identifying you as being in the wrong time zone, or if the time zone is correct but the time is wrong, I suggest setting your time zone to St Petersburg manually, and seeing if that fixes the problem. I just tried setting my time to St Petersburg manually, and it appeared to be the correct time, so I don't think Apple's information about Russia's time zones is out of date.\n\nA: It's an Apple servers problem, because ALL the Apple devices shows GMT +4 for Russian zone (St-Petersburg and Moscow) instead GMT +3.\n\nA: Apple server is incorrect. Best fix I found is to pretend we are in Ukraine. Hope it gets proper fix soon. \n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcut for switching to Desktops #5 and higher How can we create a keyboard shortcut to switch to desktops #5 and higher?

It hadn't happened since I've had the computer (several months) and then suddenly all of my Bluetooth devices (keyboard, trackpad, iPhone) would disconnect and not only can the computer not connect, but Bluetooth preferences won't even display any BT devices.\nThe first time the issue was resolved with a reboot+cleared PRAM, the second time that didn't work, but I was able to unload/reload the Bluetooth controller to resolve. It happened again today and now I haven't been able to resolve the issue. Any ideas?\nOS: 10.10.2\nHardware: MBPw/Retina (2014), iPhone 5S, Apple Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad\n\nA: Your bluetooth controller is probably kaput.  If your MBP is under AppleCare (hopefully still since it's a 2014), this should be covered under warranty.  I would take to the local Apple Store for service\nIf not, go to your local electronics retailer (Walmart will work here), get a usb bluetooth dongle, install and see if devices can connect.\nIf they can, then you have narrowed down your problem to the internal bluetooth.   You may be able to find a BT module on eBay for a nominal price.  They are fairly easy to replace.  But if you aren't handy with a screwdriver, a local \"Geek\" could handle this task.\n\nA: The MacBook Retina models have a combined Airport/BT card. Before actually spending any money on parts I would suggest deleting the BT preference file, then perform an SMC reset.\nThe file to delete is com.apple.bluetooth.xxxxx.plist (xxxxx = a string of charcters unique to your machine) and will be in /Library/Preferences/ByHost/ in your Home folder.\nIf that doesn't work the next stage is disconnecting the battery then removing and re-seating the card. Ifixit link here. Ensure the battery is disconnected as this will clear all SMC settings and protect the board while you remove the card. Don't skip this stage.\nIn addition to the SMC reset this will also ensure a good connection between the combo card and the logic board. It's worth checking out in case the card is actually ok but not working for other reasons.\nAnother check you can perform is to install OS X onto an external drive if you have one available. If you see your BT icon on the new, clean installation you will then know it's a software issue rather than hardware.\n", "Q: Unable to clear formatting in Notes app I'm trying to get into using the Notes app for just keeping track of my thoughts while I'm working. As I'm typing away I might decide to make some text in italics and then later revert back to normal text.

The Format->Font menu shows that the formatting has been turned off and yet when I type more text it still shows up with formatting. \nHas anyone had this problem? Any ideas on how to make the damned app work properly?\nedit: Italics seems to be the main culprit here, I can usually turn of other formatting styles, but once I've triggered italics it won't go back to normal text unless a open a different note and then come back to the one I was editing.\n\nA: I have seen this too. I work around it by always pressing enter a few times before starting any new note. Then I go back to the start. When the formatting gets stuck I can just move down to a blank line and there will be no formatting. \n", "Q: No Facebook notifications on Yosemite I run OS X 10.10.2 now, and when I started out with 10.10, I was delighted that Notif Center would send me Notifications when something happened, after I had added the Account in Internet Accounts (I used Lion previously). However, some months ago, it suddenly stopped working, with no clear cause. It was not installing the 10.10.1 update, for instance.

Click on \"all\" and presto! they had been\n\"read\" at one time or other, and reappeared; or, I guess, click \"Unread\" if they are unread to make the unread reappear.  I have no idea how they disappeared (probably by my cat) but that's how it worked for me.   BTW, I was not smart enough to figure this out myself.  This fix was entirely due to a helpful person at the Genius Bar\nin Marlton, NJ.  \nIf this still doesn't work please also note that he showed me that my reading list was in my iPhone cloud\nunder Settings> iCloud, etc.  \n\nA: The list just comes back be patient.\n", "Q: Script to change downloaded mac wallpaper automatically?

Yosemite I'm using Yosemite (OS X 10.10.1).  If I search for the term \"foo\" and want a list of all files that include that term, I get foo.doc and bar.foo.doc and foodstuffs.xlsx and even The Foo History.  But it does not include snafoos.docx and AllTheFooReports.xlsx.  How can I change it to the (obvious!?!) behaviour of returning all results which include the search term?  \nI'd like to be able to do this from within Finder, not just in terminal.\n\nA: The Finder searches for word prefixes.\nIf you save your search as a Smart Folder and then inspect that using a text editor (e.g. TextMate) you will see the raw Spotlight query:\n((kMDItemDisplayName = \"foo*\"cdw))\n\nThe \"w\" modifier tells Spotlight to search for words. The \"*\" wildcard at the end of the search string makes Spotlight search for word prefixes. It will match names that contain a word beginning with \"foo\".\nThat matches all of your examples but one. \"foo\" comes at the start of the file name, after a space or punctuation or is capitalized. The exception is \"snafoos\" where \"foo\" is just a sequence of letters in the middle of the word.\nYou could change the query in the smart folder to:\n((kMDItemDisplayName = \"*foo*\"cd))\n\nOr click the \"+\" button below the search field in Finder and add a \"name\" \"contains\" \"foo\" criterion.\nOr use mdfind in Terminal:\nmdfind -onlyin . '((kMDItemDisplayName = \"*foo*\"cd))'\n\nOr use HoudahSpot (of which I am the developer) to get more control over your search.\n\nA: If you are stuck you could use a find command in a terminal window.\nOpen a terminal window and type :$ find . -iname \\*foo\\*\nHere's an example using the files you mentioned in your question.\nmgagnon-mbp:tmp mgagnon$ ls\nAllTheFooReports.xlsx   bar.foo.doc     foo.doc         foodstuffs.xlsx     snafoos.docx\n\nmgagnon-mbp:tmp mgagnon$ find . -iname \\*foo\\*\n./AllTheFooReports.xlsx\n./bar.foo.doc\n./foo.doc\n./foodstuffs.xlsx\n./snafoos.docx\n\nIf you're not familiar with the terminal this is a fun way to learn! :) The easiest way to open a terminal windows is using a spotlight search (command-spacebar) and search for terminal.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Airports, Wifi Roaming, and Ethernet Backhaul According to Apple's Wi-Fi base stations: Setting up and configuring a roaming network (802.11 a/b/g/n), there's an implicit assumption that I want to use a wireless for everything. That is, the extended base station backhauls its traffic using Wifi.\nWifi is a limited resource, and there's only so much bandwidth in a channel. I'd like to reserve the wireless bandwidth for clients, and backhaul the extended base station traffic using ethernet. But Apple's article doe not discuss how to bridge the APs using ethernet through a switch.\nHow do I set up roaming between two airports and backhaul over ethernet using a switch (and not Wifi)?\n\nRelated (from James' answer below): in the upper diagram, the extended Airport is plugged into the primary Airport base station directly. That's not quite the configuration we have because we can't run the direct cable. We are in a historic building, so we can only use existing cables and run it to the basement and into a switch. \n\nA: The diagram at the top of the article you linked to in the question seems to show exactly what you are trying to achieve; the extended base stations are connected via Ethernet, from their WAN ports, to a network port on the primary base station. Have you tried this configuration?\n", "Q: Apple Account Country Change I really need to change my apple account country. I would like to see a TV show but I can only find it in the US store, and because I am in the Emirati store, it won't show up in that store. I do not understand why apple has placed the 'country store' system because when someone in a different country wants to buy a certain item, they aren't allowed to. Can I change my account store or is it not possible?\n\nA: Apple has separated the store into different countries because the rights to movies and shows can be owned by different companies in each country. For example a film might be distributed by Paramount in the United States and 20th Century Fox in the rest of the world (as was the case with James Cameron's Titanic). So Apple has to make separate deals with these companies to distribute their content in the store.\nYou can change the country attached to your account, but then in Apple's own words: \"After you change the country of your account, you won't see the items you purchased from the previous country’s store in the Purchased section.\"\nTo change the country you may need a payment option located in that country. Again in Apple's own words: \"only German credit cards can be used to buy content from the German iTunes and App stores\".\nLife would be easier for us if this wasn't the case, but unfortunately Apple has to follow the rules of the people who own the content they are distributing through their stores.\n", "Q: Is there a way to limit OS X when searching for apps? My issue is that OS X is finding multiple versions of applications. When opening a file with the \"Open with ...\" option, I see multiple versions of an app.\nThis is being caused by having multiple OS X partitions mounts. I'm not sure which process searches for apps, but I used the lsregister -dump command to see that the database contains a version from each of my boot partitions.\nDoes anyone know what process does this?\nIs there a way to limit this process to certain partitions?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the Spotlight pane in System Preferences.\n\n*Select the Privacy tab.\n\n*Drag the Applications folder from the partitions that you don't want indexed into the list area.\n\n\nShortly thereafter the duplicate results should disappear from the list, leaving applications from the one Applications folder you want.\nYou might need to force a refresh the LaunchServices database afterward too.\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nFinally restart the Finder with the following command to rebuild any data cached within the Finder.\nkillall Finder\n\n", "Q: Will my Macbook Air be able to handle dual 4k displays?

Will my Macbook Air be able to hand the two monitors at it's full resolution?\nIf so, what cables would I need? If not, are there any macbook's that can handle dual 4k monitor at their native resolutions?\n\nA: Short answer - No.\nLonger answer, from Everymac…\n\n*Although Apple only reports that this model can support a single external display up to 2560x1600, Intel reports that this model can simultaneously support two external displays up to 2560x1600 \"daisy chained\" via Thunderbolt 2.\n\nThe current top spec Macbook Pro, on the other hand, can support 2 external monitors at 4k, but only at 24Hz - same source\n\n*This model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 3840x2160 on two external displays via Thunderbolt 2. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 3840x2160 via Thunderbolt 2 and a single 1080p display at up to 60 Hz, 3840x2160 at 30 Hz, or 4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI.\n\n", "Q: Why isn't my iPhone 4S charging (apparently) only in some places? I charge the phone at home using the Apple wall adapter that came with the phone and an Amazon basics 30-pin-to-USB cable. I have been doing so for over a year (i.e. since I purchased the cable).\nI was charging the phone at work with the Apple 30-pin-to-USB cable that came with the phone, connected directly to a port on my work computer. I have been doing so for at least a year as well.\nAbout a week ago, my iPhone stopped charging at work. It continues to charge at home.\nWhat I've tried so far (to no avail):\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning off my phone.\n\n*Soft-resetting my phone.\n\n*Replacing the 30-pin-to-USB-cable with a third-party, yet certified, cable.\n\n*Replacing the 30-pin-to-USB-cable with another Amazon basics cable; the same cable (per Amazon) that works at home (tho not the actual same instance of that cable).\n\n*Connecting (all of the three) 30-pin-to-USB-cable(s) to a wall adapter.\n\n\nI have not update iOS within at least month of this issue.\nI'm upgrading iOS to 8.2 (from 8.1.x) now.\nEDIT – it will charge at work if I turn it off.\nEDIT1 – I tried plugging the wall adapter into (a) the surge protector into which the power cables for my computer and monitors are plugged-in; (b) an outlet in my cubicle; and (c) a wall outlet in my office. None worked.\nEDIT2 – I tried all three cables, and the wall adapter, that I had at work, in the outlets I use at home. None of the cables worked. The wall adapter worked with the lone cable I have at home that works. In summary, even using a (working) wall adapter, I can't charge using any of three cables at work. I can charge my phone with those same three cables tho if I turn my phone off! At this point, I'm worried some aspect of my work environment caused, directly or indirectly, damage to the cables, so I'm loathe to bring my lone working cable from home to test it.\nBut the cables work if I turn my phone off!\nEDIT3 – To add more confusing info, I replaced one of the three cables that wasn't working – the one that's the same (as far as I can tell) as the one cable that does work – and the replacement doesn't work at home (while my phone is turned on). Maybe the dock connector in the phone is damaged but somehow (???) the one cable is damaged in some particularly complementary manner that the phone can still charge (while turned on) when connected to it. The same cable for which one works and two don't (while my phone is turned on):\n\n\n*\n\n*AmazonSmile: AmazonBasics Apple Certified 30-Pin to USB Cable for Apple iPhone 4, iPod, and iPad 3rd Generation - 3.2 Feet (1.0 Meter): MP3 Players & Accessories\n\nA: It is possible that there is a problem with the port on the computer, either with the device now being blocked (which is sometimes done via policy in enterprise environments) or the port malfunctioning/disabled altogether. Do other devices, such as flash drives, work if you plug them into the same USB port you were using with your iPhone?\nIf no devices are working in the port, try the following:\nWindows/Mac Desktop/Macbook w/ removeable battery:\n1) Shut down the computer\n2) Unplug all items from the computer, including power\n3) Press and hold down on the power button for ~7 seconds\n4) Plug power back in\n5) Plug other devices back in\n6) Start up and see if the port has started to work again\nMacbook without removable battery:\n1) Turn off device, unplug all devices except Magsafe charger\n2) Hold down left Shift, Control, Option, and Power button at the same time for ~5 sec (note you may see a change in the Magsafe LED color for a second)\n3) Power machine on and see if device connects\nSometimes a glitch in the System Management Controller (yes, even on Windows machines) can cause a USB port to go dead. If it continues to not work, reach out to your IT dept./technician to see if perhaps there is a hardware failure.\n", "Q: Launch Apple Script on App Focus Is there a way to configure an Apple Script (or any script for that matter), to be run every time an application is focused?\nFor example, if I am on Safari currently, and I tap on a QuickTime window, I want it to run a script that I define.\n\nA: The following related questions suggest that there doesn't appear to be an easy way for you to do this. \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7217724/mac-os-x-how-to-monitor-a-window-change-event\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/853833/how-can-my-app-detect-a-change-to-another-apps-window\nThe best you can do is query the current active window in a loop and react when you notice a change.\nHTH\n", "Q: How long does it generally take Apple to propagate subject category changes in my submitted eBooks I have several books on sale in the ibooks store. A couple of weeks ago I did a minor change to the subject category of all my books. About a week after that I started to notice a drop on sales. I am trying to figure out whether this drop might be due to normal seasonal cycles or it might be that my change got propagated and classified the books in the wrong pile.\n\nA: I've not seen this change take longer than 48 hours unless there were a long holiday weekend or some shutdown like is typical and emailed/posted months in advance (like December 25 shutdown the last few years past).\nIf you have a concern, you could always log into iTunes Connect and contact support to check that things are not stuck in your case.\n", "Q: Can't restart because OS X thinks an app is open I was working with Xcode and it stopped responding so I force quit, reported the error, and tried reopening the app.  When reopening the dock hung too so I ended up having to restart the dock with killall -KILL Dock.  Unfortunately now OS X thinks Xcode is running but hung.  Long pressing the icon in the dock or going to the force quit screen clearly show the app but selecting \"Force Quit\" does nothing and the app does not appear when I do ps -e.\n\nIs there any way I can get OS X to realize the app isn't running so I can open it or safely restart the OS?\n\nA: This bug occurs occasionally for me, and the ‘safest’ workaround I've found which I use is to quit all other open apps, then quit (not force quit) WindowServer. This logs out the current user without taking regard for apps which desire to interrupt this process, or apps which the OS still believe are running.\n                         \nAccording to an Apple Support Communities thread, this problem is caused by the kernel:\n\nIf \"killall -KILL process_name\" or \"kill -KILL process_pid_number\" does not kill the process, then that process is hung in the kernel, as a kill signal cannot be delivered until the process returns from kernel space to user space.\n\nSource: https://discussions.apple.com/message/26762830?tstart=0#26762830\n…but I'm not certain how accurate this is. Certain apps seem to exhibit this behaviour more often than others and I am yet to find a link as to what the actual cause of the problem/bug is.\n", "Q: What was the Mac that Ran 'System 1' I thought I was reasonably early to the party, but the first Mac I owned - an SE 30  - was running System 6.06 when I got it & after a brief foray with 6.06 we had 6.07 with actual multi-tasking…\n…but what machine ran System 1?\n…& was it even called that at the time?\n\nA: Wikipedia to the rescue, they even have an article dedicated to System 1:\n\nSystem 1, also known as Macintosh System Software was the original Macintosh operating system. It is a part of the Classic Mac OS family, and ran on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. It was released on January 24, 1984 along with the original Macintosh and was replaced by System 1.1 on May 5, 1984.\n\nand a lot more about all other releases.\n\nA: According to EVERYMAC, the Macintosh Original (128k), 512k, and 512ke (ED) were the only versions that were shipped with System 1.  \n", "Q: OS X Text Replacements sometimes not working? This is a weird problem, I write a lot of different languages on my computer, and since my keyboard doesn't have all the keys in the world, I have made certain key-combinations that replaces them with another letter.\nFor example, \"†˛\" becomes \"þ\" and \"∂∂\" becomes \"ð\". Now that works fine, but I have also added \"œœ\" that is supposed to become \"ǫ\", but form some reason that special replacement does not work while the others do.  EDIT: To be able to type the ǫ letter I must also press space (\"œœ \"), while the others work perfectly to write in a word without pressing space. \nIs there any reason for this? I'm using the Yosemite 10.10.2, the same problem exists on the 10.0.3 DP.\n\nA: From what I can test empirically here, the text replace function handles 'letters' differently from 'other characters'.\nFor instance, I can replace ## with € in the middle of a word, yet I cannot make qq do the same thing, it demands either a space, or for me to click on the confirmation box that springs up.\nI'd perhaps suggest as a workaround, use a less letter-like trigger.\nIf it doesn't spring a confirmation box, then it will replace mid-word.\n!! @@ ££ $$ etc all work just fine.\n", "Q: How can I open a Google Maps URL in Apple Maps? Is there a way for me to convert a Google Maps URL to an Apple Maps-friendly format so it opens in the correct place?\nI might be in the minority, but where I am, Apple Maps offers vastly superior driving directions.\n\nA: You can simply copy and paste an URL from Google Maps (either from sharing with the Google Maps app), paste it in the Apple Maps search bar and it will resolve the correct location.\nGoogle Maps short URL (of the form goo.gl) won't work and will need expansion before proceeding.\nI've created myself a Workflow (soon to be named Shortcuts in iOS 12) to expand the URL automatically. You can force-touch an URL going to Google Maps and use this Workflow with the Workflow share extension.\n\nA: Not sure how you can do it in iOS, I can't find the equivalent command, but you can do it on the Google Maps web site in a browser then copy/paste the info to Apple Maps…\n\n\n*\n\n*go to Google maps in a browser\n\n*search your desired location\n\n*once that's found, right click the pin & select \"What's here?\"\n  \n\n*The latitude/longitude will then be shown in the info bar, top left\n\nThis can be copy/pasted to Apple Maps\n\n\nA: Apparently, Google doesn't want you to switch apps. There seems not to be any easy way to export a location in a format that Apple Maps can read it. I also have been fiddling with it and I even tried to make a Workflow, but without success. In the end, I found two moderately easy ways to do it:\n1. Without any third-party apps\nTap the \"code+\" to copy it to the clipboard.\n\nThen go to Safari and paste that code to search it in Google. You should get a Google search results with a map at the top. Tap the map to open a full version of it and then you get normally formatted coordinates, that you can copy and paste into Apple Maps.\n2. Using a third-party app as a quick bridge\nAn easier way to do it, but that's requires the eventual purchase of a third-party app, consists in using Opener. It's a small utility that allows us to choose which app will open a given URL. Having the app Opener installed, all you need to do is share in Google maps and select Opener.\n\n\nIt will give you an option to open that location in Apple Maps, or in other supported apps that you may have installed in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIt's the easier easiest and quickest way I managed to do it in iOS.\n\nA: I have been searching and there is no easy way to extract the coordinates or anything other than the a Google map URL from the iOS Google Maps app.\nI have to think that it is on purpose. \nThe “easiest way” so far is to type by hand the coordinates (viewable but not copyable from the Google Maps app)\n", "Q: Can I set up two Samsung monitors to my mac book air mid 2012?

By doing 'Off' (as it appears in the menu) it only affects the shuffle command. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: In earlier versions of iTunes, \"repeat\" and \"shuffle\" were associated with playlists.  With iTunes 12 they are global flags and seem to be toggled by menu clicks; there's no direct property to manipulate.\nYou can control repeat from Applescript thus:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell application process \"iTunes\"\n    tell menu 1 of menu item \"Repeat\" of menu \"Controls\" of menu bar 1\n      click\n      click menu item \"All\"\n    end tell\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nOptions are \"All\", \"One\" or \"Off\"\nYou can do similar for \"Shuffle\" with allowed options of \"On\" or \"Off\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell application process \"iTunes\"\n    tell menu 1 of menu item \"Shuffle\" of menu \"Controls\" of menu bar 1\n      click\n      click menu item \"On\"\n    end tell\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nThis makes it scriptable to control the status of shuffle and repeat, and you could bind these scripts to keyboard shortcuts.\n", "Q: PHP on OSX 10.10 How do I install/allow php to run on Yosemite?

I've tried it, and still, I cannot get php files to work (I'm making a website and I need a php file).\n\nA: If you are not very familiar with the command line and config files (and it appears that you are not) then get Apple's Server app (US$20 at the app store). PHP then becomes a check-the-box setup option, as does local DNS (also essential).\nThe only common web-related app you will actually need to install via the command line is mysql. There is a package installer on Oracle's website.\n\nA: Or you could just use MAMP which is an installable and easily removable installation of Apache, MySQL and PHP entirely separate from that which is installed with and in the operating system.\nI like it because it is simple and if I mess something up in my tinkering I just trash the MAMP folder and reinstall.\nIt is free (though they do offer a commercial, supported, edition) and works just as well as the components that come with Mac O/S.\nI have no interest in the company, I've just used it quite a bit in the past.
