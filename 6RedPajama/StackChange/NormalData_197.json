["Q: Prevent standard users from seeing and running some apps How to control just some apps to be available on other accounts, Not all of them?\n\nA: You might try changing the permissions of that program. I don't know if you can prevent a user from seeing the file, but you can definitely remove their permission to execute it.\nYou can remove everyone but the owners right to read, write, and execute the program.\n# removing read, write, execute privileges of \"group\" and \"other\" from the program file.\nsudo chmod go-rwx <program file>\nIf you want someone else to be able to be able to read, write, or execute that file then you can give the program file \"group permissions\" and add the the desired users to that files group.\nsudo chmod g+rwx <program file>\nsudo useradd -G <UserToAddToGroup> <NameOfFilesGroup>\nI think if you spend a little time to learn the permission structure you will be able to accomplish what you are wanting to do.\nAlso, IIRC you could probably use sudoers to achieve your goals as well. This would be more complicated and require some reading.\nYou can modify sudoers with: sudo visudo\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why doesn't running \"sudo shutdown now\" shut down? When I issue the following:\nsudo shutdown now\n\n..my newly commissioned Ubuntu 14.04 server doesn't shut down. It stops with the following message:\n* Stopping System V runlevel compatibility\nGive root password for maintenance:\n(or type Control-D to continue):\n\nIf I type in the root password, the machine simply sits there at the shell prompt.\n\nA: It's a legacy from the days when the physical machine couldn't power off by itself. For example, the halt command sudo halt terminates all programs and unloads almost everything from RAM, ready to be powered off. However, if you run sudo halt -p, it will do all that, then signal the system to power off, or in the case of the shutdown command, you need the -a option, I believe, though I personally use halt.\n\nA: systemctl poweroff -i \n\nuse this for all linux.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure the correct command needs to contain the \"-h\" option (halt). Try this:\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\n\nA: Traditionally, the command sudo shutdown now will take you to the runlevel 1 (recovery mode); this will happen for both Upstart and SysV init.\nTo get what you want, i.e., to shut down the computer properly, you need to give the -h switch to shutdown. \nOne thing to note here is that halt will close all the processes, turn off the CPUs and return the control to a ROM monitor of the mainboard needing the user to press the power button to get the power supply turned off, whereas poweroff after turning off the CPUs will simply turn off the power supply resulting in a proper shutdown.\nThe -h switch of shutdown will either halt or poweroff the computer, the decision will be taken by the system although in Ubuntu I have seen that it would normally poweroff the machine. To be sure of that, you can use the -P switch with shutdown to poweroff the computer. \nTo summarize, here are the commands available to poweroff (not halt) a computer:\nsudo shutdown -h now\nsudo shutdown -P now\nsudo poweroff\nsudo halt -p\nsudo init 0\n\nThe poweroff and halt commands basically invoke shutdown (except for the poweroff -f). sudo poweroff and sudo halt -p are exactly like sudo shutdown -P now. The command sudo init 0 will take you to the runlevel 0 (shutdown).\nNow what if you want to shut down forcefully, i.e., you don't want to wait for processes to close normally? In that case you can use:\nsudo poweroff -f\n\nThis will not use shutdown. Rather, it will invoke the reboot(2) system call (used for reboot, poweroff & halt) to power off the computer instantly.\n\nA: I've always used the following\nsudo shutdown -a now\n\nor to reboot immediately after shutdown\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nLooking at the shutdown help option it doesn't list -a as a proper command, but I could have sworn a long time ago -a was abort or something like that. Anyways I've kept using that and it it has worked all these years, but it looks like shutdown -h now is the correct option.\n", "Q: I use Windows and Ubuntu together. I want to uninstall Windows I use Ubuntu and Windows together but now I want to uninstall  Windows. \nOS uninstaller and gparted were recommended to me. \nDo any files or documents in Windows C: hard disk get harmed or deleted? \n\nA: sure if you delete your windows partion all your data from windows are away if you safe your data on an another partion (like d:) they are save\n\nA: If you use OS-Uninstaller is performs a complete wipe of the entire partition.

How does this affect the need to wash empty disk space and will it unnecessarily increase wear on my drive?  It would seem that if it's memory, once you overwrite with ANYTHING the old data is gone. Sounds to good to be true though. \nIf you don't know what I mean, I'm talking about overwriting empty disk space to make sure any data there is unrecoverable. Tools for doing this are found in the wipe, and secure-delete packages. Wipe is facilitated through nautilus through the nautilus-wipe package. \n\nA: I'd suggest reading this Security.SE answer (and the links at the end).\nIt is true that overwriting a memory sector will wipe it without any of the ghosting old mechanical disks get, but the controllers for these disks have all sorts of life-prolonging features that obscure physical \"sectors\" away from the operating system. \nFor example, many modern disks reserve a portion (up to 20% of physical size) for wear levelling. Because this is all handled by the disk in the background, this prevents you from actually clearing everything. You might be able to get everything by doing a multi-pass write but it's hard to guarantee without doing a chip-by-chip analysis (which a determined attacker might).\nAs others have said before, if you want security you need to start with security:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy drives that are hardware-encrypted.\n\n*Use full disk encryption.\n\n\nIn either case, it's childplay to prevent the correct key being entered, rendering the data unusable without time-expensive cracking techniques. More than that, a wipe of an encrypted disk will knock out at least ~80% of the data (a mathematician will probably counter this), making it much harder to decrypt.\nThe only way to otherwise guarantee a secure wipe on an SSD is to destroy it.\n\nA: Use 'SED' (Self-Encrypting Drives) technology:\n\nThe only way to otherwise guarantee a secure wipe on an SSD is to destroy it.\n\nWhile this is generally true, the latest generation of SSD have Trusted Computing Group 'Opal 2.0' transparent AES-256 encryption of pages (storage elements), and discard this key when the page is no longer needed or has exceeded 'wear' (re-write) tolerance.\n\nSamsung > first 3D Vertical NAND SSD > SED technology\n\nSafeguard precious data without sacrificing performance\nProtect your PC's hardware and personal data when you take your laptop on the road with the\n  850 PRO's SED technology. The drive includes an AES-256-bit hardware-based, full disk\n  encryption engine that secures your data without performance > degradation, often experienced\n  with software-based encryption.\nThe 850 PRO's advanced security complies with the TCG™ Opal v2.0 standards, protecting PSID,\n  and is compatible with the Microsoft® eDrive IEEE® 1667 protocol. Plus, you can erase or\n  initialize data with the crypto erase service.\n\nComputerWeekly > SED .. best-kept secret in hard drive encryption security\n\nAn SED is a self-encrypting hard drive with a circuit built into the disk drive controller chip that\n  encrypts all data to the magnetic media and decrypts all the data from the media automatically. All\n  SEDs encrypt all the time from the factory onwards, performing like any other hard drive, with the\n  encryption being completely transparent or invisible to the user.\n\nNote: While HDDs can be erased with the right tools (and enough patience), SSDs will retain old data on unused/discarded pages. Unless you are using full-disk (or at least home-directory) encryption, this is a major security risk (for SSDs).\n\nThis is what I use on my primary desktop PC(s) and notebook PC.\n", "Q: How to downgrade libdrm-intel1?

The only issue (kinda a big one) that I have run into with this running Ubuntu 14.10 is with the eMMC they have for a boot drive. I don't know all the terminology, but here it is in plain language. There is a tiny partition on the eMMC that is confusing Ubuntu. I think it's called or labeled RPMP, and Ubuntu can't access it. It is at the beginning sectors of the drive, so Ubuntu tries to read it, but can't. This significantly slows the boot time (Approx. 4 minutes for me) and has also interfered when installing new kernel updates through the Ubuntu Software Center. I read somewhere that there is a fix, but I haven't seen it yet. I am hopeful that it makes it's way into Ubuntu 15.04, or this could be a very annoying computer to have.\n\nA: I'm writing this from an HP Stream Mini desktop running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64-bit), so I'm proof it can be done. (From what I've read the Stream Mini desktop is basically the same system as the notebook, just in a different form factor.)\nThe process isn't hard, but it's hard to find out exactly HOW to do it.\nI'll assume you already know how or can find out how to put Ubuntu onto a bootable USB stick. The trick is getting the HP to boot to that stick.\nLong story short: you need to press F10 at boot to get to the UEFI/BIOS configuration. Just change the boot order so your USB stick comes before the hard drive.\nIf you are unable to find your USB Drive, try switching boot options to \"Legacy\", saving those settings and retrying F9\nA lot of stuff out there mentions pressing F12, but that just brings up UEFI boot options, which won't show the USB stick.\nI am planning to do a full write up of this on my blog soon (I'll post a link here when I do), but for anyone with some experience installing Ubuntu, I'm guessing the only problem you'll have is getting the USB stick to boot.\nIt's also possible to tell the system to boot to the USB stick by navigating a labyrinth of options within Windows 8.1, but that only works until you've overwritten Windows. I've installed Ubuntu 3 times on this machine now. (Don't ask... it's not because it didn't work, it's because my experimentation got out of hand and I needed a clean start.)\nI will say that once you get Ubuntu installed, it is smooth as butter.

(The man cpio, and info cpio, were too hard to understand), so I couldn't figure out what is CPIO doing in this command.\ngzip -cd /boot/initrd-xxxxxxxxx.img | cpio -imd --quiet ;\nfind . | cpio   -co\n\nBasically, what does \"cpio -imd\" versus \"cpio -co\" mean?\n\nA: -i and -o are essentially cpio commands for extracting files from (copy-in), and adding files to (copy-out), an archive.\nThe options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*-c\nUse the old portable (ASCII) archive format. \n\n\n*-d, --make-directories\nCreate leading directories where needed.\n\nIf your archive contains a/b/c/d/f, and the folder you are extracting to only contains a/b, then the a/b/c and a/b/c/d directories will be automatically created by cpio.\n\n*-m, --preserve-modification-time\nRetain previous file modification times when creating files. \n\nThe -c option is presumably added for compatibility. The -m option means that the modification time of the file when it was archived is used instead of the current time. This may or may not be useful depending on the task. (For example, backups maybe expected to retain it, but it may not be needed if all you care is that you have a copy of the contents of the file.)\nHave look at this somewhat-old Linux Journal article on cpio.\n\nA: Thank you so much!!! Your information was VERY HELPFUL! I hope that the CPIO developers can fix the manpages for cpio, as it is very hard to understand.\nIn case others read this thread, this was from the link you helped me and REALLY helped me understand what exactly CPIO is and why it is used as opposed to tar or zip or rpm/nash/initrd etc...:\n\ncpio can create and extract archives on diskette, tape or in files using eight different archive formats, including tar. It can also create an almost perfect duplicate of a directory tree, preserving file ownership, modes, and access times. Since cpio is designed to accept a list of files such as the output of ls or find, it is more suited for comprehensive backup systems than tools like conventional tar; the set of files processed can be easily controlled programmatically.\n\ncpio also has some less obvious advantages. The default cpio format uses the space on tape much more efficiently than the conventional tar format, and it can also skip damaged sections of archives and continue during restore operations, instead of quitting completely.\ncpio has three modes of operation. Pass-through mode, which is what I used in the example above for duplication, create mode, which is used for creating archives, and extract mode, which is used for extracting files from archives.\nPass-Through Mode\nAs its name implies, in pass-through mode cpio acts as a conduit for copying lists of files from one destination to another. The ability to do this while creating subdirectories as needed and handling special files makes it a crucial tool for any system administrator to be familiar with.\nFor example, one common situation on a multi-user system is the need for more drive space for user directories. The administrator will need to perform the following steps: add an additional drive to the system, create one or more file systems, copy the user directories from the old file system to the new one, and then, depending upon the circumstances, change the file system mount points in order to make the transition unobtrusive.\nThere are three methods available for copying the users' files over to the new disk. One is to use tar to archive the files and extract them to the new area. This requires the time necessary to archive and extract the files.\nAnother is to use cp's recursive mode to copy them directly. This mode copies only regular files and links. It also follows symbolic links, which can duplicate a lot of files when used carelessly.\nOf course, few system administrators know exactly what is in their users' directories. A developer may have special files such as sockets or pipes. Any user may have files with special permissions in order to prevent unwanted access. Administrators do not have time to inspect home directories that carefully, and many users do not want them to anyway.\n$ find . -depth | cpio --pass-through \\\n --preserve-modification-times \\\n --make-directories --verbose /mnt/export\nThis command causes find to output the name of every file under the present directory. (The -depth option insures that directory names are output before the names of the files in them.) cpio reads these file names in and copies them to /mnt/export.\nThe switches passed to cpio are:\n--pass-throughOperate in pass-through mode.\n--preserve-modification-timesSet the modification times of the new files to that of the old ones.\n--make-directoriesCreate directories when necessary. (This option works when restoring archives, also.)\n--verboseVerbose mode. This mode will produce output for all files. An alternative is the -dot option which only produces a . for each file processed. (These options work in all modes.)\nThe command above creates an exact duplicate of the original directory, regardless of the types of files or any special file modes that were set.\nIf the files are being copied to the same file system, the --link option can be used to hard link files when necessary.\nCreate Mode\nCreate mode creates archive files. (This is also referred to as “copy-out” mode.) cpio accepts a list of file names, just as it does in pass-through mode. But instead of creating duplicate files in another area, it creates an archive and sends it to standard output.\nSince it is sent to standard output, the archive can be redirected to any device or file such as a tape, diskette, or standard file.\n$ find -depth /export/home \\\n    | cpio --create > /dev/fd0\nThis creates an archive of the /export/home directory tree on the floppy drive at /dev/fd0. Of course, the /export/home area probably won't fit on one floppy, but cpio prompts for another device or file name when each floppy is filled, so it can be replaced, and the user can type the device name again. (Note that find's -depth switch is still recommended to prevent possible problems when the archive is extracted.)\nWhen it comes to creating archives, cpio has many options. One of the most important is the format of the archive.\nbin(default) the binary format encodes files in a non-portable method. Therefore, it is not suited for exchanging files between Linux on a PC and Linux on other architectures such as Alpha or Power PC.\nodcold (POSIX.1) portable format. This is portable across platforms, but is not suited for file systems with more than 65536 inodes, which means most of today's larger hard disks.\nnewcnew portable format. This is portable across platforms, and has no inherent limit on number of inodes.\ncrcnew portable format, with a checksum added.\ntarcompatible with tar, but only supports file names up to 100 characters.\nustarnew tar format. Supports up to 255 character file names.\nhpbinnon-portable format used by HP/UX.\nhpodc“portable” format used by HP/UX. Stores device files differently.\nThe archive format is specified with the --format switch.\nOut of all the formats, the crc format is probably the best, since it is portable and has an extra degree of error checking via the checksum.\nA better method for creating an archive would be:\n$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --create \\\n  --message=\"Insert next disk and type /dev/fd0 \" \\\n  --format=crc > /dev/fd0\nThis uses the crc format for the archive and prompts the user with Insert next disk and type /dev/fd0 as each floppy is filled. The --message option, which works in both create and extract mode, replaces the default message.\nThere are many other options available for the creation of archives, which I will cover later.\nEven though GNU tar does have many of the advantages of cpio, the ability to use find to specify the files to be backed up provides much more flexibility than shell wildcards. [You can do this with tar, too, but you have to send the output of find into a file and use that file as an “include file” for tar—ED]\nExtract Mode\nExtract mode (also referred to as “copy-in” mode) extracts files from archives. This mode is inconsistent with the other two, since file names are specified on the command line, instead of via a list on standard input.\n$ cpio --extract < /dev/fd0\nThis command restores all of the files from the archive in /dev/fd0, since no file names were specified. If the archive spans more than one volume, cpio will prompt for each volume the same way it does when archives are created. The --message option can be used to override the default message, as in create mode.\ncpio automatically recognizes archive formats during extraction, so it is not necessary to specify them on the command line.\nThe path passed to cpio by find is stored in the archive. Therefore it is important to pay attention to how find is used.\n@@@@@@So.... basically to CREATE You do this, to make a cpio file, or a floppy disk:\n$ find . -depth | cpio --create > /tmp/archive\nThis creates an archive that extracts into the present working directory.\n$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --create \\\n\n/tmp/archive\n\nThis creates an archive that will try to extract to /export/home, regardless of the circumstances. If the -d option is specified the directory is created if it does not already exist. (If /export/home does not exist and -d is omitted, the extraction will fail.)\nAnything specified on the command line that is not an option is treated as a filename pattern.\n$ cpio --extract \"back\" < /dev/fd0\nThis will extract files in the archive that have back in their name. No other files will be restored. Multiple patterns can also be specified.\n$ cpio --extract \"back\" \"save\" < /dev/fd0\nThis will extract files with “back” or “save” in their names.\nIn addition to providing patterns on the command line, they can be provided as lines in a file. The file is specified with the --pattern-file=filename option. This provides a lot of flexibility in restoring files, since the actual path does not have to be known and wildcards are not needed. Frequently restored patterns can be stored in a file.\nThe --nonmatching option is used to specify files not to extract.\nIt may help to see the contents of the archive before extracting anything from it.\n$ cpio --list < /dev/fd0\nThe --list option lists the contents of the archive. The option --numeric-uid-gid forces the list to show user and group IDs numerically, instead of trying to resolve the names with the passwd and group files.\nInstead of standard input and output the archive can be sent to (or extracted from) a file.\n$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --create \\\n  --file=/vol/archive\nThis option works either for creating or extracting archives. To use a remote tape drive specify the hostname and user name before the filename. (The user must have access to the remote host without a password. This can be done by using the file .rhosts)\n$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --create \\\n  --file=eric@bajor:/dev/rmt0\nOne of the key advantages of creating archives with this option is that disk files (archives not on tape or floppy) created with this option can be appended to with the --append option.\nThis command will work if eric has no password, (not recommended) or if the host that the command is run on is listed in the .rhosts file in eric's home directory.\nWhen restoring an archive it is sometimes desirable to not alter the file modification times:\n$ find /export/home -depth | cpio --extract \\\n  --preserve-modification-times --file\n/vol/archive\nThe --preserve-modification-times option works in extract mode in addition to pass through mode.\nIn addition to preserving modification times, the access times for archived or copy files can be preserved so that the cpio operation does not affect the original files:\n$ find . -depth | cpio --pass-through \\\n --make-directories --preserve-modification-times \\\n --reset-access-time /vol/copy\nThis will copy the current directory to /vol/copy while copying the modification times on the old files to the new and also leaving the access times on the original files untouched.\nThe default action for cpio, when operating in copy-in (extract) or pass-through mode, is to prompt a user for confirmation before writing over existing files, if the existing file is newer. By default, cpio will not replace the existing files. The --unconditional option overrides that behavior:\n$ cpio --extract --unconditional \"back\" \"save\" \\\n  < /dev/fd0\nThe --dereference option copies the file pointed to by a symbolic link, instead of the link itself, in archive creation and pass-through mode.\nThe --rename command will prompt the user to interactively rename each file. This only works in extract mode.\nWhen acting as a system administrator, it is sometimes useful to restore an archive or duplicate a directory and change the user or group id of the target in the process.\n@@@@So.... basically to EXTRACT You do this, do extract from a cpio file, or a floppy disk:\n\n$ cpio --extract --owner=Cloud.Strife < /dev/fd0\n\nThis will restore the archive on /dev/fd0 and set the owner of all the extracted files to eric and the group to staff. Only root may use this option. If the group is left out, it will not be changed unless the . is included, in which case the group will be set to the user's login group.\nAnother option related to file ownership is --no-preserve-owner. This is the default behavior for non-root users. Files will belong to the user copying or extracting them, instead of the original user. For root the default is to preserve ownership.\nThere are also advanced options related to transferring data between big-endian and little-endian architectures and for controlling I/O buffer sizes to optimize performance.\n", "Q: ARP flux how to solve I have a server with 2 NICs having an IP address in the same subnet, this is what my /etc/network/interfaces looks like:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n  address 192.168.2.155\n  gateway 192.168.2.51\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  dns-nameservers 192.168.2.180\n  dns-domain exaple.com\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n  address 192.168.2.156\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n\nSo the idea is that eth0 with ip 192.168.2.155 is the 'management' interface with internet connectivity.\nThe eth1 NIC with IP 192.168.2.156 will be used to communicate with internal devices.\nNow When i configure this with a default system, and try to ping eth1 on 192.168.2.156 with other devices on the LAN, these packets are not being received by eth1 as one would expect, but by eth0, I verified this by running tcpdump -i eth1 icmp, and can see no packets coming in.

What would happen if I just did '$ sudo rm /media/jeff/stuckdrive'?\n\nA: It seems like what you considered your /home partition never got automounted (at least it does not now). So Ubuntu still includes the /home directory to the root partition /. And of course, as it does not get mounted at boot time, you can  not manually unmount it either!\nSo I suppose we have to manually edit your /etc/fstab configuration file. Could you please post this by including it into your question? You can leave the first 6 lines out and start with the line beginning with \"# \nWe might also need the output of sudo blkid /dev/sda7 to add this partition back to your automount list. \nSo when you attached those two pieces of information to your post, just leave me a short comment on this answer to wake me up... ;D\nSee you later!\nCORRECTION: It is not the /home partition that fails but an independent NTFS backup volume! I misunderstood.\n", "Q: Find folders of size lesser than x and delete them I want to find all folders (within a folder) which are less than 100mb large and delete them. I actually don't want to use a bash script. But probably there is some neat one-line-loop possibility to do this. But unfortunately my shell knowledge isn't that good\nWhat I've tried\n du -sh * | grep -E \"^[0-9]{1,2}M\" | xargs -0 rm\n\nThis won't work since the output of du -sh * | grep _E \"..\" seems to be one single string.\nWhat I also have tried is \nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type d -size 100M [-delete]\n\nBut I guess the -size flag isn't what I'm looking for\n\nA: The simple approach is to find all directories, get their size and delete them if they are under a given threshold:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type d | \n  while read dir; do [ $(du -s \"$dir\") -le 102400 ] && rm -f \"$dir\"; done\n\nHowever, that will fail on directory names containing newlines or other strange characters. A safer syntax is:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type d -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' dir; do\n    [ $(du -s \"$dir\") -le 102400 ] && rm -f \"$dir\"\ndone\n\nSince this will process subdirectories before their parents, by the time dir1 is processed, dir2 and dir3 will already have been deleted so its size will be below the threshold and it too will be removed. Whether or not you actually want this will depend on what exactly you are trying to do.\n\nThis, however, is a simplistic approach. Consider the following scenario:\n$ tree -h\n.\n`-- [4.0K]  dir1\n    |-- [4.0K]  dir2\n    |   `-- [ 80M]  file1\n    `-- [4.0K]  dir3\n        `-- [ 80M]  file2\n\n3 directories, 2 files\n\nHere, we have 2 subdirectories under dir1, each containing an 80M file. The command above will first find dir1 whose size is >100M so it will not be deleted. It will then find dir1/dir2 and dir1/dir3 and delete both of them since they are <100M. The final result will be an empty dir1 whose size, of course, will be <100M since it is empty.\nSo, this solution will work fine if you only have a single level of subdirectories. If you have more complex file structures, you need to think about how you want to deal with that. One approach would be to use -depth which ensures that subdirectories are shown first:\nfind . -depth -maxdepth 1  -type d -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' dir; do\n    [ $(du -s \"$dir\") -le 102400 ] && rm -f \"$dir\"\ndone\n\nThis way, dir1 will be processed after dir2 and dir3 so it will be empty, fail the threshold and be deleted as well. Whether or not you want this will depend on what exactly you are trying to do.\n\nA: Using du with flag -h to do value comparison is usually a bad idea.\nThe command you are looking for is:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type d | grep -v ^\\\\.$ | xargs -n 1 du -s | while read size name ; do if [ $size -gt 104857600 ] ; then echo rm -rf $name ; fi done\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*find . -maxdepth 1 -type d finds all subdirectories of the current directory\n\n*grep -v ^\\\\.$ excludes the current directory (.)\n\n*xargs -n 1 passes them one by one to the next command\n\n*du -s provides the summary (i.e. total) space of the files in that directory\n\n*while read size name ... done executes a loop over its input, reading the size and the name of each directory\n\n*the rest is more or less self explanatory.\n\n\nOnce you are happy with the command remove the echo before rm -rf\n", "Q: Adding multiple hard drives to ubuntu server so owncloud can use them I am using an old desktop to install ubuntu server on. Once I have it installed, I upgrade to the newest version. After it is finished, I install owncloud. I've gotten it all set up and working. The problem is I have four internal hard drives (one which has the OS and everything on) and an external hard drive. Ubuntu server detects them but I can't use them in owncloud as storage. I add external storage support to owncloud and set up the devices using local, it even has the green light letting me know they are found. But when I go back to the main page, I still only have my main hard drive. How do I get owncloud to use these other drives as storage? I'm at my wit's end, I've installed Ubuntu Server at least 12 times.\nSo I've used LVM to set up three of my four internal hard drives to act as one (saving the last one for when I build a website).

I've read using GBT because it has support for >2TB, but would it be able to be used by Linux and Windows?\n\nA: Make sure that the folder's that you like to bind in owncloud is accessible for the user witch run apache2 or your webserver. When you run apache2 then the group and the user is www-data.\nWhen you use the folder only for owncloud:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/external/folder\n\nWhen you use the folders for owncloud and other stuff:\nsudo chgrp -R www-data /path/to/your/external/folder\nsudo chmod -R g+w /path/to/your/external/folder \n\n", "Q: How to fix \"Server Not Found\" on my home wifi while using my laptop with Ubuntu Cinnamon?

I think i should use it like:\nls /home/mydir | grep stomething\n\nThe next question is (no idea how to do this) how to use ls and another command to count number of dirs in main folder?\n\nA: Your usage of ls and grep is correct, that will find any results in the ls output containing 'stomething'.

I have a 3 TB LDM Windows partition that was from a Windows 8 install that hibernated and I have since lost the hiberfil.sys or ability to boot into that install (through my own stupid actions, but that's beside the point). \nThe partition has ~ 1.6 TB of data that I would like to keep and use.

About a year ago I installed Ubuntu 13.10 side-by-side with Windows 8.\nA few weeks later I updated it to 14.04 (only so I could stop seeing the \"available updates\" message) and I updated my Windows 8 to 8.1 (because my laptop gave me no choice on the matter).\nAfter I did all that, something weird happened which caused my laptop not to show me my operating systems when I powered it on, and instead it went straight to Windows 8 all the time. However this didn't mean I couldn't enter my Ubuntu system, but I had to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the machine by pressing the Assist system so I could get into the UEFI loader, and from there I could enter my BIOS.\n\n*Change my BIOS mode to legacy and restart and wait for a not-so-nice message saying it couldn't find any operating systems.\n\n*Power off, and repeat step 1, and change BIOS mode back to UEFI.\n\n*Restart and it would show me that screen, asking which OS I wanted to boot.\n\n\nNow, at that time I was too busy to try and fix that. And then I stopped using Ubuntu altogether. One, because I got a Mac, and since they're both UNIX based systems I could do on the Mac everything I could do in Ubuntu; and two, because they now keep a Ubuntu machine in my office so I can store and test any new projects I develop.\nSo, at the moment I don't really need Ubuntu, so much as I'm starting to need the space it takes, and I want to delete it from my Hard Drive.\nFor this purpose I watched some Youtube videos, but they led me nowhere, since they show their Computer Management window in Windows 8, and it only shows 4 partitions. 2 for Linux and 2 for Windows, but in my case, for some reason, I have many more, and I don't want to delete anything if that could mean damaging my Windows partition...

If it doesn't, shopt -s dotglob ; chown -R you:you /media/you/wherever will fix it so it does. The shopt command makes it include hidden files, & the chown changes ownership to your new UID & GID.\nNow, use `blkid /dev/sdx4' to get the UUID for your home partition, add it to /etc/fstab -\nsudo vi /etc/fstab or whatever editor you prefer\nUUID=78995654kjhgjyt7896 /home ext4 defaults 0 1 - obviously, using your UUID & filesystem type here.\nmount -a should now replace your home directory with the old one, although a reboot is a better idea as you may get some odd effects if you just remount.\nYou can then delete your old system - /dev/sdx1, and sdx2 -others beware as that is sometimes an extended partition and may hold your home directory!

I did not try on other version.\n", "Q: Disk /dev/root full, but cannot identify the reason I need some help to fix some disk space issue.\nActually I'm using a private vps cloud server with 50Gb of disk space.\nWhen I run df -h, I get :\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/root        48G   45G  570M  99% /\ndevtmpfs        2.0G  4.0K  2.0G   1% /dev\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nnone            395M  524K  395M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /run/shm\nnone            100M     0  100M   0% /run/user\n\ndf -i returns :\nFilesystem      Inodes IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on\n/dev/root      3141600 78065 3063535    3% /\ndevtmpfs        505084  1438  503646    1% /dev\nnone            505206     2  505204    1% /sys/fs/cgroup\nnone            505206   891  504315    1% /run\nnone            505206     2  505204    1% /run/lock\nnone            505206     1  505205    1% /run/shm\nnone            505206     2  505204    1% /run/user\n\nBut when I run du -sh / | sort -nr | head, I get :\ndu: cannot access â/sys/kernel/slab/L2TP/IPv6â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/sys/kernel/slab/L2TP/IPâ: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/391/task/391/fd/4â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/391/task/391/fdinfo/4â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/391/fd/4â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/391/fdinfo/4â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/402â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/32350â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/32354â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/32356â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/32360â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/32363â: No such file or directory\ndu: cannot access â/proc/32368â: No such file or directory\n8.9G    /\n\nSo I know that both commands don't return the same kind of informations.

But the 7 folders (7 days backup) only use 1.7gb of disk space.\n\nA: Do you have any other partitions that you occasionally mount? I just tried to help a guy with a similar problem a few hours ago: 14.04 disk mount problem came our of left field As we found out together, he once mounted a partition for backup and it crashed (power fail I think). After that, the partition somehow stayed in a mounted state as an unaccessible folder in /media/ and also counted to the disk usage info. He finally just deleted the corrupted mountpoint to solve the issue.\nSo do you also have any dead mounts? Then you can try removing them (backup is always recommended! I take no responsibility for eventually damaged data!).\n\nA: OP said\nI figured it out. \nActually I was using a script to launch the backup and sync to dropbox of my app files. Things are : I have a sync script which tells what is the application to get the backups from, then sync it to dropbox. But the sync is both way. \nAnd the temporary sync files are in the same folder as the sync script. For an unknown reason, the script was executed multiple times instead of once (probably a bad cron configuration). So each instance was using some disk space to sync and I finally ran out of disk space.\n", "Q: How to properly provide license when packaging? I wrote  a BTRSF GUI for Ubuntu and  I want to license it with the MIT License.Now that I'm packaging it in a .deb format how and were should I include a copy of the license?\n\nA: Set your licenses in debian/copyright (in your build source). This should be automatically transposed into /usr/share/doc/PACKAGE/copyright during the packaging process.\n", "Q: cp Cannot Stat '-r' Strange issue, for some reason, when I'm running a copy command, it's treating the -r flag as an argument.\nsudo cp –r usr/* /usr\n\nThe following is the error:\ncp: cannot stat ‘–r’: No such file or directory\n\nI know that -r doesn't exist as a file/directory, that's because it's a flag of to cp command, not an argument.\nHow can I resolve this?\n\nA: Per the comments, it looks like you've copied a long-dash (&ndash;). This is syntactically different to a regular dash and the cp command is just reading it like it's a filename.\nEndashes are slightly but noticeably longer than regular dashes. There's an even longer version called an emdash. Here's a comparison between the three:\n- dash\n– endash\n— emdash\n\nIf you've copied this organically from a web page, this might explain it. Wordpress substitutes a double dash for an emdash and I'm sure there's a wierd substitution for an endash too.\nTo type this manually, most users need to use the compose key combo: Compose--.\nIf your keyboard is generating these on its own, there's something odd going on in your keymap. Longer dashes aren't —as far as I know— standard base punctuation for any language.\n", "Q: Can I run programs on stock Ubuntu? I've compiled a C++ program using the Sublime Text build system, but on a different computer it says \"Permission denied.\".\nOption to execute as a program is marked, I think I set the permissions to 755 too.\nIs there anything that I need to do? Do I need to install gcc to run programs?\nEdit: I was using the file from my pendrive (FAT32), that could be the problem maybe. But if I need to set permissions I'd move the the file to the Desktop.\n\nA: \nI was using the file from my pendrive (FAT32), that could be the problem maybe.\n\nAlmost definitely. We have questions on executing on FAT-based filesystems dating right back to the start of Ask Ubuntu.\nSimply put, that's probably your problem if you're using the default mount options and the best fix is to switch to a better filesystem. Ext4, even NTFS... Just something mildly POSIX compliant that supports execute bits. Or you can hack around it and manually mount all the files as 755 (eugh).\nYou can sidestep the permissions framework by executing the file with the ld linker system. It's a bit messy but it should work for a binary file (probably won't work on scripts):\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /path/to/64bit-binary\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2 /path/to/32bit-binary\n\nIf it's a script you can also load a file through its interpreter's binary (rather than relying on a shebang):\nsh /path/to/script.sh\npython /path/to/script.py\n\n", "Q: USB keyboard sometimes works sometimes it doesn't I'm using xubuntu 14.04 LTS.

It seems that it is the same on every Ubuntu machine. At least on 12.04.\nThis is how I debugged the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had Asterisk, Linphone and Wireshark already installed.\nI run all of them. \n\n*I make Wireshark to listen on \"lo\". Normally there was nothing showing in Wireshark. \n\n*Then I call a hello world on localhost. I see that the first communication from Linphone to asterisk happens at 0sec, then something happens at 0.5sec, then a long pause and the next packet is almost 3 sec later. That was my problem.\n\n\nBelow is how I fixed it. It gets rid of that long 3 sec delay, although there is still 0.5sec, that I cannot get rid of.\nAs it turns out dnsmasq that comes with network-manager was resolving localhost by asking a remote DNS server , opendns in my case.\nIn /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf I commented out #dns=dnsmasq \nthen\nsudo service network-manager stop\nsudo netstat -anlp | grep -w LISTEN\n\nkill all running dnsmasq processes\nsudo apt-get install dnsmasq\n\nThen configure dnsmasq, make sure in /etc/dnsmasq.conf you have \n# Listen only on localhost\nlisten-address=127.0.0.1\nbind-interfaces\n\nAnd this is all.

Does it have to be run from command line?\nShouldn't I be able to run it by double clicking on the script name?\n\nA: To run a TCL script from the command line, cd to the appropriate directory and then tclsh your_script.tcl \nThe effects of double clicking it depend upon the configuration of your desktop, and also what the script actually does - it may only send any output to the console, for which you'd need to have run it from the command line. \n\nA: The problem lies with you not configuring the Nautilus properly.\nRefer to this post How do I run executable scripts in Nautilus? , change the Executable Text Files to Run executable text files when they are opened.\nYou can try the following helloworld script to test, the first line please change it to the path of your tclsh (you can find that by which tclsh:\n#!/usr/bin/tclsh\npackage require Tk\nbutton .b -text {Push Me} -command {tk_messageBox -message {hello, world}}\npack .b\n\n\nThe result will look something like this.\n", "Q: dual booting ubuntu 14.04 with windows 7 ultimate 6 months ago I formatted my 320GB hard disk drive and changed the partition table to GPT, then I installed windows 8.1. With gparted I formated my whole hard disk and changed the partition table to MSDOS. Then I installed windows 7 ultimate. \nAfter that I started to install ubuntu 14.04 but there was no option to install along side my windows 7. I didn't pay attention and I selected something else. I made 30 GB partition for Ubuntu and 3 GB for swap with gparted. All the things went well but when I started the lap top again it was only Uuntu booting and there wasn't any option to choose windows booting. It seemed that windows is not installed. \nThen I again formated my HDD and installed windows 7. Now I want to install ubuntu but still facing the same problem. There is no option to install along side windows 7. Ubuntu doesn't recogniz my os. I tried sudo os-prober but it answers nothing. \nWhat should I do ?\nI do really love ubuntu?\nSorry for my bad english.\nWith special thanks. \n\nA: It is best, IMO, to install the Windows OS first, in its NTFS partition as you have done. Then install Ubuntu. When you get to the Replace/Alongside/Something Else choices for partitioning, click the Something Else option. This gets you to a partition editor like gparted or similar. Use that to choose or create partitions for Linux swap (maybe about 12 Gig) and for Ubuntu itself (maybe 50 Gig, or more if you think you will need). You can use file system type EXT4 for the Ubuntu partition. The Linux swap partition has its own file system type: linux swap. When your partitions seem satisfactory, continue the installation. (Sorry that the installation instructions are unclear at that point for someone not accustomed to partitioning.)\n", "Q: Resizing swap partition after installing Ubuntu 12.04 I have a few gigabytes of unused space on my hard drive. How can I add this extra space to my swap partition?\n\nA: I recommend you use gParted, a pretty easy-to-use GUI tool to do partitioning stuff. \nIf the unpartitioned space is physically directly allocated next to your current swap partition, you can just change its size to also cover the free space. This is easy.  \nBut if there are other partitions between the free space and the old swap, you have to move the partitions in between them. This takes a bit more time and is risky (there is always the danger of losing data when you edit partitions - do a backup first!), but also possible. However, you should avoid moving (bootable) system partitions, as this could get you in trouble at the next restart...  \nAnyway, about what amount of space are we talking? Having swap partitions bigger than maybe 2x RAM size or 8GB (values guessed by myself!) does not lead to better performance. It will just lay there useless.\n\nA: Fortunately in my case free space is next to the swap partition. So I do the following steps to resize my swap partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install GParted from Software Center.\n\n*Run Gparted and search for your current swap location. It's /dev/sda8 for me.\n\n*Open a teminal and type:\n sudo swapoff /dev/sda8\n\n\n*Resize the swap using Gparted.\nRight click on swap-Linux and select Resize/Move. Next determine your new swap    size and click Resize/Move. Finally apply the pending operation using Edit menu.\n\n*Finally type the following command in the terminal:\n sudo swapon /dev/sda8\n\n", "Q: Why firefox page scrolling is slow on Ubuntu 14.04? Why on the firefox default installation (on 14.04) the page scrolling is so slow?\nWith Chromium I haven't this problem.\nMy hw: 4GB RAM and a nvidia video card (9600 GT).\nThanks!\n\nA: You might need to install your video cards drivers.  By default ubuntu usually installs the open source version which sometimes don't work as well.\nYou can find out if this is the case by type \"Additional Drivers\" into the launcher -> search scopes.\nIt should look something like this. Make sure you pick the Nvidia Legacy I believe is the correct version for your Video Card.\n\nYou can also try and enable smooth scrolling in Firefox if it isn't activated. \n\n", "Q: Infra-Red Remote control on Ubuntu I've just got a  new computer (Fujitsi-Simens Amilo Xi 3670). It came with a remote control for windows Vista. Is there any way to make it work with Ubuntu 14.10?\n\nA: Yes there is:  (I have a Siemens too so both experiences should be similar)\nWhen you do an lsusb | grep --ignore-case infrared you should receive output similar to this:\nBus 004 Device 002: ID 1934:0702 Feature Integration Technology Inc. (Fintek) \nIntegrated Consumer Infrared Receiver/Transceiver\n\nThat is the host adapter for the remote control.\nThen you should copy the Remote Control Transceiver Configuration into a file and save it for inclusion in the following step.\nThen you should:\napt-get install lirc\n\nto install the Linux Infra-red Remote Control support and when it asks you for a remote control file, browse to the file you've just saved above and it should be working out of the box now.\nTo show where the device is, do a: ls /dev/lir* and the output should show you the device.\nTo test it in VLC player, do the

Use Kali Linux instead of it!\nBut although I can provide you some help here. The ifconfig does not show any wireless device!

I have installed it with 3 IDE drives and Lubuntu.\n(1) I am trying to get it to be seen on my network so as I can transfer files/movies back and forth.\n(2) Also how to get the drives seen from the networked PCs\nAny pointers/links to how to do this would be most appreciated. \nG\n\nA: Assuming the computers on your network are Windows PCs, the easiest way to share files and folders from Lubuntu would be to configure samba (an open-source implementation of Windows sharing protocols).\nThere's a step-by-step guide here: How to Create a Network Share Via Samba Via CLI (Command-line interface/Linux Terminal) - Uncomplicated, Simple and Brief Way!\n...which might look a little intimidating at first, but it's definitely doable and could be a great learning experience as you get started with Linux. That wiki is a little old though, so I've updated a little bit. A more modern (but less explanatory) guide is available in the Server Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/samba-fileserver.html\nEssentially, you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Samba\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install samba\n\n\n*Create the directory to share - and I would put it either in your user's home folder or in the /srv folder (you can make this if it's not there). You can make that folder in PCManFM (the file manager) by clicking File > Create New... Folder and give it a name. If you'd rather do that in the command line, it would be something like:\nmkdir /home/*linux-username*/*folder-to-share*\n\n(replace *linux-username* with your Linux username and *folder-to-share* with the name of the desired folder)\n\n\n*Make a backup of your configuration file in case things go wrong:\nsudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf ~\n\n\n*Edit the configuration file using this command:\nsudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nOr, if you'd rather use a graphical text editor, you could use leafpad:\n    sudo leafpad /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nMost of the configuration can be left alone (try not to delete anything in the file, especially the # symbols along the left edge of the page, unless you'd like to enable that option) - but you'll want to add at the bottom of the page or so:\n[share]\n    comment = Ubuntu File Server Share\n    path = /home/linux-username/folder-to-share\n    browsable = yes\n    guest ok = yes\n    read only = no\n    create mask = 0755\n\nNote: /home/linux-username/folder-to-share should be the same as the folder you created in step 2.\nNote 2: If you are NOT okay with guests on your share, delete the line \"guest ok = yes\".\nNote 3: Spacing is important here. Make sure you have exactly one space on each side of the = character.\n\n\n*You might need to add yourself as a samba user:\nsudo smbpasswd -a *username*\n\n\n*You will need to restart samba for this to take effect:\nsudo restart smbd\n\nsudo restart nmbd\n\n", "Q: My custom .desktop file appears in Dash as a text file I recently installed MATLAB on my computer. I found that while I could easily start MATLAB from the terminal, there was no executable file I could double click on to run it. So I created a Bash script to run MATLAB and then created a .desktop file and saved it in /usr/share/applications/. Here's the content of that .desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=MATLAB\nHidden=false\nExec=Desktop/Programs/scripts/runMatlab.sh\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/matlabIcon.jpg\nCategories=Application;\n\nIf I look inside /usr/share/applications/, I indeed see an executable file with the name MATLAB and the appropriate icon, and if I double click on it MATLAB will run just fine. However, if I type MATLAB into Dash, matlab.desktop appears as a text file. It doesn't have the correct name (MATLAB) or correct icon, and if I click on it Gedit will open instead of the file being executed.\nHow can I fix this?\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04 by the way.\n\nA: First of all, move the .desktop file to /usr/share/applications/ (global launchers, needs root permission to move file) or to ~/.local/share/applications/ (only for the current user).*\nEDIT: When you run desktop-file-install, this is not necessary as it automatically copies the file to /usr/share/applications/\nThen, after checking your .desktop file for errors with desktop-file-install filename.desktop (no output means no errors, but even some warnings may not prevent the launcher from working),\nyou add it to the Unity dash by running sudo desktop-file-install filename.desktop (EDIT: root privileges required to access /usr/share/applications/ where global launchers are stored). Please note that this command might add some lines to the original .desktop file.\nI hope this solved your problem. Greetings!\n(Source: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles)\n\nA: If you take a good look in Dash, you will find out that matlab.desktop does not appear as an application, but the file  matlab.desktop appears in search, or recently used, since you obviously edited it.\nThe error\nThe reason is that Dash does not see it as a valid .desktop file for (at least) the following reason:\n\n*\n\n*You should not use relative paths in a .desktop file (Desktop/Programs/scripts/runMatlab.sh is relative), but absolute paths.\nOther possible reasons could be an invalid icon path or the fact that you call the script without the preceding sh (if the script is not executable, but given the other information in your question, that seems not to be the case).\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*Another thing is that if you store the script on what appears to be a local directory, you should not store the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications, but in ~/.local/share/applications.\n\n\n*There is no need to make a .desktop file executable if you run it from Dash or the Launcher. Most launchers in either /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications are not. Only if you locate it on- and run it from your Desktop.\n", "Q: Creating command history list Is there a way to display a list comprised of the last n terminal commands made by a particular user ? \n\nA: Every user has a .bash_history file, present in his home directory. i.e. /home/<USERNAME>/.bash_history. It stores all the command executed by a particular user.\nYou can use this file to see the command executed by a user. (You need root privilege to access file of other user.)\ntail -n /home/<USERNAME>/.bash_history\n\nDon't forget to replace n with actual number.\n\nA: If your shell is bash, then the best way is to use the history command:\n(HISTFILE=/home/user/.bash_history; history -c; history -r; history n)\n\nWhile a bit complicated, this provides all the benefits of the history command (such as timestamps, if you have enabled it). The parentheses (()) ensure the commands are run in a subshell and don't affect the current shell.\n\nA: tail -n /home/userinquestion/.bash_history would seem the obvious answer - assuming they have bash as their shell, of course..\nIf there is a terminal open, it may not have written commands to the history file yet.\nYou will need to use su or sudo if the user is not yourself.\n\nA: One other option is to create a simple shell script that does this:\n#!/bin/bash\ntail --lines=$1 /home/$(whoami)/.bash_history\n\nThis takes g-P's answer and makes it just a little prettier by doing more stuff automatically.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run nano history-lookup.sh (or whatever name you want - just end it in .sh) \n\n*Paste that code in \n\n*Press Ctrl+O then Ctrl+X to save and exit.\n\n*Run bash history-lookup.sh NUMBER-OF-ENTRIES. It should spit them out nicely onto the screen.\n\nA: Please try:\nhistory | tail -n20 > history20.txt\n\nBy sending the result to a text file, you can print, review, email, etc. the text file at any time.\n", "Q: Issue with linux-image-3.13.0-44-generic & linux-image-extra-3.13.0-44-generic I've been using Ubuntu Server for a few months now.\nI'm getting the below OUTPUT after running sudo apt-get -f upgrade:\n\nReading package lists...

Specifically @muru's link helped a lot. Be careful though, that you don't do what I did, and end up removing files that are actually important to the running of the PC (like the network). :)\n", "Q: USB Installed Ubuntu server fails to load without USB I have tried installing the Ubuntu server (version 14.04) onto my acer desktop using my USB. I configured the USB through Universal USB Installer (version 1.9.5.7), using the option that said Ubuntu Server Installer. \nI booted into the USB and did the installation, making sure to check that I installed it on the hard drive and not on the USB. After the installation finished, I removed the USB, as the prompt asked, and I restarted the computer. All I got after that was a black screen with a blinking underscore on the top left. I waited a while to see if it would change, but it did not. Then I booted in with the USB and the server worked. However, I do not need it on a USB; I need it on the computer's hard drive.\nI did this process twice and got the same results.\nI appreciate any help.\n\nA: Okay, after some trial and error, I found out that Universal USB Installer does not properly install the Ubuntu Server, of all options. Therefore, I had to use Rufus to create my bootable USB. After that, everything went perfectly. If anyone has an idea of why this is the case, I would be very interested to know.\nAfter all, I've used UUI for many other installs and it worked perfectly. Why wouldn't it work with the Ubuntu Server option? \n", "Q: Can't get Grub to load windows after using Boot repair I have windows 7 64bit, installed on pc, installed ubuntu 14.04lts, everything looked and worked great, until I went to load windows, and would just get a purple window.\nI found the information to repair this with Boot-repair. It worked & am now able to boot up Windows, but only Windows. :/\nA little advice in simpleton words on how to get dual boot working properly at this point?\n\nA: I had a same problem with boot-repair that it could not recognize windows and it was just Ubuntu option on purple screen but sudo update-grub worked for me.\n", "Q: juju deploy ceph hangs in pending in maas environment I have ubuntu 14.04.1 with maas 1.7.1 rc4 and juju 1.20.14.  My client machine is commissioned and deployed.  I can ssh ubuntu@cl1stn2.maas and I can juju ssh 1 successfully.  I did \"juju deploy --config config.yaml ceph --to 1\".\njuju status ceph looks like:\njuju status ceph\nenvironment: maas\nmachines:\n  \"1\":\n    agent-state: pending\n    dns-name: cl1stn2.maas\n    instance-id: /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-caa78cae-a5d5-11e4-b918-180373b04ac9/\n    series: trusty\n    hardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=16 mem=24576M tags=auitsdisk\nservices:\n  ceph:\n    charm: cs:trusty/ceph-31\n    exposed: false\n    relations:\n      mon:\n      - ceph\n    units:\n      ceph/0:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: \"1\"\n        public-address: cl1stn2.maas\nnetworks:\n  maas-em1:\n    provider-id: maas-em1\n    cidr: 10.20.0.0/24\n\nI don't see any attempt to contact cl1stn2.maas and the status stays in pending for ever.  I can ssh to cl1stn2.maas and juju ssh 1 successfully.  I don't see anything in the all-machines.log.\nWhere do I look to find out what it is waiting for?\n\nA: Juju attempts to start a new machine and use cloud-init to inject the script necessary to download and start a juju agent process.  This process then contacts the juju state server (machine 0) and check in.  The status remains in pending forever until the client checks in.\nIf anything goes wrong with this process then the machine stays in pending state forever.\nThe simplest solution with juju and it's cloud thinking, is to just remove the unit and wait for it to clean up and power down the server and then add a new unit and let it deploy it all again.\nIf it continues to fail after several retries, then it is more than likely that there is something wrong with your networking configuration.\n", "Q: How to use multiple screens on Ubuntu 14.04 How can I get two screens show half and half of my desktop? On Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: I don't believe combining displays is supported by default.\nYou can extend the display and then remove the launcher by going into settings -> displays.\nAfter that you will have 2 screens that you can use.  Sometimes you even need to turn off display mirroring if that is enabled. \n\n", "Q: CVE-2015-0235 How to update eglibc to 2.15-0ubuntu10.10 I followed these instructions and found that my glibc version was 2.15-0ubuntu10.9. How do I update it to 2.15-0ubuntu10.10?\nIt is also mentioned here that services have to be restarted after the update. How do I know which services I have to restart?\n\nA: If you're on 12.04 or 10.04, you don't need to do anything special to upgrade. The usual procedure applies:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nOr, specifically:\nsudo apt-get install libc6\n\nTo verify, run apt-cache policy:\n$ apt-cache policy libc6\nlibc6:\n  Installed: 2.15-0ubuntu10.10\n  Candidate: 2.15-0ubuntu10.10\n  Version table:\n *** 2.15-0ubuntu10.10 0\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     2.15-0ubuntu10.9 0\n        500 http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main amd64 Packages\n\nThe USN notice is more cautious, and given the core nature of libc, I second it:\n\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\n  all the necessary changes.\n\n", "Q: How can I set the User Agent in a webapp? I have developed a simple web application which is in the click store and available for users to install on their phone. Some websites require a special UA string in order to render correctly and I'd like to reluctantly do that in my webapp. \nHow do I override the UA in my webapp?\n\nA: You have basically 2 ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*in your desktop file, update the Exec= line by adding --user-agent-string='Your UA' to it,\n\n*add a webapp-properties.json file in your webapp folder such as:\n\n\nhttp://bazaar.launchpad.net/~dbarth/+junk/webbapp-whichbrowser/view/head:/webapp-properties.json\nthere is a small caveat here, you have to move your other command line definition (such as --webappUrlPatterns) in that file (in the \"includes\" section), and add --webappModelSearchPath=. or --local-webapp-manifest (which is a shortcut for the latter) to your Exec= line,\n", "Q: Can I create a launcher for keyboard shortcuts? Just to clarify, I do not want to create keyboard shortcuts that run desktop icons.\nIs there any way to create a desktop shortcut that, when clicked, runs a keyboard shortcut combination? I find the Super +Shift +W shortcut to be extremely useful, but I am often using the mouse only for extended periods, and switching windows frequently. Going to the keyboard to do so is rather tedious. \ncan I make a desktop icon that runs Super +Shift +W when clicked?\nI am aware that there are other questions of a similar nature, but none I have found have really answered the question.\n\nA: The very \"basic\" version of what you are looking for would be:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Show\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 0.25&&xdotool key Shift_L+Super_L+w\"\nType=Application\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*You would have to install xdotool (as mentioned by @Takkat):\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Then paste the code above into an empty file, save it as (e.g.): show.desktop\n\n*Then:\n\n*\n\n*if you want to run it from your desktop: make it executable and run it by double-click\n\n*If you want to run it from the Launcher: move it into ~/.local/share/applications, drag it from there on to the Launcher.\n\n\n\nExplanation\nWith xdotool, you can simulate keyboard strokes. The command to run your keyboard combination by xdotool is:\nxdotool key Shift_L+Super_L+w\n\nWhy the pause of 0.25 sec?\nWithout the pause, the script would start while you were double clicking the icon, and break the command.\nIf you strictly use the starter from the Launcher, the Exec= line can be:\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"xdotool key Shift_L+Super_L+w\"\n\nNote\nThe .desktop file is the most (possible) basic version of a .desktop file. You can \"dress\" it with an icon, for example, with an Icon= line, with the path to an icon you'd want to use. More on options here.\n", "Q: Cannot install ubuntu 14.04.1 alongside Windows 8.1 I am trying to dual boot my old PC (an Acer extensa e264) currently running Windows 8.1 with Ubuntu 14.04.\nHowever, when I choose to install alongside Windows and continue, the installation CD is ejected and the screen remains black.\nI have tried using different installation CDs and USB sticks and I've also tried Ubuntu Gnome 14.10.\nHow can I resolve this issue?\nUPDATE: here is the link for the gParted screenshot and when 1 try to install Ubuntu on a partition\n\n\n\nA: I'd the same probleme and I successed to solve this issue. The probleme is that your partition are certainly in MBR but, and I don't now how to explain clearly, it rest some GTP. Also try to do this command in the terminal:\nsudo gdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nIt will show that GTP is present or exist.\nAfter, do:\nsudo fixparts /dev/sda\n\nI hope I can help you.\n", "Q: I can't resize/partition my disk in Ubuntu 14.04 I am new to Ubuntu. A week ago I installed Ubuntu and by mistake I installed it in the Windows partition. What I did was that I deleted all the files from Windows and only installed Ubuntu 14.04.\nEverything has been OK since then but I realised that there are almost no games to play in Linux, so I want to dual boot my computer because I still want to use Ubuntu.\nI can't resize my disk, and I don't know why.\nAh, by the way my computer is a Sony Vaio (I don't know the ID).\n\nA: You can't resize or otherwise edit a mounted partition, and if you're working from inside Ubuntu (rather than, say, from a Live CD or USB), the partition Ubuntu is installed to is mounted.  Reboot from a Live medium, and you'll be able to do all the resizing and repartitioning you need.\nBe careful, you already know why you should back up first!\n", "Q: Wifi Intel Centrino N-2230 not working on Dell Inspiron 17r SE on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I had to reinstall my Ubuntu system because it was not working properly so I did with a USB installation and I kept my old /home.

500GB free space (no other /dev/) I have trouble installing Ubuntu, which I want to be alongside Windows 8. There is no alongside option but only the 'Erase disk and install Ubuntu' option and also 'Use something else'.  It is as if my disk is empty without any Windows 8 OS.\nI know that I can install it using the 'Use something else' option... by creating a partition in the Windows 8. By shrinking and get the unallocated 20GB free space partition (at which I already have currently) and I also know when I exceed 4 partitions, then the installation won't work, so now I only have:\n\n\n*\n\n*C:partition 175GB NTFS,\n\n*E: partition 270GB NTFS,\n\n*System reserve partition 350MB NTFS, and;\n\n*also 20GB unallocated partition (I made for Ubuntu).\n\n\nBut when I boot Ubuntu from a USB flash drive, pressing F12, I then have both the 'Try Ubuntu' and 'Install' options.\nWhen I click 'Install', I still don't have the 'Install alongside' option. Instead \nI only have the 'Erase and install Ubuntu' option.\nAlso, when I click on 'Use something else', it only shows:\nDev/\n Free space 500 000 Mb. \n\nAs if there is no primary partition. Because normally it would show:\ndev/ sda1 ntfs\ndev/ sda2 \ndev/ sda3\n\nSo I am afraid to proceed because the free space I made was, and should be, 20GB and not the whole 500GB.\nI need help. \nI've been searching all over internet and I couldn't find a problem that is the same as mine. I would really appreciate any help. Frankly, I'm really tired of using the 'Try Ubuntu' option.\nP.S. My Windows 8 was installed by PC technician when my laptop was reformatted. \n\nA: Do the 'Try Ubuntu' to boot in to the live disk, and then open up the partition manager (Gparted) to see what partitions are really on the drive.\nOr go back in to Windows, winkey+x to bring up the little menu of options from the Desktop, go in to Disk Manager and do the same thing. \nMake sure there are really only 3 primary partitions, leaving one available for Ubuntu. If you already have 4 primaries used, you'll need to do some juggling. \n\nA: I found the answer eventually, the types were all basics. But the solution is here Re: 'Install alongside' not available while trying Dual Boot with Win7 64bit . Even I'm a bit hazy about that GPT but anyway yeah it worked perfectly. I am now able to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.\nWell anyway, thanks Dale A. for your suggestions.\n\nA: I also had this problem and even after searching a lot I still wasn't able to find a working solution. So I started tinkering myself and for me the solution was  the following.\nFirst download the MiniTool Partition wizard software. When installed open the application and check whether the partition type of the drive where the windows is installed is of the PRIMARY type. If not then change the disk type to PRIMARY using this minitool partition software and then try to install Ubuntu again. This time it will show the option to \"install alongside windows\". Don't forget to check the \"apply\" in the software to apply the changes.\nYou will have to restart your computer and after restarting it will work without loading into Windows. Read carefully and Do not press any key as you don't want to cancel the operation which the software is working on.\n", "Q: How to connect Bluetooth headset with laptop I'm using a Dell Vostro 1015 laptop, running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I have a Nokia BH-108 Bluetooth headset which I use with my Nokia device. I want to connect it with my laptop, but haven't been able to. Can anyone explain in simple plain English how to do that?\n\nA: One thing that is usually needed to use a headset or other audio device is a module for pulse audio. Open a terminal window with Ctrl+Alt+T and enter \npactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nand then pair with the device.\nIt is an Atheros bluetooth that you might not have firmware for, so if the above doesn't work, first try\nsudo apt-get install linux-firmware\n\nand reboot.\n", "Q: Are there any icons for folders that fit in with gnome shell?

Made a search on StackExchange and other places and looks like the most commonly agreed approach is either use iptables-save/iptables-restore or iptables-persistent package. I'd prefer (may be due to my not yet matured Linux nature) to keep iptables rules in \"explicit\" form (e.g. iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT) instead of having all different rules dumped into the same persistent file where, without comments and some structure, could be tricky to find a particular rule and change it.\nWhat I did so far - I've added following line to the /etc/network/interfaces\npost-up         sh -c \"/etc/iptables/eth0.post-up.sh\"\n\nwhere eth0.post-up.sh is a file where iptables are explicitly set (e.g. iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT). All would be good, rules are applied, but the reason I'm writing here is that if I try to run iptables -L FORWARD then I don't see the loaded rules, though I'm sure they are applied (it's a subnet forwarding rules and I see that ping goes through when the rule has run and that it doesn't when the rule hasn't run. Here is the output:\n# iptables -L FORWARD\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nufw-before-logging-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-before-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-after-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-after-logging-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-reject-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-track-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n\nIf I comment out the above post-up ... in the /etc/network/interfaces file (making sure the rules are not applied) and then run the rules manually I get the output:    \n# iptables -L FORWARD\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\nufw-before-logging-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-before-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-after-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-after-logging-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-reject-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nufw-track-forward  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere\nACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             state RELATED,ESTABLISHED \n\nSo, the rules are applied in both cases, but in the former case then iptables -L doesn't show the rules, and in later ase it does.\nUltimately it works but I'd like to understand what's the caveat here, why it looks like I'm the only one around who is trying to use this approach, and why iptables -L doesn't give me expected output.\nUPDATE: have to correct myself, not all iptables rules in eth0.post-up.sh file are executed, out of 3 commands below:\n/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT\n/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nonly the last one (wiht POSTROUTING) is executed which is required for ping to go through, where as the first two neither have any traces in the iptables -Lnv FORWARD nor result in connection getting established (e.g. wget google.com) from another computer which uses this box as a router. But if I run this file manually after boot - then all is executed correctly, both ping and wget from remote computer work as expected.\n\nA: I use softether vpn on my pi. I use this gist to set it up. \nSoftether (or at least this script) puts iptable rules in /etc/rc.local \nAs an example, this is mine \n # Start VPN Settings\n\n for vpn in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*; do echo 0         > $vpn/accept_redirects; echo 0 > $vpn/      send_redirects; done\n iptables -A FORWARD -i br0 -o br0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n iptables -A FORWARD -i br0 -o br0 -j ACCEPT\n\n # End VPN Settings\n\n exit 0\n\nThis should run your iptable commands on boot. May be a more appropriate way, but this seems to work for me (at least as far as vpn concerned, never had any issues) \nJust make sure you put tables before \n exit 0\n\n", "Q: Error fetching interface information: Device not found Running 14.04 on VMWare player, I am trying to configure a new Ethernet device eth1 through editing /etc/network/interfaces.\nI have configured a device for eth0, and that is working properly.\nHere is my interfaces file:\n\nAnd the output from ifconfig -a:\n\nI have tried sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart and sudo service networking restart\nof which both work, but running ifconfig eth1 returns\neth1: error fetching interface information: Device not found.\n\nI have also tried suggestions from other threads such as leaving out some fields such as network from interfaces, to no avail.\n\nA: Have you added a second interface unit in vmware?\nhttps://www.vmware.com/support/ws55/doc/ws_net_configurations_changing_vadapters.html\n", "Q: Problems connecting to my school's wifi So I have a lenovo yoga 2 pro with Ubuntu 14.04 installed, and so far I have had to blacklist ideapad_laptop to unblock my wifi adapter. \nNow I'm having a hard time connecting to my school's secure wifi.

I would just look at what runs the most and then type \"which\" command to find out where the most used services are located.  After that I would check the size requirements out of my top 5 most used programs and then figure out future growth and see if it makes sense to put those services on the SSD or not.  I would think MySQL and PHP are going to be some important pieces along with your main application folder.\nIf it is just a home server then I would honestly just install everything on the 2TB HDD and then use the SSD on things I know I would like to have as fast as possible.\nIt is relatively easy to move a directory to a new partition if you find out you would like some additional speed when you find out your usage patterns. \n", "Q: How are the Ubuntu Core rootfs built? Ubuntu provides \"Ubuntu Core\" rootfs for a range of architectures however the wiki page (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core) does not provide any information on how these rootfs are generated or what is the 'best' way to do so.\nHow can I go about generating my own?\n\nA: I don't know for sure those images are prepared this way, but I would think the way you want to do this is to use the debootstrap program, which is the debian tool used to initialize a directory tree to contain the bare minimum set of files/packages to have a usable debian/ubuntu system.  This is the tool used to do a by-hand install from another unix like OS, or to set up a chroot or pbuilder or other type of image.  Either format a filesystem, mount it, and point debootstrap to that location, or create a regular directory that you will later convert to a filesystem image with e.g. mksquashfs.

Apache, Cups, Dovecot, GnuPG, isc-dhcp, lighttpd, mariadb/mysql, nfs-utils, nginx, nodejs, openldap, openssh, postfix, proftpd, pure-ftpd, rsyslog, samba, sendmail, sysklogd, syslog-ng, tcp_wrappers, vsftpd, and xinetd.\n\n\nApparently the test code is available on the University of Chicago website. Therefore you can do:\nwget https://webshare.uchicago.edu/orgs/ITServices/itsec/Downloads/GHOST.c\ngcc GHOST.c -o GHOST\n./GHOST\n\nThe final output would be vulnerable or not vulnerable.\n", "Q: How to fix Virtualbox I'm trying to launch a new windows xp virtual machine, but, when I do, I get this error message:\n\nFailed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_SUPLIB_WORLD_WRITABLE).\nCode d'erreur : NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005) Composant : Console\n  Interface : IConsole {8ab7c520-2442-4b66-8d74-4ff1e195d2b6}\n\n\nHow do I to fix it, please?\n\nA: solved this in the IRC:\nthe file permissions on nearly all / folders are a mess (nearly all have 777).\na\nsudo chmod o-w /usr  \n\ndid fix it. \nBut i strongly suggest a reinstall since there is no way to get the permissions right again for all folders and files.\n", "Q: How can I xprop or xwininfo Gnome-Do? I need to see the X properties of the Gnome-Do popup window, in regard to this question that I asked earlier. The problem is that as soon as the Gnome-Do window loses focus it closes, so I can't change focus to the terminal to run xprop. The answer I keep seeing on the internet is:\nsleep 5; xprop\n\nThen open the Gnome-Do window and wait for xprop to start. It seems clever, but simply doesn't work:\n$ sleep 5; xprop\nxprop: error: Can't grab the mouse.\nThe same goes for xwininfo:\n$ sleep 5; xwininfo \n\nxwininfo: Please select the window about which you\n          would like information by clicking the\n          mouse in that window.\nxwininfo: error: Can't grab the mouse.\nI've also tried running xprop using the Mod+R shortcut in Awesome WM, but while the Gnome-Do window is open, the shortcut doesn't work. It just types an r into the search box.\nI have no more ideas. How do I do this?\n\nA: If you run the script below, it records for 10 seconds (or any other time you set) the output of the xprop command on the frontmost window (running the xprop -root command). Subsequently, it writes the output, after the time has elapsed, to a file: outfile.txt\nIf you make sure to keep the Gnome-Do window active until the script has finished, you can be sure the last record is corresponding to the Gnome-Do window.\nTo use it\n\n*\n\n*Simply copy the script below into an empty file, set, in the head section, the desired path to the output file (outfile =, use an absolute path). Save it as record_xprop.py\n\n\n*Start the script by the command:\n  python3 /path/to/record_xprop.py\n\n\n\n*Call your Gnome-Do window (or any other application you need data from).\n\n\n*After the time has elapsed, your outputfile will show five times the output of the xprop -root command, separated by a dotted line.\nNote\nIf you need more time, just change the \"5\" in the line:\n while t < 5:\n\ninto any other value you need\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\noutfile = \"/home/jacob/Bureaublad/outfile.txt\"\ndata = []; t = 0\nwhile t < 5:\n    data.append(subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"xprop -root\"]).decode(\"utf-8\"))\n    time.sleep(2)\n    t = t + 1\nwith open(outfile, \"wt\") as out:\n    for rec in data:\n        out.write(rec+\"\\n\"+\"-\"*20+\"\\n\\n\")\n\n\nEdit\nIf this does not work for some reason (appearantly the window is not frontmost, as recognized by xprop), we could do the same trick with the wmctrl -l command (replace xprop -root by wmctrl -l in the script), to identify the window by its name first.\nOnce that is done, we can subsequently run again xprop, with the -name option, to get the needed info: xprop -name <windowname>\nFor both commands, you can run either the sleep command, or, if you need more time, run the script again.\n\nA: Jacob got it in the comments!\nUsing the sleep 1; wmctrl -l command, then opening Gnome-Do, I got this output:\n0x00e000b9  0 bonus-debian Do\nWhich shows the name of the Gnome-Do window.

When I cd into a directory containing a .exe that I can run in Wine, how do I run that .exe with primusrun?\nSpecifically, I have installed Skyrim via Steam on PlayOnLinux. I've successfully run other games in Wine, without PlayOnLinux active. But for Skyrim, the game's framerate renders it almost unplayable, even on the lowest settings. I want to run it through primusrun (Bumblebee), so it will use my Nvidia GeForce graphics card instead of the default Intel. Adding primusrun to the command on the shortcut properties allows the game to run using the card, but the game blackscreens after the Bethesda logo, only working properly about 2% of the time.\nWhen I cd into the directory containing TESV.exe, then execute the command primusrun wine TESV.exe in terminal, it just shows a new line as if the command was successfully executed. However, nothing happens to show that that is the case. Nothing launches.\nSo, to summarize, how do I run Skyrim in Wine from the terminal or via a script, using primusrun to designate my Nvidia graphics card as the one to use? Or else, if this is not possible, can someone link me to some directions on how to fix the blackscreen on launch?\n\nA: While this is still an issue for me, I've found a workaround.\nBy adding primusrun to the shortcut, it reliably launches in fully functional form the first time after rebooting my machine. Any subsequent launches are likely to blackscreen, but the first one almost always works.\nAnother workaround is to install SKSE (Skyrim Script Extender), create a PlayOnLinux shortcut for SKSE.exe, and add primusrun to the shortcut properties as well. This runs reliably about 80% of the time, with no need for rebooting between launches. Useful for when your game crashes randomly.\nPlease note, however, that when you close Skyrim, the process does not end properly, so you have to open System Monitor and kill it, or else use the kill command in terminal. Other than that, though, it works pretty well!\n", "Q: Problems with Software Center and Terminal Here's the problem. \nWhen I open Software Center it's black and closes after few seconds, can't do anything.

I could reach other servers as well. But for various reasons I need TAP.\nThe OpenVPN server is a standalone machine behind a NAT(router), so it's not the default GW at the same time.

Anyways I tried to enter the usual commands like\niptables -A INPUT -i tap0 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i br0 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD -i br0 -j ACCEPT\n\nOR\niptables -A FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD -s 10.8.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD -j REJECT\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE\n\nwith changing the eth1 to br0, and tap0 as well, but with no effect.\nActually this iptables and route part is difficult to understand for me.\nIn bridged mode, do I need to have any routing or iptables active to achieve access to all of my servers?\nDo I need to manually add something like\nroute add default gw 192.168.1.1 dev br0\nor anything in that kind to declare a specific route?\nHow to tell my LAN where to \"see\" VPN clients?\nI quess the problem is, that the openvpn server is not the GW, but I can't put openvpn to my dd-wrt hacked router, it's not supported for my model. How can I set up the openvpn server to work around this problem?\n\nA: Ok, found out by myself..\nWhile trying to ping all the possible IPs in my LAN while connected to VPN i figured out that the IPs I cannot reach belong to virtual servers (VirtualBox) only.\nAnd then I gave myself a facepalm... I forgot to adjust the bridged NICs in VirtualBox for the virtual servers to br0 instead of eth1, as it was before.\nJust for convenience I also enabled Promiscuous Mode, because I read on many threads that Promisucous is a MUST regarding the bridged setup.\nNow I can ping eeevrything.\nEvery day I learn something new :)\n", "Q: Userid and Password for localhost:631 on Lubuntu Live USB Session (Background)\nI'm testing Lubuntu for future installation via a live USB.

Now when I boot normally, I reach a screen that simply gives me a grub prompt.

But I want a specific one like: www.therestrictedone.com to be accessible only by VPN clients.\nIs this possible?\nCan I make apache work simultaneously on two ports. So port 80 is accessible from Internet and 81 only within VPN?\nProbably I am saying lot of things without sense? I am just trying to express whats going through my mind with my own words.\n\nA: Couple different ways to do this. If you have no intentions of hosting any other site except for vpn access the quickest and easiest way would be to use a firewall and only allow from local network. Anyone that connects to vpn will be given a local address such as 192.168.1.x. So using UFW\n sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 80\n\nIf you intend to have other sites and are setting this up as a vhost, usually you can throw in an \n Allow from 192.168.1.0/24\n\nOr\n Allow from 192.168.1.*\n\nIn the vhost configuration. I forget the exact format for ip range, but it one of the two referenced above.

Look into the foremost man pages for more info.\nA bit more effort is needed to restore a simple txt file. Here we have no clear start and end markers.\nMy favorite way is to extract the strings from the diskimage and then restore the files manually.\nstrings USBimage.raw > strings.txt\nI open strings.txt with vi and find the text I was looking for “This text is very important to me.”\nGood luck with recovering your data!\n", "Q: Counting printed pages on a network printer In my company I have a printer connected to a PC with Lubuntu and this PC is connected to internal network.

I started using them about 3 months ago. Recently everything was working fine, (I even figured out how to get WoW working perfectly all on my own) but then one day my pc crashed. Soon everything was slow to open until eventually the hard drive would no longer boot. I have the disc i used to install ubuntu so i pop that in. I use the gnome-disks to format the hard drive and make sure everything is okay (tests came back that the hard drive is in fine condition) however when I try to install ubuntu it comes up with \"Input/output error during read on /dev/sda\" I looked around and found it's either the hdd or the cd. With the hdd come back fine (and now that I notice, the cd seems to be running MUCH slower then before) I think it's the disk.\nMy problem, I'm lazy and don't want to buy another disc from the store (living in the middle of nowhere it's hard to get a blank cd without going out of my way) I was wondering since I have to run my pc via the live cd if i can over-write the current files and replace them with a new download from the site, thus I don't have to get a 2nd disc to put the iso file stuff onto that then reinstall? \nForgot to mention: The disc is large enough to have both sets of files (broken and unbroken one it) I'm not sure how it would be able to tell them apart though.....\n\nA: My apologies for writing this as an answer but a comment would not have ta same impact as \nit is my considered opinion that your hard disk is failing, so: Back up your data first! and then do the following:\n\n(What? You're still here???  Go away and back up your data first!)\nBoot your LiveCD, go to the software centre and install smartmontools, then go to a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\nsmartctl --all /dev/sda\n\nand copy the output of what you've got  to http://paste.ubuntu.com and provide the link of that in your question and drop a comment below this answer!\n", "Q: not able to boot up with the key lock on Since installing the latest version have had to hit the key lock key to use the keypad.\nHow can I boot up with the key lock on? \nWithout not having to hit the key lock key every time?\n\nA: If you're talking about the NumLck key, go to the software centre and search for numlockx or through a terminal:\napt-get install numlockx\n\nIf you're talking about the CapsLck key, have a look here: How do I turn off Caps Lock (the lock, not the key) by command line? \n", "Q: Supercomputer from old computers I have many computers sitting around. \n\n\n*\n\n*A netbook\n\n*A laptop \n\n*A desktop\n\n*And another Desktop\n\n\nI was wondering if there is any software that is capable of taking the processing power of the computers and using it to make a powerful server that could host windows or Linux vm?\nWhat kind of connections would you use?\nWhat software could I use?\nWhat applications does this have.\nHas anyone done anything like this?\nDoes this seem do-able.\n\nA: There's an old joke on http://slashdot.org about taking a bunch of old computers and making a Beowulf cluster. \nInterestingly enough, here's a ZDNet article about someone doing just that using a bunch of Raspberry Pi computers: http://www.zdnet.com/article/build-your-own-supercomputer-out-of-raspberry-pi-boards/\nI don't know if you can merge your computers together to make a much larger computer to run a single instance of Linux or Windows. The main issue that you'd run into is the communication between processors. Most computer CPUs need a low-latency/high-bandwidth bus and Gigabit Ethernet just isn't fast enough for this, really.\nThough you can create a Virtual Machine cluster out of the faster computers using the (free) ProxMox Virtual Environment: https://www.proxmox.com/\nThis is totally doable.\n\nA: You could host a mini cloud using software like MAAS (http://maas.ubuntu.com/).\nUsing maas you can manage a cluster of computers; you can deploy workloads to them using tools such as juju (juju.ubuntu.com). Maas takes care of booting and installing the computers when juju requests hardware for deployment.

If user name is embedded  but  pass‐\n      word is missing in URI, aria2 tries to resolve password using .netrc. If pass‐\n      word is found in .netrc, then use it as password. If  not,  use  the  password\n      specified in this option.  Default: ARIA2USER@\n\nSo you can use something like this\naria2c -j5 --ftp-user=yourname --ftp-passwd=password --input-file=list.txt \n\nAnother way may be gnu parallel(check man parallel for more details):\ncat list.txt | parallel -j5 wget --user=mylogin --password=mypassword -P /home/ftp\n\n", "Q: can't bootstrap in Landscape OpenStack Autopilot I use MAAS to make landscape openstack outopilot.

The -d 5 option stands for delay and gives you a delay of 5 seconds to select the window to be in the screenshot.\nInstall with this:\nsudo apt-get install scrot\n\nReference: Ubuntu Manual - scrot \n\nA: You can also use combination of Shift and PrtScr buttons to take screen-shot of a specific area with user-defined dimensions. \nJust press the combination and use the modified-cursor ( it becomes similar to a plus sign ) to choose the area for screen-shot. \n\nA: Script, using Shutter\nI don't think it exists, but like anything, it can be made.\nIf you make the script below available under a key combination (explanation further below), a window will pop up, allowing you to set the margins of your screenshot on the left, right, top and bottom, separated by a space:\n\nresult:\n\nor:\n\nresult:\n\netc.\nI set the default to 30 px, but you can set any default value (see below).\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses Shutter and wmctrl.

If you use Kubuntu, Zenity is not installed by default:\nsudo apt-get install zenity\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file. If you want you can change the \"default' marge in the line of the script:\n`arg =`\n\n\n*save it as custom_screenshot.py.\n\n*Add the script to a key shortcut combination: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\".

On different window managers however, the output of the wmctrl -lG command shows small differences in the y-position of the window. These differences are eliminated by the value, set in the deviation= -line of the script. The currently set value (0) is appropriate for Unity and KDE.\nThe script is also tested, and works fine on Xfce and Gnome, but the value needs to be changed then, as explained in the head section of the script. \nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n\n\"\"\"\nOn different window managers, the window geometry as output of wmctrl differs slightly.\nThe \"deviation\" should compensate these differences.

That hash is always the same when the file or the given string is the same.\nWith the utillity md5pass you do exactly the same, but the hash gets \"salted\". In cryptography, a \"salt\" is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase to raise entropy. Thats why md5pass always outputs a different value.\nWhy salting?\nThe problem is that when users have the same password they have the same hash. If the hash gets salted randomly, every password has a different hash value. The salt must be saved separately in another table, because it is needed to vertify the password. In md5pass the salt can be defined (as the second argument). If no salt is defined the system geneates a random one.\nAnother advantage is that in case of MD5 or SHA rainbow tables are less effective as without a salt, because,  without a salt, the hash value must be calculated just once for every password.\n", "Q: Kernel problem on TOSHIBA I have a SAMSUNG with following specs\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel® Core™ i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4 \n\n*Intel® Ivybridge Mobile \n\n*8 GB internal memory\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit\n\n\nSince quite some time now, my list of kernels starts with the version 3.13.0.39.

Current versions of Xubuntu include a different suite of packages than that release did.\n\n\n*\n\n*When it says \"Package 'foobar' is not installed, so not removed\" - that means you never had that package in the first place, so don't worry about it.\n\n*When it says \"E: Unable to locate package foobar\" or \"E: Couldn't find any package by regex 'foobar'\" - that probably means that exact package is not included in your version of Xubuntu. You could have a similar package with a different name, but you might not.\n\n\nWhat you don't see is all of the packages that are included in your version of Xubuntu that you want to uninstall, but the system is not uninstalling because they are not included in that 3-year old list.\nFor those reasons, the simplest way to replace xubuntu with lubuntu would be to run these three commands:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nAnd then, after logging out and logging in using LXDE (the Lubuntu desktop):\nsudo apt-get purge xubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nSome miscellaneous files or packages may still remain from your Xubuntu installation. If you would like to be as thorough as that guide was, I would recommend running:\napt-cache depends xubuntu-desktop > ~/xubuntu-desktop-depends.txt\napt-cache depends lubuntu-desktop > ~/lubuntu-desktop-depends.txt\n\nand remove anything from the first list that does not appear on the second with this command:\nsudo apt-get purge package1 package2 ...\n\n...etc, where each package to be removed is separated by one space.\nusing the \"apt-get purge\" command also removes configuration files, except those in your home directory. For more info on that, see here: What is the correct way to completely remove an application?\n\nA: Test this:\nSwitch on your computer.\nPress and hold the Shift key, which will bring up the Grub menu.\nIn the Grub menu select the line which starts with ---- Advanced options.\nSelect the line ending with ---- (recovery mode) something like:\nUbuntu GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.2.0-26-generic (recovery mode)\nPress Enter key and your machine will begin the boot process.\nYour pc should display a menu with a number of options.\nSelect the line will be ---- Drop to root shell prompt, press enter with this option highlighted.\nIn the terminal run it:\nmount -o remount, rw /\nmount --all\napt-get update\napt-get install --reinstall aptitude deborphan\n\naptitude remove '?and(?reverse-depends(gnome),?not(?reverse-depends(?exact-name(lubuntu-desktop))))'\n\naptitude remove '?and(?reverse-depends(xubuntu),?not(?reverse-depends(?exact-name(lubuntu-desktop))))'\n\napt-get install --reinstall lubuntu-desktop\napt-get dist-upgrade\ndeborphan\napt-get --purge remove $(deborphan)\ndeborphan --libdevel\napt-get --purge remove $(deborphan --libdevel)\ndeborphan --find-config\ndpkg --purge $(deborphan --find-config)\napt-get autoremove\napt-get clean\nreboot\n\n", "Q: Timer to shutdown I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Intel NUC DN2820. And almost every night as I lie down to sleep I listen to music, and my NUC shuts down (On Windows). On Windows it has the easiest command ever in CMD: Shutdown -s -t 1000.\nThat doesn't work on Ubuntu I figured out, but I found this command: Sudo shutdown 18:45, for those who don't know, 18:45 is an example when the system will shut down.\nI tried this in terminal: Sudo shutdown 01:00 and I got a message in terminal '' E:/ can`t find the command''\nThe E: drive is my external drive, and C: is my SSD, what can I do to get it to shut down? \nThanks :)\n\nA: The correct command would be sudo shutdown -h 23:45 - without the -h or -r switch it isn't a valid command (there are others - see man page).\nUsing +9 instead of the time gives you any easy way to say 'in 9 minutes'.\nAny reference to E:/ tells us that there is some reference to a windows command going on here as linux has no E:/ which is partly why there are comments as to what you really typed, above - please copy/paste commands, don't re-type them!\n\nA: sudo shutdown -h +30 will let the system power off after 30 minutes.\n", "Q: Ladspa plugin folder locked I have LMMS installed.

In the worst case changing permissions of these directories can lead to an unbootable system.\n\nMany LADSPA plugins can easily be installed from the Ubuntu repositories (available plugins listed here).\nIn case a plugin is not in the repositories, and not installable from a Debian package obtained elsewhere we may copy files according to the instructions from the given plugin by gaining temporary root access using sudo on the command line:\nsudo cp </path/to/source> </path/to destination>\n\n", "Q: How can I get a .sh file to run as Sudo in profile.d?

If this is possible it needs to be done on several servers and ubuntu virtual machines (Manually in command line) . \nI already tried a few solutions but nothing worked out for me. The goal is that by running a script of some sort to sort the security updates together and then update only the security updates. \nIt isn't possible to install them automatic because the servers and the virtual machines have great impact on the company. \nBtw I am a noob on linux / ubuntu . Tried (sudo apt-get upgrade but this only upgrade the existing software , Tried this with no result apt-get -s dist-upgrade | grep \"^Inst\" | grep -i securi | awk -F \" \" {'print $2'} | xargs apt-get install , Also tried this sudo sh -c 'grep ^deb /etc/apt/sources.list |grep securi >> /etc/apt/sources.security.repos.only.list' with no result.

Maybe there is a possibility to workt together with this the command abbove ? So that i only need to download the security updates , and becouse it is a company servers i cant just shutdown rest of the reposotory .\n\nA: Is it possible to only install the security updates? \nAnswer is : yes.\nYou can use unattended-upgrades which can handle automatic installation of security upgrades in Ubuntu system.\nRunning  sudo unattended-upgrade will install all the security package available for upgrade.\nInstall this  package if it isn't already installed using\nsudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades\n\nTo enable it type\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure  unattended-upgrades\n\nand select \"yes\".\nYou can also use it with the  cron to schedule(weekly, monthly) an automatic security update.\nSee the Official Ubuntu Documentation for  a comprehensive explanation \nJust as a side note: If you have  several machine,  I would suggest you to create a local repository so that you will not need to download same  package again and again in several machine.

I recently downloaded Dota 2 from steam and earlier I was playing it then I turned my computer off for awhile because it was hot and when I went back to play it I opened steam and it wasn't in my downloads and when I click the desktop icon it created for Dota 2 it brings up the install thing. How can I fix this?\n\nA: it will work if you open it through steam now, because suddenly turning off the computer can make the program file corrupted by deleting essential bits & pieces that were running before you suddenly turned the computer. If you try opening through steam AND tells you to install, do it, because the corrupting of the file must have been so bad that it became fully unreadable by the computer in a way. \nTIP: you turned the computer in such a way in first place because it too hot right? Try to minimize the amount of applications that are running in the background to keep the computer cool as well as put it on top of a very heat absorbing material so as to make sure it's not the computer that gets heated up.\n\nA: Open .steam folder in your home directory > steam > SteamApps > common and check if dota2 folder is there and check it's size.\nIf it's there go one level higher and check if any of the appmanifest file contains name dota. If not, you have to obtain the appmanifest file for dota and put it there. Either from other Linux machine or from Internet.\nThen open Steam, right click on Dota 2 > Properties > Local Files > Verify cache integrity. It will download any files you are missing.\nIf there are not data for dota, then something deleted it and you would have to download it anew.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 Black Screen before login (AMD HD 6470M) I am using a laptop with the current specification:\nAMD Radeon HD 6470M\nIntel Core I5-2520m\n8GB RAM\nIm Using Ubuntu 12.04, I boot into it using the standard Grub loader, i get the Ubuntu writing, followed by a black screen, this black screen sticks at this point prior to the login screen, if i press 'Ctrl + Alt + Del' the Ubuntu logo re-appears and my computer shuts down.

I did boot into windows as well and noticed a slow down after first logging in; but that goes away after a couple of seconds.

How could I debug to figure out which package is causing slow down in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The standard Ubuntu NVidia drivers generate some problems on slightly older and slightly newer NVidia hardware.\nIf you want more then the standard Ubuntu repository drivers, install the xorg.edgers PPA.  As the xorg.edgers group ask not to give installation instructions directly without linking to their page, this is the best I can do for now...\nIf you don't know what a PPA is or need some guidance about rolling forward and backward of driver versions  after reading their page, leave a comment below.\n", "Q: How can I remove a specific known_hosts entry without deleting the file When I try to ssh to my server (I reset the server) I get the usual \"WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!\"\nI then run the suggested ssh-keygen -f \"/home/XXXX/.ssh/known_hosts\" -R xxx.com\nBut this doesn't fix the problem.

I'm trying to understand how to properly partitioning the disk for future Ubuntu installations.\nThe reason: after trying to install Windows 7 alongside Ubuntu, I enabled \"Legacy mode\" on my HP pavilon laptop's BIOS (I think it is EFI, but it looks like traditional BIOS). For now I've understand that is complicated task to use GPT and EFI on Windows 7. However at the moment it doesn't matter, because my Ubuntu doesn't start, at the startup EFI says that \"no operation system have installed, please check the disk\". I can successfully start Ubuntu by choosing \"boot from EFI file\" option and specifying boot file at startup. \nPlease see the screen shot below. This is how my disk looks like:\n \nI've read these two very helpful topics: efi-boot-partition-and-biosgrub-partition and how-to-use-manual-partitioning-during-installation. But can't find analogical situation.\nSo the questions are: Can I install Ubuntu 14.10 with only 4 parts: \"/\", \"/boot\", \"swap\" and \"/home\"? What the partitions are odd here? (in the example above)\n\nA: Short answer: What Timur Fayzrakhmanov wrote is right, replace the /boot-partition with an EFI partition.\n\nWhat I know or found out:\n\n\n*\n\n*For booting UEFI you need a FAT32 EFI partition, one for each drive is sufficient and can handle several operating systems (this depends mostly on your UEFI firmware).\n\n*For booting Linux in legacy mode on a GPT drive you need a BIOS-GRUB-partition without any filesystem and flagged as BIOS_GRUB.\n\n*For booting another legacy operating system from a GPT partition table the general advice is that you need a separate BIOS-BOOT-partition. To my experience and as far as I can remember just installing Windows 7/8 in legacy mode will create the necessary partitions (IIRC MSR, BOOT and OS).\n\n*The /boot-partition that is sometimes suggested for advanced setups (RAID, Full Disk Enrcyption, etc.) is really just for advanced systems. With UEFI a boot partition for Linux isn't really necessary for advanced setups either, because the EFI partition can be configured hold the kernel and initrd images as well. The gummiboot developers published a specification how they like to see it implemented and published a new version just a few days ago that would combine all the necessary files and configuration in one file.\n\n\nSo for UEFI and MBR booting you would at least need an EFI partition (all EFI bootable OS) and a BIOS_GRUB partition (GRUB PC manages all legacy OS). Don't remove or reuse any existing MSR partition. You can try to install a Windows 7 EFI loader to the EFI partition with bcdboot, the Windows 8 version has some more improvements like the /f uefi option.\nBooting a /, /boot, swap and /home 4 partition layout from GPT in BIOS as well as UEFI mode is not possible, you need a partition for each mode. However with GPT there is no real limitation.\nI posted further details/instructions in Is it still possible to install Ubuntu to an external harddrive with UEFI?\n\nA: To install Ubuntu on GPT drive and UEFI there is must be \"EFI boot partition\". The other partitions like \"/home\", \"/boot\" are optional. For me optimal are the following partitioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI boot partition\n\n*swap\n\n*/ (root)\n\n*/home\n\n\nand that's all)\n", "Q: Listing certain contents from a site in the terminal This was one of the 12 problems in my practical exam today . For the first part of the task,  we were supposed to list the contents of the first page from http://slashdot.org . I used lynx for this one. Then, for the second part, we were asked to filter the output in such a way to only list the headlines ( article names) from the first page of slashdot.org ( this one literally crushed me) .\nBear in mind that this was a task out of 12 in an 100 minute exam,  so I reckon there's a fast way to do it, but I couldn't manage to find a discernable patteren . Any ideas on how to solve this ?\n\nA: grep '<h.*>.*<\\/h.>' sample.html | sed -e 's/<[^>]*>//g'\n\ngrep 'regex(all heading tags)' filename pipe(\" | \") sed remove all html tags\nThis should work.\n\nA: You need two components. First you need something that can fetch the slashdot main page (the raw html), and then something that lets you get the headlines from that.\nThe first component could be curl or wget. I'm partial to wget:\nwget -O slashdot.html http://slashdot.org\nNext, look at slashdot.html with a text editor. You'll find that headlines are contained in  tags. So the second component is something that understands HTML well enough to let you get only the h2 tags. You could do this with some clever regular expressions using grep, awk or sed but you'll go insane. I prefer something that knows HTML a bit better. If you're allowed to install extra packages, get the libxml2-utils package and use xmllint. It can parse HTML (with the -html switch) and understands xpath notation for HTML/XML node selection. Explaining xpath is beyond the scope of an answer here, and it would make a very good research topic for you to learn more, so I suggest you google \"xpath\" to understand how it works.\nAbout the only additional trick is that xmllint will print the text from h2 nodes verbatim, so it will look ugly as they're all in one line. I'll also use redirection and pipes to avoid creating temporary files, and discarding xmllint's html validation output (slashdot html is terribly noncompliant):\nwget -q -O - http://slashdot.org | xmllint -html -xpath '//h2/span/a/text()' - 2>/dev/null\n\nYou'll notice it shows the headlines all in one line. Now, to separate them, change it to this (to insert a \\n character as part of headline text, before the closing </a>:\nwget -q -O - http://slashdot.org | sed 's/<\\/a>/\\n<\\/a>/g' | xmllint -html -xpath '//h2/span/a/text()' - 2>/dev/null\n\n\n\n*\n\n*First, wget the slashdot homepage, outputting the HTML to standard output (-O -), and suppressing wget progress messages (-q).\n\n*Pipe this to sed to add \\n after each closing </a> tag.\n\n*Finally pipe this to xmllint (use - as input file to read from stdin), ask it to use the html parser and show only nodes matching the given xpath expression, discarding any diagnostic output (2>/dev/null to discard standard error).\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.4 HDD files can't be seen by XP on an external USB drive Due to a power supply malfunction I rescued the hard drive and placed it into an external USB storage box and plugged it into an XP professional O/S computer to recover emails, music etc but XP cant see the files but does see the drive.\nThe system was working 100% and I am certain the files are there but XP cannot see any of Linux but the used disc is right.

Then reconnect the XP drive and copy/paste or import the files where they ought to be after many more explorations of the web to discover where they needed to be.\nThere were a few things that didn't transfer or got corrupted but that's computers but 98% arrived where they were supposed to be after 48hrs of following advise given, my thanks as a complete novice I would either be at a computer engineer pleading for help and checking the bank account or on pills. \nLesson learnt BACK UP or PRINT important files and before taking anything apart copy files to another storage device!\nThose younger than 50 probably could have done this in an afternoon, its a language thing in some cases, but those more creaky are fumbling around in the dark as the computer speak is totally alien and we're worried about breaking what we don't understand beyond repair. \nAgain my thanks its running!\nP.S If the answers the computer what was the question?\n", "Q: Is it advisable to remove Evince (Default Document Viewer)? I installed qpdfview and liked it more than Evince. So I want to remove Evince. Is it advisable (as it is a core item in Ubuntu 14.04)?\n\nA: In your case, the program Evince was installed on your system as a component of the ubuntu-desktop metapackage. There are several excellent answers here about what a metapackage is and the implications of uninstalling a component of a metapackage and the metapackage itself. Here are two:\nWhat is the difference between a meta-package and a package?\nHow to determine if a package is a meta-package from the command line?\nComing back to your case, if you run apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop and examine the output, you'll see a section called Depends:. This lists all the software, including Evince, specified by the ubuntu-desktop metapackage. If you attempt to uninstall any of the packages in that list, the ubuntu-desktop metapackage will also be uninstalled (along with other dependencies unique to the package you want to uninstall in the first place).\nGoing further down, you'll see this:\nDescription-en: The Ubuntu desktop system\n This package depends on all of the packages in the Ubuntu desktop system\n .\n It is also used to help ensure proper upgrades, so it is recommended that\n it not be removed.\n\nIn other words, sometime in the future, when you want to upgrade your system to the next permissible version of Ubuntu, the upgrade process will want to refer to the ubuntu-desktop metapackage. At that time, it will be advisable that you re-install ubuntu-desktop before undertaking the upgrade step. Until that time, not having ubuntu-desktop on your system doesn't mean you'll be without a \"desktop\"; its absence has no adverse day-to-day consequences.\nAs a precaution, the next time you want to uninstall anything, run a simulation first by leaving out sudo and by including -s. For a really scary simulation, look at the output of apt-get purge -s zenity. Then, if you have doubts, you could research the matter as you did for Evince!\n\nA: If you have a secondary program it does not matter. To remove it simply Press CTRL+ALT+T this will open the console. In there run this command:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge evince\n\nThanks, hope this helps.\n", "Q: Accept headers: application/rss+xml, text/rss+xml, text/xml I have a Ubuntu with Apache and PHP running a web server and a full working web site on it.

According to the developer of the client it must respond with the following headers: application/rss+xml, text/rss+xml, text/xml.\nHow do I fix/enable this on my server?

Thanks :) here is a screenshot of it\n \n\nA: All this requires is the Unity Tweak Tool. Merely navigate to Unity > Additional. Where it says \"Show the launcher -- Super\" Change the binding to backspace. That will disable the Window's key binding to the launcher.\nYou can use many methods to bind Slingscold to the Super key. I used System Settings Keyboard > Shortcuts and the \"+\" button to create a custom shortcut. The command to run \"slingscold\" is simply slingscold.\n\nA: At the time of this writing, no solution existed, but there is one here now!\nOriginal answer for historical reasons:\nUnfortunately (In the mean time I went looking through the source code) SlingScold is not a Window Manager, just an application... So you cannot disable Unity, so you cannot bind it to super key, nor to the icon in the top left corner without re-programming Unity... \nSo what you want cannot be done...  \nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news.  :-(\n", "Q: Can ghex show raw hex bytes on /dev/sdb?

It's just not possible, even when the disk is unmounted and not any more after the disk has been ejected...\nAnyway, If you really, really want to have a more or less safe look at the MBR, execute the following command:\nWarning:dd is the abbreviation of Disk Destroyer!\ndd if=/dev/sdX of=~/home/Documents/MBR.HEX bs=512 count=1\nghex ~/home/Documents/MBR.HEX\n\nWhere X stands for the disk containing your boot record.\nIf you want the unsafe version, don't come crying afterwards, download a single-user single-tasking OS like FreeDOS, boot that and use a tool like Hex51a and run that and you can do anything you want, including totally unsafe things!\n>:-)\n", "Q: How can i install ET Legacy from GitHub on Ubuntu 14.04? My problem is that I want to install ET Legacy from GitHub, but I can't figure out what package is needed to be downloaded from here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libstdc. The only thing I could figure out (with some help of an another site's user), is that I need one of the lstdc++ packages. \nThe full terminal output can be found here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9919220/.\n\nA: The output shows you have g++ installed, which means you have libstdc++-4.8-dev installed as well. Besides, it looks like the error is about 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit system, so you probably need to install g++-multilib.\nsudo apt install g++-multilib\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 freezing Ubuntu 14.10 with the following hardware:\nWireless:  Qualcomm Atheros AR93xx Wireless Network Adapter\nGraphics: ATI Radeon 280 (fglrx driver)\nCPU: 4690K \nMotherboard: ASRock Z97 Pro4\nMemory: 16G\nHardrive: SSD (AHCI set in BIOS)\nThis computer was running windows 7 for a long time without any issues, so there shouldn't be any hardware problems (I did run multiple hardware checks including Memtest).\nAfter hours or at random time (when playing game for instance) the computer will freeze.  This is a hard freeze.  For instance sometimes I can't even do \"Magic\" SysRq trick (this might be due to frozen keyboard).\nNow here is the weird part.  There is NOTHING in syslog at all nor in dmesg.  The log simply stops.  For instance yesterday it died at 5am next log was at 11:30 am when I rebooted.\nDoes anybody have any suggests as to where to look further?  I am suspecting that this is probably a graphic adapter issue.  Primarily since nothing else is particularly unusual about my setup.\nThank you!\n\nA: Well so I found the issue; although still don't know if it is hardware or software.  \nThe issue was in fact with the Video Card.  I swapped the card with another computer and for 2 days now I've had 0 issues.\nWhat concerns me is that this card is working fine in Windows 7, and that the freeze was so hard.  Everything was shutdown, including networking.  Heck I couldn't do magic sysrq!!!!!\nSo I have no idea how a module, any module, could cause such a crash within an OS. \n", "Q: what can i do, i can't install wine Some packages could not be installed.

I'm using a HP Chromebook 14 and I'm running ChromeOS and Ubuntu at same time and I have a 32 GB flash drive. \nI'm trying to figure out how to install steam directly to the flash drive but it doesn't ask me where to install it and it ends up on my laptops hard drive. Is there a way in terminal?\n\nA: According to this page You can download the steam tarball from here\nDownload this, put it on your flash drive (I'll use /media/user/flash/ for where you downloaded it)\nVia terminal do\ncd /media/user/flash #or put in whatever location you actually downloaded it to\ntar -xf steam_latest.tar.gz\ncd steam\nchmod +x steam\n./steam\n\nThis should bring steam up for you, according to their documentaion.\nNote that this doesn't 'install' it, but gives you an executable script that you can run from the flash drive. Not sure what implications this might have\n\nA: If I did understand you correctly then using symlinks that point to the external drive should be the solution you are looking for.\n\nNote: If you already have an existing .steam and .local/share/Steam folder, then copy it to the external drive before running the commands. You should use a Linux filesystem like EXT4 for the external drive, no FAT or NTFS.\n\nCreate a symlink for the .steam and .local folder in your home directory:\nmkdir /media/$USER/$your_external_drive/.steam\nmkdir -p /media/$USER/$your_external_drive/.local/share/Steam\nln -s /media/$USER/$your_external_drive/.steam .steam\nln -s /media/$USER/$your_external_drive/.local/share/Steam .local/share/Steam\n\nThat's it, when you want to run Steam you just connect the drive, mount it from the launcher and start Steam. I use symlinks for moving larger folders (Steam, VirtualBox…) from my SSD home partition to another internal HDD and I haven't noticed any issues. There should be no difference between internal drives or external drives unless the drive is easily ejected accidentally (loose plug or too bulky to move the laptop abround while the drive is mounted) or the flash drive isn't able to carry the I/O load (like some cheap micro SD cards or very tiny USB flash drives).\n", "Q: IO error after PSU change I have just changed my PSU with better one...\nPlugged cables as same (and i unplug DVD)\nIt works OK...

I used gparted to install a new partition, but the partition seems useless.  I can see the partition in Disk Management, but it has no properties--it's empty.

Disk Management shows the partition has 60.29 GBs available and 100% free space, but it also shows nothing listed under volume or file system.   What is wrong with my partition?  Thanks\n\nA: Are you actually using Windows cmd to try & run linux commands? And Windows disk management to see what's going on?\nThat's not (ever) going to work - Windows is deliberately blind to other OS's, to discourage you from tinkering, and does not have the tools to do this. So the answer to your question is perhaps that there's nothing wrong at all...\nIf you can get it to boot the linux OS, you should find it has worked.\n\nA: What you're showing is the windows disk manager which doesn't recognize EXT3/EXT4 partitions.  If you did install Ubuntu (and it looks like it from your screenshot), just reboot from your hard disk and you should see a menu showing you how to boot into Windows or how to boot into Ubuntu.  \n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't see such a menu, boot from the USB again, press Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\nsudo mount /dev/XdY /mnt\n\nWhere X is the disk type and Y the disk letter. (probably it's going to be sda but if you're unsure, leave a comment)\n\n*Then, bind the directories that the Ubuntu boot loader (grub: GRand Unifying Bootloader) needs access to to detect other operating systems:\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev &&\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts &&\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc &&\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys\n\n\n*Then change the directory and make it root (chroot), install grub and \nsudo chroot /mnt\ngrub-install /dev/XdY\ngrub-install --recheck /dev/XdY\nupdate-grub\n\nand reboot and you should be able to boot into Ubuntu without the USB stick.\nSource\n\nA: It's extremely likely that nothing is wrong with the partition that you created with gparted. What's wrong is expecting Windows to recognize native file systems of Non-Microsoft operating systems. Boot the system, choose Ubuntu from the GRUB menu and you'll find that Ubuntu happily recognizes all your file systems (including Microsoft’s). If you have installed Ubuntu this should work famously, If not, boot from the installation media and install on the unused partition.\n", "Q: Chrome Flash Player Extension Keeps Bringing Up Black Bar 14.04 Hi there I am running Ubuntu 14.04 and am trying to watch cartoons while I do some work (I have it running through a second monitor).

While I seem to have figured out a fix for the launcher (just take the launcher away in the display settings) is there a fix for the  unity global menu and for the full screen to remain in focus? \n\nA: im sorry to hear this, ;< im very sorry but you can not get unity WP for linux/ubuntu/gentu/etc. you can not get unity WP for linux, not even with wine. if you want to watch anime ( i hope these are the cartoons you are watching you can watch them at this website but it will only work with firefox. if you go to the ubuntu software centre and search \"flash player plugin\" download it and if you go into firefox and go to settings then plugins you will see flash player. these are 2 websites you can watch anime/cartoons  http://www.crunchyroll.com/\n you can copy and paste it into your browser. heres the other one. http://www.hulu.com/tv/genres/anime i hope i helped you :>P\n", "Q: Realtek Ethernet card disconnnects randomly My laptop has a Realtek RTL8168 Ethernet card, which works pretty well.

I've came up with a couple possible solutions based on some research online as well as personal suggestions from experience.\nReplace Kernel Module\nFrom researching online, it appears that frequently the best solution is to replace the r8168 module that comes with Ubuntu installation, with a newer , updated version. For instance, this crunchbang post.\nThis  Ubuntu Forums post from 2012 documents a script for a newer, updated version of the r8168 module. You can do sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) or     sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-headers-$(uname -r) , and then follow matera.ttp's instructions. Praseonym, who also posted there, suggests installing the driver with dkms , which is supposed to rebuild modules for each kernel update. Now, you should have dkms already installed, and you could check it with which dkms . So you could either use Praseonym's instructions or matera.ttp's . The idea is the same.\nTweak Module Settings\nFor many network issues tweaking the module configurations could help solve the issues, but frankly I doubt it's an issue, since you've used  r8169 with same effect. Nonetheless , give it a try.\nIn  the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory, create r8168.conf file. In that file, write:\noptions eee_enable=1\nSave and reboot. \nNow, you could do very much same thing with other options. For instance, my first guess was to add options timer_count=3600 to the r8168.conf file. Why 3600 ? Assuming that the parameter deals with time, then it's most likely seconds. \nI've found a case where it actually didn't work, and the problem was bios related. Refer to this page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2138125&page=2\nIf everything else fails\nI've mentioned on other posts as well, that sometimes hardware is the issue and no matter how much tweaking you do - it won't help. In personal experience , I've dealt with two rtl8192 wireless chipsets, one of which was giving weird sound bug, but the other works almost flawlessly. \nI suggest you explore possible replacements for your ethernet card. My suggestion would be portable usb hub with ethernet slot, much like these\n\nA: I think, you need to install more stable official driver for Realtek (RTL8111/RTL8168) ethernet card.\n1. Get root privileges\nGet root privileges, while typing “su” or (when you use Ubuntu) “sudo -s” in a terminal.\n2. Get the requirements\nTo build and install the driver, we need the kernel headers and the build tools like gcc. To get them, just easily type in a terminal:\napt-get install build-essential\n\n3. Get the driver\nNow, go to the official download page from Realtek for the Linux/UNIX Driver for the RTL8111/RTL8168 ethernet card and download the latest driver version.\nLink: Realtek Download Page\n4. Untar the archive\nThe driver is compressed to an archive. So uncompress it with the following command:\ntar xfvj r8168-8.025.00.tar.bz2\n\nNOTE: Please do not forget to replace the “r8168-8.025.00.tar.bz2″ with the driver version which you have downloaded!\n5. Blacklist old driver\nWe have to blacklist the old driver (r8169) to prevent the system to load it. To do this, easily set a new entry in “/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf” which is called:\nblacklist r8169\n\nor just enter in the terminal again\necho “blacklist r8169″ >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nto do this in only one command.\n6. Build and install the new driver\nNow, the whole requirements to install the new driver are done. Let us now change in the driver directory, which we have uncompressed in a few steps before:\ncd r8168-8.025.00\n\nNOTE: Again, please do not forget, to change “r8168-8.025.00″ to the version which you have downloaded.\nThe only think we have to do now is, to build the driver and install it. To build it, just type:\nmake clean modules\n\nafter a few secondes (depending on your CPU), the driver is build and you can install it with:\nmake install\n\n7. Welcome r8168\nOne of our last steps is, to let the system know about the r8168 driver. With the command\ndepmod -a\n\nyou rebuild the kernel module dependencies and with an\ninsmod ./src/r8168.ko\n\nyou insert the new kernel module (the driver) into the kernel.\n8. Make it available for boot\nTo always use the new module, you have to make a new initrd boot file. Just do\nmkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-`uname -r` `uname -r`\n\nin a terminal. Here we make the initrd file with the help of the “uname -r” command, which allows us to get the version of the actually running kernel.\nAt least, you have to add in the “/etc/modules” file a new entry, which is called “r8168″, to get the driver automatically loaded after boot. As an alternative you can do the last step again with only one command:\necho “r8168″ >> /etc/modules\n\nThat’s it! After a reboot you should have the best possible performance with the RTL8111/RTL8168 and additionally no other network problems should be available anymore (no break down).\nAfter the reboot you can check if the right driver is loaded with this command:\nlspci -v\n\nwith this command you should find your RTL8111/RTL8168 network card in a list and the additional command “Kernel driver in use: r8168″.\n\nA: A few days ago I found a new release of the driver (8.039.900) on Realtek's website. I downloaded, compiled and installed it, and never experienced any connection drops since.\nUpdate r8168:\nThe most current driver source can be downloaded here.\nExtract the downloaded archive and run \nsudo make\n\nin the extraction folder. After compilation, the currently installed r8168 module will be automatically replaced by the new version (which in my opinion should only happen when running make install)\nTo load the new version, run\nsudo modprobe -r r8168 && sudo modprobe r8168\n\n\nPS: Don't use the installation script which comes with this driver. It will uninstall the old module (no matter whether r8168 or r8169) before even attempting to compile the new one. If the compilation fails, you're left without internet, if you don't have WiFi or another Ethernet card.\n", "Q: Nouveau unknown chipset at install I'm trying to install Ubuntu version 14.10 on my new computer. It's a fresh build with nothing installed yet. You can see a list of the hardware here. At first I had difficulty with the UEFI boot, but I went into the BIOS and set everything that I could to \"legacy\". Now, when I try to boot, I get the following error:\n\n[ 2.817690 nouveau E[ DEVICE][0000:01:00.0] unknown chipset, 0x124020a1\n[ 2.817724 nouveau E[ DRM] failed to create 0x80000080, -22\n\nI tried booting in nomodeset, which I thought did something to fix that, but it didn't work. I suspect it has something to do with not having any drivers yet, but I didn't get an optical drive. I was planning on just downloading them. What can I do?\n\nA: Do a Ctrl+Alt+F1\nlogin and do\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo ubuntu-drivers devices\n\nsee what is recommended\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-xxx (xxx is your recommended driver)\nreboot.\n", "Q: Directory shared between users Let's say I have 3 users on my server:\n\n\n*\n\n*/home/bob\n\n*/home/joe\n\n*/home/fred\nI want to create a folder at /share in which bob and joe can both add and delete files. I want all of files added to that directory to have permissions such that both users can modify or delete them.\nThe issue is that when directories are created within /share/, they are created with permissions for the owner. If a folder is created in /shared then it belongs to the creator, and nobody else can modify/delete its contents.\nI need to have this folder behave such that everything created in it has full rwx permissions for everyone.\n\nA: Using Groups\nLike Trevor said, you can make a group, and give that group read, write, and execute, permission to that folder.\nTo create a group: \nsudo groupadd groupname\n\nYou can use anything in the place of groupname, just remember what it is!\nNext, let's create a folder in /share\nsudo mkdir /share\n\nSet that folder's group to the created one, and well as set permissions\nsudo chgrp groupname /share\nsudo chmod 775 /share\n\nRemeber to change groupname to the one your created!\nYou can see that we change the permissions of /share to 775, here's a explaination of what that means.\n7 in the first position, this gives the owner of the folder, read (lists files in folder), write (create/delete files in folder), and execute (be able to cd into that folder). In our case the owner of the folder is root.\n7 in the second position, this gives the folder's group, read, write, and execute permission. In our case the folder's group is groupname or whatever you set it to.\n5 in the final position, this gives the the public (whoever can logon to the system), read, and execute permission. This allows them to cd into folder and list the files using ls or a similar command. If you want to prevent others from cd'ing into the folder you can use 0 instead of 5, meaning they get no permissions.\nTo add a user to a group, so that can use the group permissions, we can use:\nsudo usermod -a -G groupname [username]\n\nBe sure to change groupname and [username] to their correct values.\nNote: a user may only be in one primary group, but multiple secondary groups. The command I provided adds another secondary group to the user specified.\nUsing ACLs\nA alternate solutions, which I think is more complex is to use ACLs (or Access Control Lists).\nThis allows you to grant specific permissions to specific users without the use of groups or changing owners. For this to work the file system must be mounted with the acl option.\nPreparing to use ACL\nFirstly, we must check if the drive is already mounted as ACL. Because we the folder is in the /share is in the root (/) partition, we must ensure that the root partition is already mounted with the acl option.\nNote: The /home is not always inside the root partition, the /home folder can be it's own partition. This also applies to other partitions.\nTo determine if a partition has ACL enabled, we can use the mount command.\nmount -l\n\nFor me, this is on the first line.\n/dev/sda5 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n\nWe can see that the partition /dev/sda5 is mounted at /. Yours may not be on the first line, like mine. It may be on the second, third, but it should be mounted at /, because that's where our /share is.\nNow, we will need to determine if we have the acl option.\ntune2fs -l [partition path]\n\nFrom my output of mount -l you can see that my partition path is /dev/sda5, yours may be different.\nFrom running the command we will get something similar to this:\ntune2fs 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\nFilesystem volume name:   <none>\nLast mounted on:          /\nFilesystem UUID:          5e7b3dcf-cda0-4a74-ab0e-67c9ce8ab044\nFilesystem magic number:  0xEF53\nFilesystem revision #:    1 (dynamic)\nFilesystem features:      has_journal ext_attr resize_inode dir_index filetype needs_recovery extent flex_bg sparse_super large_file huge_file uninit_bg dir_nlink extra_isize\nFilesystem flags:         signed_directory_hash \nDefault mount options:    user_xattr acl\nFilesystem state:         clean\n~cut off to save space~\n\nOn the default mount options line, we can see that we have acl enabled. If you don't have acl enabled, you can use Google find out how to do that.\nNow, like the method with groups, you will need to create the folder:\nsudo mkdir /share\n\nOne last thing, we must set the folder to 700, so only root (and people granted access by ACL) can access the folder:\nsudo chmod 700 /share\n\nNow we can set the access control.\nNote: setting the permissions, without using acl, and instead using chmod, will cause acl permissions to be reset.\nSetting ACL permissions\nIt's a bit simpler now, if you want to set permission for a user, you can use\nsudo setfacl -m \"u:[username]:rwx\" /share\n\nThis will grant [username] rwx (read, write, execute) permissions. The sudo is required only because /share is owned by root.\nFor a group use:\nsudo setfacl -m \"g:[groupname]:rwx\" /share\n\nFor a other/public (only includes people who are able to logon to the system) use:\nsudo setfacl -m \"o:rwx\" /share\n\nNote: you can swap rwx out for others like rx for read/execute only.\nNote: if you pass a -d option while using setfacl (setfacl -d -m \"u:...), this will set the default ACL value for the folder. This will cause any NEW files added to the folder to automatically have the permissions you applied.\n\nA: EDITED:\nMake a user group, right click the folder you want and set appropriate permissions for that group! Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Intel Wireless N 7260 disconnects and asks for password I am on the ubuntu 14.04 live usb, and would like to dual boot with the pre-installed Windows 8.1 (i know how to do this), on my Toshiba e45t.

I am using Linux Kernel 3.19-RC5 with Oibaf graphics stack on Ubuntu Gnome and I am currently very happy with this setup. However, there is Linux Kernel 3.13.0-44 & few other packages available for dist-upgrade.\nI would like to know :\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it okay if I use dist-upgrade & install Linux kernel 3.13.0-44 ? I\nwant to keep using 3.19-rc5 with oibaf stack and I don't want my X\nto break.\n\n*Is there any alternate way to do dist-upgrade by blacklisting Linux\nkernel packages ?\n\n\nA: The reason you pull in new kernel versions is that you have the shell package linux-image-generic installed, which does not contain the kernel image itself but at any given time depends on the most recently released kernel package.  This is why you get a new kernel version installed even though its package name is different, containing the version number.\nIf you never want to automatically get a new kernel version, you can remove this shell package, ensuring that the package containing the actual kernel image is not removed along with it.\nOr, if you normally do want to install new versions but you just want to temporarily avoid one particular version, you can use pinning, to tell dpkg/APT specifically to avoid a certain package, or a certain version of a package.\nPinning info: Need to prevent a package from being installed\n", "Q: sed : difference between \" sed 's/\\-.*// \" & \" sed '/\\-/s/\\-.*//gw \" I am learning few simple sed commands.\nCommand #1\nsed 's/\\-.*//gw without' tgs.txt\n\nCommand #2\nsed '/\\-/s/\\-.*//gw with' tgs.txt\n\nOutput #1\n$ cat with\n2. Databases \n6. Windows\n Raja\n\nOutput #2\n$ cat without \n2. Databases \n6. Windows\n Raja\n\nDifference Between them\n$ diff with without \n$\n\nWhat's the difference between these two commands?\n\nA: There is no difference between these in effect:\nsed 's/\\-.*//g'\nsed '/\\-/s/\\-.*//g'\n\nThe first form acts on all lines, the second form acts only on those lines which match /-/ using addresses. Since the action taken includes -, in effect both lines will only affect those which contain -.\nNow if you'd used /Raja/ as an address instead, you'd only have seen the last line in with - that is, only those lines which contained Raja, and had the substitution performed.\n\nA: These two sed commands,\nsed 's/\\-.*//g'\nsed '/\\-/s/\\-.*//g'\n\nwill do the same job. Let me explain how..\nsed 's/\\-.*//g'\n\nwill replace all the characters from - to the last character with an empty string. If a line don't have any - character then the replacement won't occur. That is, it won't affect the lines which don't have the hyphen - symbol.\nsed '/\\-/s/\\-.*//g'\n\nwill first search for the lines which have the - symbol. If it finds any, then it will do the replacement (replaces all the characters from - to the last character with an empty string) on those lines. \nSo both are the same. Your first sed command would be enough. You don't need to put the search condition. Also, since - is not a special character, you don't need to escape it.\n", "Q: Booting ubuntu directly I have installed Ubuntu alongside windows but the problem is I am unable to get the dual boot screen where we have the windows boot loader listed, instead of that the computer directly boots into Ubuntu.....I  am unable to see the grub screen.\nAny suggestions how to enable the dual boot list.\n\nA: Have you tried reinstalling grub? check this link out\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu as a main OS on my Netbook Designed for Windows 7 Hello!\nI have Ubuntu on a virtual box.

I'm trying to counter my \"emacs pinky\" by putting some keys in more accesible places. I've already switched Ctrl for Caps Lock, which was a no brainer, putting a setxkbmap command to the Startup Applications list.\nI've decided that I should also move the left Meta/Super/Windows key, that I tend to use a lot and is not very comfortable to access in my keyboard. The best key to make its function would be the one above the Tab, that in american keyboards makes the ~ symbol (and in the ES keyboard makes the Masculine/Femenine symbols and the backslash, and ).\n\nI've figured out, looking at /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/es, that its code is TLDE:\nkey <TLDE>  { [ masculine, ordfeminine,    backslash,   backslash ] };\n\nBut how can I swap that key with the left meta key??

Device independence is an important principle of the\n  system’s design; do not compromise it merely to save someone from\n  typing an option now and then. (Variation in error message syntax when\n  using a terminal is ok, because that is a side issue that people do\n  not depend on.)\n\nInstead, consider adding command line options to your program to change behaviour, and using these in your upstart job.\n", "Q: How to fix : unable to reconnect with Empathy / telepathy to a specific IRC channel after computer hard reboot ?

I've installed a VirtualMachine to work on the background. I use SSH to control it via terminal. But, sometimes SSH service didn't work properly and I can't access the VirtualMachine outside. All I can do is power it off via VirtualBox GUI. But, I think it's not a good idea to use poweroff, since it's like I pull the power cable out. Is there anyway to show the VirtualMachine after I started it via VBoxHeadless? So, I can turn it off with shutdown command.\n\nA: We can not change the video output from headless to local screen after starting a Virtual Box VM in headless mode. But if not configured otherwise there will be an RDP server started automatically at default port 3389 in a headless machine. By this we will have access to that machine's GUI through any RDP-viewer.\nIn case SSH did not work it is very likely that your RDP server may be inaccessible too. In this case it is not recommended to poweroff or kill a running VM as this may lead to data loss.\nIn this case a quite convenient and secure workaround is to terminate the headless machine with saving the machine's state. This can also be done from the command line by:\nVBoxManage controlvm \"<Name of Machine>\" savestate\n\nAfter that we will be able to start the machine in non-headless mode at exactly the saved state from the Virtual Box Manager, or again from command line with:\nVBoxManage startvm \"<Name of Machine>\"\n\nThen we can debug the reason for any previously failed access, or safely shut down the machine.\n\nA: I was able to do it when I accidentally started a Saved State Normal Start in Headless. I simply saved the headless state again then did a normal start. My first inclination was to ssh into it, but this is much better.\n", "Q: What's the difference between PREROUTING and FORWARD in iptables? I am trying to understand how this system works and I have problems to understand the difference between using NAT PREROUTING or filter FORWARD.\nFrom what I understand, the PREROUTE can send the packet to another server, avoiding the filter. If NAT can handle this via PREROUTE, what is the purpose of having a FORWARD rule in the filter?\n\nA: PREROUTING: This chain is used to make any routing related decisions before (PRE) sending any packets. Always remember that in PREROUTING/POSTROUTING i.e. NAT table the ACCEPT/DROP/REJECT etc targets of the default FILTER table will not work. The NAT table is only used for taking routing decisions. You should use PREROUTING when taking any routing decisions i.e. the decisions which are needed to be taken before the packet will start traversing through the network. Here is an example, we are redirecting any traffic that just reached the server on port 80 to the port 8080:\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080\n\nFORWARD: As the name suggests, The FORWARD chain of FILTER table is used to forward the packets from a source to a destination, here the source and destination are two different hosts. So, as you can imagine FORWARD rules are basically used on servers where one host is sending/receiving traffic from another host via the server. When the packet is generated from the server the chain is OUTPUT i.e. the traffic is going out from itself whereas INPUT chain means the the packets are meant for the server itself only. Here is an example of FORWARD chain where any TCP traffic received on port 80 on interface eth0 meant for the host 192.168.0.4 will be accepted and forwarded to 192.168.0.4:\niptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -d 192.168.0.4 -j ACCEPT\n\n\nA: NAT Table:\n\nThis table should only be used for NAT (Network Address Translation) on different packets. In other words, it should only be used to translate the packet's source field or destination field.\n\nFilter Table:\n\nThe filter table is mainly used for filtering packets. We can match packets and filter them in whatever way we want. This is the place that we actually take action against packets and look at what they contain and DROP or /ACCEPT them, depending on their content. Of course we may also do prior filtering; however, this particular table is the place for which filtering was designed.\n\nIn Traversing of tables and chains we can see that filter's FORWARD chain is traversed only by forwarded packets (packets that come from network AND go out to network), i.e. your computer is acting like a router, while nat's PREROUTING chain is traversed by both forwarded packets and packets whose destination is the local host.\nYou should use nat's PREROUTING only to change the destination address of the packets and filter's FORWARD only for filtering (dropping/accepting packets).\n\nIf we get a packet into the first routing decision that is not destined for the local machine itself, it will be routed through the FORWARD chain. If the packet is, on the other hand, destined for an IP address that the local machine is listening to, we would send the packet through the INPUT chain and to the local machine.\n  \n  Packets may be destined for the local machine, but the destination address may be changed within the PREROUTING chain by doing NAT. Since this takes place before the first routing decision, the packet will be looked upon after this change. Because of this, the routing may be changed before the routing decision is done. Do note, that all packets will be going through one or the other path in this image. If you DNAT a packet back to the same network that it came from, it will still travel through the rest of the chains until it is back out on the network.\n\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu 14 64 bit along side a 32bit Ubuntu on a dual boot system? My system is dual booted one with WIndows 7 32 bit and other with Ubuntu 10 32 bit. But my lap supports 64 bit. I want to install 64 bit ubuntu on my system. Will it be best to uninstall old Ubuntu 32 bit from my system and then install 64 bit of it or install it afresh by keeping ubuntu 32 bit on one side afraid of loosing files. I am not sure whether i have created a separate partition for ubuntu 32 bit during my installation, but pretty sure the primary boot system was windows. \n\nA: Here is what you can do:\nTake a large usb or hard drive, connect it to your computer and download the files on the ubuntu os that you want.\nNext, go into windows and remove all the ubuntu files.\nThen re install the new ubuntu on the partition.\nYour good to go!\nHope this helps.\n\nA: It would be very difficult for a non-expert to install 64-bit Ubuntu over 32-bit without losing files. \nSo it is strongly recommended to back up your files. \nAs for dual boot of 32-bit and 64-bit it is possible but in my opinion, not effective in the long run in terms of hard disk space and hardware performance, because you will have to resize partitions or remove 32-bit Ubuntu sooner or later. \nYou do have separate partitions for Ubuntu.Ubuntu always sits in another partition than Windows. It is never inside Windows.\nSo the best thing you can do is to backup files (both Ubuntu and Windows files for being more confident), and make a clean install of Ubuntu 64-bit by removing 32-bit version.\n", "Q: Keyboard layout related issue - fixed in GUI but receive error in terminal I run on Ubuntu 14.04. I have an issue related to the keyboard layout in GUI mode. I managed to fix it in the GUI by using:\nsetxkbmap -layout us [1]\nand adding it to the ~/.bashrc. That works fine. However, the problem I have now is that when I login to the text-mode terminal I receive an error - Cannot display \"default display\". This is not surprising because this command does not work in text mode. \nThe question is: where should I put [1] and have no error in text mode terminal?\n\nA: Issue is solved.

I can only see root@user:~#. Any key press has no response.\nSo can I remove the sudo package and reinstall it? Will it effect any other files?\n\nA: Your second mentioned problem (can't type at root prompt in recovery mode) suggests there is much more wrong with your installation than being unable to use sudo.  I'd suggest it's probably the simplest way out to backup your personal data (you should be able to do that from a Live CD or USB) and reinstall Ubuntu to get a clean, working system.\nUninstalling sudo is almost certainly a bad idea; I haven't tried it, but it's central to the way Ubuntu is designed to work (you can't do anything in privileged mode without it, on a default installation).  It certainly won't fix the problem with recovery mode, and it's likely to uninstall so many dependent packages that you'll be forced into reinstalling anyway.\n", "Q: Recover data from a formatted windows hard drive dont know if its right to post on here but i have a bit of problem.\nI had a windows 8 laptop and partitioned it into 4 partitions.

May I suggest looking for computer shops in the area see if they can recover any of your data. \nHope this help \n\nA: I have already written about data recovery here: Recovering Very Important Lost Data From Ntfs Partition Have a look here as well http://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery and here http://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Tools:Data_Recovery\nFirst of all, if you lost an important file, stop using the file system the file was on NOW. The data you lost might still be on the disk, but the longer you use the file system, the higher the chances are that the data gets destroyed. So unmount that file system or switch the system off now.\nI will show how data can be recovered that was on a 2GB USB stick, but in principle that works for HDs as well. It just takes much longer, and you need much more disk space for recovery.\nFirst thing I do is that I create a disk image of the disk. That way I do not accidentally destroy any data that might still be there.\nI have stored files on this stick and then reformatted the stick:\nIMGP1176.JPG\ntest.txt\nNow the file system does not know anything about the files anymore. However the data has not been overwritten and is still on the stick.\nLets try to recover them. I need to recover them the hard way, a simple undelete will not work.\nI dump all data from the USB stick /dev/sdi to a file. This Step is essential. I am now working on a copy of the data and am not in danger to destroy the original data.\ndd if=/dev/sdi of=USBimage.raw\nOK, the data is in a secure place now.\nNo I try to recover the file. I use the carving tool foremost. Foremost scans the disk for known start and end markers of several file types.\nI will now use foremost to reconstruct the file\nforemost -i USBimage.raw -o foremostout\nAnd like a miracle the file was reconstructed in foremostout/jpg/00007750.jpg\nThis works quite well for all files with a clear start and end marker. Look into the foremost man pages for more info.\nA bit more effort is needed to restore a simple txt file. Here we have no clear start and end markers.\nMy favorite way is to extract the strings from the diskimage and then restore the files manually.\nstrings USBimage.raw > strings.txt\nI open strings.txt with vi and find the text I was looking for “This text is very important to me.”\nGood luck with recovering your data!\n", "Q: Disabling CPU \"permanently\" As some of you may know, there is a common problem in some old notebooks, between battery and adapter, which is when charger plugged in, computer restarts itself, and this is a real pain in the neck.\nThere are one or two different solutions for this problem, for example, the one can disable the second CPU via Device Manager in Windows' safe mode and by this way restarting would be prevented. But you know, things work different in Ubuntu, there isn't any chance to disable the second CPU via \"Device Manager\" since there is not any \"Device Manager\". So I was looking for a appropriate solution and I found one. There is a terminal code that let me disable the second CPU, which is: \necho 0 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online\n\nWhen I enter this command, it works like a charm and there is no problem, but the problem is, after shutting down the computer and reopening it, CPU enables itself automatically.\nSo that's the problem. Sometimes I forget to enter this command and thus my laptop repeats itself and my whole work goes into trouble.\nIs there any way to make this command \"permanent\" ? Or is there any other way to disable the second CPU?\n\nA: In the file /etc/default/grub the number of CPUs can be specified (limited) on the \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\" line. Example (where I have added it to something that was already on the line):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"ipv6.disable=1 maxcpus=1\"\n\nNotes: In case of problems, it is a good idea to save a copy of your original grub file first:\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.original\n\nYou have to edit as sudo (i.e. sudo nano /etc/default/grub) and you have to update grub afterwards:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: sudo apt-get trying to connect through old proxy I previously had a proxy set-up when visiting somewhere for work, to use the internet there.

The Ubuntu SDK appears to be only for creating Ubuntu Apps. What exactly is an \"Ubuntu App\"?  The website is very detailed, but I can't see any description of what is meant by an Ubuntu App.\nI understand that these apps can run on either the desktop or an Ubuntu phone, but which desktop? Is it specifically Unity, or will these apps be usable on Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, or even Linux Mint? \nOr does this depend on whether or not I use any Unity specific hooks? \nEdit: the referenced website has been updated since I asked this, so the question is not really relevant any more. \n\nA: I think that what an \"Ubuntu app\" is is really written in the explanation, i.e. a program that can work on Ubuntu (both Desktop and Touch).\nWith that SDK you can create QML and/or HTML5 applications.\nThis means that they can work on all the desktops that support these formats. I personally do not know a list of desktops with such capabilities, apart from the default Ubuntu interface, Unity.\nThe SDK is built thinking of Ubuntu (it is Ubuntu SDK, not Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, Ubuntu Mate, ecc) and gives easy access to the services provided by Ubuntu (such as Content Hub, as explained in the Platform section).  \nI guess that it can be easily adapted to write programs for other desktops that take advantages of QML and HTML5.\n\nA: An \"App\" is a short name for \"Application\".\nAll it means is its a application that was built for Ubuntu, from a linux based SDK.\n", "Q: Support for en_150 locale I read at https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/62316/why-is-there-no-euro-english-locale about en_150 locale.

Not quite sure why it modified sdb. Did you have sdb as default boot drive in BIOS?

When I try to deploy jenkins-salve I get the error message:\njuju deploy -n 1 jenkins-slave\ncannot assign unit \"jenkins-slave/0\" to new machine: use \"juju add-machine ssh:[user@]<host>\" to provision machines\n\nI also tried:\njuju remove-service jenkins-slave\njuju deploy jenkins-slave --to 2\nAdded charm \"cs:precise/jenkins-slave-7\" to the environment.\nERROR cannot assign unit \"jenkins-slave/0\" to machine 2: series does not match\n\nIt makes no sense, since before attempting to deploy jenkins, I added two machines:\njuju add-machine ssh:machine1\njuju add-machine ssh:machine2\n\nboth successfully finished.  Here's my status output\njuju status\nenvironment: manual\nmachines:\n\"0\":\nagent-state: started\nagent-version: 1.20.14\ndns-name: thebat\ninstance-id: 'manual:'\nseries: trusty\nhardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=1 mem=979M\nstate-server-member-status: has-vote\n\"1\":\nagent-state: started\nagent-version: 1.20.14\ndns-name: elemental\ninstance-id: manual:elemental\nseries: trusty\nhardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=1 mem=979M\n\"2\":\nagent-state: started\nagent-version: 1.20.14\ndns-name: terrifying\ninstance-id: manual:terrifying\nseries: trusty\nhardware: arch=amd64 cpu-cores=1 mem=979M\nservices:\njenkins:\ncharm: cs:trusty/jenkins-2\nexposed: false\nunits:\n  jenkins/0:\n    agent-state: started\n    agent-version: 1.20.14\n    machine: \"1\"\n    open-ports:\n    - 8080/tcp\n    public-address: elemental\njenkins-slave:\ncharm: cs:precise/jenkins-slave-7\nexposed: false\nunits:\n  jenkins-slave/0:\n    agent-state: pending\n\n\nA: The answer is quite simple, yet very unlikely.  The charm for jenkins-slave is a precise charm, which means it can only be installed on a precise Ubuntu VM.  \nWhile this only seems obvious after an entire day with juju, I believe it is a major problem with this tool.  Chef / Puppet, etc are not flavor dependent, so why is juju flavor version dependent.  It's a major lack of planning in my opinion.  \n\nA: You are using the manual provider, which means you have to manually manage and match the charm series with the series deployed on the unit.  If you used, e.g., the local provider (the documentation provides a predefined Vagrant image which has been tested to work on OS X), Juju would automatically manage the unit allocation—including the series—for you so that you would not run into this issue.\nThe series defined for a charm is the version of Ubuntu that the charm has been tested on and is known to work with.  It is entirely possible that the charm will work with a newer series, and in many cases the same charm is submitted for both series.  (There has also been some discussion of supporting multi-series charms, where the supported series are defined in the charm's metadata.yaml.)\nIf you find a charm that is only available for a specific series but you really want to run it on a different series (with the caveat that it may not function correctly), you can always branch the charm from Launchpad into a local directory structure of <series>/<charm-name> and deploy it using juju deploy local:<series>/<charm-name>.  (This is the same process that a charm author would use to being making the charm support a new series.  If you do this, and are able to get the charm to work, certainly the charm maintainer would likely appreciate you submitting your changes to allow the charm to support the new series.)\nNote that the series restriction only applies to the machine upon which that charm is deployed.  As long as two charms support the same interface, they can be related and work together, even if they are running on different series.\n", "Q: Difference Between GNOME on Red Hat and Ubuntu? I am learning RHCE 6.0 course.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I learn it on Ubuntu? (Till now I am able to work, but in future am I supposed to install Red Hat?)\n\n*What is the difference between GNOME on Red Hat and Ubuntu?\n\nA: Install Red Hat in VirtualBox if you don't want to install it as a normal operating system installation. A basic vanilla installation of Red Hat in VirtualBox should be enough for what you are trying to do. GNOME on Ubuntu is similar in almost all respects to GNOME on other Linux distributions generally.\nSince the course you're taking is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, you will have an easier time with the course if you have the installation iso for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. If you don't have an RHEL 6 iso, then try to install as close a match as you can to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 ships with the GNOME 2 desktop environment which is no longer provided in the repositories of the current versions of Ubuntu Desktop. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, GNOME 3 is the default desktop environment. GNOME 3 is the version of the GNOME desktop environment that is in the repositories of the current Ubuntu Desktop releases.\n\nA: If you're targeting RHEL/CentOS 6, they're using GNOME2, that is, the GNOME used on Ubuntu 10.04. So, there's a huge difference in terms of GNOME on Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 with that on RHEL/CentOS 6.\n\nA: 1) I would say that this is not a good idea. Although most basic commands are very similar (or even the same) on Ubuntu and Red Hat, advanced system administration stuff (in terms of tools and procedures) is very different. \nIn case you want to practice on a \"free\" version of Red Hat, I suggest you take a look at CentOS (http://centos.org/).\n2) GNOME is a graphical interface for Linux, and is the default for Red Hat and Ubuntu GNOME. Apart from some minor differences, I think both distributions are very similar in this regard.\n", "Q: Can't expand Ubuntu VM's hard drive space Running df -h returns:\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1       3.9G  3.7G  1.8M 100% /\nnone            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev            2.0G  4.0K  2.0G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           396M  880K  395M   1% /run\nnone            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            2.0G   76K  2.0G   1% /run/shm\nnone            100M   48K  100M   1% /run/user\n\nFor some reason Ubuntu says I only have 4GB hard drive space, but in VirtualBox, under Storage > Controller: SATA it says I have Ubuntu.vdi (Normal, 11.72 GB).\nI've tried running resize2fs as well, and it returns:\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda1\nresize2fs 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)\nThe filesystem is already 1048320 blocks long.

If you have other users whose home directories reside on /home then you will likely need to correct those ownerships as well.\n\nA: As said in the comments you should always backup your system before updating , creating.

I have an SD card that's connected via a USB interface. \nThe output of fdisk -l indicates the following: \nDisk /dev/sdb: 3965 MB, 3965190144 bytes\n\nI have a script that re-initializes multiple partitions on a disk using mkfs.ext4 and mkfs.vfat commands, all followed by a sync. Although the sync command finishes with an exit code of 0, the light on the USB SD adapter is still flashing (indicating disk activity).\nCurrently, in my script I have a count-down timer to just count-down 90 seconds, which I've determined is 'good enough' to ensure that the disk isn't busy before the next operation, but it's really a hack.\nQuestion: Is there a generic way to check whether the physical device /dev/sdb is being accessed, regardless of operation (i.e. including re-writing partitions, re-reading the partition table using sfdisk, or accessing a file on a partition on the disk)? \nI've tried fuser /dev/sdb and fuser /dev/sdb*, but it doesn't achieve this goal - when the light is flashing on the USB SD card adapter, there's not always output from the fuser command.\n\nA: \nIf you were using dd there is a command that would tell us if still doing its job \n sudo pkill -USR1 -n -x dd\n\nDont sound like that what you're doing. \nI think the reason the activity light is still going after sync is because writing to SD Card tends to be slower......

The strange thing is, sometimes I can connect and the conection would stay for the whole day...on other days it's not possible at all or isn't working for few hours and suddenly I can connect. In the beginning this problem wasn't so bad and mostly everthing worked out fine, but now I have this problem whereever I try to connect and I tried it with several routers already.\nWith a wired connection the internet works out very well.\nI was already making some research and from what I red I assume that it has to do with the wifi driver. I found out that my network adaptor is an Atheros 9462. \nThat article might be similar to my problem, but none of the commands really worked out ( it could have been my fault, as I'm not that much into ubuntu at the moment):\nAtheros AR9462 WiFI very unstable & package loss\nIs there anybody who is able to explain me in simple words how I could solve my problem?\n\nA: I used to get this on my computer, I dont know why this happens but the solution that worked for me was to disconnect from your internet and reconnect and re-enter that code to access your internet. \n\nA: Your problem is one of two things:\n1.\nYour computer's network adaptor is the issue, this means that you computer keeps disconnecting from the network. This can be solved by contacting the company you got the computer from.\nOr 2.\nYou router is loosing connection to the internet, this means that all the devices loose connection to the internet but stay connected to the router. This means that you should contact your internet service provider.

If it finds display driver, enable it. Then reboot. \nEdit\nCommenter may be right, I didn't notice the low video/system ram. You may want to use something lightweight like Lubuntu, possibly Xubuntu\n\nA: As you're using an Intel Graphics card/chip, you can try installing more apt drivers using Intels Linux Graphics Installer. Here's a step-by-step instruction:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Intel Open Source website and download the latest Graphics installer for Ubuntu. Download the installer for the correct architecture (32-/64-bit). I assume you'll need the 32bit one.\n\n*The downloaded file will have a .deb file extension, meaning it's a software package. When you double click it, the Ubuntu Software Center should open up, prompting you to confirm the installation. Click Install and enter your password.\n\n*After the installation finished, you should have a new item somewhere in your menu/dash with the name Intel Linux Graphics Installer. Click it.\n\n*Follow the steps described by the installer. You may have to enter your password again.\n\n*If it's able to find a driver, it'll install it. If this succeeded, close the program and reboot your computer and you may have working graphics.\n\n\n\nFor such an old and weak computer, Unity (the desktop of Ubuntu) could be too demanding. You may try a more lightweight flavor like Lubuntu. In Lubuntu, instead of USC, a program called GDebI will open to install .deb packages. The procedure will be the same, though.\n", "Q: \"APC does not appear to be running\" Help!\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm a Linux newbie. I have a VPS with Ubuntu 12.04.5 on it.\n\n*It came with PHP 5.3.

In other words I need an ssh key pair where I don't actually have to generate the key on any of the systems that will be ssh-ing.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: On system A:\nmkdir /tmp/my-keys\ncd /tmp/my-keys\nssh-keygen -t rsa -f some-name\n\nit will generate a some-name file containing the private key, and a some-name.pub file containing the public key.\nNext, copy the some-name private key to system B (the one you want to connect from). Place it in the .ssh directory for the user you'll connnect as. If the user doesn't have an .ssh directory, create it by running ssh-keygen in that system; or, if you don't want to (I think this is your whole point), manually create the directory, copy the some-name file into it, and ensure .ssh has mode 700, and the some-name file is 600. Both should be owned by the user in question.\nFinally, copy some-name.pub public key to system C (or any system you want to be able to connect to, from B). Place it in the .ssh directory for the user you'll connect as. Rename it to authorized_keys, this is the list of keys SSH will examine; any private key which matches the given public keys will be allowed to connect.\n", "Q: CTRL, ALT, SHIFT or right-click kills some windows For the last few days, certain desktop applications have started dying whenever the Ctrl, Alt or Shift keys are pressed, or the GUI is right-clicked.

Because by default, root owns the /var/www/html, so we need to set the folder's group to A1, and set the permissions\nsudo chgrp A1 /var/www/html\nsudo chmod 771 /var/www/html\n\nThis allows anyone to go into the /var/www/html, but not edit or view the content folders.

I am pretty sure I did not over write it because I can see the solid state drive in my Ubuntu desktop and it has all the \"Windows program files, etc.\"\nCan you help me figure out how to get my boot menu to show both ubuntu and windows?\nWhat are some things I can try at this point?\n\nA: I am not sure if I understand correctly, but if you mean not having to re-install programs, I see several options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use Application Mover to migrate them from the HDD to the SSD before formatting Win 7 on the HDD. \n\n*Leave them where they are; (don't format Win 7* on the HDD), and run them from SSD through shortcuts. \n\n*Use portable applications versions when possible, and locate them on the HDD. Also install the application \"PortableApps\" with it's own Start Menu to access them like installed versions. \n\n*Install new programs (installer versions) on a folder in the HDD.. this may make them slightly slower (probably unnoticeable), but save you space on the SSD. \n\n*For your final question: When you install programs you most always get prompted to decide where you want them installed, so instead of C:\\Program files, just change the drive letter to X:\\Program files. If you leave Win 7 on the HDD intact, you can keep installing programs there, and the user start menu will go to the X:\\Users\\your user acct\\Application Data\\program name. A part of each installation goes to the Windows folder which can't be moved but it's a minimal part. \n\n\nLeaving Win 7 on HDD intact, you can even keep using the same User Profile folder setting the same folder in the new installation, as the \"Users\" folder, or the User Profile folder. The larger temps are located in the user folder (C:\\Users\\Your user acct\\Local Settings\\Temp and Internet Temp files), the System temp files are in C:\\WINDOWS\\Temp but system temps are a lot less... and you can clean them regularly through Start\\Run\\type: \"temp\" and the System Temp folder opens. \n\nA: Before you do anything further, make sure you have a backup of any information or data that is important to you on either your Windows drive, or your Ubuntu drive.  Reconfiguring your partitions can go horribly wrong, and doing bit-level recovery does not always work.\nYou may have overwritten your EUFI partition.\nYou may have changed some of your BIOS, so your computer is not booting to the Windows drive.\nWindows does prefer have the first physical drive as it's system drive; I have seen weird behavior from Windows when it is not on the first physical drive.\nGrub2 is the usual boot loader for Linux.  There is a lot of documentation on the Internet on using it.  Google is your friend.\n", "Q: How to figure out whether a package is already installed? I installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 as a guest on a windows host.\nBefore installing GCC, I need to make sure that the following packages are installed:  \nGMP, MPFR and MPC  \nI checked the Ubuntu package site and I think they correspond to:\nlibgmp10, libmpfr4 and libmpc3  \nHow do I find out whether the packages have already been installed?\nIf they haven't been installed, how do I install them?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can list all installed packages via dpkg like this\ndpkg -l\n\nYou can then pipe that through grep to only find the things you are interesting in:\ndpkg -l | grep libgmp10\n\nOr you can be less specific in your grep \ndpkg -l | grep libgmp\n\nGrep will find any line in the output with that string.\nInstalling is easy also\nsudo apt-get install <package>\n\nNot sure of the package name? Tab complete works in the apt-get install command also, or you can use:\nsudo apt-cache search <string>\n\n\nA: There are many ways to find whether a package is installed or not in Ubuntu. For example if we want to find whether vim is installed or not in Ubuntu we can use any of the following commands:\ndpkg -s vim\ndpkg --get-selections | grep 'vim' #I always prefer this one as it shows other packages that has the pattern `vim` in their names, very useful in some cases\ndpkg -l vim\napt-cache policy vim\n\nNow if want to install a package after finding that its not installed already, just do the following (here we are installing vim, just replace vim with whatever package you want):\nsudo apt-get update #It will update the local cache of repositories, not mandatory but recommended\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nHere is a simple bash script to check if a package is installed or not, if not then it will install the package. It will ask you to input the name of the package. \n#!/bin/bash\necho \"What's the name of the package you want to check?\"\nread package\ncheck=$(dpkg -s $package 2>/dev/null | sed -n '2,3p' | grep -o 'installed')\n\nif [[ \"$check\" == 'installed' ]]\n        then\n                echo -e \"$package is already Installed\\n\\n\"\nelse\n        echo -e \"$package is Not installed\\n\\n\"\n        sudo apt-get install $package\nfi\n\n\nA: Use sudo apt-get install $package-name1 $package-name2 $package-name3, as many packages as you want. If they are already installed, it will say $package-name is already the newest version.\n\nA: \nYou can install GMP with \n sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev\n\nMPFR\n sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev\n\nMPC\n sudo apt-get install MPC\n\n\n\nA: For saving the entire output of dpkg -l to a file:\ndpkg -l > ~/Desktop/packages\n\nand open with a text editor:\nnano ~/Desktop/packages\n\n", "Q: OSError: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable When doing a network broadcast from Python, I get this: OSError: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable\nMy code is as follows:\ndef send(ip, message):\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n    sock.connect((ip, 4601))\n    try:\n        sock.sendall(message)\n        response = sock.recv(1024)\n    finally:\n        sock.close()\n    if response:\n        return response\n    else:\n        return False\n\nI replaced ip with \"<broadcast>\" and that's when I get the error. My server is listening on port 4601 so I don't understand what's going on. I also replaced it with the actual network broadcast address provided in network-manager and still got nothing.\n\nA: In case of broadcast, you should not use TCP rather you should use UDP. Then again you need to use sendto()  method instead of connect(). sendto() is used to send data to a certain address which is the \"broadcast\" address in our case. So the following should work:\nimport socket\nmessage = \"Hello\"\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\ns.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)\ns.sendto(message, ('<broadcast>', 50000))\n\n", "Q: Kubuntu 15.04 Vivid Vervet: Why do GTK apps look ugly?

I am taking a linux class this semester and one of the questions on a lab is:\nUse the set command to find out all directories in your path.\nNormally, I would just use $PATH to find out the directories in my path.  But, obviously the question is asking us to use set.  I have never used set before and went to do man set to find out a little bit about the command, but, to my surprise my shell (bash) didn't have an entry for set.  However, I see that there is a set man page here http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html So that is my first question: Why isn't there an entry when I use the command man set?  \nI posted on a discussion board that if i just type set it spits out a bunch of function stuff that looks like info from rails which I have installed on my machine.  No idea whats going on there..  My professor explained that set is a \"built in\" function which is why it might not have documentation in the man pages. \nAfter looking at the set documentation online a little bit, I still have no idea how I can get it to spit out my $PATH and after doing a little research I haven't found anything that really explains set well in the context that I need to use it\nTo be clear I am not simply seeking an answer here, a general explanation pointing me in the right direction would be very helpful.\nTL;DR\n\n\n*\n\n*Why can I find a man entry online for set but when I use the command man set no documentation is available in my terminal.\n\n*What might be a general way to use set to find the directories in my PATH\nThanks!\nedit: The full question: \n\n\n*Use the set command to find out all of the directories in your “PATH.” You will get a lot of data and you will need to pipe to another command to filter out just what you want. Please note that PATH is capitalized. Paste or type those directories below. You will get a bunch of data so see if you can dig through it to get the answer.\n\n\nA: You are correct that set is a shell builtin: that means that its documentation is in the manual page for bash (in the SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS section) rather than in a manpage of its own. More simply, you can get basic usage information by typing\nhelp set\n\nfrom the shell prompt. As to using it to \"find out all directories in your path\" it would be useful to have some context - I can't really imagine what your instructor/teacher might be intending, aside from perhaps using set -- $PATH (with a suitable IFS field separator) to assign path elements to the shell's positional parameters, and then print them.\n\nA: *\n\n*There is a manual entry for set: the one derived from the POSIX standard's specification of set. To view it, you must have manpages-posix-dev installed (well, manpages-posix would do, but you might as well install both). Then you can do:\nman 1posix set\n\nOr visit the online Ubuntu manpage: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/set.1posix\nWhen possible, do prefer the manpages from that site, since it reflects the manpages that can be made available on your Ubuntu system. Other sites may vary markedly.\n\n*What your prof probably intended was that you would use the grep command in combination with set. This is not the Right Way™ for a few reasons. grep can be used to filter out lines from the output of another command, or from a file. And set's default output is ... every variable set in your shell and their values, including PATH.\nLastly, you forgot to click Next while viewing the Bash documentation.\n", "Q: Is there any way to use ubuntu to convert an ISO to DMG?

The reason why I'm asking this is that the encryption leaves up to a length of 143 characters to be used as filename. While normally it doesn't seem like a trouble, it becomes one when the name of a file contains many multi-byte CJK (Chinese, Janpanese, Korean) characters.\nHowever, I wasn't able to manually rename the file, because it was supposed to be downloaded and processed internally by a program. Specifically, it is the resume file used by Transmission, which should be stored under ~/.config/transmission/resume directory.\nAs I do know in which folder the file will be stored (in this case, the aforementioned resume folder), I'd like to unencrypt this specific folder to solve the \"filename too long\" issue.\nSo my question is, aside from unencrpting the entire home folder, is there a way to unencrypt only one specific folder/directory?\n\nA: I don't know a way to do exactly what you ask;  but you could create a folder elsewhere and mount it within your home folder, which would solve the problem. \nI do this with à second hdd, mounted as '/home/mark/media', so as not to fill my ssd with photos & music. \nFor example,  create a folder in\n/media/example\nand mount it by adding a link\nln /media/example /home/mark/example\n\nThis will then persist over reboots.  If it's a while partition it's better to add it to fstab\n\nA: If you could decrypt or mount just on single file, it would use the same keys as all the other encrypted files, so I'm not seeing an advantage over just mounting the encrypted home regularly.\nIf you wanted to create another unencrypted folder anywhere else to store the ~/.config/transmission/resume directory, or the whole ~/.config/transmission you could do a bind mount:  \nmount --bind olddir newdir\n\nand wouldn't need to use a separate partition or drive, could put the newdir in / or /home or anywhere.\n", "Q: How to open new window instead of already open window in gnome When I have e.g. Firefox open and I press the Super key, type 'firefox' my existing window is shown.

Add | cut -f 1\nSee the man or info pages for find, xargs, and du for more info.\n\nAfter question was edited to add the files are in a text file, can still use xargs along with it's option:\n--arg-file=file\n-a file\n          Read items from file instead of standard input.  If you use this\n          option, stdin remains unchanged when commands are  run.   Other‐\n          wise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null.\n\nSo:\nxargs --arg-file=file du -bs\n\n\nA: Since you have a specific list of files to be deleted and there's no restrictions in modeling the solution it's pretty straight forward (bash):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ $# -ne 1 ];\nthen\n    echo \"Usage $0 filename\";\n    exit 1;\nfi\n\ntotalsize=0;\n\nwhile read filename\ndo\n    filesize=`du $filename -b | awk '{print $1}'`\n    totalsize=$(($totalsize + $filesize))\ndone < $1\n\necho \"Total usage $totalsize bytes\"\n\nThe filesize variable uses du to get the file's size in bytes. The output would be something like:\n15 file.txt\n\nwhereas we would need only the 15 from that output, to parse I use awk, which print the first line (the delimiters are spaces)\nAdditionally if you want to delete the file too, just add rm $filename at the in the while cycle\n", "Q: how do i download ubuntu desktop on wnidows 8 and make a dvd to upload ubuntu to my laptop I am trying to install Ubuntu desktop to my laptop.

Speed issues I have a ubuntu 14.04 installed on i3 1.4GHz laptop. To do some real time tasks (software) I bought a new i7 2.9GHz laptop with SSD and have copied the ubuntu partion in the pervious laptop to the new laptop.\nMy question is that does the previously installed programs and software take the advantage of the speed and high configuration in the newer one or is it better to install a new ubuntu again. \n\nA: Of course will it be faster. Why shouldn't it be able to use a better CPU or disk? The hardware will be used properly, but doing a fresh installation could speed it up a bit more anyway, because of the software (no rests of old packages, fresh settings, ...).

Turns out I didn't need it as much. And so, I'm thinking of enlarging the Ubuntu partition instead (to update to Ubuntu 14) but now, I can't since there are those two partitions in between.\nIs there any way I can repartition this without having to format anything? Thanks!\n\n\nA: You can shrink sda4 (e.g. by 10GB) and then just move sda5 and sda6 to the left by the same amount. After that, you have space to enlarge sda7.\nBut caution: Partitioning is always risky! Especially moving the left border of a partition, especially of a bootable system partition, can cause errors that might prevent your machine from booting! A backup is the best way to avoid data loss, so take the time and do it, it might save you much trouble!\n\nA: How about just shrink sda4 (I think windows can shrink itself, in case you're worried about windows' proprietary NTFS filesystem & linux's ntfs drivers) and then create a new separate partition in the new empty space,  for your /home folder, &/or for data? \nA default Ubuntu installation only takes up under 8GB of space (I think, the installer won't run with less than that?), so after moving out some data &/or removing unneeded programs, should be a good amount of space left.\n", "Q: cannot install ubuntu 12.04 LTS using bootable pendrive I have downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 LTS -64bit ISO file and created bootable pendrive using Startup Disk Creator.\nUsing this pen drive,when i try with \"install Ubuntu\" or \"Try ubuntu without Installing\" installation stops at ubuntu pink screen background.\nI already have 12.04 LTS -64 bit and 32 bit in my laptop,Am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS -64bit in new partition.\nI have tried this pen drive with different desktop/laptop and it works fine with \"install Ubuntu\" or \"Try ubuntu without Installing\" so i don't have any doubt with my bootable pen drive.\nplease suggest me how can i overcome with this issue.\nRegards\nSenthil\n\nA: Possibly incompatible graphics, or some other setting.

This works, because the new icon is shown correctly in the whisker menu (in the list of favorite applications, for example).\nHowever, when the application is open, the icon shown in the xfce panel (in the window buttons item) is still the old one. Is there a way to change it also there?\n\nA: I think the only way is to change the \"icon set\", in XFCE it's under the \n\"Settings Manager\" -> Appearance -> Icons\n(I'm not sure how to create a new custom icon set though, that's probably answered in another question or website somewhere)\n\nOr maybe I missed the icons that you want changed... the minimize - maximize - close buttons?\nThey can be chanced with other themes in the\n\"Settings Manager\" -> \"Window Manager\" -> Style\nSettings page (and you can re-arrange & pick the visible buttons too).\n\nA: use xseticon, e.g. for a window named htop\nxseticon -name Htop /usr/share/pixmaps/htop.png \nput it in a shellscript (make it executeable) and point your .desktop file's Exec= line to it\nxterm -T Htop -e htop \nsleep 1;\nxseticon -name Htop /usr/share/pixmaps/htop.png \n\n\nA: sorry for necroposting but I think this is relevant.\nSo I think the issue here arises from the fact that the icon name and the program name differ in .desktop file.\nFor example, I have my own app I am developing and I wrote a .desktop file for it. At the start, my Exec line contained the path to the executable at /usr/bin and Icon line had a path to /usr/share/pixmaps/. However the name of the executable was slightly different than the icon name itself. The program, when installed, shows the icon in Whisker menu and if I put the shortcut file on desktop, however no icon was shown when the program was running, only that blank icon - white window thingy.\nOnce I named my icon exactly like my executable name the icon started showing in the window buttons plugin on xfce panel.\nI've tested this with Skype and Slack which show their icons correctly when installed because as mentioned before, the entries in .desktop files for Exec= and Icon= lines have the same name.

If not, I'd assume it should auto-negotiate a slower speed, but maybe it's not.\nAnd I've read that bad / low quality / damaged cables or plugs won't work correctly at all speeds, maybe that's the case & it's causing errors are higher speeds, and the \"errors:7461\" line above.\nAnd just wondering, how unbearably slow is your internet, if 100 Mbps is too slow? What speeds are you actually getting? WiFi is generally \"fast enough\" for almost everyone everywhere using the internet, and it's only 11 / 54 / 100 Mbps.

Just execute it directly.\nYour (expired) Ubuntu version offers avconv which is missing many features including several concatenation functions.\nConcatenate\nUse the concat demuxer if you want to attempt to join them with no re-encoding. All videos must have the same parameters.\nUse the concat filter if the videos vary in width, height, frame rate, etc. The filter will require re-encoding.\nNote: You never did provide the info I requested a year and a half ago in my comments to your question, so I can't suggest which one you specifically need to use. Also, I can't provide examples specific to your inputs without this info, so the following examples are generic and may not work without additional options.\nconcat demuxer\nMake a text file listing your inputs:\nfile 'input0.webm'\nfile 'input1.webm'\nfile 'input2.webm'\n\nNow run ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -f concat -i input.txt -c copy output.webm\n\nconcat filter\nIn this example input1.webm has a bigger width x height than the others. This example command will scale input1.webm so it matches the other videos:\nffmpeg -i input0.webm -i input1.webm -i input2.webm -filter_complex \\\n\"[1:v]scale=640:-1[v1]; \\\n [0:v][0:a][v1][1:a][2:v][2:a]concat=n=3:v=1:a=1[v][a]\" \\\n-map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" output.webm\n\nAlso see\n\n\n*\n\n*FFmpeg Wiki: Concatenate\n", "Q: Network disconnected.

My fellow worker changed my wallpaper on the guest account (stupid joke). Now I've got a completely mess. The Wallpaper changes automatically every couple of seconds. And when I try to delete the file with the stupid wallpaper in it, it is automatically restored to  my home directory. Please help.\n\nA: This article will help you to change the guest account's settings: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CustomizeGuestSession\nAs you know, at every login you get a completely fresh guest session which will be fully deleted after logout too. But interesting is what happens at the login: To create a new temporary guest session (home directory is in /tmp/guest-XXXXX), Ubuntu takes the contents from /etc/skel/ (default stuff for all users) and /etc/guest-session/skel/ (default guest) and creates the temporary account of it. So to change the guest settings, you will have to change the contents of /etc/guest-session/skel. This is usually done by either replacing this directory with a symbolic link to another user's home path (a hidden user only for tweaking the guest account preferably) or by logging into a guest session and copying its active home directory contents with root permissions to the /etc/guest-session/skel/ folder (from a superuser account logged in parallel).\nAny more problems, or did you understand everything?

(The prompt is displayed as root@ubuntu ~#)\nIs there any difference in the behaviour of these commands?\nThe only thing I could understand is, that sudo su uses the fish configuration located in /root/.config/fish/ and sudo fish uses the fish configuration in my home directory /home/uloco/.config/fish.\nIs there a possibility to crypt my system by using sudo fish? Will there be any owner changes made to files in my home directory if I use this?\n\nA: sudo su executes su as if you were the root user. That means, the shell that is opened is the shell given in the entry of the user in /etc/passwd in the 6th field. In case of your systems root user it might be /bin/fish. That shell is executed as login shell, so the rc-scripts of the root user are executed.\nWhen you execute sudo fish, then the application fish (the shell) is executable as if you were the root user, but within the environment of the calling user.

I am having a weird issue here that I am not quite sure how to fix! \nAfter thinking for almost an entire day that I have one of those infamous boot to black screen issues that I wasn’t able to fix,  I \"fixed\" the issue by forcing my laptop into sleep by closing the lid, waiting until the hardware went to sleep, and opening it again to find my login screen sitting there just like expect it to. I can also login and keep working normally from that point onward. So I am basically booting the OS in sleep mode from what I can figure.\nThis came about because I left the laptop in sleep mode without a power cable over night by accident. My laptop uses, in theory, the nvidia optimus thingy which I believe a lot of users report issues with not working correctly resulting in huge power consumption. This has apparently caused my system to forcefully shut down while in sleep mode.\nHow can I reset everything so I boot normally again?\n\nA: As you didn't specify which exact NVidia hardware you have I can only give a vague answer: \nSome \"nvidia optimus thingies\" take a long time to initialise.

However, once you have Lightning open, you can retrieve the contents of a Webcal link and paste it into a calendar. In this discussion, the following actions are recommended: \n\n\n*\n\n*open Lightning \n\n*in the calendars list: right-mouse click -> new calendar \n\n*select 'on the network'  \n\n*select 'iCalendar'\n\n*then paste the URL to your .ics\n\n\nA: In case someone is wondering, this is also possible with Evolution (tested in version 3.10.4).\nYou can create a new calendar by choosing the \"on the network\" option and use that webcal URL.\nI tested that with Facebook's birthday calendar.

So using the URL from the question (webcal://myservice.com/foobar) as an example, you should be able to go to http://myservice.com/foobar in your browser and it will download the calendar file. Or if you prefer the command line:\nwget 'http://myservice.com/foobar' -O webcal.ics\n\nUse https:// for webcals:// URLs:\nwget 'https://myservice.com/foobar' -O webcal.ics\n\n\n*In Lightning, go to Events and Tasks > Import\n\n*Select the file you downloaded\n\n*Select the existing calendar to import into\nIf you've already done the steps in Jos' answer or if you no longer have the original URL:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Lightning, right-click the calendar with the events from the webcal URL > Export Calander\n\n*Repeat the steps above starting with step 2 to import the events into another calander\n\n*(Optional) Unsubscribe from the calendar with the events from the webcal URL (right-click > Unsubscribe Calander)\n", "Q: ATI driver for Radeon 6530D After installing Ubuntu on a machine with a Radeon 6530D graphics card, the machine will reboot to a black screen because of problems with the default graphics driver. \nHow do I install the proprietary ATI driver? \n\nA: This is how I installed the ATI driver for Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04. \n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot.

Any word from the developers (I can't seem to find any) on making this functionality available?\n\nA: So, on a whim I reinstalled Ubuntu from the latest version (14.10). I originally had 14.04 LTS. Nothing I did could get this to work (even reinstalling 14.04). So I downloaded the lastest release and did a clean install.

When you enable the lock screen option you get prompted to enable Accessibility features. This is the key for log in screen. Onboard doesn't automatically pop up at login. But in the task bar, you'll see the little Accessibility icon (a little man figure in a circle). touch that and you get the option to show the keyboard.

You do have a couple of options to make it a better presentation though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase the global font size in the terminal (in Konsole this is Control++). This makes it easier to read at a distance but will limit how many rows you can fit on the screen. MDP will bug out if the font size is too big for the content.\n\n*Use ASCII art! figlet is pretty great for this but you will have to use the markdown code-formatting to preseve the spacing around it in your presentation file.\n __  __         _____ _ _   _      _ \n|  \\/  |_   _  |_   _(_) |_| | ___| |\n| |\\/| | | | |   | | | | __| |/ _ \\ |\n| |  | | |_| |   | | | | |_| |  __/_|\n|_|  |_|\\__, |   |_| |_|\\__|_|\\___(_)\n        |___/                        \n\nUltimately it's going to be a combination of the two.\nmdp really looks like fun though, just make sure you test it on the presentation hardware before you do your presentation - you don't want to be the muppet whose presentation doesn't work.

I find that when I place one of these on a slide it appears at approximately the size of the original transparency rather than scaling to fit the slide. Looking in Position and Size there does not seem to be an automatic way of expanding it to fit. Is there an automatic or quick way of doing this rather than resizing manually?\n\nA: I don't believe this is an option in impress as an alternative:\nYou could write a script to do the manual step for you on a directory full of images you wanted to resize. I would likely do this from the terminal with avconv like this: avconv -i input.jpg -vf scale=160:120 output_160x120.png\nWhere scale is the width and height desired. granted you need to match the orignal ratio or the image won't look quite right so if your image ratio is 4x3 you might use 320:240, and 16x9 you might use 320:180. Based on your comment you might use 280:467. Of course you'll need a loop to iterate through all the input files. \n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor f in *.jpg;\ndo    \ncommand=\"avconv -i $f -vf scale=160:120 $f.160x120.png\"\n$command\ndone\n\nYou could modify this to meet your needs.

By accident I deleted /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh. I then restored it by copying that same file from another similar Linux machine (same OS).\nNow I can't login because the login screen keeps coming back after each successful login. I tried both Xubunto session and Xfce.\nAny suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: If you think it's that file that's responsible, you could reset it back to the packaged defaults by reinstalling the bash-completion package. We have to be a little more forceful to get it to copy the configuration back, but this should work:\nsudo rm /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh\nsudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-confmiss\" install --reinstall bash-completion\n\nReboot and see where that gets you.\n\nIt has just struck me that you might have problems getting to a terminal to enter this! There are several options there but here are my favourite:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recovery Mode's root console\n\n*A LiveCD/USB cross-mount/chroot\nThey should both set you up as root on your install, and from there you should be able to action a change. If nothing else just delete the current bash_completion.sh file.

I found that latest version which is determined in Synaptic Package Manager is older than what is on developer web site. It is different from latest stable versions as well, and even after 2 (or sometime 6) months the version in synaptic is not updated. Why this difference occurs? And is there any way that update latest version for all packages in Synaptic?\n\nA: On Ubuntu, the major-versions of software included are fixed within a distribution. \nBecause you usually don't get upGRADES with new functions in a stable distribution (ie Ubuntu 14.10), only upDATES which fix actual problems. Major changes are applied to the next release of the distribution (ie Ubuntu 15.04). So an upgraded version might be coming with the next version of the distribution in use. This applies to most Linux-distributions. They don't want to make sure that you have the most recent software all the time, but that the software is working together perfectly. \nUsing PPAs for some software is a possible compromise to get more recent software, or you can download the tarball from the developers website and compile yourself. \nThere are some distibutions using rolling releases - ie Arch Linux - in this case there is no version of the distribution itself. This is nice for enthusiasts and early-adaptors, but using such a distribution you will for sure experience problems with incompatibilities, and you will have to fix some things which probably never were experienced by someone before you, so there will be a point where you are on your own. \nYou should not use rolling releases in case you need your system for work. \nHowever, even when using a rolling distro, you will still need to wait till the maintainers of the distribution created a package for the package-management in use. \nIf you REALLY want to have the most recent version of anything, you will need to create your own Linux-from-scratch-system, what means building ANYTHING yourself. But you would not have any spare-time to use your system for the rest of your life if you plan that as you will be recompiling software all the time ;)\n", "Q: how can I configure my live (x|l|k)ubuntu to: have my username and NOT autologin I am playing around with the ISO image of a few Ubuntu derivatives - which should be fairly similar to Ubuntu. The version is 14.04.1 64bit. The idea here is to create a custom live USB stick, based on the live session that you get when you first boot Ubuntu from a DVD-ROM or a USB stick. \nNote that, I have tried a normal installation of Ubuntu in the USB stick, but this is not suitable for me, because the USB is slow as a storage media. As a result, any session in this system was sluggish and generally ineffective. \nSo for best results and quicker respond the session needs to be run from a RAM-drive and the path of least effort seems to be the live Ubuntu session that you get when booting Ubuntu LiveCD or LiveUSB. If you have any other suggestion please feel free to put it forward.\nI have gone through a large number of guides. I have heard of Ubuntu customization kit and of other (mostly very old) specific customizations. One thing that is certain among all guides is that the customization needs to be done in the casper initial (ram?) system. So, I have extracted the ISO image of Xubuntu, and I have unsquashed the filesystem.squashfs boot file.  From what I have read the boot scripts are located in \nsquashfs-root/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/ #directory\nsquashfs-root/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper #file\n\nAnd what I want to achieve - at least initially - is to \n\n\n*\n\n*have my own user with my own user name.\n\n*delete the live session user\n\n*disable autologin\n\n\nI have already tried to do this from the live session (using persistency) but lightdm autologin features are not persistent and the same is true for deleting the live session user.\nso in the file casper I see there are 4 awesomely relevant entries\nUSERNAME=casper\nUSERFULLNAME=\"Live session user\"\nHOST=live\nBUILD_SYSTEM=Custom\n\nand changed it to\nUSERNAME=nass\nUSERFULLNAME=\"not a live session\"\nHOST=portableos\nBUILD_SYSTEM=Custom\n\nIt looks like not only I can have my own user from boot , but also there is no need to delete the casper user as I am already the main user replacing casper :)\nUnfortunately, replacing these with custom values, re-making the squashfs file system and replacing the file in the ISO does not change the live session user. The live session user is once again called \"Ubuntu\".\nLikewise, doing chmod -x in file casper-bottom/15autologin  (or even deleting it altogether) did not alter the boot process and did not ask for a password during login. \nSo it appears this is once again NOT the right location to create a new user, delete the casper user or to disable the autologin boot process.\nSo I have to ask, WHERE should I do all these customizations? \nEDIT:\ncommenting user-session=xubuntu in squashfs-root/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/10-xubuntu.conf I have successfully disabled the autologin. \nAlso I have updated the file squashfs-root/etc/casper.conf\nUSERNAME=nass\nUSERFULLNAME=\"not a live session\"\nHOST=portableos\nBUILD_SYSTEM=Custom\n\nbut again I boot to user \"Ubuntu\" - this is the only available user.\nFinally, squashfs-root/etc/passwd does not contain any entry for user \"Ubuntu\" so I can not simply alter it there.\nIt goes without saying that I \"mksquashfs\" the file system and replace the relevant file before every attempt to boot it.\n\nA: Finally!\nAfter endless hours of search and combining sparse information, to change the default username, one much reach into the initrd.lz. It appears that sqyashfs inherits the username as it is exported from the initial ram drive.\nSo once you have extracted the liveCD ISO, pick up the initrd from casper/initrd.lz , and :\n\n\n*\n\n*extract the initrd with lzma -dc -S .lz /mnt/casper/initrd.lz | cpio -id\n\n*move the initrd.lz that was just extracted in the current folder, away from tcurrent folder.\n\n*add your preferred username & hostname in etc/casper.conf. \n\n*in the same file uncomment the \"flavour\" variable.\nNote that there is no need to alter the default username and values in scripts/casper. You may be confused as I was, but there is no reason why these are there. (why really?)\n\n*return to the initrd root folder and recreate the initrd file as find . | cpio --quiet --dereference -o -H newc | lzma -7 > ~/new-initrd.lz\nEDIT:\n--dereference in step #5 above should not be used in more recent (>=17.04) versions of *ubuntu.\nNow,replace the other initrd.lz under  extracted-iso/casper/ and you should be able to log in with the username that you chose.\n\nA: Sorry for stating the obvious, but your original problem was that a live USB stick is too slow for you, so now you're trying to achieve through a software solution which is easily solved through another hardware solution...\nJust buy an SLC USB stick, install Ubuntu on there, modify the boot process to your needs and you're done! 15 minutes? 20???\nAn SLC USB 3.0 stick is basically an SSD hard drive on a stick.  They're about 2-3 times as expensive as a normal USB stick, but they're also 4-8 times as fast (for the same USB speed) and last 4-8 times as long... \nThe only disadvantage that I can see is that you can't expect to walk into any small shop and expect them to be on stock!\n\nA: Booting the drive, then going to User Accounts, (or Users and Groups), and adding yourself as a user, used to work, this would also get rid of user Ubuntu.\nThe drive must have a persistent install.\nThere may be some problem shutting down.\nIf you prefer the edit filesystem.squashfs method, it is probably easiest to edit this while booting from a Live DVD or a second Live USB.\nIf you need to edit this while booted from the target drive, then for a live USB go to filesystem/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs.\nIf you are booting the iso file using grub2 then go to filesystem/isofile/(location of the iso) and open the iso with Archive Manager and edit the filesystem.squashfs you find there.\n\nA: I confirm, it's work for me\nTo change user name: \n\n\n*\n\n*new-initrd/etc/casper.conf\nTo change uid:\n\n\n*\n\n*new-initrd/scripts/casper-bottom/25adduser\nMore about customize initrd image:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/CustomizeLiveInitrd\n(Be careful to delete the file .disk/info on your usb drive because it can override your setting)\nSébastien\n", "Q: Wireless mouse lags on high CPU usage I sure hope this is a novel problem as I have tried to find a solution to it every time I get really fed up with this, which has been quite a few times, but no luck so far.\nTrouble is that when my CPU is under heavy load then my wireless mouse (HP Z4000) starts to lag a LOT.\nThe strange thing is that if I move the mouse closer to the receiver on the PC, the lag goes away. It's not a solution though, because when I say closer, I mean about 10-15cm from the receiver, which is not feasible when trying to use a laptop with an external monitor, a mouse and keyboard attached.\nAlso the touchpad works just fine. For example if I load a huge file the wireless mouse refuses to cooperate until either the file has finished loading or I close it using keyboard or touchpad, which remain usable.\nI have tried with all four USB ports (2x2.0, 2x3.0) and the problem persists.\nIs it possible, that high CPU load draws power from the USB ports so the signal strength weakens?\nI'm using an HP Elitebook G840(i5-4200U, 4GB RAM) and Ubuntu 14.04.\nAnything else I should add here that would help?\n\nA: I experienced the same thing on my desktop computer with a Logitech mouse.

So after googling how to revert what I have done, I managed to reinstall ubuntu-desktop and then I went through the history of Software Center and reinstalled everything that was removed.\nNow I think that the system should be ok, but apt-get is still suggesting, that I have packages which can be removed. Honestly, I don't believe him, because the list is quite long and some things sound important. Also most suggested packages are related to Java, which are obviously important to me as a Java developer.

removes orphan  packages i.e. those packages that were automatically\n installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no longer needed.\nSo running apt-get remove should not create any harm in your case. \nYou are getting this because you might have missed some packages to reinstall.\nNow if you don't want to see these long list in your apt-get autoremove command , you can use apt-mark for this .Mark all these package as manual so that apt-get will consider these packages as installed manually.\nFrom man apt-mark\n   manual\n       manual is used to mark a package as being manually installed, which\n       will prevent the package from being automatically removed if no\n       other packages depend on it.\n\n\nSyntax of apt-mark for above is\nsudo apt-mark manual

I'd like to upgrade the Ubuntu to 14.04 LTS.  Can I do it?  And how can I do it so that the Windows Vista partition remains intact?\nThis question received a \"duplicate\" marking incorrectly.  My question is not about simply upgrading from 11.04 to 14.04 LTS; I know that requires three steps.  It's about doing it on a dual-boot system, without disturbing the Windows partition.  Can this be done?  And how do I go about it?\n\nA: it depends on how you have your version of Ubuntu installed. If it's on a separate partition, you could just get the installation on a disk and run the installation and just run it under 'upgrade.' It will then do the update from there off of the disk itself. You could also just install over the older version with the newer version of ubuntu. WARNING! if you install over an older version, it is wise to back up your personal documents of either a flash drive, CD/DVD, or Ubuntu Cloud.\n", "Q: ubuntu 14.04 installation in virtual box very slow I am a newbie to the Unix OS , I was advised to start working on Ubuntu and due to some restrictions I had to install it on Oracle Virtual Box. I gave it the right amount of RAM but it's still not usable , it's very slow.  Do you kow any way to fix this ? \n\nA: well, have you thought of the possibility that you are running it in an emulator/ virtual box? When you run an Operating System in a virtual box, you are cutting your system's performance in half. So, when you said that you added the right amount of ram, you ought to have doubled the recommended RAM. The virtual box consumes more ram than what is recommended. it also depends on your processor. i ran a virtual box of my own and the system registered that i was using a single-core processor and 2 GB of RAM when I actually had a Dual-core and 4 GB of RAM. The best option is to upgrade your hardware or just install Ubuntu alongside Windows/ Mac OSx. You could also see about partitioning your HDD and just install Ubuntu by itself (dual-boot). You would still be able to work on ubuntu, as far as programming and what not, from the primary Operating System. Ubuntu provides free ubuntu console editors for free. Running in Bare-metal mode is also optional, but you still may not get maximum performance from your system.\n\nA: Have you considered adjusting the settings in virtual box?\n\n", "Q: Help with an IF and SED to replace \\n I have a filename variable that sometimes gets set as:\nattachment; \nJobRunStatisticsReport_20150122.zip\n\nIn the File Manager window, it looks like this:\n\nI need help coming up with an IF statement that says:\nIF $filename contains 'attachment; \\n'\nthen\nand then help with a SED that looks for that new line character (\\n) and replaces that and everything before it with nothing.\nCan anyone lend a quick hand please?\n\nA: Your filename actually contains both a carriage return and a newline. bash parameter expansion can handle this:\n$ filename=$'attachment;\\r\\nJobRunStatisticsReport_20150122.zip'\n$ echo \"$filename\"\nattachment;\nJobRunStatisticsReport_20150122.zip\n$ shopt -s extglob\n$ echo \"${filename##attachment;*([[:space:]])}\"\nJobRunStatisticsReport_20150122.zip\n\nDoes not affect \"normal\" filenames:\n$ filename=\"no attachment here\"\n$ echo \"${filename##attachment;*([[:space:]])}\"\nno attachment here\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu: How to execute a script without using terminal? This is my dilemma. I have a program that can only be launched through terminal. So, right now I am always having to first open the terminal and then do the following ./theGUIScript. It runs but I want to have a link or a executable script or application on the desktop that does the same thing but with double click. So, whenever I want to start this program, I double click on this link or script. I have looked at all the self-help online on this issue, but there seems to be no definitive answer. And whatever I try it doesn't seem to help. When I think I solved this issue, Ubuntu opens the file with gedit or popups a message saying there is a problem with the shortcut or link.\n\nA: Just move your executable from the directory where it is to the desktop using the mouse. Or if you want to keep it in it's original directory, create a symlink.\nDepending of whether I use a shell script with the extension .sh or a compiled c-program (with just the name a.out) the icons look different, the symbolic links showing some additional arrow, but the programs are being executed ok.\nFrom what you write, the program is obviously executable by you. \nWhat happens, when you right-click on the file?

It\n   can  copy  locally,  to/from  another  host  over  any remote shell, or\n   to/from a remote rsync daemon.  It offers a  large  number  of  options\n   that  control  every  aspect  of  its behaviour and permit very flexible\n   specification of the set of files to be copied.  It is famous  for  its\n   delta-transfer  algorithm,  which  reduces the amount of data sent over\n   the network by sending only the differences between  the  source  files\n   and  the  existing  files in the destination.  Rsync is widely used for\n   backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.\n\n   Rsync finds files that need to be transferred  using  a  \"quick  check\"\n   algorithm  (by  default) that looks for files that have changed in size\n   or  in  last-modified  time.   Any  changes  in  the  other   preserved\n   attributes  (as  requested by options) are made on the destination file\n   directly when the quick check indicates that the file’s data  does  not\n   need to be updated.\n\nSource: man rsync\nBoth pull and push methods are available...\n", "Q: Convert text file with colon-separated values to html table I have a big file with more than 10000 records formatted as below.\nThis needs to be converted to a html table\nI tried various ways of converting into csv and then to html etc, but I have so far not been able to get the desired output\nData.txt\nName       : john\nage        : 20\ntag id     : 1234567\nName       : Mark\nage        : 40\ntag id     : 832245\nName       : tom\nage        : 60\ntag id     : 789324\n......\n\nI want this to be converted into a \"html\" table like this:\nName    Age   Tagid\nJohn     20   1234567\nMark    40     832245\ntom     60     789324\n\nI need to process files of 10000 records.

So it's been stated in other questions that you can't wipe / secure erase an SSD with the same tools that you use to wipe a regular hard drive. This was for two reasons, the first was that you could wear out the drive if you do it regularly and the second was that it actually is ineffective at overwriting old data. The first I get as it pertains to TRIM and \"wear leveling\" etc., the second I don't.  Be that as it may, what would you use to securely erase an SSD, assuming the above?\n\nA: Honestly, I'm not buying into either premise.\nFirst, I'm not sure what is meant by regularly but I can't imagine wiping an SSD often enough to wear it out. I have several systems with SSD drives that I use daily and some of them I have wiped occasionally. \nSecond I see no problem with using dd or dc3dd to wipe an SSD. If there is concern over the wear levelling algorithm leaving data behind in \"spare\" sectors, several runs should do the trick. How many runs are \"secure\" will certainly be a matter of opinion.\nRecommended:\ndc3dd wipe=/dev/sdX where sdX is the drive (ex. sda, sdb, sdc,).

By design, the tool does not remove either Host Protected\nAreas (HPAs) or DCOs.

I'm adding a new EBS volume to an existent Ubuntu server on AWS EC2.\nI created the volume and it's attached to the server, I can see it there, all is OK.\nWhat are the bonus/onus of creating a partition on the volume (so I'll use it like \"/dev/xvdf1\") against using it as is (\"/dev/xvdf\"), creating the file system direct on the volume?\n\nA: Inside EC2, to me, it only really makes sense to use the entire volume for the filesystem, because of the flexibility allowed by Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, which are much different than many physical disks, in the sense that you can provision them as needed, destroy them as needed, attach and detach them from instances without rebooting, and take snapshots and clone them without using the instance's processor, memory, or I/O.  And, without a partition table, resizing when you need more space is cake.\nNeed a bigger filesystem?  If you're using the entire volume without a partition table, it's very straightforward.\nMake an EBS snapshot of the volume using the AWS console, with the volume still mounted and in use. You will not actually use this snapshot, but trust me for a moment.  If you recently made a snapshot of the volume, and still have it, you could skip this step, because the purpose here is to make the rest of the steps faster.  \nUnmount the volume.\nTake a second snapshot.  This is the one you want.  We made the previous one because it will make this snapshot much faster.  When EBS takes a snapshot, it saves the disk contents to a hidden repository on S3. For each consecutive snapshot of the same volume, only the changed blocks need to be stored, so this snapshot will be built, mostly, with stored pointers to the location of all the data that's already been captured, and only changed blocks will be physically backed up.\nCreate a new volume, using the last snapshot.\nAttach the new volume to the instance in place of the old one, and mount it.  Verify the data as needed.\nThen, you can use resize2fs to grow the filesystem to fill the available size on the new volume, while the volume is in use.\nThen delete the first snapshot above.  EBS will \"roll forward\" everything it contains that is also needed by the final snapshot, so the final snapshot is still valid.\nAs a final step, you may want to warm up the new volume using sudo dd if=/dev/xvdx of=/dev/null bs=1M.  When a volume is created from a snapshot, the contents of the volume are loaded \"lazily\" from the snapshot onto the actual volume, which means the volume becomes fully available before its performance is optimal.  If you ask for something from the volume that hasn't been loaded yet by the background process, you'll still get it almost immediately, but not as fast as if the background process had loaded everything.  The dd operation, above, does a physical read of the entire volume, causing the whole thing to be available with the lowest possible latency, more quickly than it otherwise might.  This is documented as something that should be done with the volume unmounted, but whether you do it before or after the resize isn't terribly important.  The various flavors of pre-warming EBS volumes is discussed at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-prewarm.html ...\nTo me, using the entire volume for the filesystem, without a partition table, seems like the only way to go, since it minimizes downtime and the opportunity for error.  All of my EBS (and ephemeral, for that matter) volumes are done this way, except for some very early ones.\nYou can, of course, use fdisk or parted to create and modify the partition table in the customary way, but -- in my opinion -- this is unnecessarily adding additional \"moving parts\" ... which usually translates to more opportunity for error.\nIf you know how to get your local machine's X-Server working, and accepting incoming connections from the EC2 instance in order to display the GUI output locally, you can also easily use the graphical tool gparted on EC2 instances, with the graphical interface displaying on your local workstation screen -- yes, this works, I've done it -- but getting that working is outside the scope of this question.\n\nA: Today I occurred the same problem , when you ceate the new ec2 intance by default EBS is 8GB.\nYou can modify the size of the attached EBS without creating new intace or taking snapshot or detaching EBS..\nHere are the three steps you can follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize EBS Volume\n\n*Resize partition\n\n*Resize partition\nFor the first step go to your AWS console and click EBS and change the desired size and click modify.\n\n\nFor the rest of the steps please follow this article\nif you have any quetion feel free to ask.\nThanks!\n", "Q: Remap right click key to Fn? my laptop has a dedicated right click key and I was wondering if that could be remapped to a Fn key.\nI've tried searching for an answer.

You'll get a list of sites for which there are flash settings set. Looking at record 65 at the end of the image, you'll notice the type is plugin:flash and the permission is set to 2. The values 1, 2 and 3 mean respectively allow, block and always ask. If a site has use default selected then there will be no record for it in the table.\nThese four options can be set for a specific site by using the third option in Whocares answer, i.e. click padlock or globe, select more information and then permissions.

Verify this and then we'll talk more. \n\nA: It seems to me like maybe your Grub2 was not properly installed.  In a situation like this, the best thing to do is to simply re-install Grub2 from a Live environment.  Basically you'll have to put in the installation disc again, reboot the pc and make sure that it boots off the disc you just inserted, then having done that, you can go through the process of reinstalling grub2 to sda1 if that's the drive that Windows is booting from.

Computers don't like \"sometimes\": they like \"always\":  #1 is \"sometimes\" without expense and as you're handling the machine anyway, having a script library.sh and monitoring.sh makes sense (as you're on command-line anyway).  #2 is more expensive, but is the most robust solution of all.\nSo, not an answer to your question, but 2 solutions to your problem! ;-)\n", "Q: Downloading Ubuntu to acer chromebook I have an Acer Chromebook c720.

I have an extremely simple script that currently executes a command on a file located in the same folder: command ./file_in_folder option output. It would be better if script asks user which file they want.\nCan a simple script ask the OS's default GUI file manager to open and pass selected file back to script?\nFake Code:\n\n\n*\n\n*User double click executable script\n\n*GUI file manager pops up\n\n*User selects <FILE>\n\n*Script executes command <FILE> option output\nIf no, what is recommended way to pass <FILE> to script that will execute command <FILE> option output?\n\nA: Zenity can be used to make a GUI file picker, using the --file-selection option. For a single file, this is sufficient:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nfile=\"$(zenity --title \"Pick a file\" --file-selection)\"\ndo something with \"$file\"\n\n\nWhere it gets tricky is handling multiple files. There are only two characters not allowed in filenames: the ASCII NULL and /. /, of course, appears in paths. Therefore the only character you can safely pick to separate two filenames is NUL.\nYou can't use NUL since the character has to be passed as a command line parameter.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick one file at a time using repeated selection dialogs.\n\n*Verify that each path returned by zenity is an absolute path and the file exists.\n\n\nSomething like:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nOLDIFS=\"$IFS\"\nIFS='-'\nFILES=($(zenity --file-selection --multiple --separator='-' --title \"Pick a file\"))\nIFS=\"$OLDIFS\"\n\nfor file in \"${FILES[@]}\"\ndo\n    if [[ $file == /* && -f $file ]]\n    then\n        echo $file\n    fi\ndone\n\nOf course, even this does not save us from a filename like /foo/bar-/etc/passwd.

I don't really know what steps I should take aside from resetting/re-installing chrome. Would really appreciate any tips on identifying and removing corrupted or infected files related to the malware. \n\nA: Here are couple of suggestions. When I mention commands, those are to be issued in command-line aka terminal , which you can access by pressing CtrlAltT\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove google-chrome related folders, e.g. /home/username/.config/google-chrome and /home/username/.cache/google-chrome. You can find others with locate google-chrome command.\n\n*Remove google-chrome completely with sudo apt-get remove --purge google-chrome or sudo dpkg --purge google-chrome.\n\n*Get an antivirus or rootkit checker, as well as system cleaning programs. jkrix mentioned ClamTK, which is decent option, but there's others. Open Software Center and simply search for rootkit or antivirus or security. As for cleaning software, I recommend BleachBit. \n\n*Popup adware might not necessarily infect viruses but rather routers. Refer to this post on askubuntu.com.\n\n*Remove .macromedia folder; flash-player related adware isn't something unheard of.\n\n*Adware might not necessarily be attatched to the browser, but come from somewhere else. Open chrome (with only one page if possible) and in terminal isssue the command netstat -tulpan > netscan.txt && gnome-open netscan.txt. This will output list of established connections with list of which progams have established those connections. The text file will be opened as soon as the scan complete with gedit, which is a default text editor in Ubuntu.\n\n*If things don't work out, backup your files and reinstall the whole system. Upon completing the reinstall get yourself a firewall and chrome plug-ins such as adblock or Better Privacy. Reinstalling whole system may sound paranoid, but if a system is seriously compromised, it's better be safe than sorry.\n\n\nYou could also ask about your issue on security.stackexchange.com  . That site is all about cyber security in general, and you probably will find much better solutions than here.\nBest of luck to you !\n\nA: My first guess would be to install and run ClamAV. I've been using it for a few months now and it does a pretty good job at detecting malware.\nI use the GUI version of ClamAV which is called ClamTK.\nHope this has helped you out.\n", "Q: Can't do a release upgrade from 14.04: It was not possible to authenticate some packages Trying to do a release upgrade on Ubuntu 14.04 with:\ndo-release-upgrade\n\nI get the following error:\nIt was not possible to authenticate some packages.

It's worth a try, I love linux and I have so many years using it but now there's only one thing that I cannot do. I have my music collection in flac and I always convert flac to m4a using nero aac under Windows but in Linux I don't know how to do it. With sound-converter and soundkonverter I only get 256kbs aac files and I want them at 400kbs for the sound quality and space.\n\nA: How are you doing it on Windows, with Nero AAC?\nIf you use neroAacEnc -lc -br 400 -if <input-file> -of <output-file> on Windows, then it's  the same on Linux with the Linux binaries that Nero offers.\nYou should re-evaluate your choice of encoder, codec and bitrate:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mobile and entertainment devices today have more storage space, integration to online storage or streaming and support for lossless audio formats. Why not go with FLAC for the important pieces and use 256kbps for everything else?\n\n*There are new encoders and codecs like Fraunhofer FDK AAC and Opus.\n\n*At last, have you ever made a double-blind test with different AAC encoders and your Nero 400kbps encodes? Do you notice any difference? On which playback device and which gear?\n\n\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to convert AC3 6ch audio to HE-AAC? GUI solution?\n\nA: neroAacEnc will not use flac as an input file but you can use Linux pipes to pass the file to neroAacEnc using either ffmpeg or avconv. To achieve your slightly outrageous bitrate use the following:\nffmpeg -i test.flac -f wav - | neroAacEnc -if - -ignorelength -br 400000 -of test.m4a\n\nThis tested nicely on my own system and should work as well with avconv if you prefer to use this instead of ffmpeg. The avconv syntax differes only in the name of the executable:\navconv -i test.flac -f wav - | neroAacEnc -if - -ignorelength -br 400000 -of test.m4a\n\nI confess that the monstrous bitrate could perhaps grow on me as well :)\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hydrogenaudio wiki: Nero AAC\n", "Q: Bluetooth connection issues in Ubuntu 14.04 installed in ASUS F451-CA I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 in my recently bought Laptop ASUS  F451-CA and i have problems with the Bluetooth connection.

Whenever i look at the router page then it\nshows an IP which is completely different from the IP i see in the webpages like ipmango and other sites too. Can a single computer have two different IP address?\n.\n\nA: Yes, a computer can have two different IPs given it has two interfaces.\nThe IP that ipmango is showing is known as the Public IP address whereas the IP address the router page is showing is known as the Private IP address.\nIn a nutshell, you can think of a Private IP address as the address any network other than your Local network will NOT unerstand whereas Public IP address will be understood by those networks. We normally use Private IPs in LAN.\nHere are the ranges of Private IPs:\nClass A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255\nClass B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255\nclass C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 \n\nA router is responsible for routing traffics between two or more different networks. So, let just think it this way, your Router has a WAN interface where you will put the Public IP address without which you will not be  able to go to to the internet. The router also has lets say one LAN interface where you will put a private IP so that you local network can be built under this private IP. \nFor example your router's Public IP is 49.244.254.104 and your router's Private IP is 192.168.1.1. Now you can have a LAN e.g. 192.168.1.0/24 where all your local computers are allocated private IP addresses between 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254. All your LAN's traffic will be first reach the Local facing interface (gateway) having IP 192.168.1.1 of the router, the router will then route the traffic to the internet by using the Public IP.   \n", "Q: Why does the Update Manager say 'Check your internet connection'? Every time Update Manager asks check your internet connection but my internet connection is just fine.\nI've tried sudo apt-get update in terminal. Its working fine also.\nPlease advise me.\n\nA: I had similar problems at one time and solved it by selecting settings in the update manager and clicking Select Best Server. A series of tests are run to find the most responsive server for your situation.\n\n\nA: I had similar issue on Ubuntu 14.04. To resolve it, when the Software Updater fails go to the settings > Ubuntu Software and change the server Download from to the Main Server as shown in the following image:\n\nIt was set on 'United States' and it was working fine, but suddenly this error showed up and as I mentioned changing the server fixed the issue.\n\nA: There is a key difference about how update-manager and apt/apt-get attempt to check for the update. update-manager first checks the Internet connection by asking NetworkManager for the state of the connection. apt/apt-get, in contrast, tries to make a direct connection to the mirror.\nThis can create a big difference, as you have discovered. As the strength of your connection is changing or perhaps even dropping for a few seconds, NetworkManager is changing the state property. The possibilities are Active, Activating, Deactive, Deactivating, and Unknown. \nLeaving out some additional details, update-manager will only accept Active as the correct response; but if NetworkManager detects less than a full signal, it's going to keep changing the state of the connection. (I don't know the details of how NM determines that.) This will cause update-manager to get responses other than Active.\nAgain, apt-get is attempting the connection directly. It may still timeout on you or fail to complete, but it keeps moving.\nI think the issue is a combination of speed and signal strength. If apt-get is working for you, that's probably your best workaround. \nChanging the mirror to a faster or closer one as @elder-geek suggest is definitely a good idea that should help both cases since apt-get will be also be using that new mirror as well.\n", "Q: system crash while using dual operating system I'm using windows 7 i installed Ubuntu as second operating system.\nMy windows files are shows in Ubuntu but i cant able to open it,after some weeks my system has crash windows is not booting.\nMy question is dual operating system with windows and Ubuntu is good?\nIf it is good how to install it correctly?\n\nA: If you want to install Ubuntu in dual-boot with Windows, the best way for a beginning user is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows on a partition using 40% of your hard disk\n\n*Install Ubuntu on a partition using 40% of your hard disk\n\n*create a FAT32 partition of 10% of your hard disk\n\n*Leave the other 10% space free for now to allocate it later to wherever you will need it.\n\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you use Windows, use your Windows applications on your Windows files\n\n*When you use Ubuntu, use your Ubuntu Applications on your Ubuntu files.\n\n*When you need files accessible to both Ubuntu and Windows, store them on the FAT partition.\n\n\nNever any problems!\n", "Q: Need help deleting a directory I have a directory in my home directory (the one with My Documents, etc.) with a name that looks a bit like my username (random upper-lowercase alphabetical characters).

I think it was created by BleachBit, which crashed near the end of wiping free space, and thus, because of the crashing, the file is corrupted and won't do anything.\nHow do I delete it?\nI have Xubuntu, by the way.\n\nA: \nand if you try to delete it it doesn't seem to work\n\nIf a normal rm -rf {dir} does not work do a disk check first. Easiest to do that would be (this will reboot your system and do a disk check during the boot): \nsudo touch /forcefsck\nsudo reboot\n\nAnd try a rm -rf {dir} again. If that still does not work try it from a live dvd. Don't kill the command and let it run for a little while. \nIt is possible that there is an error with the file system where a dir inside a dir points to a dir above (and making an endless loop).

Is not exact answer of my question , but be free to down vote if you want.\n\nA: As you've already installed the xorg-edgers PPA, when you execute the following command:\napt-cache search nvidia | grep --ignore-case binary | grep version\n\nyou should receive:\nnvidia-304 - NVIDIA legacy binary driver - version 304.125\nnvidia-331 - NVIDIA binary driver - version 331.113\nnvidia-340 - NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.76\nnvidia-346 - NVIDIA binary driver - version 346.35\nnvidia-352 - NVIDIA binary driver - version 352.30\nnvidia-355 - NVIDIA binary driver - version 355.06\n\nTo install the latest driver, perform the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-355.06 \n\n(do not use nvidia-current!) and reboot and test\nIf that doesn't solve your problem, go back one level (340) and if that doesn't work another one and another one until it works.  If none work, disable the NVidia chip in your BIOS wait a few weeks and try again with the latest driver (there currently are a bit of problems with NVidia)\n", "Q: efibootmgr cannot launch OSX yosemite (only showing folder image with question mark) I have a macbook pro with freshly installed yosemite (100 GB) and freshly installed Ubuntu.

There were numerous problems getting a bootable system, but finally achieved this with an absolutely clean install of a minimal system on totally fresh partitions.\nMy next step was to install lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter to give me a desktop manager. lightdm installed fine, but the greeter installation fails with\nupdate-alternatives: error: alternative path /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter-ubuntu.conf doesn't exist'\n\nQuite correct - it doesn't. I took a stab that this was purely a creation problem, so created an empty file, reran the installation, and it appears to work successfully. However, any attempts to start lightdm fail with\nSeat: Stopping; failed to start a greeter\n\nI haven't found anything in the greeter logs, and suspect the problem goes back to the greeter installation issues, and its not quite as simple as fudging the missing file. I've removed/reinstalled both lightdm and the greeter a number of times, but haven't got any further.\nAll versions should be the current stable versions - 1.10.3 for lightdm, and 1.8.5 for the greeter. \nI've spent a bit more time today seeing if I could get to the bottom of this. I'm still suspicious that something hasn't installed correctly, but haven't a clue what.\nI deinstalled the standard gtk greeter, and installed an alternative greeter (I happened to grab lightdm-webkit-greeter for no other reason that it was readily available). This installed fine, and on reboot I was presented with a standard login screen. That's a step forward, but it was impossible to login - it refused to authenticate.\nHaving a look at the lightdm log, there are some indications that authentication worked fine, but session creation was the culprit. There are log entries of the form;\n\n\n*\n\n*Authenticate result for user andrew: Success\n\n*User andrew authorized\n\n*Greeter requests session ubuntu\n\n*Seat: Failed to find session configuration ubuntu\n\n*Seat: Can't find session 'ubuntu'\n\n\nNot sure if this is relevant at all, but I've been trying to understand exactly what config files should be present. /etc/lightdm exists, but is empty (I understand this was deprecated in 14.04, so makes sense). In /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d there are the following config files;\n40-lightdm-webkit-greeter.conf\n50-greeter-wraper.conf\n50-guest-wraper.conf\n50-unity-greeter.conf\n50-xserver-coand.conf\n\nI won't pretend I understand how all these fit together, nor exactly what I should expect, but I assume the leading numbers give some order for processing these. A couple of entries in this forum have referred to a 50-ubuntu.conf, but I don't have one of those. Should there be one there (ie. is this the 'ubuntu' mentioned in the session creation error)? If so, this could indicate the problem is with the lightdm installation rather than the greeter?\n\nA: The easiest way to add a desktop to a server is to run this command:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nOTOH, then you would be far from a \"minimal system\"...\n\nA: Just to close the loop, I think I've finally got to the bottom of this.\nA desktop installation also had similar problems, but I was finally left with a clue that pointed to the graphics subsystem.

There I can run configfile (hd0,msdos3)/ROOT/ubuntu/@/boot/grub/grub.cfg and the usual grub menu starts and I can boot my system.\nIt seems to me grub can't find grub.cfg by itself.\nThe instructions actually say the path is (hd0,msdos3)/ROOT/ubuntu@/boot/grub/grub.cfg (notice the @). But this didn't work for me. I had to put a / before the @. But I guess this is not relevant. (3.5 test boot from existing grub installation)\nGrub was installed with grub-install --boot-directory=/rpool/ROOT/ubuntu/boot /dev/sda as per the instructions.\nAnyway, after a few reboots I noticed there is actually a real folder /rpool/ROOT/ubuntu/boot and also a folder /rpool/ROOT/ubuntu/@/boot which contain a grub folder with about everything but a grub.cfg:\n$ ls -l /rpool/ROOT/ubuntu/boot/grub/\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root     3 Jan 30 21:34 fonts\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   699 Jan 31 11:04 gfxblacklist.txt\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  1024 Jan 30 21:34 grubenv\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root   273 Jan 30 21:47 i386-pc\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root     5 Jan 30 21:47 locale\n\n/rpool/ROOT/ubuntu/@/boot/grub/ contains the same.\nI copied /boot/grub/grub.cfg to both locations and now it's working.\nMy actual problem  is that if something updates grub, I have to copy grub.cfg again. For now I added 2 lines to /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig to do the copying on every grub-update. But when the grub package is updated this change will be gone. So I'm looking for a reliable solution here.\nOne further thought:\nCould it be that /rpool/ROOT/ubuntu/ should also hold my filesystem?

If you need more infos let me know.\nFWIW: My only prior knowledge of ZFS is from using freenas, this is my first attempt to do it myself.\n\nA: Some corrections from my own experience.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your \"rpool\" was mounted at \"/rpool\" automatically at the time you created rpool. That's why somewhere in the configuration process you issue zfs set mountpoint=none rpool in order to eliminate that behavior. The same you do for rpool/ROOT to eliminate its automatic mounting at /rpool/ROOT, which you don't need.\n\n*In fact, your zpool is \"rpool\", while \"rpool/ROOT\" is a ZFS dataset and not a zpool. \n\n*With grub-install you can only refer to the current directory tree. That's why you give it --boot-directory=/boot. The script itself doesn't want to hear anything about ZFS. But further in the process other auxiliary scripts included with GRUB2 will check what's mounted there and make sure grub can access it at boot time. So if you use the most recent version of ZFS, as of the date of this writing, GRUB2 will NOT recognize it and will refuse to install there. Alas!\n\n*You sure put \"/\" before \"@\" and it IS relevant, as you yourself admit it DIDN'T work for you otherwise. EDIT: well, it USED to matter, but with the last git code it doesn't.\n\n*Lastly, booting into snapshots is not supported, I'm afraid. That is to say, while you CAN tell GRUB to use something like (hd0,2)mypool/ROOT/myfs@version etc., your actual boot will be not what you expect. So don't do that.\n\nA: I just figued it out:\nThe grub-install command was wrong. --boot-directory needs to be /boot instead of /rpool/ROOT/ubuntu/boot.\nNow I did grub-install --boot-directory=/boot, deleted the boot folders in /rpool/ROOT/ubuntu and /rpool/ROOT/ubuntu/@ and it boots just fine.\nLet me try to explain:\n/rpool and /rpool/ROOT are my zpools. They are mounted there so I can access the datasets I may create in those pools, I think. The folder /rpool/ROOT/ubuntu is unnecessary, it was just copied there while copying the filesystem from the termporary ext4-fs to the ZFS pool. I deleted it now.\nGrub finds the config file in /boot just fine, because it knows ZFS. It even finds my snapshots. Thats what the paths with @ are for:\nIn grub shell I can use (hd0,msdos3)/ROOT/ubuntu or (hd0,msdos3)/ROOT/ubuntu@ for the actual current filesystem, or if I have a snapshot called \"version-1\" I can tell grub to use (hd0,msdos3)/ROOT/ubuntu@version-1. Should be the same on the kernel command line to boot with a snapshot as root filesystem like linux /ROOT/ubuntu/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-45-generic root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/ubuntu@version-1 but I haven't tried that yet.

GVim is in the Ubuntu repos.).  \n\n*To delete all of the above -- the easy to delete anything is to click it once and send it to the Trash by pressing the Delete key. Sorry, no Gedit. Alright, if you must do it that way, open Gedit and from the Gedit menu select Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins tab -> put a check mark to the left of External Tools. Restart Gedit, and now you can run commands in Gedit by selecting Tools -> External Tools -> Run command. What's the point though? You can only run commands the same way as you would run them in the terminal, so you lose the advantage of using a GUI program.\n\n\nA: There is a trick.\nUnder Windows, if your files are in list or detail view, the right click always gives you the option New File, New folder.\nUnder Ubuntu, if the directory is in List view, every place you click a file or folder is selected and Ubuntu only shows the options for manipulation for the highlighted file.\nYou have to click the small icon view, then all objects are clustered and there is free space. You have to click the free space with no single file or folder highlighted. It's trivial, but not for a (linux) novice like me or (probably) Amr Saad.

I've been using Ubuntu for long time. However, I'm still confused about one issue.\nWhy one would use default Ubuntu kernel(3.16 atm) instead of latest stable kernel(3.18 atm)? Is this only because of stability?\nI know that there could be issues with newest beta NVIDIA drivers when you use latest rc kernels, but when kernel goes stable it should be safe to use. Why Ubuntu ships its own kernel instead of latest stable build? I've searched about this, but I was unable to find valuable information.\n\nA: So the question you need to ask is 'Who decided \"latest stable kernel\" is 3.18?'. Wat that decided by The Kernel People or by Canonical? (the answer: the Kernel People).\n\nWhy Ubuntu ships its own kernel instead of latest stable build?\n\nThe Ubuntu kernel configuration files need to be added, tested and tweaked to the new kernel. That will cost time and resources (the idea is that it is better spent on the next Ubuntu release). So the latest stable release according to the Ubuntu Kernel Team is currently 3.16. \nKernel/dev/extended stable and mainlinebuilds should be an interesting read.\nBesides that: \nWe will get a kernel update every 6 months that is tested and stable so it is not a long wait (less if you assume the kernel release is not out on the day a new Ubuntu appears). \nHow many end-users do you believe are waiting for kernel 3.18? Unless you are a developer (and you will know how to upgrade the kernel; and you will know where to find an upgrade method) there should be hardly any need to upgrade your kernel. Yes, there are some interesting features in any new release but those are not to interesting for the mainstream users of Ubuntu. \nAnd we will get those features in 3 months anyways.  \n", "Q: rEFIt - rEFInd - Grub2.....what is the “right way” for Ubuntu 14.10 on a Mac: Can someone please help me to understand the “right way” (if there is such a thing) to run Ubuntu on an EFI computer (specifically a 2012 iMac -- I have Ubuntu 14.10 installed on this iMac, on partition /sda5).  \nI initially installed rEFIt.  It didn't work perfectly, so I later tried to replace it with rEFInd (though I think my removal of rEFIt was incomplete).  And of course I had Grub installed on the Ubuntu partition.  \nI don't remember the sequence of these installs.  I think I installed rEFIt on the Mac side, then installed Ubuntu (with Grub) on the /sda5 partition. . . then later “upgraded” to rEFInd by installing it on the Ubuntu side (but it might have been on the Mac side).  \nWhen I booted the Mac, for a long while, it would boot into Grub2 – where I would select my Ubuntu install.  Then, not sure what happened, but it started booting into rEFInd.  In rEFInd, I would select the Ubuntu icon and it would then boot into Grub2.  Essentially, I had two different boot managers that I had to use in sequence.  \nAnyway, I had this working for a long time until after a major crash.  After the crash, every time I booted into rEFInd and selected ANY OS (including LiveUSBs), it would initially load but then the screen would eventually go blank and just stop there.  Nothing appeared to happen.  So I then removed reFIND and installed reFIt.  Now the Mac boots into rEFIt, and I when I select the Ubuntu icon, it goes to Grub2.  But the Grub screen is not entirely clear, just a little pixelated.  \nThis caused me to wonder:  should I have to use two boot managers?  \nIs it possible/preferable to either: \n1. boot directly into Grub2, with no intermediary; or\n 2. boot into rEFIt (or rEFInd) and not have to then go to Grub?\nThanks for any erudition on this matter.  I just don't get it.\n\nA: Both your #1 and #2 options are possible; however, if you don't understand the Mac's native EFI-mode booting and how the Mac implements BIOS/legacy booting, you're likely to make a hash of things in setting it up. My suspicion is that you installed Ubuntu in BIOS/legacy mode with a BIOS-mode version of GRUB, which means that GRUB will be unable to launch OS X (or maybe it'll manage, but that path is very flaky in my experience). If I'm right, you'll want to install either an EFI version of GRUB or rEFInd to do as you want. Installing from OS X is preferable, although the Mactel tools to which LiveWireBT can theoretically make this more reliable in Linux. (I have limited experience with these tools myself, though, so I can't comment on them in detail.) My pages on hybrid MBRs and EFI boot loaders for Linux will help bring you up to speed, but be prepared to spend some time on the reading. Sorry, but I know of no good shortcut for this. A brains-off step-by-step guide might work, but is more likely to lead you astray because of assumptions the author makes that don't apply to your system.\nThe rEFInd documentation is pretty extensive. Be aware there have been significant changes in rEFInd's Mac support recently. In particular, version 0.8.4 and later now install to the EFI System Partition (ESP) by default, which is necessary to work with the way Yosemite is set up by default. This change has caused some confusion among users, though.\nFull disclosure: I maintain rEFInd, so I'm not unbiased.\n\nA: Booting the GRUB EFI binary directly should work. For newer Macs there shouldn't be any difference between a normal UEFI install on Windows or on a Mac. For older Macs you need to bless the GRUB EFI binary, the Mactel tools PPA provides tools to make the setup easier.\nYou can even boot an external Ubuntu installation, as I described in Is it still possible to install Ubuntu to an external harddrive with UEFI?, but for booting from an internal drive on a Mac you should omit the --removable option from the grub-install command. Also you don't need to create another HFS+ partition when following these instructions in your case, use the partition where the Mac EFI loaders are.\n", "Q: Lost disk space after switching to Ubuntu from Windows I am new to Ubuntu and was really excited to try it.

OR\nHow can I make the fan speed auto-adjust once the system is started?\n\nA: The short answer: maybe, depending on your BIOS and use-case\nThe long answer: The NVidia card doesn't expose its temperature sensor through hardware to the BIOS, therefore the BIOS is taking the safest bet and assumes it's working at 100% and thus cools at 100%.\nIt's only the driver that exposes the hardware sensor through software to the machine and therefore the fan comes back to a normal level...\nThe only way to get the noise down depends on your use case and your BIOS.  On my machine, I just disable the NVidia in the BIOS until I need it (to drive the HDMI port and to play games) so as the BIOS then knows that the card is not doing anything, the fan doesn't run at all and the noise is non-existent...

Might work for you, since you say that gnome-settings-daemon is already in your autostart.\n\nA: Since 13.10, the session manager (gnome-session by default) runs managed by yet another process manager: Upstart.\nWith these kind of mixups, the graphical session startup process only gets more convoluted each release.  If you want to peek a bit, take a look in /usr/share/upstart/sessions.\nIn short, you have two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a look at which session you are selecting, then go to /usr/share/xsessions/YOUR_SESSION.desktop and search for the text X-LightDM-DesktopName.  If its value is different than GNOME, choose another session type.\n\n*Create a file named ~/.xsessisonrc and add the following line.\nexport XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME\n", "Q: question on getting the following information for Ubuntu running on Vmware player I am trying to follow the answer posted in Configuring Ubuntu vmware guest NAT  to solve the similar issue.\nAt first, I would like to know how to get the following information as the Kingsly wrote in his answer\n\n\nA: First of all, don't take screen shots but \"edit\" the question and copy-paste the text into your question if referring to another question.

I'm running Lubuntu 13.04 using lightdm as my login environment.\nIf I'm logged in to the graphical session and start my process, everything is groovy. But if I start the process remotely (ssh session), it tries to draw a window through ssh, and fails. I need it to draw the window locally (on the physically attached terminal). How can do I this?\n\nA: X-server where xclients are connected are defined by DISPLAY variable. For first local Xserver it's usually :0.0.\nSo - if you're logged remotly for machine with local Xserver, and you're want to run something locally - set:\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0\nand then run your Xclient application - it'll connect to /tmp/.X11-unix/X0, and run localy.\nBut - if you wish to skip ssh forwarding and run xwindow application remotly without ssh - you can do it too - you must open Xserver to accept remote connections, add xclient using xhost, and then define variable DISPLAY to ip:xserwer\n", "Q: How can i find the current password in ubuntu without booting up into recovery mode? My current ubuntu Administrator account has Automatic login ON.I was wondering if there was a way to recover the current password with my account logged in without recovering it from GRUB.\n\nA: Reading the comments under your question, it seems as you have lost total access to your root account. So you can neither run sudo passwd from a normal session, nor can you access the recovery shell, which requires the root password. So you have the following options left:\nEither reinstall your system...\nor reset the password from a live USB/DVD system. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you already have an Ubuntu DVD or USB stick, skip to step 4.\n\n*If you don't have an Ubuntu- or other Linux-ISO file, download one, e.g. the current Ubuntu release.\n\n*Burn it to a DVD (e.g. with Brasero) or extract it to an USB stick (e.g. with Startup Disk Creator or any similar program which doesn't ask for root permission)\n\n*Boot the DVD or USB and select \"Try Ubuntu without installing\"\n\n*From within the live system, open a terminal and find out, which is your system partition: sudo parted -l. This will list all your partitions, of all connected drives. Your USB stick partition will be mounted as /, so it'll be another drive. Search for an EXT4 partition, which (when using Legacy BIOS) has the boot flag and fits the size of your system.\n\n*Mount this partition r/w: sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt -o rw\n\n*Open a root shell in the mounted system: sudo chroot /mnt\n\n*Reset the root password: sudo passwd, enter new password twice.\n\n*exit\n\n*Unmount the system partition: sudo umount /mnt\n\n*Reboot into your system.\n\n\nA: booting into livecd to change password is not necessary. It's enought to:\n\n\n*\n\n*when system is booting, in grub menu - enter via \"e\" key to edit command line.\n\n*add there something like init=/bin/bash\n\n*when you have prompt - change password using passwd command. sometimes it's necessary to remount root partition into rw (mount -o remount,rw)\n\n*after change - do \"sync\" command to write change into disk, and then reboot system.\n\n\nSometimes it's worth to do backup of /etc/shadow file (cp /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.backup) - for example when you really need to recover old password, because your home directory is encrypted with it... - then after loggin you can try to find your password using john tool from old shadow file.\n", "Q: Nvidia-drivers problem in Ubuntu 14.04.1 64bits Today I've upgraded the system and the problem is that it appears and 640*480 screen with the login and the background, after logging in, the screen got stuck.\nI have an NVIDIA card, GT610 to be precise, and I have CUDA installed, this is necessary because I'm learning to develop on this.

See example: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Checking_if_networking_is_up_inside_a_cron_job_or_script\nMaking NM do something in between status changes I'd imagine involves changing the NM code itself.\nCan you provide more details on what you are trying to accomplish?\n", "Q: WIreless and wired networking no longer working after update today (Jan 31) of Ubuntu 14.04 I just did an update of my Ubuntu install on my laptop and after rebooting, the wireless didn't work anymore, it doesn't even show up in iwconfig, however it does show up in lspci (Broadcom BCM43228).

I just yet starting to learn about web serving. So, far I know domain name is used for web page addresses (URL), like if we have an URL like this:\nhttp://www.theaddress.thedomain.com/path/to/file.html\n\n\n\n*\n\n*http:// is for protocol that is being used.\n\n*www is for hostname.\n\n*theaddress.thedomain.com is for domain name.\n\n*and so on.\n\n\nBut I confused when those terms are used in linux system. Like, when I try to install Apache2 on VirtualMachine and use it as server, i still can't use the hostname instead of typing my VM IP address to the web browser.\nWhat are they doing in the system? Are those things matter when we don't use the linux as a web server? And is it possible to address the VirtualMachine with it's hostname and domain name? Or, those two only will be used when the server is going online?\n\nA: You would normally have to run a DNS server to get a domain name, which normally is not done for a personal VM. You can use the IP address of the VM to connect to it from inside your LAN, or localhost to connect to itself from within you VM. If you really want to, you can edit your hosts file on your box (not in the VM, but in the OS that is running the VM) to contain a custom hostname for your VM, basically, it'll map the hostname to the IP of the VM.\n\nA: Without making things too complicated, your initial assumptions are correct.\nYou can give Machine-A a domain name but other machines on the network still need \"someone\" to translate that name into an IP if you try to ping it, most of the times that \"someone\" is the DNS server.\nServices exist to make this discovery automatic, i.e. let your machine broadcast it's hostname through a specific protocol but let's leave that aside for now.\nIn the case of a VM, another thing to remember is that VirtualBox for example will automatically put your VM in a LAN network, so by default your host machine is in a different network than your VM.\nIf you are playing with Apache inside a VM I suggest setting the network type of the VM to \"bridged\", that will allow it to behave like another machine on your same home network.\nRegarding how to reach the VM from the host or any other machine in the same network (provided you've already set the bridged networking), you can register it in your home router, most of them will offer an option on their admin console to register hostnames.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Recovery from user@1000service error My system crashed.

Rooting is when you wipe your handset clean of its existing operating system\n  and install a new version. The problem with rooting is that handset\n  manufacturers install and customize the OS to work specifically with\n  their device so clearing it may make some features and functionality\n  not work correctly.  Furthermore, all handsets sold by Rogers are\n  verified to work on our network before giving them to customers. In\n  turn, it’s impossible for us to troubleshoot or provide technical\n  assistance on a device that is no longer in line with that\n  verification. That, in a nutshell, is why rooting voids the warranty\n  of Rogers-purchased devices.\n  \n\nIn which it states changing the os voids the warrant. \nI suggest if you want to keep your warranty to not do this, as there is no legal way of changing the os and not loosing your warranty!\nThanks, hope this helps.\nTo read more about the warranty issue read here.\n\nA: Maybe a Dualboot configuration works for you.

Does this help?\nI mean probably Facebook uses cookies to spy on my web traffic, and I assume that a cookie created in one browser has no way to monitor what I am doing in another browser... \n\nA: Facebook mainly uses the Facebook Like buttons installed on the web pages you visit to track where you went and are. This button injects an iframe that stores cookies on your computer, and cross references all the web pages you visit.\nTo prevent this, I'd recommend the Adblock Extension, which, alongside blocking advertising on the pages you visit, has an option to block social network like buttons.\nAdblock: https://getadblock.com\nIf you are really really nervous (read: paranoid, in a good way), use the  Tor browser. https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\n\nA: Update 2017\nWhile my old answer below is still my recommendation (I updated it), Firefox has a new Testpilot Feature that does exactly what you want: It allows you to use internally a different browser for different webpages if you want to. You can also automate this process and therefore make less mistakes. This feature will probably included by default in a future Firefox release this year (2017). So, give it a try, use Firefox, browse to https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/containers and follow the instructions.\n\nold, but not outdated answer\nUsing two different browsers could partially help. But I remember reading about non-Facebook users getting tracked by Facebook on third-party sites. They probably just wait for you to log in. It's better than nothing, but just do a mistake once and they got you ;)\nOnce they have the connection between your second browser and your account, they can always see who you are based on some new HTML5 canvas tracking techniques for example (no cookies needed). I don't know whether they use this, but basically it's possible. Also it's a lot of work and distracts your workflow. I wouldn't do it, but maybe someone can rate this on a more professional level.\nI use (and recommend) a combination of Firefox addons to protect privacy. Note that addons for your browser in general can make browsers slower, e.g. on older computers. Especially if you add too many lists in ad blockers. I recommend one or two good lists.\n\n\n*\n\n*uBlock Origin: A good ad blocker will block most ads and tracking stuff based on lists. I do not recommend AdBlockPlus, because they have a strange business model, and they had some legal arguments at least here in Germany. I didn't find any good English source, but fact is they have a conflict of interests, because they are working with and getting money from companies to whitelist their ads under some criteria (they call it \"Acceptable Ads\"). So better ignore AdBlockPlus, if your concern is about your privacy.\nDownload: uBlock Origin\n\n*Privacy Badger: This is a work-in-process plugin that does not work with lists, but with algorithms. It's developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to protect privacy. Still, it's in development and (probably) not yet perfect, so I use it together with AdBlockEdge. There is no configuration required.\nDownload: Privacy Badger\n\n*HTTPS Everywhere: This enables HTTPS when possible, even if some sites do not support it by default or in a broken way (that is, you are on https, but as soon you click on a hyperlink, it's gone). It is also developed by the EFF. There is no configuration required.\nDownload: HTTPS Everywhere\n\nA few words about Privacy Badger\nPrivacy Badger rates every connection to \"green\", \"yellow\" and \"red\". Red means blocked, green means not blocked. Yellow means that only cookies from this connection are not accepted. I recommend to stay with the rating of privacy badger as long as everything works. You can easily change this though through a slider for every connection.\nScreenshot on heise.de\nThis means that it will do compromises (yellow), trying not to break the sites functionality.\nSolutions for Website Operators\nOf course it is disappointing to see that your favorite sites are not really caring about your privacy. You could ask them to improve, e.g. by using the \"Sharriff\", which generates new sharing buttons without tracking support. They do not use the default sharing buttons, but simply generate a URL to your social network. So you only get tracked when you click on a sharriff button. Basically, it's like manually sharing the link and it looks pretty normal to the user. It's available on GitHub and was initiated by heise.de, a big German technology magazine publisher.\nhttps://github.com/heiseonline\n", "Q: Nautilus search for Artist Albums, Artist name and other Music Metadata Is there a way to make Nautilus Search Engine look for Music Metadata like Artist name, Album, Year, Composers,etc... and make it show the results according these Metadata?\nI am interested mostly for mp3 files. \n\nA: You can add the ability rather easily by downloading a python script: http://pastebin.com/zN69twVP\nDiscovered through the inimitable resource that is the ArchWiki:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GNOME/Files#Music_files_metadata_in_list_view\nEDIT:\nYou can also add the functionality using WebUpd8's PPA:\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/05/add-pdf-audio-and-exif-metadata-to.html\n", "Q: Migrating from Windows XP I'm not sure if this exact question was asked before but here it is.\nI am currently on windows xp and would like to move to a version of Linux/Ubuntu like Ubuntu itself or Lubuntu or whatever is out there. Only thing is it should be easy for my parents to use it, as they are not so techie...! It should be kind of similar to xp and should be so buttery smooth.\nHere are my current system specs:\nPentium 4 2.8 GHz\n20 GB dedicated for OS, whichever it is, rest 20 for personal use (total 40 GB HDD)\nRAM 1.4 GB\nGraphics 32 MB\nWired internet connection\nShould have LTS or whatever it is called - for updates, so that I don't have to update/upgrade for a long time.\nPlease suggest me the best one with reason.\n\nA: For people migrating from Windows XP LXDE or MATE desktop enviromments would be the easiest ones to learn as they use very similar appearance.\nConsequently Lubuntu (LXDE using OS) or Ubuntu MATE (MATE using OS) will be the best choice. \nXubuntu using XFCE is also worth trying.\nThe lightest in terms of hardware requirements is Lubuntu. Go for Lubuntu 14.04 - It is the latest stable version which is going to be supported for 5 years. (Until 2019)\nHere are the minimum supported requirements of Lubuntu 14.04 according to Ubuntu wiki:\n266 MHz processor;\n128 MB;\n3 GB hard drive;\nno fancy graphics\nA more usable system would have:\n512 MHz processor or faster, 32 or 64 bits;\n512 MB of RAM;\n6 GB hard drive;\nno fancy graphics   \nUbuntu MATE 14.04 LTS is also supported until 2019, but not from Canonical. It is not official Ubuntu flavour yet and receives support only from its team.\nUbuntu MATE 14.04 hardware requirements\nXubuntu is another good option for older computers, though it is a bit ''heavier'' than Lubuntu. See here for requirements:  Xubuntu.org\nBear in mind most Linux distros allow you to try the system before installing. When you boot from the installation disc you will have two choices : Try or Install\nYou may choose the Try option to test the OS. You will be able to see if it will be suitable for your hardware and of course your taste. Try and choose. And Best Luck with Ubuntu.  \n", "Q: Where are the headers with IOCTL numbers for ext4? I am looking for ext4.h, or another file that contains EXT4_IOC_*. There is nothing in /usr/include or /usr/src. I have linux-headers-generic installed. I am on Kubuntu 14.10. Where are the headers?\nEdit: Using Ubuntu Package search, there are definitely no packages that contain the correct ext4.h. Mysterious.\n\nA: Some of the EXT4_IOC_ definitions appear to be exposed via /usr/include/ext2fs/ext2_fs.h, which is supplied by the package e2fslibs-dev.\nTo obtain the actual ext4.h header AFAIK you will need to download the kernel source package, rather than just the kernel headers: either by enabling source repositories and then executing something like\napt-get source linux-image-`uname -r`\n\nor by checking it out directly from the git repository. You should then find ext4.h in the fs/ext4 subdirectory:\nfind linux-3.2.0/ -name 'ext4.h'\nlinux-3.2.0/fs/ext4/ext4.h\nlinux-3.2.0/include/trace/events/ext4.h\n\nHowever you probably shouldn't be relying on kernel source headers if you are writing user-space code - if something's not exposed via the regular development package or kernel headers, then you shouldn't be using it outside of the kernel.\n", "Q: OpenStack deployment with MAAS, Juju and Autopilot I have a problema with my cluster installation.

After logging-in into Landscape, it states that the fourth requirement is not fulfilled, because of the lack of a least one machine with two disks and two network interfaces.\nMAAS states that I have six machines but the size of disk is of one disk only. I tried to deploy ubuntu on one of them and the second hard disk is present as 'sdb', even though not formatted. MAAS also stats every node has two network interfaces.\nWhat am I doing wrong? I cannot figure out! Should I try to deploy OpenStack with Juju manually?\n\nA: Landscape queries MAAS to determine which nodes have multiple network devices. Does MAAS show at least one of the nodes as having two or more MAC addresses connected to networks e.g. if you go on the node page, it should say something like 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF (on maas-eth1)'\nIf your nodes are on a secondary network which is not MAAS managed, you will have to manually add that network and associate the MAC addresses with it.

However, the Intel GPU doesn't appear to detect when the secondary display is plugged in (it isn't shown in the Screen Display settings). However, if I change Prime to use the Nvidia GPU, both displays are shown.\nMirroring the displays works fine (except for the occasional graphics freeze which I understand is a known bug with the Nvidia drivers). However, if I uncheck mirroring, I get some strange behaviour. At first glance, it appears to be correct - the TV shows the left desktop and the primary display the right desktop. Firstly, the primary display is actually frozen (I can see the cursor on it despite moving it on the other display). Secondly, when I try to move the cursor from the TV to the primary display, the desktop just slides on the TV - that is, it's like I'm pushing the viewport along with my cursor.\nHere is what I get if I take a screenshot.

I have a desktop running Ubuntu 12.04 and the hard drive is full. I want to transfer the files over to my laptop running Ubuntu 14.04. The hard drive in the laptop is basically empty but way bigger than the desktop so I know that I will have plenty of room to transfer files over to. Would I use an ethernet cable, or a usb cable to connect the two, and then, where do I go from there? Thanks!\n\nA: A direct connection between two computers is perfectly possible with a \"cross cable\" and can be bought at any store that sells network cables.  Some newer network interface cards (NIC) don't even need a cross-cable and can use a normal network cable.  Refer to the technical specifications of your NIC for further info.\nHardware config:\nHave a look at this Ask Ubuntu Q&A how to set up a static IP address and set one computer to use 192.168.1.1/24 and the other to 192.168.1.2/24\nPlug this cable into the Ethernet ports of both computers.\nSoftware:\nThe easiest way to transfer files between computers is nitroshare as it doesn't need any infrastructure and is easy to install and blindingly fast.  It also runs on everything: Ubuntu, Windows, ...\nTo install nitroshare, use the following steps:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/nitroshare-dev\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nitroshare\n\nA small icon now shows up in the menu bar:\n\n(do these steps on both computers)\nOn one computer, click the nitroshare icon and click \"Send Directory\" and send Documents, Pictures, ... over one by one.\nWarning! Do not send the entire /home directory as that will copy your configuration files as well!\n\nA: A direct connection using either ethernet or USB is not possible between two computers. Most likely you would have both computers connected to a router (wireless or wired), which would mean you know the IP address of each, and are able to ping one from the other. I would then suggest installing and running sshd on one and using scp from the other to copy files. It is also possible to connect from the client to the ssh server using nautilus to transfer entire folders of data. An alternative route would be to use Samba to set-up Windows-style networking and shares and use it to transfer files. Set-up steps for both sshd and samba are in the Ubuntu Server guide (presumably also in Desktop guide). Scp is described in brief at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/TransferFiles.\n\nA: Several \"ancient\" tools exist do this from the early\nUsing a CLI, (Command Line Interface) rsync with a network cable (possibly cross-wired, though as mentioned since early in the millenia, not a necessity) is exceptionally powerful and was created in 1996 for this very purpose.

I use Firefox Sync in three devices (my notebook running Ubuntu 14.10 and two other Windows machines), and I use the \"show my windows and tabs from last time\" setting on them all, but since the upgrade from Trusty to Utopic, this setting doesn't work anymore on Ubuntu. It's okay on both other two Windows devices I use, only on Ubuntu I have this problem - everytime I close Firefox, when I open it again, it shows me the default Ubuntu start page. I don't know if it happens because I don't sync the tabs, only the rest of the stuff. And I have already turned off the sync, modified things on about:config following tutorials and nothing works... I've been thinking about downgrading back to trusty, since I maintain OS and archives in a separate partition... What could be going on?\n\nA: I got the same problem since I updated FF to ver 35. I'm using Elementary OS. \nI got it working by making \"refresh firefox\": https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings\nAftert that, tried and it was working.

If I have to view the files inside that partition what is the command i have to use?\n\nA: First of all when you are using Linux, you have to forget the Windows concept.\nIf you mount a partition using nautilus, it gets mounted at /media/$USER/ not in /media. It will get mounted at some other place only if you are  defining the mount-point in mount command or in /etc/fstab file.\nSo if you want to cd to some partition using terminal, use\ncd /media/$USER/<partition_name>\n\nFor example\ncd /media/$USER/games/\n\n", "Q: How can I have a startup service wait till remote drive to become available?

I installed Ubuntu and I think I have jumbled up the partitions. I wanted to create 3 logical Disks of 250Gb where Ubuntu will be installed and two other disks for files and other stuff.\nBut after installation I am able to see the disks as folders in root directory and unable to write anything to those folder, (wrong mount points maybe :( ).\nHere are the mount points I gave during installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*First Disk:  mount point: \\\n\n*Second Disk: mount Point: \\drive1\n\n*Third Disk:  mount point: \\drive2\nWhen I tried to reformat using gnome-disk-utility 3.10.0 I got these errors:\n\n\n\nA: First, in Linux the forward slash (/) is used as a directory separator, not the backslash (\\). This might be contributing to your problems, but you've probably just transcribed it wrong in your question. I mention it simply to cover the most fundamental thing first. Also, in the Linux world partitions are not referred to as \"drives\" or \"disks\"; they're \"partitions\" or \"filesystems,\" depending on context. The words \"drive\" and \"disk\" usually refer to your hardware, so you can't \"create... disks.\"\nSecond, the sort of error message you're reporting is often caused by rounding issues in the partitioning software. That is, the software might say that Partition A ends at \"250MiB,\" when in fact it ends at 250.25MiB. When you tell it to begin the next partition at 250MiB, it displays an error like what you've shown because 250.00MiB is less than 250.25MiB, and of course it can't comply. There are two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave a short gap between the partitions -- tell it to start the partition 1MiB after the end of the preceding one and 1MiB before the beginning of the next one. You may end up with small gaps between your partitions, but at least you'll have partitions.\n\n*Use another partitioning tool -- GNOME Disk Utility has its points, but it's a little less polished and precise than some others. GParted is what I prefer when I want a GUI tool or need to resize partitions; and I use gdisk (for GPT) or fdisk (for MBR) for precise command-line operations. (Disclaimer: I wrote gdisk, so I'm not exactly unbiased.) Both gdisk and fdisk use sectors as units, so you can place your partitions with precision. (The values may round a bit to comply with certain alignment rules, though.)\n\n\nBefore I end, I want to make two more points:\n\n\n*\n\n*I suspect you're approaching your partitioning task with Windows assumptions. Vanishingly few experienced Linux users would create partitions to be mounted as /drive1 and /drive2. The Linux unified directory tree is very well-defined, with directories like /usr, /home, /var, and /tmp. Experienced administrators may split one or more of those directories (or various others) off into their own partitions, but it's unclear to me what you hope to accomplish with /drive1 and /drive2. Linux program files will not be stored there (mostly they go in /usr) and user files normally reside in /home. You can learn more about this by reading up on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) on Wikipedia, among other places.\n\n*Most modern computers (those sold since mid-2011) use (U)EFI, which works best with GPT, rather than the MBR partitioning scheme you seem to be using. To be sure, most EFIs include the ability to boot in the old BIOS mode, which generally uses MBR, but at this point, IMHO it makes most sense to stick to EFI and GPT with new machines. If your computer is older, of course, it may be BIOS-based, and early EFI implementations were often flaky enough that using them in BIOS mode might make sense. See this page for more on identifying your computer's capabilities and the boot mode of your Ubuntu installer.\n\n", "Q: No Syntax Highlighting in Ubuntu SDK I just installed Ubuntu SDK.

Based on your time zone choice during installation, the installer 'guessed' that you prefer the Belgian conventions for time/date, currency, etc., so currently you probably have Deutch (Belgien) selected in the Regional Formats tab. Unfortunately (which is a bug) it means that the weekday and month names are showed in German.\nThe simplest way to change it is to switch to some of the English options in Regional Formats. Often English (Denmark) is a suitable choice in Europe.\nAnother option is to edit your ~/.profile file, and add the line\nexport LC_TIME=en_DK.UTF-8\n\nThat will fix the weekday and month names, without affecting things like currency and number formats.\n", "Q: How do I use integrated Graphics dor display and nvidia card for rendering I have a dell m3800 laptop with integrated Intel HD4000 and a Nvidia Quadro K1100M Graphics card.\nThe problem is that the Nvidia drives the display and does the rendering.\nWhen I am rendering in blender using the Nvidia GPU my display gets very laggy.\nAnother problem with the Nvidia card driving the display is that the display freezes sometimes even when I am not rendering and i have to switch to another tty and back.\nI would like to have the Intel card drive the display and use the Nvidia for everything else.\nI have looked at numerous other threads and have not found a clear solution or answer to how to do this or if it can be done.\n\nA: What you want to do is called CUDA and blender supports that.\nHowever from the Blender CUDA FAQ:\nWhy is Blender unresponsive during rendering?\n\nWhile a graphics card is rendering, it can not redraw the user\ninterface, which makes Blender unresponsive.

Two similar projects, but different redirect I've installed xampp, and started configuring my current working project, and as a result I was unable to do this due to magic circumstances. First of all I guessed that this is something wrong with xampp, but I decided to create simple virtual host to check how it works, and this virtual hosts works perfectly, but not my working project :(. So, I'll tell what I've done, and I would be very happy if someone will help me:\nXAMPP is located in /opt/lampp \nWorking and custom project in /home/awesomeUser/dirForWork/projForWor\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed # from apache's httpd.conf to include virtual hosts\n\n*Created new virtual host in httpd-vhosts.conf and it looks like:\n\n\n\n    <VirtualHost *>\n        DocumentRoot \"/home/awesomeUser/dirForWork/projForWor\"\n        ServerName test.localistic\n        <Directory \"/home/awesomeUser/dirForWork/projForWor\">\n          Require all granted\n        </Directory>\n    </VirtualHost>\n\n\nAt /home/awesomeUser/dirForWork/projForWor I have index.php with echo phpinfo();\n\n\n*Added to /etc/host  127.0.0.1 test.localistic\n\n*Restarted xampp, and that's all, PROFIT!\n\n\nBut I've done the same actions for my working project and I just have the redirection to xampp's splash page. How it can be even possible? That splash project is on /opt and my request goes to /home... Share your thoughts about this\n\nA: Been a while since I setup a vhost in Apache, but I think it should be more along the lines of\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nDocumentRoot /home/awesomeUser/dirForWork/projForWor\nServerName test.localistic\n <Directory /home/awesomeUser/dirForWork/projForWor> \n Require all granted\n </Directory>\n </VirtualHost>\n\nEdit\nI don't think you need the \"\" in DocumentRoot and Directory \nAlso, did you remember to add index.php before index.html in \n sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf\n\nYou could also add the vhost settings in my answer into /etc/apache2/sites-available and then symlink it to sites enabled, reload Apache and should work. \nSo as example, add my answer to a file (call whatever), but for sake of example we will call it work.conf\nThen \n sudo a2ensite work.conf\n\nAnd then \n sudo service apache2 reload\n\nFinal Edit\nI don't use xampp, I just have a regular LAMP install.  I added my above answer (but tweaked to match my home directory) to /etc/apache2/sites-available/geoffmcc.conf\nAnd then did \n sudo a2ensite geoffmcc.conf\n\n sudo service apache2 reload\n\nTweaked my domain name to accept and as you can see vhost works \nvhost\nAs opposed to the default site \ndefault\n", "Q: Nautilus-Columns I have installed nautilus-columns as I wished to view and sort files by the date they were created rather than last modified, but I find that whilst it works for mp3 files it doesn't seem to for ogg.

If you think about nov, 1st. think that I can \nln a.txt b.txt \nrm a.txt \n\nand have the same final effect: b.txt contains exactly the data of a.txt, but the metadata linking to the content is created on nov, 1st...  \nIt will heavily depend on  the filesystem where you have your files stored. Unix-type file system (like all the default linux file system --- ext4, etc.) have no metadata for the first creation date. If you see the manual page for fstat(2), you can see that the data for files is: \n\n          time_t    st_atime;   /* time of last access */\n          time_t    st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */\n          time_t    st_ctime;   /* time of last status change */\n\n\nThere is an old ongoing confusion on that ctime means creation time (as it is on some MS-DOS derived file system) but in unix there is no such a thing as the first time of creation of a file. \nSo no, in normal unix filesystem you do not have the creation time. You just have the last metadata modification time. \n\nA: As a sort of post script, I have realised that 'Image Viewer' (bundled with Ubuntu 14.04) is a very good place to view EXIF data.\nIn Image Viewer just select 'View>Side Pane' or 'Ctrl F9'. Even more info is available by selecting 'Details' at the bottom of the sidebar.\nThis helped me with the initial problem of wanting to view the date a photo was taken, if not the issues experienced trying to run nautilus-columns.\nThought I'd post this as I was unaware that Image Viewer had that capability, I hope it may help someone else!\n", "Q: Commercial Edition and Free Edition We want to use Ubuntu 14.X Server edition in our Dell PowerEdge R470 Servers for one business critical application, I already downloaded the Operating system from official Ubuntu site. My doubt is do you have any commercial edition which suits for servers platform instead of free/open  downloadable OS, What is the major difference in terms of security features in free downloaded OS. Do you have any other version which having more security and feature set. Please suggest.\n\nA: \nWhat is the major difference in terms of security features in -open source- free downloaded OS.\n\nThe difference between open source and closed source is that with the 1st many eyes can look at the source code whereas with closed source your need to trust the company that owns the code. If some government decides it needs a backdoor in an operating system adding it to an open source system will be spotted. In a closed source version it will not.\nIn general, a closed source operating system tends to be non-free. But open/closed source is not exactly the same as free/non-free.\n\nMy doubt is do you have any commercial edition which suits for servers platform instead of free/open downloadable OS.\nDo you have any other version which having more security and feature set. Please suggest.\n\nNo, why would we need to? It is super-secure out-of-the-box and with a few simple commands it can be hardened even further.  It is not invulnerable, but much more robust as most commercial OSes. Ubuntu does have a (payable) support service called landscape for businesses.\n\nPlease suggest.\n\nFeel free to use the Ubuntu operating system (stick with an LTS though due to the long support cycle) or any other Linux system for that matter. It is safe, secure and you can tinker with it as much as you want. We use Ubuntu for all our server needs: professionally, my company has Ubuntu servers where we code on, we have Ubuntu in a datacenter hosting our software and we use it in google and in amazon instances to host our software. All with apache, mysql, jasperserver (that is a document server system) with replication between all of them.\nCanonical (the company behind Ubuntu) does not put any restrictions on anyone using it besides their copyright on the word *buntu and the *buntu logo. But that is only if you want to distribute your own version of the operating system. Not when using it.\n\nSecurity is something that needs permanent evaluation. If anything security is about social engineering.\nChanging passwords every so often; making sure passwords are not easy to guess. If the admin gets fired you FIRST change the admin passwords and then you fire him. Checking log files every so often. Sign yourself up to mailing lists so you are up to date regarding bugs  and security related problems. Security is also making sure the backup is restorable so in case there is a breach you have something to fall back on.\n\nA: Ubuntu is a free, open-source OS with regular security and maintenance upgrades provided. There is no distinction of \"free vs. commercial\" versions of Ubuntu. Suggest that you read the Ubuntu Server Overview. Would also suggest that for a business server deployment that you use the 14.04 LTS release as it has a five year support term.\n", "Q: Installing Airstream issues: how do I enable? Talk to me like I am 5... Very light user of my Ubuntu (Lubuntu) system, my Terminal installation and configuration knowledge is basic at best.. I want to stream music and video to my android using airstream (http://www.airstream.io/download/linux.html).\nAirstream works fine on my Windows systems.\nThe issue I am having: I have got the .deb pack, used package installer to install it. All the files end up in a weird circle of bin/16/user/16/user type of folder, many folders deep and not in var or home directory.\nI have no idea what to do next.

Sometimes I start Ubuntu and it's instantly off, other times it's when I open or close a program. Sometimes I can operate for days at a time, before it stops working.\nI have a rlt8192se.\nI know very little about Ubuntu and Linux in general. I have tried a couple of solutions with no luck. Because of the wireless issue, instead of really switching to Ubuntu, I'm just playing with it and mostly using Windows 7. I would categorize myself as a novice and I need your help to solve this problem.\nThanks\n\nA: There is one and only one driver in Ubuntu that will claim and drive your device. You can't arbitrarily decide to change the driver from rtl8192se to, for example, rtl8192ce. You can compile and replace your rtl8192se with a newer version of rtl8192se. However, newer is not always better.\nFind out what driver you currently use:\nlsmod | grep rtl\n\nFind out more about your device:\nlspci -nn | grep 0280 \n\nIf, for example, the pci.id of your device is 10ec:8174, then you can see the alias here:\nmodinfo rtl8192se\n<snip>\nalias:          pci:v000010ECd00008174sv*sd*bc*sc*i*\n\nOne and only one driver in Ubuntu has that alias and therefor drives your device.\nThere are probably some changes you can make at the router to help. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, I have better luck with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nThere are also some things to adjust on your computer. I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting.

OpenSUSE is on UNetbootin's list of compatible distros. You should reformat the USB flash drive as FAT32 in GParted first if you have ever used the USB flash drive to boot a Linux distro. \nUNetbootin has been dropped from the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories. When I tested the built-in Startup Disk Creator application as a UNetbootin replacement app with a non-*buntu live .iso image it worked  in Ubuntu 18.04.\nAlso see: Trouble installing openSUSE 13.1 via live USB. Since the ViciBox v.6 iso file that you downloaded is 728MB, a 2GB USB flash drive should be large enough to make a bootable USB ViciBox flash drive.\n", "Q: quick-and-dirty file sharing on a LAN I have a rather large file(s), which I'd like to share between two Linux boxes on the same network.  I'm somewhat familiar with scp, but how do I configure it on the host?  That is, how does the host allow the client to connect?  Or, is it that when you login with scp, or ssh, that since you login with username and password, just use a username and password which are on the host machine?\nThat is, just login to the host with an existing user/password?\nI'd be interested in a GUI, along the lines of Windows File Sharing, if that's possible.  \n\nA: The Quick & Dirty way would be to open up a port for an incoming connection on the sending side and then connect the receiver to the sender on that port and then send files over the connection. This will be the fastest method to transmit data within the LAN as there will be no encryption, transmission and other overheads usually associated with the SSH. Although keep in mind that this process will not use any authentication and encryption mechanism. This is helpful when you are transferring file inside the LAN between trusted hosts.\nOn the sending side:\nnc -l <port> < /file/to/be/sent\n\nFor example:\nnc -l 5000 < /home/user/test\n\nOn the receiving side:\nnc <sender_ip> <port> > /where/to/be/saved\n\nFor example:\nnc 192.168.0.5 5000 > /home/myself/new_file\n\n\nA: SCP works using the same credentials as SSH.\nIf you can SSH from host A to host B using this command:\nssh username@hostb\n\nthen the command to SCP a file from host A to host B would be:\nscp /path/to/file username@hostb:/path/to/destination\n\nIf you are interested in a GUI you could try using the default Files (nautilus) -> Go -> Enter Location ... and typing in: \nsftp://root@hostb/path/to/destination\n\nI know its not SCP but its still fairly easy. Alternatively you could take a look at Filezilla.\n\nA: I would consider using NitroShare. NitroShare is a simple file sharing GUI program. It can be installed using\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/nitroshare\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nitroshare\n\nYou can launch it from your Desktop's menu (Dash, in the case of Unity), and the program will open in the system tray. It will need to be opened on both the computer sending the file and the one receiving it.\n\nA: if you want \"easy way\" copy files between hosts - i recommend you use mc (midnight commander). You have there option \"shell link\" - for easy connect to remote host using ssh.\nFor automating use of it - use ssh-keys - on client please do:\n\nssh-keygen -t dsa\n\nand press enter few times, and then copy key to server:\n\nssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_dsa.pub user@server\n\nthen - you can connect using ssh/scp protocols from client to server without using password.\n\nA: One of the easiest (both to setup and use) solutions is NFS. NFS is a client-server model, so one machine has to be a server while the other is a client\nConfiguration settings\n\nfolder-to-share -> Path to the folder you want to share\nserver-ip-address -> IP of the machine hosting the shared folder\nclient-ip-address -> IP address of the machine accessing the shared\nfolder (use network address such as 192.168.1.0 to allow any machine to access)\n\nServer\nsudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server\necho '/<folder-to-share>/ <client-ip-address>/255.255.255.0(rw,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,sync)' | sudo tee --append /etc/exports\n\nClient\nsudo apt-get install nfs-common\necho '<server-ip-address>:<folder-to-share> /media/share        nfs rw,hard,intr 0 0' | sudo tee --append /etc/fstab\nsudo mount /media/share\n\nYou can now browse the share as you would any other folder.\n", "Q: How to set which output sound an application should use This is the scenario I have right now, since it is my first time having some headphones and also a speaker system connected to the PC.\nI have two apps opened: Steam & Music Player (eg: Banshee, Rhythmbox)\nI want the music player to output it's sound to the Speaker system and I want Steam to output it's sound to my headphones. This way, everybody around can hear the music while I take a couple of hours playing L4D2.\nHow can I do this since the only thing I see is the following:\n\nNOTE - First time playing around with Steam, sound system and music player like this. Like I said, never had a headphone, even less a stereo system connected to it.\n\nA: Well found the answer after searching about pulseaudio,alsamixer and a whole bunch of other stuff. This will only work if you are using the speakers and headphones on different audio devices (Like the speakers connected to the Motherboard sound system and the headphones are connected via USB). Basically this is the road I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the PulseAudio Volume Control  \nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\n\n*Open Dash and type \"pulseaudio\" and then open the PulseAudio Volume Control\n\n\n*On the Playback Tab and you should see all the current applications using the sound system (If not then at the bottom of that Tab, there is the option to show all applications). Select the application you wish to change and select which output device to use for that specific application.\n\nWith this setup, the sound from my music player goes out to the speaker system and the sound from Steam goes to my USB headphones. This would actually be a nice option to have directly in the sound system.\nIn my case I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*One USB Headphone (Connection is via USB so it counts as 1 external output sound device)\n\n*Inboard sound system on motherboard (Everything connected to it counts as the same external sound device, so if a headphone is connected to it, this answer will not work since it will be seen as part of the inboard sound system and not a completely separate external output).\n\n*HDMI connection (HDMI connections offer Video, Audio and Networking all in one, so it counts as another output sound device).\n\n\nThis is why this answer would work for me, but not for anybody that connects all devices to the same sound device as mentioned in the comment by Takkat's research.\n", "Q: asus server install issue ok so I built a system with a dual cpu board and 16 gig ddr4 per cpu.  the board is an asus z10pa-D8, the cpus are intel xeon e5 2620 v3 6 cores.

You need to set your disks in plain sata/AHCI mode with uefi boot.\n\n*Make sure your usb stick also boots in uefi, not legacy. If the boot env doesn't see uefi, then it will assume you want a legacy system, which is sometimes broken on newer rigs.\n\n*Make sure you make an uefi partition, when you format. If you don't then the system installs fine, and when you reboot, it will not boot.\n\n", "Q: Why does my web site have to specify the .php extension in the URI Was running a 12.04 ubuntu lamp setup.

I then have to hold down the power button to force the computer to turn off.  However, when I try to start up the computer again, it will get past the crypt_swap message, check the disk for errors and start up perfectly fine.  It seems to work every other time.\nWhen it comes to turning the computer off, Ubuntu itself can't seem to make the computer do so.  When I tell the computer to shut down through Ubuntu, it will transition to the purple Ubuntu splash screen and freeze there after a couple of seconds.  The only way for me to actually turn the computer off is to once again hold down the power button.\nI read on another forum (I can't find the link right now...) that it could be a module called \"hp_accel\" that is causing the startup problem.  I believe this may be it, because I started Ubuntu through Recovery Mode in GRUB, and the last message to appear had something to do with hp_accel reverting to default configuration since it couldn't identify my laptop before the startup process froze up as usual.  Concerning the shutdown issue, I have no idea what could be causing that.\nSo, what can I do to fix these issues, if anything?  Should I provide some sort of log to help diagnose the problem?  If so, what log would I want to get and how do I get it (never dealt with logs and log-fetching before so I have no idea what to do when it comes to that)?\nThanks!\nSIDE NOTE: I know that the latest Linux kernel image I can get through the Ubuntu Software Update program is 3.16.0-29, but with that image, my computer would freeze on startup 100% of the time.  So, I reverted back to the -23 image because I could at least get it to start some of the time.\n\nA: using Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 Alpha 2 solves most of the problems. My computer fails to load when I let it start with no intervention. If I stroke an arrow key and select Ubuntu (even if it's the only OS), the computer loads.\nThe shut down seems to be fixed with this.\necho \"blacklist dw_dmac\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\necho \"blacklist dw_dmac_core\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nBy the way, Ubuntu 15.04 is really stable in my PC, only one reboot in two weeks, even with Alpha 1.

Hey guys I was looking to install Ubuntu on my Acer Chromebook 13 (CB5-311-T1UU) in the way outlined in on the comment made on this thread:\nTrue Ubuntu on Chromebook ARM (samsung)\nIt appears that you can't fully remove ChromeOS from a Chromebook (well, you can but it really struggles) but you can make it dual boot and make it boot into Ubuntu by default. I'll show you the last method.\nFirst make a backup of all you local files because everything stored locally will be deleted by entering developer mode.\nPress and hold the Esc and Refresh keys together, then press the Power button (while still holding the other two keys). This will reboot your Chromebook into Recovery Mode.\nWhen you get the yellow screen with the exclamation mark hit Ctrl+D (This will bring up a prompt asking if you want to turn on Developer Mode.) Press Enter (this will take about 15 to 20 min. You'll get a screen with a red exclamation mark but leave it be until it reboots into ChromeOS).\nTurn it on but do not login. Make sure you have a WiFi or Ethernet connection configured at this point. 3G/4G is not recommended. Press Ctrl+Alt+→ (→ is the forward arrow where the F2 key would be on a PC). Do not use the normal Ctrl+Alt+→ method to get a shell. Use the Ctrl+Alt+→ method while no one is logged in.\nLogin as user chronos, no password is needed.\nAs the chronos user and without having changed directories or run other commands, run:\ncurl -L -O http://goo.gl/s9ryd; sudo bash s9ryd\n(There is a new script with a new link.

Compare chrubuntu.sh and chrubuntu.sh.orig for\n  details.\n=> Reinstall Chrome OS in Developer Mode\nThis sound complicated but is in fact really easy. Simply press\nesc + refresh (f3) + power\n\nthis will reboot. On the boot screen press Ctrl + D, then Ctrl-D again\n  and then ENTER. This will re-install Chrome OS in dev mode.\nWhen Chrome OS is in dev mode there is a long delay on each bootup.\n  Simply press Ctrl-D on the boot screen to skip the delay.\n=> Repartition MMC card\nOpen a Chrome window, press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a terminal window.\n  Enter the following commands:\nshell\ncd ~/Downloads\nwget http://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2014/chrbook13/chrubuntu.sh\nsudo bash chrubuntu.sh\n\nThis will ask you how much space you would like to reserve for Ubuntu.\n  I chose 16 GB. After changing the partition table the script will\n  reboot the device. The boot loader will then recreate the chrome os\n  partition used for user content on the smaller partition, leaving the\n  newly created partition for ubuntu untouched.\n==> Installing Ubuntu\nOnce again, open a Chrome window, press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a\n  terminal window. Enter the following commands:\nshell\ncd ~/Downloads\nwget http://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2014/chrbook13/chrubuntu.sh\nsudo bash chrubuntu.sh\n\nThis time the script auto-detects that the target partition already\n  exists and installs ubuntu.\nNext install the launcher:\nwget http://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2014/chrbook13/ubuntu.sh\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin\nsudo cp ubuntu.sh /usr/local/bin/ubuntu\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ubuntu\n\nNow you can boot into ubuntu by running \"sudo ubuntu\"\n\n", "Q: updating cache problem I am new to ubuntu, and the system showed updates available, it shows some downloading but it does not send  a message confirming the updates were successful or something like that. after that I opened the system settigns and the updating icon. after going through the  tabs I click close amd a message appears that says the information about available software is out of date, I click to reload and it downloads a buch of files then it shows it is loading software list and it stops and goes away without showing anything else.\nI open again the system settings and it does it all over again, never the update completes.\nI can not update anything, not even firefox\nany suggestions please?\n\nA: Try in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nThe command apt-get update is to update list of available upgrades, apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade are to upgrade your system.\nAlso you can do this by 3 steps:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: packages reuse when upgrading Ubuntu 12.04 to Ubuntu 14.04 I have two machines that are both with Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit. Now I've upgraded one into the Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit. And I want to upgrade the other into 14.04. Is it possible to copy directly the downloaded packages into the other machine to less the upgrading process?\nAnother question is, should I recompile the softwares(e.g. boost, mpich2, and so on) that have compiled with 12.04 64bit when the system is upgraded into 14.04? And should I re-install those softwares?  Is there any problems of compatibility?\n\nA: \nIs it possible to copy directly the downloaded packages into the other machine to less the upgrading process?\n\nYou can in theory copy the *.deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives/ from one computer to the other, as that is the cache for downloaded packages.  Then it should be able to install the matching packages on the other PC without re-downloading, as long as they are the same version and same architecture.\nThe only reason this may not be possible is if for some reason this cache has been purged already (eg with the likes of apt-get clean).\n", "Q: Unable to boot from cd or live usb on Toshiba satellite U945-S4140 I am trying to completely switch over to ubuntu from a my toshiba ultrabook. Link to product page: http://www.toshiba.com/us/computers/laptops/satellite/U940/U945-S4110\nI previously had linux mint dual booted with windows 8, and to get that to work my friend had to do something to the computer. I have the iso for ubuntu 14.04 LTE loaded onto a cd, and I have tried starting my computer with my external usb disk drive, but I keep getting the message \"Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected boot device and press a key\" even though I have the UEFI set up to boot from my cd drive. I was able to previously install ubuntu, but right at the end of the install the bootloader failed to install correctly. How should I proceed to be able to join the ubuntu family?\n\nA: In order to install from a USB device you may need to include a USB installer on the media. Doing so will allow your computer to recognize the media as bootable. You may be able to use the same process used to make a bootable pendrive. Try going to www.Ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows. I did this process with a 2 GB pen drive and got a successful install. However, I also had to ensure my computer was set to recognize the drive as an external hard drive and set it to top priority in the boot sequence.\n", "Q: I'm specifying the port when I use scp, but I get an error saying port 22 connection refused. What am I doing wrong? All I want to do is move a file from my laptop to my server.  Both machines have openssh-server installed, and port 2222 is specified in both sshd_config files as well as both ssh_config files.  I'm using the following to attempt to copy the file:\nscp -P 2222 user1@thenameofmylaptop:file.name user2@[serverIPaddress]:/home/user2/filepath/file.name\n\nEven though I have password authentication set to no and rsa keys installed in both directions, it still asks me for a password.  After I give it the password, it gives me the following error:\n\nssh: connect to host [IP address of server] port 22: Conection refused\n\nIs there a separate config file for scp?  What am I missing?\n\nA: You don't need the user@host:/path/to/file.name syntax for the local file that you are trying to copy - in fact, doing so is likely causing scp to try to open a connection on port 2222 from your laptop to itself. Try just\nscp -P 2222 path/to/file.name user2@[serverIPaddress]:/home/user2/filepath/file.name\n\n", "Q: Black screen when in nvidia mode after updating to kernel 3.13.0-45 After I updated to kernel 3.13.0-45, I cannot use nvidia anymore.

Within the Display preferences in ubuntu, the resolution is \"locked\" as \"Built-in Display\" and the resolution is also \"locked\" at 800 X 600. I wanted to know how, if possible, I can change the resolution to take advantage of the most beneficial screen resolution.\n\nA: That might not be a complete solution but may be it could help you since it would give you much better than 800x600. I have an IMac Retina. I run Ubuntu 14.04 inside Vmware Fusion. After enabling full retina display support in Fusion, I can set Ubuntu to support 2560x1600. In full screen mode, it is not as nice as the native retina with OSX but, it's still quiet nice. If I set it up to use about 1/4 of the screen, it really uses the  real \"pixel\" resolution. in full screen, it just makes everything bigger.  It's not perfect but it's quiet nice. From all my googling on the subject, it appears that it is the Linux drivers that are not meant to support such a large resolution/that many pixel. They are working on though.\n", "Q: Macbook style touchpad not working correctly (Dell Inspiron 15 7547) I just installed Ubuntu 14.10 on this new laptop and am having issues with the touchpad. \nThe touchpad is one of those all-in-one style ones where there are no separate left/right buttons. Because of this, if I hold one finger in the area where I am supposed to click, and navigate with another, it just goes no where.

Then add the configuration block from above\n\nSave, exit, and reboot or restart lightdm display manager.\n\nA: Your touchpad (most likely) is working correctly. \nThe solution would be to only have one finger on the touchpad, if you want to move around.\nIf you hold one finger on the touchpad and are moving a second finger around, your touchpad may either recognize a multi-touch gesture or just ignore the second finger due to the first finger staying still. In both cases it will not translate as mouse movement.\n\nI would suggest to enable \"tap to click\", so that you do not actually need to use the physical button(s). (There is actually at least one physical button, but instead of being separate the whole touchpad is the button)\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 12.0.4 VSFTPD connection timeout using external IP I am having a problem connecting to my Ubuntu 12.0.4 server with vsftpd using my external IP.

From man apt-get:\n\nNote that quiet level 2 implies -y; you should never use -qq without a no-action modifier such as -d, --print-uris or -s as APT may decide to do something you did not expect.\n\nThose options all, as suggested, don't actually install anything. What's wrong with using -qq as a quieter alternative to -y ?\n\nA: When you use apt-get  without a no-action modifier, it means you are going to perform some actual operation with packages like install, remove, upgrade etc.\nSingle -q means quiet. It produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators. But when you use -qq which is quiet level 2, it  implies quit with -y (--assume-yes). In this case no output will be produces except error.\nNow why it is considered as dangerous?\nSometime apt-get removes some packages to satisfy the dependency. Using -qq in such condition may remove some package which is important for you or for the system without informing you.\nSo it is not considered as safe because  such operation can make your system unstable.\n", "Q: avconv creates zero byte file while trying to downsample mp4 video I am having a time lapse video created using my phone that I am trying to downsample from 1080p to 640x480.\nAccording to this answer, I am using avconv command\navconv -i input.mp4 -s 640x480 output.mp4\n\nbut it creates a 0 byte file which obviously contains nothing.\nThe output of the command is as follows\na@b:~$avconv  -i ./Videos/CivilStudy.mp4 -s 640x480 ./abc.mp4\navconv version     9.16-6:9.16-0ubuntu0.14.04.1, Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the Libav developers\n  built on Aug 10 2014 18:19:26 with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)\nInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from './Videos/CivilStudy.mp4':\n  Metadata:\n    major_brand     : isom\n    minor_version   : 512\n    compatible_brands: isomiso2mp41\n    creation_time   : 1970-01-01 00:00:00\n    encoder         : Lavf52.64.2\n  Duration: 00:00:43.58, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 10159 kb/s\n    Stream #0.0(und): Video: mpeg4 (Simple Profile), yuv420p, 1920x1080 [PAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 10025 kb/s, 24 fps, 24 tbr, 24 tbn, 24 tbc\n    Metadata:\n      creation_time   : 1970-01-01 00:00:00\n    Stream #0.1(und): Audio: aac, 44100 Hz, mono, fltp, 129 kb/s\n    Metadata:\n      creation_time   : 1970-01-01 00:00:00\n[libx264 @ 0x843bde0] using SAR=4/3\n[libx264 @ 0x843bde0] using cpu capabilities: MMX2 SSE2Fast SSSE3 SSE4.1 Cache64\n[libx264 @ 0x843bde0] profile High, level 3.0\n[libx264 @ 0x843bde0] 264 - core 142 r2389 956c8d8 - H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec -     Copyleft 2003-2014 - http://www.videolan.org/x264.html - options: cabac=1 ref=3 deblock=1:0:0 analyse=0x3:0x113 me=hex subme=7 psy=1 psy_rd=1.00:0.00 mixed_ref=1 me_range=16 chroma_me=1 trellis=1 8x8dct=1 cqm=0 deadzone=21,11 fast_pskip=1 chroma_qp_offset=-2 threads=3 lookahead_threads=1 sliced_threads=0 nr=0 decimate=1 interlaced=0 bluray_compat=0 constrained_intra=0 bframes=3 b_pyramid=2 b_adapt=1 b_bias=0 direct=1 weightb=1 open_gop=0 weightp=2 keyint=250 keyint_min=24 scenecut=40 intra_refresh=0 rc_lookahead=40 rc=crf mbtree=1 crf=23.0 qcomp=0.60 qpmin=0 qpmax=69 qpstep=4 ip_ratio=1.25 aq=1:1.00\nencoder 'aac' is experimental and might produce bad results.\nAdd '-strict experimental' if you want to use it\n\nWhat do I do now?\n\nA: During this conversion both video and audio need to be decoded from the original file and then encoded to the target file. In this case the original file happens to have the audio encoded with 'aac' (Advanced Audio Coding). The decoding of the audio is not a problem, only encoding to 'aac' encoded audio seems to be problematic.\nSee the last two lines of the output above:\nencoder 'aac' is experimental and might produce bad results.\nAdd '-strict experimental' if you want to use it\n\nAs stated in the message the encoder 'aac' is experimental. To use it anyway add '-strict experimental' like this:\navconv -i input.mp4 -s 640x480 -strict experimental output.mp4\n\nThis will use the experimental encoder to produce a video with embedded audio which is encoded with 'aac'. If the parameter is omitted no output is created (only a zero byte file). So, no encoder is used in that case.\nI was able to convert a video like that with no problem. If the codec does not work for you, you can specify an other codec for audio like that (using mp3 as an example):\navconv -i input.mp4 -acodec mp3 -s 640x480 output.mp4\n\nIf is no audible soundtrack in that recording at all - since you are converting a time lapse - you might not want to embed audio at all. To achieve this use the parameter -an:\navconv -i input.mp4 -an -s 640x480 output.mp4\n\n", "Q: Using Remmina between two Ubuntu 14.04 Systems I have a laptop and desktop running 14.04.

Utimately, I would like to be able to run the majority of the OS in ram, but be able to install programs to the usb thumb drive, and save files (like cpp files) to the usb as well.\n\nA: You can split usb to two partition. One for booting ubuntu, second for data.\nSimple mount second partition of usb and you data is available. This data is also available on any other pc or on the same pc when boot from hdd.\nTo speed up your live system try to add swap via file.\nCreate swap file and add them when running live.\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/swap_file bs=1024 count=${size_of_additional_swap}\nmkswap /path/to/swap_file\n\nAfter booting a live sysyem turn on swap with\nswapon /path/to/swap_file\n\nSwap file can be on usb or on same partition like live distro.\nTry, maybe this will be solution for you.\n", "Q: The application Keyboard input Methods has closed unexpectedly I get this message: \"The application Keyboard input Methods has closed unexpectedly\" immediately After I log in.

I am using ubuntu 14.04 64 bit on an Intel i3 4005u system. The 4005U has an integrated GPU. There is also a 2GB Radeon HD 8550M dedicated graphics card installed. \nThe problem is with installing the additional drivers. The laptop overheats using the open source driver (48 degrees Celsius in a air conditioned room).  \nThe listed Graphics -- Intel Haswell mobile -- has me thinking that Ubuntu is not using the dedicated graphics card at all. I wanted to know is there's any other way to install the drivers and avoid overheating.\n\nA: Last year I built an AMD A6-6400K Home Theater PC (HTPC) with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. The A6 has a dual port GPU processor built in.\nIt worked great until an Ubuntu update on Dec 12, 2014. I had been using the X-org X-server wrappers (open source, tested) until recently. But these wrappers don't work anymore.\nNow I am using the latest AMD proprietary device drivers. This was a challenge.\nHere is a screen shot of my current \"Additional Drivers\". What many don't know is that the easiest way to install the AMD fglrx driver suite is to select option 2 or 3 below. But these do not give you the latest drivers from AMD.\n\nI have downloaded the latest AMD drivers from here and carefully followed the instructions here. Four custom .deb files are created in a directory.\nUnfortunately following the instructions failed to properly install the AMD Catalyst Control Center on my system.  This was corrected by doing the following:\ncd <wherever the .deb files are>\ndpkg -P fglrx-amdcccle\ndpkg -i fglrx-amdccle_<whatever_version_is_here>.deb\n\nAfter a successful install, the Synaptic Package Manager should display something like the following after filtering out `fglrx':\n\nNote the 2:14.501 version tag. The current updated Ubuntu LTS default is 2:13.350.\nThe CCC lets you configure and tweak your AMD graphics, The instructions above discuss dual GPU configurations. Read them carefully. And maybe there is some way in the BIOS to disable the Haswell Mobile or select the AMD GPU.\nGood luck. I use the Ubuntu 32 bit OS and the Radeon 8470D driver on the A6-6400K. One of the defaults was an 8% underscan. This made my 50 inch TV display a 46 inch picture. I have no idea why this would be a default.

Packets for the internet will go over that nic, packets for the local will go over that nic assuming all other things are setup correctly.\nI suppose you could have some very specific/unexpected configs that I dindt mention here.\nThis will bring a NIC named eth0 up (usable)\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up\nThis will bring a NIC named wifi0 down (disabled)\nsudo ifconfig wifi0 down\n", "Q: ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack When I run this code:\n~/cdec/training/mira/mira.py -d dev.lc-tok.es-en.sgm -t devtest.lc-tok.es-en.sgm -c cdec.ini -j 2\n\nI receive this error message:\n File \"~/prefix/sw/cdec/training/mira/mira.py\", line 551, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"~/prefix/sw/cdec/training/mira/mira.py\", line 204, in main\n    args.weights, hope_best_fear = optimize(args, script_dir, dev_size)\n  File \"~/prefix/sw/cdec/training/mira/mira.py\", line 327, in optimize\n    (source, refs) = split_devset(args.devset, args.output_dir)\n  File \"~/prefix/sw/cdec/training/mira/mira.py\", line 314, in split_devset\n    s,r = line.strip().split(' ||| ',1)\nValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack\n\nThat's happening in this script\nCan I fix this?\n\nA: Literally speaking, what is happening here is the code expects two values out the back of line.strip().split(' ||| ',1) (so it can assign those to s and r) but it's only getting one.

Are there any hidden benefits?\nPS. As a new user I just met aria2c last night and had the question about two different competitors; I'm not related to aria2c in any way. Please don't be prejudiced.\n\nA: Aria2 probably is objectively better, but there are a few reasons wget has (and will likely retain) the crown as default downloading application in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*wget is tested and omnipresent. It's actually older than some of the moderators. \n\n*Because it's almost 20, everything and its brother depends directly upon wget. It's not as easy as just replacing one with the other. You would need a legacy script to interface between apps wanting wget and that request being sent through Aria2.\n\n*wget is also smaller, approximately 20% of the size of Aria2. This matters for default applications because of the CD size.\n\n*While Aria2 may do everything, wget is plenty for most jobs.\n\n*There's also the question of multithreaded downloads being antisocial. They can hammer a server for new connections which isn't always desirable. Modern internet connections cope fine with single-threaded downloads.\n\n\nIf you're just doing stuff for yourself, feel free to use whatever you like. Aria2 seems capable enough and it's probably even objectively better... But it has a lot of history to overcome before it replaces anything.\nIf you want to pursue this and get Ubuntu to replace wget with Aria2 as the default for Ubuntu, you'd have to talk to the Ubuntu developers on the ubuntu-devel mailing list. Expect resistance. You'll have to make arguments overcoming the above and you may have to do some of the work up front (eg providing a legacy handoff script as a wget binary replacement). It's possible, I'm sure it is but I won't lie and say it'll be easy.\nThe reason everybody uses wget is slightly cyclical. It's everywhere and everybody knows it. Until Aria2 (which I can barely type twice without spelling it incorrectly) is as omnipresent as wget, experienced users are going to keep using what they know if it's good enough. There's a lot of muscle memory to overcome.\n", "Q: Run Windows Java program in Ubuntu 12.04 without Wine If a Windows program (*.msi) was written in Java, is there a way for me to extract the contents and install it taking advantage of Java's cross-platform capabilities?

I hope that you don’t have to read any of\n  the other “solutions” on this page. I hope you haven’t wasted your\n  time doing other work-arounds. I hope you are in an environment where\n  you are able to use this solution:\nrpc.mountd --manage-gids\n\nrpc.mountd is the program that actually serves nfs. The –manage-gids\n  option allows the server to just plain ignore the incoming bogus 16\n  groups from the client, and allow the nfs server to look it up for\n  itself. Straight from the man page:\n   -g  or  --manage-gids\n          Accept requests from the kernel to  map  user  id  numbers  into\n          lists  of  group  id  numbers for use in access control.  An NFS\n          request will normally (except when using Kerberos or other cryp-\n          tographic  authentication)  contains  a  user-id  and  a list of\n          group-ids.  Due to a limitation in the NFS protocol, at most  16\n          groups ids can be listed.  If you use the -g flag, then the list\n          of group ids received from the client will be replaced by a list\n          of  group ids determined by an appropriate lookup on the server.\n\nYou must have a modern (past 2007) version ( >1.0.12 ) of the linux\n  nfs server for this option and a recent kernel (>2.6.21) to go with\n  it. Most modern distros can do it, but if you are using Solaris or\n  some sort of embedded NFS appliance, you are probably out of luck.\nOn a modern Ubuntu server it has this option on by default. Check with\n  the documentation on your distro on how to turn it on properly. Then\n  party.

Then as your normal user, you are trying to take that output and write to /sys/\nSudo isn't a magic command that elevates privileges for your whole command line.

The directory is very large, and it would be useful if I can pause and resume the download as needed.\nThe target FTP directory is static. That is, it's contents won't change in time. And no authentication is needed.\nWhat's the best tool to do this job?\n\nA: wget should work:\nwget -r -l 0 ftp://username:password@some.host/some_dir/*\n\nwget is tool for downloading files. \n\n\n*\n\n*-r means recursive.\n\n*-l 0 for  infinite recursion, because -r by default have recursion depth of 5.\n\n*some_dir/ is relative to user home dir.

You can download files in pararell, stop, resume, limit speed etc.\nAlternativly - you can use wget\n\nwget -m -c ftp://serwer/directory\n\nIf you wish to stop - simply stop wget. For resume - do it again - it will not download files which was already downloaded.\nIf you wish to download/reject specific files you can use -A or -R option (or - if you wish to specify it via regexp - --accept-regex/--reject-regex)\n\nA: AFAIK ftp doesn't support downloading the directory directly. \nYou can use FileZilla for this purpose. It stores all your transfer in queue. You can resume the transfer later once it is paused or  when you reconnect to server.\n\nA: I tried those commands but wget interpreted user:pass has being the server and port so i ran this command and it worked, hope it help :\nwget -m -c 'ftp://servidor/directory/' --ftp-user=<your ftp username> --ftp-password=<your ftp password>\n\n", "Q: How to format an external 64GB SD card (exfat) using command line?

I've bought the ROG G551JM Asus laptop which proven to be Ubuntu-compatible. The computer's keyboard is ill-designed with the key \"Poweroff\" being an ordinary key, placed in the spot, where one usually finds the \"End\" key. The computer is fine otherwise, so I bought it with the assumption, that I would be able to somehow \"fix\" the problem, i.e. remap the PowerOff button into the \"End\" key.\nThe PowerOff button made wrong (ASUS G551JM):\n\nNormally there is an «End» key (ASUS N56VZ):\n\nThe \"PowerOff\" button events are produced by the /dev/input/event2:    Power Button device (as reported by evtest) with code 116 (example line from evtest: Event: time 1422895638.246142, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 116 (KEY_POWER), value 1)\nThe key is also visible to X server, and ultimately Ubuntu can identify key presses as a PowerOff key and launches the \"Goodbye user Adam...\" semi-transparent dialog box that confirms my will to actually turn the computer off.\nThe problem is that the binding that binds the PowerOff key press with the routine that displays that confirmation dialog is not visible under dconf-editor and I have no hint where to find it.\nCan anyone tell me, where to change (or delete) the default binding for the PowerOff key???\nIt should be something easy.\n\nedit 21.IX.2016:\nThere is a way to permanently disable the dialog box, see How do I modify the options for the power button? . I hope that after disabling the power button, it would be possible to re-assign it to something else.\n\nA: This should do the trick.\nEnter in terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power \"nothing\"\n\n\nA: I was able to get it working on my ASUS N751JK in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (tested with Unity desktop environment in both cases and KDE Plasma in 18.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, set action of \"Power Off\" button to nothing.\nUnity\nLike mentioned in answer of Johano Fierra:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power \"nothing\"\n\nor alternatively sudo apt install dconf-tools and use dconf-editor to change org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power property (like described here). Reboot or logout is required to make it working.\nKDE\nGo to \"System Settings\", select \"Power Management\" tab in \"Hardware\" section and then select \"Energy Saving\" tab, scroll down, find \"When power button pressed\" dropdown list and change its value to \"Do nothing\". Click \"Apply\" button for changes to take an effect.\n\n\n*Install xdotool:\nsudo apt install xdotool\n\nThis one will allow us to trigger key events.\n\n*Next step is to trigger \"End\" key press on \"Power off\" button press.\nUbuntu 18.04\nCreate /etc/acpi/events/power file with the following contents:\nevent=button/power\naction=/etc/acpi/power.sh \"%e\"\n\nand create /etc/acpi/power.sh script with the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\nxdotool key End\n\nand add execution permissions to it:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/acpi/power.sh\n\nUbuntu 16.04\nBackup ACPI script used to handle \"Power Off\" button's event:\nsudo cp /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh.backup\n\nThen edit it, find the following:\n# If logind is running, it already handles power button presses; desktop\n# environments put inhibitors to logind if they want to handle the key\n# themselves.\n\nand modify the code below so it looks like:\nif pidof systemd-logind >/dev/null; then\n    xdotool key End\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n\n*In order to apply these changes one should run:\nsudo acpid restart\n\nThanks to Adam it's possible to restart acpid automatically when a user logs in (on system boot). So instead of manual sudo acpid restart in terminal each time after reboot add the following line:\nsession optional    pam_exec.so /usr/sbin/acpid restart\n\nto the end of /etc/pam.d/common-session file.\n", "Q: Lowest brightness setting turns backlights off I am running Ubuntu 14.10 on a Laptop.\nWhen I turn my brightness to the lowest setting it actually turns my backlights off and my entire screen goes black as if my computer was turned off. I have been finding this rather annoying because if I am holding down the keyboard shortcut to turn the brightness down and I don't stop just before I get to the lowest setting my entire screen just goes! Of course if I turn the brightness back up again then the screen comes back on.\nBut I was wondering if this is some sort of bug or whether it is actually meant to turn the backlights off on the lowest brightness setting? And if there is a way that I can prevent it from turning the backlights of fully when I go to the lowest brightness setting, even if it is by getting it not to allow the lowest brightness setting?\n\nInformation Update:\nI tried adding acpi_backlight=vendor option in my kernel boot parameter but that didn't work. Instead what it did after a restart was break my brightness control so that brightness was stuck at 100% all of the time and when trying to adjust it the little bar which tells me how much it is was stuck on a really low and inaccurate amount.\n\nA: I think this is a normal feature, I have it too in Ubuntu 15.04. I actually quite like it: when I need to run something overnight on my laptop, it basically allows me to switch off the screen. Windows doesn't let me do this, I had to keep a large book over my laptop screen or change my power settings when I had to run overnight processes.\nThat being said, if you don't like it, why don't you just keep your brightness at a higher setting?\n", "Q: SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol when trying to access HTTPS URL While trying to create a staging environment for my WORDPRESS website, I am not quite able to setup the HTTPS configuration.\nI copied the wordpress folder and backed up Mysql database and was able to have a copy of my website, but whenever I click on any link, it will take me to HTTPS url and shows me a SSL connection error.\nEnvironment\n\n\n*\n\n*Vagrant VM Ubuntu server Precise64\n\n*Chef to configure my host\n\n*Apache2 w/ SSL mod\n\n*Wordpress\n\n\nUNAME\nuname -a\nLinux test-www 3.5.0-23-generic #35~precise1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 25 17:13:26 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nSSL Configuration\nvagrant@test-www:/etc/apache2$ more ssl.conf \n<VirtualHost 192.168.33.10:443>\n    DocumentRoot /var/www\n    ServerName test-www.domain.com\n    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error_secure.log\n        LogLevel info\n\n    SSLEngine on\n\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/wildcard.domain.com/certificate.crt\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/wildcard.domain.com/server.key\n    SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/wildcard.domain.com/test-www.domain.com.ca.crt\n</VirtualHost> \n\nOPENSSL\nvagrant@test-www:/etc/apache2$ openssl s_client -connect 192.168.33.10:443\nCONNECTED(00000003)\n139816269579936:error:140770FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol:s23_clnt.c:757:\n---\nno peer certificate available\n---\nNo client certificate CA names sent\n---\nSSL handshake has read 7 bytes and written 213 bytes\n---\nNew, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)\nSecure Renegotiation IS NOT supported\nCompression: NONE\nExpansion: NONE\n---\n\nWGET HTTP:443\nvagrant@test-www:/etc/apache2$ wget http://192.168.33.10:443\n--2015-02-02 17:24:31--  http://192.168.33.10:443/\nConnecting to 192.168.33.10:443... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found\n2015-02-02 17:24:31 ERROR 404: Not Found.\n\nWGET HTTPS\nvagrant@test-www:/etc/apache2$ wget https://192.168.33.10\n--2015-02-02 17:25:23--  https://192.168.33.10/\nConnecting to 192.168.33.10:443... connected.\nOpenSSL: error:140770FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol\nUnable to establish SSL connection.\nvagrant@test-www:/etc/apache2$ \n\nAPACHE2.CONF\n#\n# Generated by Chef\n#\n# Based on the Ubuntu apache2.conf\n\nServerRoot \"/etc/apache2\"\n\n#\n# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.\n#\nLockFile /var/lock/apache2/accept.lock\n\n#\n# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process\n# identification number when it starts.\n#\nPidFile /var/run/apache2.pid\n\n#\n# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.\n#\nTimeout 300\n\n#\n# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than\n# one request per connection).

On startup, where does the output to dmesg get logged?\nDoesn't say on the man page:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/dmesg.1.html\n\nA: Usually kernel's operation related messages are stored in a fixed sized memory called the Kernel Ring Buffer. It's location is /proc/kmsg. dmesg usually prints the entries of the Kernel Ring Buffer in a human readable format. As it is a buffer (a temporary storage) mounted under /proc, you can imagine that it will not survive a reboot i.e. it will just show all the Kernel logs after being powered On. If you want to check all the previous Kernel logs you need to check /var/log/kern.log, as it is being stored on the disk it will survive the reboots.\n", "Q: Green Tint on Screen During Normal Boot I have a dell inspiron 17r which has an Intel hd graphics 4400 video card and I get this strange green tint whenever I do a normal boot of Ubuntu 14.04.

Currently, I can wake my PC by sending a magic packet from another device on the LAN. However, the PC will not power on when I send the packet from outside the network (WAN), even though I have my router instructed to forward UDP traffic on port 9 to the PC. If I run wireshark  on the machine and send the magic packet over WAN, it is indeed received by the PC.\nThis related question seems to indicate that NAT traversal modifies the packet in some way, which prevents it from actually waking the PC. The accepted answer suggests:\n\nUntick \"only allow a Magic packet to wake the computer\"\n\nHowever, this instruction is intended for Windows and not Ubuntu.\nIs there an equivalent setting or command that will instruct my network card to accept any packet?\nTechnical Information\n\n\n*\n\n*card: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

For Java, Qt Jambi appears well maintained, and allows you to use Qt in Java.\n\nA: Qt was originally for only for C++, but people have built bindings in for it to be used in other languages as poster @xxdkxx pointed out. However, I would only recommend doing this if you are familiar with Qt and prefer it, but have project constraints that limit you to a specific language. \nIf you are looking to just get started making GUI's and you are more familiar with Java, I would suggest using Swing, or if you are using Eclipse use Eclipse's built-in GUI tool called WindowBuilder. It leverages Swing and SWT Designer (another popular Java GUI builder) to make GUI-building easy for developers with a wide range of experience, from multiple days to multiple years. Some say that it won't give you quite as much flexibility as just using the low level Swing or AWT (Abstract Window Toolset) components, and people often complain that this autogenerates too much code unnecessarily, but often it is enough, and its easier to start out with.\n", "Q: Unable to extract themes pack to /usr/share/themes When I try to extract theme packs to /usr/share/themes/ it shows you don't have right permission to extract archives in the folder /themes/.\nWhat should I do?\nI am currently using Ubuntu 14.10\n\nA: Here are the permission settings of /usr/share/themes/:\ndrwxr-xr-x  151 root root  4096 Nov  7 06:50 themes\n\nAs you can see it is owned by the user root and group root. Moreover it has no write permissions for even the group members let alone others. \nSo the solution is to run sudo <command_to_extract_theme> or become root by sudo su and then <command_to_extract_theme>, the first option is preferable always.\n\nA: Unless you know what you are are doing, and even when you do, I suggest you to just extract the themes and put it on your ~/.themes directory in your home. Create it if doesn't exist.\nAlso for icons theme use the ~/.icons directory\nYou can select and switch themes in unity with unity tweak tool.\n", "Q: Moved Wubi to different partition, unable to boot after editing grub So, I've tried to move my wubi installation between disks and followed this:\nMove WUBI installation of Ubuntu to a different partition in Windows\nHowever once I start applying the edits to the grub, I am unable to boot.\nI've switched \nset root=(hd0,msdos2)  to root=(hd0,msdos1)\nDeleted the line - search --no-floppy xxx\nand switched linux /boot/vmlinuz-xxxx root=UUID= xxxxx ... to linux /boot/vmlinuz-xxx root=/dev/sda1 ...\nOnce I boot up it doesn't find a command list and states error not found. If required, I can grab a picture of it to show how the grub looks. I'm terribly inexperienced with Ubuntu, especially at this degree. Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: When it boots, hold Shift to get the grub menu. Then press C to get to a Grub command prompt enter the following (be careful; no typos; nothing here will harm anything so just start again if necessary):\nsearch -s -f -n /ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nprobe --set=diskuuid -u $root\nloopback loop0 /ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nset root=(loop0)\nlinux /vmlinuz root=UUID=$diskuuid loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk ro quiet splash\ninitrd /initrd.img\nboot\n\nWhat does the above do? 1.) Finds the root.disk (file) and sets $root to the partition it found it on.  2) Gets the UUID of the partition. 3) Creates a loop device (fake partition) from the root.disk on loop0. 4) Sets root to the loop device. 5) identifies the kernel off the loop device while setting the host partition from the UUID. 6) identifies the initial ram disk off the loop device. 7) boots the Wubi install\nOnce you have booted Wubi, run\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter that it will boot normally.\nEdit:\nI seem to recall that the Grub probe command wasn't added until after 12.04. If it doesn't work, then substitute #2 with the following:\necho $root\n\nNow note what it says e.g. /dev/sda2 and then change #5 to directly reference the partition, not the UUID with e.g.:\nlinux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk ro quiet splash\n\n", "Q: Dual Booting UEFI After bad Install, What happens to old Boot Loader? The short: I accidentally installed 32bit 12.04, and choose to 'install boot loader' on the dev/sda (or 'main' the one that has all the memory) drive. Both windows and ubuntu work, only after changing BIOS/UEFI settings. But I want to redo the install and get 12.04 or 14 on the UEFI, will the previous installing of the 'bootloader' get in the way?\nThe long: Due to the foolish misreading of the ISO versions (64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD made me choose the intel option without reading all the descriptions, my first mistake) I tried to install 32-bit 12.04 on a new laptop. After hours of trying different USB setups and UEFI adjustments, it finally booted from the USB drive when changing the settings to legacy mode support. I had done research (not enough though) on where to put the 'bootloader' so that I wouldn't have to modify the MBR or other bios stuff afterwards, they advised me to put it on the overarching dev/sda that encompasses the whole system. So I did just that, made a decent partition for ubuntu, ran the install. Found out that it would not boot windows even though windows boot loader appears in the GRUB list of bootable options. I got around that issue but going back to the UEFI/BIOS setup and changing the option back to UEFI. So apparently the computer tries to boot up any UEFI loaders first. This is a kindof shoddy work around since I don't want to be shutting down, changing Boot Setup to legacy/UEFI, then restarting to get to a different OS. Plus that can't be the best for the computer. \nI am aware if I re-install with 64bit ubuntu I will erase the partition with the 32bit, but I don't know what will happen to the GRUB/Bootloader thing I installed to the main partition. \nCan I just ignore it?\nOther details:\nLenovo ideapad Z710 laptop\n\nA: A UEFI install keeps bootloaders on the EFI System Partition, while an MBR install like you did before keeps one bootloader in MBR or unformatted BIOS_GRUB partition on GPT partition table.\nNo matter what you did before, if you re-install in UEFI mode no old and new bootloaders will interfere with each other. If you hadn't accidentally installed from 32-Bit installation media, you would even be able to just install the other bootloader setup and be able to boot (Ubuntu) both ways. (You can also boot Windows 8 in legacy mode if the BCD configuration is setup correctly to boot both ways.)\nProbably related:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling Ubuntu without formatting partition - what folders are deleted?\n", "Q: How to keep linux-cloud-tools-virtual in sync with my kernel? The Ubuntu 14.04 package linux-cloud-tools-virtual, used for compatibility with Hyper-V, depends on linux-cloud-tools-3.13.0-44-generic.  However, the standard installed kernel is 3.13.0-32, which requires installation of linux-cloud-tools-3.13.0-32-generic instead.\nIs this a bug?  Is there some way to get the appropriate version with the package manager and automatically keep it in sync even as the kernel gets upgraded over time?\n\nA: You can (and probably should) do the opposite thing — install linux-image-generic (or sth. like that) to ensure that also the kernel is updated, like the cloud-tools; they'll be kept in sync by Ubuntu people. This will also allow you to get security updates — which you do want anyway in almost any case.\nYou also probably want to setup automatic package updates through unattended-upgrades.\nThe only thing left to you is to reboot the machine when the kernel is updated, unless you let unattended-upgrades do that for you.\n", "Q: How to install ATLAS I'm trying to install sextractor on a dual-booted Windows8.1/Ubuntu14.04 machine with i5 processor.\nI'm following this guide on how to install ATLAS onto Ubuntu.\nI always encounter the error:\n../configure\nmake: `xconfig' is up to date.\n./xconfig -d s /home/user/Programs/atlas/bld/../ -d b /home/user/Programs/atlas/bld \n\nOS configured as Linux (1)\n\nAssembly configured as GAS_x8664 (2)\n\nVector ISA Extension configured as  AVXMAC (3,488)\n\nArchitecture configured as  Corei3 (28)\n\nClock rate configured as 3100Mhz\n\nMaximum number of threads configured as  4\nParallel make command configured as '$(MAKE) -j 4'\nCPU Throttling apparently enabled!\nIt appears you have cpu throttling enabled, which makes timings\nunreliable and an ATLAS install nonsensical.

After some struggling, I managed to avoid the message \"CPU Throttling apparently enabled!\" and got ATLAS 3.10.2 installed.\nThe first tip I got here, where it basically says that \"The only time ATLAS should detect throttling that isn't occurring is when the processors are fixed to run at a lower speed than their max.\" My processor was not running at it maximum speed, since I had a BIOS speed limit.\nIf you have the same problem, look at the maximum frequency allowed in the file /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies. Copy this value to the files /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-3]/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq for each processor. You need to do it as super-user, but before you have to edit the file /sys/module/processor/parameters/ignore_ppc from 0 to 1. More details are given here.\nThis was still not enough for me and I figured out that I had to edit the files /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-3]/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq to the same value that was used before. After that, I did not get the boring message any more and ATLAS was successfully installed.\nI hope that helps!\n", "Q: Is my graphics card being used and if so why doesn't it show as VGA compatible controller?

I have LUBUNTU 14.1 (I think).  My printer is a Samsung scx-4623f.\nsometimes the printer will start for a few seconds then quit...so i assume i don't have the correct driver.  I'm a newbie so if that is the problem I don't know how to download it.\nhelp please.\n\nA: To install the driver, go to http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/SCX-4623F/XAA scroll down and click the download on the right. Assuming you have downloaded the file to your downloads folder, run the following commands to install the driver:\ntar xvf ~/Downloads/uld_v1.00.06.tar.gz\ncd uld\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nThen restart cups, avahi, and network-manager:\nsudo service avahi-daemon restart\nsudo service cups restart\nsudo service cups-browsed restart\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nIf you get an error on cups-browsed don't worry about it.\nFinally, unplug and plug back in the printer and if all else fails, reboot to make sure the changes take effect.\n\nA: First, you can install the correct driver at the following site: http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/SCX-4623F/XAA.  When there, scroll down the page until you come to Manuals and Downloads; click the link to download the driver.  Also, check your connections--from computer to printer, etc.\n\nA: If the printer still does not work properly after installing the drivers, I have had good luck by manually registering my printer with CUPS (CUPS is the printing system used for Unix-like operating systems).  This is not difficult to do either.  Go to http://localhost:631/. This is the CUPS 1.7.2 site where you will manually register your printer. When you get to the site, click on the Printers tab; you may very well see your printer listed here, but it may not have been registered automatically. Weather you see it listed or not, click on the Administration tab and enter your printer information. After you finish entering your printer information, your printer may very well start working properly. Make sure you are booted to Ubuntu and not Windows--if you are, in fact, double booting from the same computer.  Note: My printer was listed when I clicked on the Printer tab in CUPS, and it was also recognized by Ubuntu, but it still would not print because it was not registered automatically by CUPS.\n", "Q: Installing a new cursor theme in Lubuntu (LXDE) I've downloaded a new cursor theme (several .cur or .ani files) but don't know how to install it.

I'm hoping to do this nondestructively, as it would take considerable time to migrate the data off and then migrate it back once the array has been built.\nNOTE: The drive I want to RAID is not a boot volume - it's storage-only.  Not sure if that matters.\nI've read instructions here and here about converting RAID1 to RAID10, and here about creating the RAID1 from the original drive (create degraded, copy data, add original drive to array), but I'm wondering if I'm headed for any pitfalls if I try to stepping-stone my way from a single drive to RAID10.  Logically, I would think it'd be fine as long as I wait for the RAID1 to finish building and verify that it's good before I do the RAID10 expansion, but I'm not sure if there's a caveat I haven't considered yet.\nIs it as simple as what I've read?\n\nA: \nI'm hoping to do this nondestructively, as it would take considerable time to migrate the data off and then migrate it back once the array has been built.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean. You have to migrate the data from your plain disk to your new array in any case. As one of the answers already suggested, you can create a RAID10 array with two missing drives and add them later after you finished migrating your data. This is easier than migrating from RAID1 or RAID0 to RAID10.\nRemember that redundancy of RAID doesn't count as a backup. If you somehow mess up your array or corrupt data, then your data is lost or corrupted permanently. At least have another 6 TB volume as a backup if something goes wrong. (I was in a similar situation a few years ago, using Debian (stable), MDADM and EXT4, which I thought was fine, until I ran an MD5 check on some of the files and found several corruptions. After mounting the same array on the latest Ubuntu and checking again most files that had corruptions before were fine. You never know which bugs you might run into, therefore have an offline backup!)\nYou might want to look into the RAID capabilities of ZFS on Linux or btrfs, which solve issues and provide advanced features like partitioning/LVM, silent data corruption, snapshots, compressing content on the fly and so forth.\n", "Q: How to safely expand root partition for Xubuntu running in VirtualBox with GParted?

Updating will need you to log into your acccount ;)\n\nI am very willing to delete everything and start again. \n\nThat is also an option; a re-install will remove anything related to Ubuntu and have you start from zero. With a new username and a new password. But try not to forget at least the user name. Be smart and pick something easy as a name (your own name is always a good option). \nMind though that if you do have personal documents it might be wise to put them on an USB before re-installing (also possible from the \"try ubuntu\" option).\n", "Q: Messed up Ubuntu 14.04 UI I installed the Kubuntu desktop environment atop Ubuntu 14.04 x64 LTS. After I removed it, the cursor remained that of plasma desktop and the background, the symbols, the sounds have changed completely. I tried unity --replace which wasn’t of much help. any way to get my old interface settings back? I would also appreciate it if you told me how to remove all the apps that came with Kubuntu, as I used apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop and apt-get autoclean, which did not remove the apps.\n\nA: you need to also uninstall all plasma and oxygen themes.\nFirst, determine what is still installed on your system by running the following commands:\ndpkg -l | grep plasma\n\nthen:\ndpkg -l | grep oxygen\n\nand for kicks and giggles, go ahead and find out what kde related apps are also installed:\ndpkg -l | grep kde\n\nUse the following command to purge (not just remove) all those apps that were listed in the output from each of those commands. You can copy and paste them all to follow the next command:\nsudo apt-get purge\n\nexample:\nsudo apt-get purge oxygen-icon-theme oxygencursors kde-style-oxygen-transparent\n\nand so on, listing as many as you would like to purge from the system in that single command.\nYou may be able to get away with using a wildcard but I warn you to BE CAREFUL to make sure what will be uninstalled BEFORE you accept the changes as using a wild card often results in uninstalling some stuff that you need or want to keep as well so make sure to read the changes before accepting yes!!!\nsudo apt-get purge \"oxygen*\" \"plasma*\" \"kde*\"\n\n\nTo regain control over your system, you have two options.\nOption one (before Ubuntu version 18.04): install unity-tweak-tool and there you will find an option for the cursor theme and other theme settings not available through the basic settings interface.\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nOption two (Ubuntu 18.04 and newer): a more simple approach is to use the gnome-tweak-tool instead:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nThe gnome tweak tool is not as complicated and more simple and the unity-tweak-tool offers more settings. Personally, I have both installed and use the gnome-tweak-tool for quick theme changes and the unity counterpart for all the other stuff not available there. It should be noted that the unity-tweak-tool is only for use with the Unity desktop which is no longer the standard as of version 18.04.\n", "Q: Auto backup on login (Ubuntu 14.04) I have installed grsync so I can backup files from my laptop to my folder on a local server. When I run it manually, the files copy across, no problem.\nI want this to happen automatically when I log in. \nI have set up a Startup Application task but it does not work. Here are the commands I have tried:\ngrsync -e backupname    \nrsync -e backupname    \n/usr/bin/grsync   #(this opens the grsync gui on log in)\n\nCan anyone tell me the correct command to put in startup applications?\n\nA: Grsync is meant as a GUI to rsync. You can use it also very easily to \"compose\" The command, to use on startup (e.g. if you are unsure how to create the rsync command):\n\n\n*\n\n*in Grsync, choose source and destination, as well as your options:\n\n\n*Choose \"File\" > \"Command line\":\n\n\n*A window will popup with the command you are looking for:\n\n\n*Copy the command you created in Grsync and add it to your startup applications:\nrsync -r -t -s /home/jacob/Dropbox /media/jacob/'My Passport'\n\nAdd to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add\nNotes\n\n\n*\n\n*After login, you might have to wait a number of seconds for the (external?) drives to be mounted. If so, you can do that as in the command below:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&rsync -r -t /home/jacob/Dropbox /media/jacob/'My Passport'\"\n\n\n*If you'd like to log your backups, simply add to you command:\n>> /path/to/logfile 2>&1\n\nso the command would be for example:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&rsync -r -t /home/jacob/Dropbox /media/jacob/'My Passport' >> /home/jacob/Bureaublad/log.txt 2>&1\"\n\n\n*If your command includes names with spaces (in the directory), place those names between quotes. From the example: My Passport should be: 'My Passport'\n\nA: This guide here explains how to launch and configure the rsync daemon on system startup.\nAlternatively, you can add your commands to the end of the /etc/rc.local script that is executed upon startup. By adding your commands in here it will execute them when you startup your machine.\nsudo nano /etc/rc.local\n\nThen type in your commands that you wan't (be sure to add them before the exit 0 line), save the file with Ctrl + O and then exit nano. The commands should then be executed on startup.\nHope this has helped you out.\n", "Q: Apt-get fails to fetch inside an LXC container I have an Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS server that's running LXC containers.

I want a simple text editor (much like WordPad) for creating task lists. The problem with gedit is that there are no plugins for formatting options. On the other hand, Bluefish and Sublime are much too heavy.\n\nA: There is a continuum with 2 ends:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dedicated TODO management software (with autosave, devices sync, reminders, outlining, archiving of done/old tasks, etc.).  Frequently stores your notes in some obscure database / format / cloud.\n︙\n\n*Plain text files, manually managed by you, edited with any plain text editor.\n\n\nIf you're comfortable with \"I'll manage my own file(s), just give me an editor\", you're already close to the latter.  I wouldn't go the WordPad-like (e.g. Abiword) route, with messy formats like .rtf or .doc.  Take the remaining relatively small step to plain text, which gives a lot of power: you can use unix tools like version control or grep on the notes, and you have much wider choice of editors. \nNote that this doesn't mean you give up text styling!  As others here recommend, a lightweight markup convention like Markdown lets you type # Heading or *italic text* (instead of Ctrl+I italic text Ctrl+I), and many editors can highlight it appropriately.\nBut you can take a step further and pretend you're editing rich text with Zim:\n\nwhile the underlying text is still plain text files + simple syntax e.g. //italic text//.\nYou can apply most styling both as you would in a rich text editor (select, menu or shortcut) or by just typing the syntax.\nAnd Zim has several handy features and plugins for organizing tasks: interlinked pages, calendar with daily pages, checkboxes, tasks with due dates...\n\nA: Someone already mentioned emacs so I'm going to mention---wait for it---vim!\nGranted, to add these \"special effects\" to vim, the file needs to be in markdown format (with a matching .markdown or .md extension, I believe). But it is there by default.\n\nTo install use:\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nMore information can be found at this question\n\nA: If you want a text editor, there is no such a thing as bold. \nPlain text is plain text. The bold, italic, colored thing you see in a programming editor like gedit, geany, kate, etc. is syntactic highlight, added by the editor to facilitate the reading and writing of programs or whatever --- it is not stored with the text. \nNow, you can leverage this to see bold in the gedit. For example, if you save your file like a markdown (extension .md), you will see this:\n\n...using the same syntax you use in Ask Ubuntu to make pretty questions and answers. You can then have a lot of tools to pretty print them, like for example pandoc.\nOtherwise, you are looking for a word processor, which is another kind of beast completely.

It is also actively updated by the developer. You can download the deb package from here.\n\n\nA: If you want to look at source code with rich formatting, then Geany or Kate is your best choice.\nHowever, it seems that you basically want a Rich Text Editor. In this case you should go for Abiword or Calligra Words.\nAbiword is much like WordPad. Install Abiword:\nsudo apt-get install abiword\n\n\n\nA: Emacs is an easily customizable text editor which is widely used and probably has more features then any other open source text editor out there. \nTo install, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

These will display is dwww without problem. \nBut other files are not and will not display automatically.

Guild Wars 2 was working fine on windows too. There I had about 50 to 60fps (35 when in a huge zerg) when the graphics were maxed out. \nNow I have in LoL only 28-45 on both lowest and highest settings. I changed the resolution too, didnt do anything. Same thing  for gw2 (~20fps@1280x800 maxed, ~20fps@1024x768 lowest). It seems to doesnt matter what setting I use, I'll always get kinda low fps. I also tried to overclock my graphics card which had no improvements at all.\nBut in the process of doing that I observed that (at least in gw2, lol not tested because I cant switch to another window) my card isnt fully used when I set the settings to the lowest. It uses in gw2 only 300MHz core and 150MHz memory clock and a gpu load of about 30% to 60%. When I use the highest setting the card is running at 1090 MHz core and 1500MHz memory clock with a gpu load of around 60% to 90%.\nMy guess is that the drivers from AMD are at fault but I couldnt find ( or I am to stupid to) the facts to support that theory.\nHas anyone an idea what I might do to fully use my gpu?\nSpecs:\nMSIs AMD R9 270 2G 2GB graphics card,\nInteln Xeon 1230v3@3.41GHz,\n8GB DDR3@1600,\nUbuntu 14.04. 64bit,\nPlayonlinux v4.2.5,\nLoL Wine 1.7.33,\nGW2 Wine 1.7.1,\nCatalyst 13.35\nEdit: I tried out some benchmarks and downloaded DOTA2 for test. The results are as I would expect from a R9 270, so it has to be wine? \nI dont expect the fps to ramp up like 20fps but why is there no difference when I go from highest settings to lowest setting?\n\nA: WINE acts as a software layer between game and the operating system, thereby reducing speed.

I booted from my windows partition and it said \"missing operating system\" but I know everything got installed so what is the issue? I've tried twice and I'm not sure what's causing this error, any help would be appreciated.\nOh and each time I installed it, I installed it to \"/dev/sda3\" and the next time I installed it to \"/dev/sda4\" there was also an option to save to \"/dev/sda1\" should I have done that? Do I need to have a swap partition in order to boot linux? I only created one partition and that was for the OS.\n\nA: Boot the live cd/usb stick. Open gparted (its on the disk) and inspect the harddrive. How many partitions does is have? If you have 1 HDD than I suggest using sda for boot. It should integrate Ubuntu with OSX in the bootloader.\n\nA: There are some things that look weird. First: Your screenshot shows two partitions (EFI FAT32 200MB boot; hfs+ 166GB) and 66GB unpartitioned space. Are you really using Windows, as its default file system is NTFS and afaik can not properly access (or even boot from) hfs+ volumes.  \nAnd where do you exactly get the message \"missing operating system\"?\nAbout the swap partition: Yes, you need it (or a swap file), at least it is strongly recommended. Give it about as much space as you have RAM built into your PC, maybe 1-8GB or so.\nAnd the last paragraph about installing to /dev/sda3 etc... This is where you want to install the GRUB bootloader. If you want to replace the \"Windows\"(?) bootloader with GRUB (recommended, because GRUB usually autodetects all other OS and doesn't need further configuration), you have to select /dev/sda (without number!), to install it to the MBR (Master Boot Record) of your disk, instead of any partition.\n\nA: Ok..U have 1 harddisk (/dev/sda) and this harddisk is partitioned in 2 partions: /dev/sda1 & /dev/sda2. There is also unallocated space present. OSX is probably located in /sda2 because I can see an hfs+ filesystem on sda2.  Ubuntu needs another filesystem like ext4 (there are others). But you can't install Ubuntu on an hfs+ filesystem. So..the best you can do is install Ubuntu in the unallocated space. The installer will see this space and offers you the possibiltiy to use this space. The installer will create all the partions you need. The bootloader should be pointed at /dev/sda1 ( I think, because I have no knowledge about OSX)\n", "Q: How to check if a variable is empty on command line?

I lost ability to display desktop icons after a boot message recommending fixing the hard disk, which I did.  Then all my desktop settings changed and I couldn't display icons on the desktop.  Repeated searches did not help.  Best solution I found was in Ubuntu Software Center.  Search for \"tweak\".  Install \"Tweak Tool\" (not \"Unity Tweak Tool\").  Then search in the search tool at the top of Launcher for \"tweak\".  Open it.  Click on \"Desktop\" tab.  Click on \"Icons on Desktop\" switch - - which appears far to right of displayed window -- if you find it is set \"off\".  When this switch is \"on\", any file in the /home/[your username]/Desktop folder should appear as an icon on the desktop.  If the switch was already \"on\" and no icons were on desktop, then I am clueless.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.3 not booting I installed ubuntu 12.04 (in Window 7 machine) and it was working properly.

I was wondering where does Google Chrome save pdf documents that it opens in the browser itself. I know those get deleted if we dont save them and close the browser.\nI looked into chrome temporary folder at ~/.cache/google-chrome, but couldnt find any pdf there. \n\nA: Note: This no longer works since the Chrome disk cache format has changed\n\nIt's in that directory, all right. Just uses a random string for filenames. Test it out:\nfind ~/.cache/google-chrome -type f -exec file {} + | grep PDF\n\nFor example:\n$ find .cache/google-chrome/ -type f -exec file {} + | grep PDF\n.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_004bf0:       PDF document, version 1.5\n.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache/f_004c01:       PDF document, version 1.4\n\n\nA: The Google Chrome cache directory $HOME/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache on Linux contains one file per cache entry named <16 char hex>_0 in \"simple entry format\":\n\n*\n\n*20 Byte SimpleFileHeader\n\n*key (i.e. the URI)\n\n*payload (the raw file content i.e. the PDF in our case)\n\n*SimpleFileEOF record\n\n*HTTP headers\n\n*SHA256 of the key (optional)\n\n*SimpleFileEOF record\n\nYou therefore cannot simply use file to determine the file type (it will just detect data), but must search for the PDF header. This will list all PDFs in the cache directory:\ngrep -Rl '%PDF' $HOME/.cache/google-chrome/Default/Cache\n\nNote: This may give you false positives in case the string %PDF appears somewhere in a file which isn't a PDF\nNote: If you're not using the default Chrome profile, replace Default with the profile name, e.g. Profile 1.\nevince will happily read the cache file directly, without having to strip the header.\nIf you do want to extract the original PDF, save the following script as extractpdf.py:\ndef main(cachefile):\n    with open(cachefile, 'rb') as f:\n        s = f.read()\n    with open(cachefile + '.pdf', 'wb') as f:\n        f.write(s[s.find(b'%PDF'):s.rfind(b'%%EOF')+5])\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import sys\n    main(sys.argv[1])\n\nAnd call it as python3 extractpdf.py <cache file>\n", "Q: How to select a file without opening it?

If I click the Orage indicator the Orage calendar pops up, where I can see/create events. What I'm looking for is to combine both apps so in the panel it shows the time (which is not possible with Orage) but when I click it a calendar appears where I can annotate events. I want this just to reduce the number of icons in my panel. \nIf this is not possible, is there an alternative app for this? I have seen several calendars but none have the role of clock too.

How can I convert a CSV file to XML?\nIs there any software for Ubuntu?\n\nA: On the community website on converting there is a link to a command line tool called csv2xml. Since it is unmaintained you might want to choose another option.\nThere is also mention of a java tool called csv2xml (warning: website is in German) and a command line tool called ff-extractor.\nThe link also has references to Python, Perl, PHP, XSLT but that means you need to code the converter yourself.\n\nA: When you know the format of the csv file and the structure you need in the xml file, it's fairly straightforward to make a script that can handle the conversion.\nTake the file simple.csv:\nJack,35,United States\nJill,22,United Kingdom\n\nYou can create the following xml file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<Customers>\n  <Customer>\n    <Name>Jack</Name>\n    <Age>35</Age>\n    <Country>United States</Country>\n </Customer>\n <Customer>\n    <Name>Jill</Name>\n    <Age>22</Age>\n    <Country>United Kingdom</Country>\n </Customer>\n</Customers>\n\nWith the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\nfile_in=\"simple.csv\"\nfile_out=\"simple.xml\"\necho '<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>' > $file_out\necho '<Customers>' >> $file_out\nwhile IFS=$',' read -r -a arry\ndo\n  echo '  <Customer>' >> $file_out\n  echo '    <Name>'${arry[0]}'</Name>' >> $file_out\n  echo '    <Age>'${arry[1]}'</Age>' >> $file_out\n  echo '    <Country>'${arry[2]}'</Country>' >> $file_out\n  echo '  </Customer>' >> $file_out\ndone < $file_in\necho '</Customers>' >> $file_out\n\nEven if you have never coded before, I think this should be easy to use and modify. The file is read line-by-line in the while loop. \nIFS is the internal field specifier. The IFS=$',' declares that the value of the field separator is a comma. This is standard for a CSV file, but it can be changed as needed to match the input file format.\nThe -r argument to the read command tells it to treat any backslashes in your file as part of your data rather than as an escape for a following special character.\nThe -a arry argument places each column of your file into an array (named arry). The columns in this example are name, age, country. In other words the values between the commas. So each column in the line is stored in an array. \nThen the needed text for xml is just wrapped around the values and the xml line is appended to the output file with echo.\n\nA: A fairly user-friendly (i.e., easy for numpties like me) solution to the CSV to XML conversion challenge is to use a nice cross-platform XML editor that has this feature built-in. (I've used it both under Ubuntu and Mac OSX 10.10.5; it also has Windows executable.)\nXMLSpear\nAs mentioned, it is an XML editor, but it includes CSV-to-XML (and Excel-to-XML) \"import\" on its main menu:\n\nIt converted a 31Mb CSV file for me (a dump from a library database of 20,000 entries) in about 15 seconds, giving me a well-formed XML file to save and manipulate.\nAs an editor it has many other welcome features (detailed at the link, above). I cannot find mention of any license for it, but this is included in the \"README\":\n\nXMLSpear is free software for personal use.\n  Please send yor feedback to xmlspear@donkeydevelopment.com or on the forum http://donkeydevelopment.com/forums.   \nCommercial use must be approved by donkeydevelopment.\n  Just send an email to xmlspear@donkeydevelopment.com with the subject \"licence request\".\n\nThe readme also helpfully includes the contents for a .desktop file.\nDoes the job well for me under Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Gnome). \n\nA: I'm a big fan of BaseX which seems to have an import capability:\nhttp://docs.basex.org/wiki/CSV_Module\n\nMight point out that it's, seemingly, easier to use a web application:\nhttps://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/123959/24327\nWhich amounts to a plugin or extension to the browser which works with google sheets.\nI feel your pain because it's a seemingly simple utility which should be, well, available through apt.\n\nA: I would suggest you or someone write codes in Python. Python is easy to learn and solve your problem easily. It have both CSV module and XML modules. My suggestion takes into consideration that you might need to have your own names for XML elements or have other complex requirements (like converting last CSV column into attribute of last but one column).\nThere are tons of tutorial online about Python.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Studio 14.10: Need Driver for Epson Workforce 1100 I am running Ubuntu Studio 14.10.

What's that mean?\n\nA: It is called the SETUID bit. if it is set by chmod 4555 test-file (in your case), then the test-file can be executed by any user as if the user is the owner of the file.\nWhen the SETUID bit is set then the Effective User ID (EUID) of the user who does not have permission to execute the file otherwise (by normal permissions, e.g. 0744), takes the EUID of the file owner and can execute the file.\n\nA: There's actually 4 attribute sets you can work with via chmod.\nSpecial, User/Owner, Group, and Others in that order, when working with the four-number chmods, with that first number being special bits that can be set.\nchmod 4555 equates to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set UID bit - Run the file as the owner regardless of which user is running it\n\n*User/Owner: Read, Execute\n\n*Group: Read, Execute\n\n*Others: Read, Execute\nThe s in your 'human readable' string for permissions indicates that the SetUID bit (explained below) is set.\n\nEffectively, we can break down the four-number chmod permissions argument into specific descriptors as follows, and doing the math to determine what a 4 in the first section would be, a 5 in the next section, and so on.\nKeep in mind that #### is Special User/Owner Group and Others in that order.\nFor Special attributes (the first number in a four-number chmod argument):\n\n\n*\n\n*Set UID - Run file as owner regardless of the user running it (shows as s in the human-readable permissions string for User section) = +4 (--s under User/Owner)\n\n*Set GID - Run file as group regardless of the user/group running it (shows as s in the human-readable permissions string for Group section) = +2 (--s under Group)\n\n*Sticky Bit - EFFECTIVE ON DIRECTORIES ONLY - If set, only the directory's owner user and root can delete the directory, and only the file owner or root can delete files inside it. (shows as t in the human-readable permissions string for Others section)  = +1  (--t under Others)\n\n\nFor User/Owner, Group and Others attributes (the last three numbers in a four-number chmod argument):\n\n\n*\n\n*Read = +4      (r--)\n\n*Write = +2     (-w-)\n\n*Execute (for files), or 'Enter Into / List Items' (for directories) = +1   (--x)\n\n", "Q: How do I fix weird graphical glitches and Wine problems?

Initially, I installed it dual booting with Windows and the fan was silent and working well. Then I decided to format my HD and install only Ubuntu. The system works OK but the fan went crazy.\nFrom time to time (~ 2min) it goes to nearly 2800 and then back again to 1600.\nI updated the Lenovo T540p BIOS but the problem remained. I have tried lm-sensors, but it did not change the behaviour.\nI saw that there is a Thinkpad Fan control application. I did not try it because I do not know much about it, how safe it is for new users and whether it works with 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: My problem was solved by editing the BIOS Power Management settings.\nOn the menu item: Power > Adaptive Thermal Management, I've changed these settings to the values shown below:\nScheme for AC: Balanced\nScheme for Battery: Balanced\n\nI chose balanced instead of Maximum performance for both AC adapter and Battery.\nAfter this, I re-started the system and the problem was solved.\nTo enter the BIOS, pressed Enter during startup.\nNow the Fan stays around 2000 with normal usage and is not noisy. When the CPU is idle or lightly used the fan speed can drop to 0 rpm.\nWhen you activate any program the Fan goes up to 2000 rpm or more (depending on the CPU usage of the application) and then stays at this level.\nOne tip is to install lm-sensor and psensor to monitor your fan speed and CPU temperature.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Dubai Date & Time Settings I am on Ubuntu 14.04 and I reside in Dubai and thus I set up my date and time settings accordingly.

By upgrading from a much older release to the latest can result in a misconfigured system due to package mishaps caused by the big upgrade leap. This is explained quite well here.\nWhat you can do is change your settings in the software update manager to only upgrade if there is a newer LTS version available. This will then detect and upgrade to 14.04 when you check for software updates (as long as you are still on 12.04).\nTo get to the software update manager you can open the Ubuntu Software Center -> Edit -> Software Sources... -> Updates then change Notify me of a new Ubuntu version to Long term support versions. Then when you save your changes your system should check for updates. When it does, allow it to upgrade to 14.04.\nWhen your in 14.04 you can do the same process but change the Notify me of a new Ubuntu version to For any new version. This will then hopefully upgrade the system to 14.10.\nHope this has helped you out.\n\nA: If you are looking just to upgrade and ignore all else open up terminal and type in \n\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Shift-Select in Matlab Editor lagging I have very peculiar problem in Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 using Matlab (both R2014a and R2014b) I am not able to solve for almost a year (maybe even more). This problem persists on my second machine I just built, therefore I don't think it is hardware specific, unless... (we'll get into that later).\nWhen I was using my ASUS U43SD Notebook, after first install, everything was fine, but after a while editing a Matlab using Shift-Select (with keyboard arrows) became hell. Lagging, freezing, clugging. I tried everything, reinstalling software, purging and reinstalling Java, everything, with no results.\nAfter a week ago, I built a completely new machine, desktop for this time, since I needed performance for my work. I installed Matlab and everything was perfect, however - it is now fifth day from built when Matlab does the same as before on my notebook. The most interesting thing is that at first it runs fine, but after Matlab starts to be a bad boy, it keeps its attitude. Formatting, OS reinstalling, none of these will resolve the problem.\nThe only thing right now that might have some impact I can think of is my SSD disk. I was using Corsair Force GS in my notebook and it is the only think that made it into my new desktop, everything else except that is new. Can it be the drive? Could it be some kind of weekly trim thing that starts after a week, therefore messing with something and persisting even after OS reinstall and complete drive format?

Programs I like to run are written in Java and Python and script files (.jar, .pyc, .py and .class)\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: Let's say you want to execute a file called fun.py located on your Desktop using the command funny. Obviously, you'll need python for that, so the exact bash command would be python ~/Desktop/fun.py. \nHow to do that without having to change the PATH variable:\nFirst create a file called funny with the following contents:\n#! /bin/sh\npython ~/Desktop/fun.py\n\nand save it to a folder (let's say you have saved it on your Desktop folder).\nIf non-existent, create a folder named bin in your home directory.\nThen execute the following commands from a terminal:\nsource .profile\nchmod +x ~/Desktop/funny\nmv ~/Desktop/funny ~/bin\n\nYou can now enter the command funny to execute the python script.\n\nA: In order to do this you need to update your execution PATH variable.\nTo see your PATH variable you can type\necho $PATH in a terminal\nThese are the places that bash will look for your executable files going from left to right.\nTo add a directory for bash to search for executables you do 1 of 2 things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the files you want to run into one of the PATH directories.\n\n\nOr\n\n\n*Add a new directory to your path\n\n\nFor option 1.\nIf your PATH=/usr/bin\nYou could copy the programs you want to execute to there.\nFor option 2\nif you made a new directory with all your programs in \n/home/bob/bin\nYou could you could add this to your PATH by editing the .bashrc file at the very end add this line:\nPATH=$PATH:/home/bob/bin\nthen to load those .bashrc changes type source .bashrc\n\nA: I think /usr/local/bin is a preferred place for user created scripts, etc which you want to start just using name. Anything you copy there can be started simply by name since that is in $PATH.  To verify what your $PATH contents type:\necho $PATH\n\nFor running bash, sh, or any scripts make sure you have \"allow execution\" set for the file:\nchmod +x  my_script\n\nRelated to to running \"python my_code.py\" or similar things which may require parameters you can create a tiny script which will start that and locate the script into /usr/local/bin.\n", "Q: Setting up a DNS without owning a domain I have been researching on how to set up a DNS server and found that BIND seems to be the best way to do so. I am new to setting up a DNS server so I have a couple of questions\nI do not own a domain name, would it be possible to still set up a DNS server with a fake domain name and still be able to test out the features as needed?\n\nA: You can install bind9:\napt-get install bind9\nYou don't need a domain to have a DNS server. If you wanted you could setup, say, your laptop or desktop to a static IP and configure bind9 to translate \"laptop\" to 192.168.1.10\nyou could also ping \"laptop\" and it would resolve laptop to 192.168.1.10\nIf you wanted to, you could setup to use it as the primary DNS server and have bind9 forward external requests to google 8.8.4.4 or any other DNS server of your choice.\n", "Q: Pinta selection cropping I've just installed Pinta to basically crop a screenshot (why doesn't Ubuntu come with a simple image editing tool?!) but for the life of me cannot work out how to crop an image to a selection properly.

I'm not very familiar with Wine, and my Windows installation screwed up. So basically, I want to use Sony Vegas Pro, and I'm out of a Windows operating system.

You can integrate it so well Vegas will just be another window on your Ubuntu desktop. Use samba to share the relevant folders with your Windows VM, and share the C:\\ drive in the VM with Ubuntu, and you can do anything you need to in the Windows directories right from bash and nautilus.\n", "Q: Error on Boot after Install I installed Ubuntu 14.10 from usb after creating the usb using the usb creator.

It requires a user and password which I do not possess I have tried (user/password)=(blank/blank) and (ubuntu/blank). The latter produces a loop... \nI read an older post that said to add a user but it doesn't seem possible.\n\nA: You need to download and burn again. It was not a complete image. \nIf you used torrent to download the image, just start it up again and make sure it starts to seed. It probably only downloaded 99.9% of it. \nIf you used browser install, either switch to torrent, or download through browser again. \nOn the download page it should give you the hash of the file. You can check the ISO to make sure hash matches, if does, you have the whole image \nEdit\nOn Windows you can download and use a free tool called hashcalc to check the sum\nThis is a list of hashes \nCheck the version you downloaded and the hash of your iso should match to that of site. If it don't match, it's not a complete image. \n\nA: EDIT \nIf the default username and password are not working then it is true the install could be in incomplete and I do agree that a live USB is quite handy, however, it is possible to add or alter users from the command line. If you verify the validity of the installation you can add a user via command line like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + F2 You should see a command line.\n\n*sudo adduser [your new username] There will be a few prompts to follow\n\n*Ctrl + Alt + F7 Should put you back at the regular gui login.\n\n\nOriginal\nGenerally when this is the case the defaults are \"ubuntu\" and a blank password.

If you're familiar with gparted it should pe pretty straight forward.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up a live version of the OS (presumably the USB or DVD you used to install). This is so that neither of you drives are mounted while you move things around.\n\n*You could re-size the partition which shouldn't be necessary since you're moving up in drive capacity.\n\n*Copy your partition over. This should use the same UUID for the copied partition. If you're wanting boot from both the old copy of the drive and the new one going forward then we can edit the fstab file. But we can burn that bridge when we come to it\n\n*Install grub on the new drive.\nAfter that you should be set. However it would be prudent to save the original copy for a bit; there's always risk when doing this for the first time.\n", "Q: Issues connecting to Mobile Broadband - Ubuntu 14.10, Pantech UML290-VW I have been successful in connecting to the Internet using a Pantech UML290-VW using the Mobile Broadband setup wizard (vzwinternet) in Ubuntu 14.10.

Anytime I try to play a video on YouTube (or an embedded YouTube video on another site) my browser becomes unstable.  The video is jumpy, going full screen to window takes a while and changing/closing the tab or pausing the video can sometimes take over a minute.  This seems to be a recent issue with Firefox 35.

For some reason Firebug or the Web Developer extension seemed to be causing the issue.  I disabled both of those and now things work fine.\n\nA: Youtube use HTML5 now, so the control (play, stop, volume) is in ECMAscript.

I first tried to download 10.04 via the Internet but the install crapped out half way through. I have now tried three times to install 10.04 from a Live USB stick and the installation completes perfectly well but upon restart when I remove the usb stick the machine will not reboot. 10.04 runs fine in \"try\" mode but simply will not reboot. I think I unwittingly installed two instances of 10.04 so perhaps that explains why it won't reboot?\nMy environment is an older dual Opteron processor on a  Tyan S2882G3NR-D motherboard with an Adaptec Raid controller with I think 3 hard drives. The machine was always a single boot Ubuntu 8.04 distro and worked well until I tried the online download package upgrade. Under 8.04 the machine first booted the RAID Controller and then it loaded Grub to boot Linux. With the 10.04 installed the RAID boots fine but then hangs when trying to load/boot 10.04.

MAAS normally authenticates API requests through OAuth, not HTTP Basic Authentication which is what curl -u uses by default for web URLs.\nLuckily, MAAS also provides a Python client library called apiclient which is included in the python-maas-client package. Using that library would allow you to trivially issue the query with an apikey, which you can get from http://$MAAS_URL/MAAS/account/prefs/. Assuming you have APIKEY and MAAS_URL, the below snippet demonstrates how you'd fetch the listing:\nAPIKEY = \"foo:bar:baz\"\nMAAS_URL = \"http://my.maas.host/MAAS/api/1.0\"\n\nfrom apiclient import maas_client\nauth = maas_client.MAASOAuth(*APIKEY.split(\":\"))\nclient = maas_client.MAASClient(auth, maas_client.MAASDispatcher(), MAAS_URL)\nprint client.get(u\"nodes/\", \"list\").read()\n\nIncidentally, AIUI curl -X GET is the query type curl issues by default.\n[*] I believe marking the path as unicode should not be necessary, but there's an assertion in the code that may be a bug.

Re-installation of wine-staging-i386 package fixed the problem:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall wine-staging-i386\n\n\nA: If you're running Ubuntu 64 bit then the problem is likely due to the fact that \"wine-staging-amd64\" depends on \"wine-staging-i386\" which is a virtual package and not actually installable.  From what I can deduce from reading about this here \"the cache has no package\" error when wine update is available is that the build environment or updater isn't dealing with the multiarch nature of this \"wine\" install.\nIf you're not using the pipelight experimental 64bit flash or unity3d plugins and don't require the 64bit version of \"wine-staging\" for anything else, then you could always remove \"wine-staging-amd64\" and it's dependencies.  If this is what you want to do then make sure to disable any 64 bit plugins you have enabled/loaded in pipelight first as follows:\npipelight-plugin --disable x64-flash\n\nand/or\npipelight-plugin --disable x64-unity3d\n\nNote: You may need to use \"sudo\" at the start of those if you installed the 64 bit plugins for all users.\nThen proceed with uninstalling the 64 bit version of \"wine-staging\" as follows:\nsudo aptitude -V purge wine-staging wine-staging-amd64 wine-staging:i386+\n\nThis will uninstall \"wine-staging\" (64 bit) dependancy package and \"wine-staging-amd64\" (64 bit) and install \"wine-staging:i386\" (32 bit) dependancy package.\nThe 32 bit package depends on only 32 bit so don't have a problem as far as I can tell so far.\nNote: YMMV ;)\n\nA: I also keep getting the Unknown error: '<class 'KeyError'>' (“The cache has no package named wine-staging-i386”)\nI have tried other solutions including those shown here:\nHow can I resolve repeated package dependency error involving ' wine-staging-i386 '.\nThey suggested doing a sudo apt-get update as well as the same solution listed above sudo apt-get install --reinstall wine-staging-i386.\nThe one that works for me to remove the annoying warning is to use Y-PPA Manager and under 'Advanced' click on 'Try to import all missing GPG keys'.

At least I Could with Windows.Is there a solution to this problem. Keep in mind I am not a programmer and very new to Ubuntu. Otherwise I am very happy with Ubuntu.\n\nA: Seems like you don't have flash installed or just need a later version.\nYou can install flash by opening the Ubuntu Software Center (on the launcher to the left and looks like a shopping bag) , search for \"flash\" then install the \"Adobe Flash plug-in\". Once you have installed the plugin restart your browser and flash applications should be working fine.\nYou can also use Google Chrome/ium for browsing (both come with flash in it). You can install Chromium from the Ubuntu Software Center or you can download Chrome here, double click the .deb file when its downloaded and then it will install itself through the software center.\nHope this has helped you.\n\nA: As Adobe Flash Player states only Chrome and Chromium browsers support verions of flash later than 11.2. So I guess you'll have to install Chrome or Chromium.\nI am using Chromium 39 from the standard repositories plus the pepperflashplugin.\nStart the Ubuntu Software Centre and search for \"Chromium Web Browser\", click the result to select it and click install.\nFurthermore search for \"pepper flash\" and install the \"Pepper Flash Player - browser plugin\".\nI hope this helps.\nCheers\n\nA: An alternative to Chrom(e/ium) with Pepper Flash is to use the Windows Flash plugin under a special edition of Wine (which stays separate from any other Wine you might have installed) via a package called Pipelight.  I've got this installed on two Kubuntu 14.04 systems and it works very well -- and supports many more plugins than just Flash.  It works with Mozilla browsers (Firefox, SeaMonkey, IceApe, IceWeasel), since Chrome doesn't need it.\nIf you don't find Pipelight in the Ubuntu repositories, Google for it; it has its own repository hosted by the developers and once you enable that, installs just like any other Debian/Ubuntu package (after which you need to issue a few commands from terminal, one-time).\n", "Q: Hanvon Tablet won't work I am trying to use the MYPaint program on a Hanvon Artmaster AM0605 tablet.

Is that possible?\n**For example, I have windows and I have my programs installed on a different hard-drive so If I'd be able to use most those programs on win7 or 10 if I had those on a different partitions.\n\nA: If you install your programs \"manually\" (compiling them from source code, or downloading their binary distribution) simply leave them on a separate hard drive or partition as you do in windows, mount this partition to some specific path in your system (for example I usually have some subfolders in /mnt to mount external partitions) and add it to your PATH environment variable.\n\nA: I think this is infeasible if not outright impossible, for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Different distributions have different package managers. That means if you install a package from both of your OSes, you can get either two binaries in different folders (which defeats both your objective to save space and to have the same program on both), or one of the binaries overwriting the other. Binary packages are often built with different options for different distributions; this rarely causes problems but if it does you will not have any idea how to fix it or even what causes it.\n\n*In Ubuntu, the packages have the locations for their files hard-coded in them. Putting them to different folders is possible, but you have to manually disassemble the package and copy the files where you wish. Some packages require multiple dependencies to be installed simultaneuously so the task can also get quite tedious. And even then, most programs look for their dependencies where they belong, and if you installed them into an alternate directory these programs will not run. You could circumvent this problem by softlinking the directories, though.\n\n*You will have configuration and permission problems. Your user(s) will not necessarily have the same user ID on both OSes, and one system will expect some package files' permissions to be different than the other. Configuration file locations and even syntax can differ between distributions, causing you further headache. Also there are a lot more tiny differences that can break compatibility and are difficult or impossible to fix.\n\n\nThat being said, if you use a few pieces of software that are distribution-insensitive and not available from the package managers (for example games for Linux) and you use them on both distributions, you can install it on one partition and use it from both.\n", "Q: Bridge interface does not get IP address after reboot I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS.\nI'm using kvm and added a bridge interface to be able to connect from VM to outside internet.\nThese are the steps I followed to do that.\nifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0\nbrctl addbr br0\nbrctl addif br0 eth0\ndhclient br0\n\nAnd edited /etc/network/interfaces\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\nauto br0\niface br0 inet dhcp\n bridge_ports eth0\n bridge_stp on\n bridge_fd 0\n bridge_maxwait 0\n\nNow I had to edit this file because, without that, my vm manager does not recognize br0 interface.\nNow the problem is, if I reboot my machine with these changes intact, it throws a message, \"Waiting for network configuration\"  and takes a long time to boot.\nAnd after coming up, none of the interfaces have IP adresses, and I dont see the network button on the top-left corner of my desktop. But thing is, br0 interface gets IP address after a while (sometimes) without my intervention.\nI'm completely confused. Any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong would be very helpful. Thanks.\n\nA: ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 is basically \"use DHCP\", whereas iface eth0 inet manual is \"use static IP\" (but none is set).  Both are mutually exclusive, so removing the latter solved your problem.\n", "Q: No Jar files included in .deb file I have created a debian source package for my java swing app that has .jar file and two lib/jar files. Three files (.dsc, .orig.tar.xz, debian.tar.gz) were generated as part of the debian source package. When I create the .deb file using: \ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b\n\nit gives the following error in install file:\ncp: cannot stat debian/tmp/abc-1.0/xyz.jar: No such file or directory dh_install: cp -a debian/tmp/abc-1.0/abc.jar debian/aspose/aspose-1.0/ returned code 1 make dpkg-buildpackage: error: fakeroot debian/rules binary gave error status 2\nContents of install file:\naspose-1.0/Aspose.Examples.Launcher.jar \naspose-1.0/lib/jsch-0.1.27.jar \naspose-1.0/lib/org.eclipse.jgit-2.2.0.201212191850-r.jar \n\nFollowing are the contents of my rules file:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n# -*- makefile -*-\n\n# Uncomment this to turn on verbose mode.\n#export DH_VERBOSE=1\n\n%:\n    dh $@ \n\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: Ok，I think that you have not created debian folder.  The files which are install, rules and so on in debian folder are very important for creating deb package. So you should read debian official manual to learn how to do it.  As you said, you should generate a install file for installing .jar file.  Good luck.\n", "Q: Difference between ls -l and ll? I'm relatively new to programming as a whole and some tutorials have been telling me to use ls -l to look at files in a directory and others have been saying ll. I know that ls is a short list, but is there a difference between the other two?\n\nA: ll is a common alias for ls -l. It is a part of the default .bashrc, with a couple more options:\n$ grep 'alias ll' /etc/skel/.bashrc\nalias ll='ls -alF'\n\n\nA: This is located in your .bashrc:\nalias ll='ls -al'\n\nBy taking a look at the manual pages for the command ls, you can see what those two attributes accomplish together:\n\n\n*\n\n*-a: do not ignore entries starting with ..\n\n*-l: use a long listing format.\n\n\nSo you can understand that ls -l would ignore any entry starting with .. That's their only difference.\nEDIT:\nLet me note, that, as commented, the ll alias differs from installation to installation. In case you are wondering what's yours, please open up a terminal and enter: \nalias ll\n\nThis will show you how ll is set. You can then look up the additional attributes by typing:\nman ls\n\n", "Q: Change logging directory/file for an Upstart service I have an upstart service that it fills up the space. I need to move the logs from /var/log/upstart to a different directory /pub/data/logs/order_server. I tried to do it using \nconsole log --logdir /pub/data/logs/order_server\n\nbut it gives an error\nstart: Unknown job: order_server\n\nchecking the file\n$ init-checkconf /etc/init/order_server.conf\nERROR: failed to ask Upstart to check conf file\n\nThe story is similar to this one. I ended up doing the hack exec /path/to/my/daemon --arg1 --arg2 >/mnt/log/XYZ 2>&1 as someone suggested. \nThe following is the service conf file\n# Ubuntu upstart file at /etc/init/order_server.conf\ndescription \"order server dev version\"\n\n\n\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up)\nstop on runlevel [06]\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 10 5\n\nexec /pub/integration_prod/integration/order_server.sh >> /pub/data/logs/order_server/order_server.log 2>&1\n\nNow the log file location is changed to the new location but getting it difficult to rotate the logs. The log file gets zipped up but a new log file is not created. \nthe upstart rotation looks something like this\n/var/log/upstart/*.log /pub/data/logs/order_server/order_server.log {\n        daily\n        missingok\n        rotate 3\n        compress\n        notifempty\n        nocreate\n}\n\nMy initial intention is to fix it by using the console log option as suggested here. I hope someone can help. \n\nA: The cookbook says --logdir is a command-line option, which means it's not an option that goes into an upstart job file, but on the command-line of Upstart itself. You can verify this in the init(8) manual page, cf. http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/init.8.html\n   --logdir directory\n          Write   job   output   log  files  to  a  directory  other  than\n          /var/log/upstart.\n\nIn other words, it's a global option, not a per-job option.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server permission troubles I am currently having some permission troubles on a Ubuntu server, the problem I am currently having is allowing other users to edit and save files created by myself or for me to edit and save files created by other users.\nWould it be possible to;\n\n\n*\n\n*Add users to a group\n\n*Give each user the same permissions\n\n*Allow each user to edit and save the other users files\n\n\nIn this instance I'm not sure what is best practice and whats best for security measures.\n\nA: While not a direct answer to the problem, this might be worth considering.\nIf you have multiple people in a position where they can all edit the same files, it's only a matter of time before you clash and overwrite the wrong stuff, delete something somebody was working on.\nI would strongly recommend moving the editing side of things to git. Everybody checks-out a copy of the data and commit back their changes. Merges detect conflicts and you can take sensible, conscious actions to remedy them. Then, on the server —if we assume this is something that is running, like a website—  checkout from the git repo under a single user.\nYou can work on scripting this with hooks and things like Fabric. Automating it opens the door to other nice things like testing and coverage testing; techniques and habits that help you avoid pushing bad code onto a server.\n", "Q: How to blacklist zfs kernel module during boot? How to disable ZFS kernel-module before boot in grub?\nIt is mentioned that some modules can be disabled through grub command line in similar question. Unfortunately this method is not working with zfs:\nmodule_to_blacklist.blacklist=yes\n\nWith next message: unknown parameter 'blacklist' ignored\n\nA: If I'm correct that you installed ZFS via dkms then it looks like you need to remove it via the same tool.\ndkms remove [module/module-version] [-k kernel/arch] [--all]\n       Removes a module/version or module/version/kernel/arch  combination\n       from  the  tree.   If  the  module is currently installed, it first\n       uninstalls  it  and  if  applicable,  will  replace  it  with   its\n       original_module.   Use  the  --all  option  in  order to remove all\n       instances for every kernel at once.\n\nSource: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/dkms.8.html\nNote: You might wish to avoid using the --all option until you are certain that you have obtained the desired results.\n\nA: I'm running into this issue because I want to boot a recent Ubuntu Live CD such that the kernel is not tainted. However the ZFS modules taint the kernel.\nTLDR; Booting with the kernel parameter systemd.mask=zfs.target allowed booting without loading the zfs modules automatically.\nIn investigating this I found 3 places where the zfs module could get loaded.\n\n*\n\n*Initrd\n\n*\n\n*The file /scripts/zfs tries to load the module in load_module_initrd, but this only gets called if there is a kernel parameter boot=zfs\n\n\n\n*init.d\n\n*\n\n*The script /etc/init.d/zfs-import will load the module when started, but this init script is by default only started at run levels S (single user mode), so not normally.\n\n\n\n*systemd\n\n*\n\n*The target zfs.target, which is started by the multi-user.target, will load the modules via the zfs-load-module.service. This can be disabled with the kernel boot parameter systemd.mask=zfs.target\n", "Q: Why does chrome use excessive amounts of CPU?

Initially, I build a simple driver and application. The thing which I notice are that every time when I inserts my module, kernel assign a major number 250. I wants to know why always it assigns 250 ?? Other thing that I wants to know that I have generated my device file using command \"mknod\". What about if I want a create a permanent device file in my device memory that remains in it even after shutdown?\nAny idea would be really appreciated.\n\nA: 250 is taken by default, when you have not specified the Major number while registering the device or while creating the node (mknod).\nFor Ex: To register a Character device driver, the function syntax is\nregister_chrdev(Major Number, Name of the driver, File operations);\n\nThis has to be done in module_init calling function. \nTo create a node, after you load that module is\nsudo mknod -m 666 /dev/char_driver c 240 0\n\nHere, \n\n\n*\n\n*666 - permission \n\n*char_driver - name of the driver (can be of any name)\n\n*c - Says that its a character driver\n\n*240 - Major number (same as if in register_chrdev)\n\n*0 - Minor number.\n\n\nThis should probably work.\n", "Q: How can I prevent people to see what application(s) I have opened? I don't want people to see what applications I have opened. I would like to be able to instantly hide the windows with a shortcut key combination, so I can save my work afterwards. I also want to hide their presence in the Launcher. \nI tried to duckduckgo it but did not find any solution.\n\nA: IMPORTANT EDIT\nWith the commands:\nxdotool windowunmap <window_id>\n\nand\nxdotool windowmap <window_id>\n\nit turns out there is a way to completely mask the presence of application windows temporarily. Even the wmctrl -l command will not list the windows any more.\nI will post the new answer below and leave the first answer as a second option.\n\nNew answer:\nHiding windows and the applications they belong to\nWith the script below, you can completely hide (unmap) application windows from your desktop. Their presence will not be visible at all, since their Launcher icons will not show an arrow as well.\nHow to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs both wmctrl and xdotool to get the window properties, the pid they belong to and to manage the windows of selected applications:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file\n\n*In the head section of the script, list the applications you'd like to (be able to) quickly hide the windows of. Use the format:\napplications = [\"firefox\", \"gedit\"]\n\n\n*Save it as hide_windows.py\n\n*Make the script run from a shortut key: Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/hide_windows.py\n\n\n*Now if you press the key combination once, the windows of defined applications will be completely hidden, their launcher icon will not show the application runs.\n\n*Press again and all windows will appear again.\n\n\nThe script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport getpass\nimport os\n\n#---\napplications = [\"chrome\", \"firefox\", \"gedit\"]\n#---\n\nwindowlist = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/\"+\".windowlist.txt\"\nuser = getpass.getuser()\n\nget = lambda x: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", x]).decode(\"utf-8\")\nwlist = [l for l in get(\"wmctrl -lp\").splitlines()]\nprocs = sum([[p.split()[0] for p in get(\"ps -u \"+user).splitlines() if app in p] for app in applications], [])\nmatches = sum([[l.split()[0] for l in wlist if p in l] for p in procs], [])\n\nif len(matches) != 0:\n    with open(windowlist, \"wt\") as out:\n        for match in matches:\n            out.write(match+\"\\n\")\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"xdotool windowunmap \"+match])\nelse:\n    try:\n        with open(windowlist) as r:\n            for l in r.readlines():\n                subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"xdotool windowmap \"+l])\n        os.remove(windowlist)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        pass\n\nHow it works\nWhen called, the script lists all windows from the applications, set in the head of the script. Subsequently, it does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*It writes the window id of the windows to a hidden file (to be able to remap the windows, since they even disappear from the output of wmctrl -l)\n\n\n*It unmaps the windows\n\n*When called again, the script will not find any windows to unmap, it will read the file with window ids and restore the windows.\n\n\n\n\nFirst answer:\n(Perfectly working, but another approach and a bit more work)\nHiding opened applications from the Launcher?\nI doubt if it is possible to completely erase all traces of an application in Unity and the Launcher. At least not by means of simple modifications, since the Launcher is designed to show a representation of GUI applications.\nIf your goal is however to prevent people to see what applications you have currently open, that can be done by simple modifications.\nA combination of two things that can easily be done\nThe solution I would suggest exists of two measures:\n\n\n*\n\n*A misleading represenation of the application in the launcher\nMy altered representation of Firefox in the launcher:\n\nYou can simply change both the appearing name and the icon to anything you like.\n\n*A key shortcut to instantly hide the windows of defined application(s).\nThis can be a large number of windows, they will be all minimized in one action (key combination)\nCombined, these two measures should do what you want: prevent people to recognize what applications you are running.\nHow to set up\n1. A misleading represenation of the application in the launcher\n(I'll use the example of Firefox)\nChanging the appearing name:\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications are represented by .desktop files in /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications.\nWe need to edit a local copy of the firefox.desktop file, so first copy it:\ncp /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/firefox.desktop\n\n\n*Open the file in gedit (drag the file over an opened gedit window or run:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/firefox.desktop\n\n\n*Now we are going to change the name of Firefox, as it appears in the Launcher:\nRight below the first two lines, you will see an impressive list of localized names. Look for the language tag, corresponding to the language of your system. I am Dutch, so I have to change the name in the line:\nName[nl]=Firefox webbrowser\n\nand I change it into:\nName[nl]=Monkey eats banana\n\nChanging the appearing icon:\n\n*While the .desktop file is still open, Look for the line:\nIcon=firefox\n\nReplace it by:\nIcon=/path/to/icon.png\n\n(If you replace it by your own custom icon, you will probably need to use the absolute path to the icon.)\nAfter you log out/in, Firefox will appear as \"Monkey eats banana\" in both the Launcher and Dash, but you will still find it as firefox as well:\n\n2. A key shortcut combination to hide the windows of defined application(s)\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs both wmctrl and xdotool to get the window properties, the pid they belong to and to manage the windows of selected applications:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file\n\n*In the head section of the script, list the applications you'd like to (be able to) quickly hide the windows of.

And I wanted to know if I could remotely disconnect other users of the network from my computer. I can see all users connected by executing smbtree.\nSo if I could just target one or more computers and do something like ipconfig -f wlan0 DOWN or something to disconnect the target.\n\nA: Sure but you need an amount of access:\n\n\n*\n\n*Physical: Walk over to the computer and unplug its ethernet cable, remove its wireless card, turn it off, throw it into the fires of Mount Doom, etc...\n\n*Remote access: Get the IP via nmblookup, ssh in with credentials that have  access to run ifconfig. If it's a Windows computer, you can do similar things with WinRS.\n\n*Central: Log into your router/switch, check the connected hardware MACs, block their MAC address.\n\n*Social: Ask them to disconnect.\n\n\nBut if you're just trying to grief somebody on a network or computer that isn't yours, go and find something better to do. This sort of misuse is a criminal offence in many countries; you can go to jail for it.\n", "Q: Disable mouse move without disabling click and scroll?

My audio output socket is damaged, but Ubuntu's older version was kind enough to let me plug earphones and use them anyway (windows wasn't as 'nice').\nI didn't update for a while since I feared that would change. But I finally gave in and updated my release. Now my earphones won't output any sound any more which is frustrating.\nIs there a way I can replace my current sound drivers with old ones? Or at least other ones that might do the same trick?\nI don't really remember which release I used. It was the newest one about two-three years ago.\n\nA: The best way to know which version works for you is to create a LiveUSB. Things you will need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an old Ubuntu images (ISO file) from http://releases.ubuntu.com/\nGo for something like ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n\n*Create a LiveUSB for it, insert a USB, search \"Startup Disk\" in your dash, and select the ISO file for it, detailed instructions could be found here: How to create a bootable USB stick\non Ubuntu\n\n*Once you have it ready, boot the system from the USB that you just created, and select \"Try Ubuntu without installation\".\nI would recommend you to give Precise 12.04 a try (12.04 or 12.04.1, not 12.04.2 ~ 12.04.5). Since it's released in 2012, and it runs on 3.2 LTS kernel, which means that it will be maintained till 2017.\nFor other releases in-between 12.04 and 14.04, you still could give them a try, but note that some of them are not supported anymore.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Install GPIO ports drivers for 12.04 on 14.04 I bought an embedded, fanless PC for work, which should run on Ubuntu 14.04. This PC has  some direct GPIO ports as well, which came with a driver distributed from the OEM. But the driver is only compatible with 12.04.\nCan anybody help me, how to convert it, so it will be compatible with 14.04?\n\nA: The driver uses the asm/system.h header, which was removed from the kernel in version 3.4. So it will not compile as is with newer kernels. However after changing this header file, I managed to compile it.\nBefore you start\nYou will need to install the necessary build tools for the later steps:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nModifying the mxe5400_wdt.c file\nYou need the change only line 47 in /drvsrc/mxe5400_wdt.c\nBEFORE: #include <asm/system.h>\nAFTER: #include <asm/switch_to.h>\nThe original readme file\nThe package contains a Readme file, which tells you what you need:\n1.Close Ubuntu WatchDog\n    (1). cd /drvsrc\n    (2). cp -f mei.conf /etc/modprobe.d/\n    (3).

So when I plug in the Ethernet cable it connects to one of the 10 fixed IP configurations I have instead of DHCP like it did last time.\nWhen I come home it often doesn't automatically connect to my home WiFi, but to some WiFi with the same name like one I configured years ago and haven't really used in ages.\nHow can I fix this to get the old behaviour back?\nEdit: This is my expected behaviour and how I remember before the update:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"MyHomeNetwork\" is the one I last connected to 1 day ago\n\n*\"dlink\" I connected to last 5 months ago and might do so again in the future\n\n*I can see a \"dlink\" network in my neighbourhood besides the \"MyHomeNetwork\"\n\n*I want NetworkManager to connect to \"MyHomeNetwork\" because it was the most recently active one\n\n\nA: Having several wireless SSIDs with the same name is fairly common in University dorms and other living arrangements where wifi is provided as part of the rent or lease. The first step I suggest is to check here from the terminal:\nls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\n\nYou will see connection information for many previous networks; for example:  \n\nGBR1   USRP CMC-guest MAHB motel-guest\n\nYou may remove any that you are certain you will not be using in the future:\nsudo rm -rf /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/MAHB\n\nNext, if you have two wireless access points with the same name, I suggest you bind to the preferred network as in this answer: Ubuntu connect drops. Worked for a while then started dropping again\nFor the connections that you want to remember but not connect to:\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/NameOfNetwork\n\nand set autoconnect=true to autoconnect=false\n\nA: First of all, open \"Edit Network Connections\" dialogue or call it through terminal with nm-connection-editor. Then open the dlink connection, and under General, uncheck \" Automatically connect to this network \"\nWhat else you could do is edit the /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file, by adding no-auto-default=* , which should prevent Network Manager creating a default wired connection. \nAlso, don't forget that changes take effect upon restarting network manager with sudo service network-manager restart\n", "Q: Why do received emails not display in Thunderbird? Environment: Thunderbird 31.4.0 on Ubuntu 14.04/14.10\nSymptoms: Emails from Yahoo Mail are received, but do not appear in the preview and do not appear when double-clicked upon to open up a fresh tab.\nExample: An email arrives.

The preview pane looks like:\n\nDouble-clicking on the line also does not change the read state, and the Conversation Reader tab that opens up looks like:\n\nRight-clicking on the line and choosing Mark > As Read will mark it as read, though this does not affect my ability to read the messages. \nWhat Is Unaffected:\n\n\n*\n\n*My RSS feeds behave normally\n\n*Calendar behaves normally\n\n*Print Preview of an email message works, so the email bodies are definitely being downloaded.\n\n\nWhen This Happened: It started about two weeks ago. I seem to recall getting an Thunderbird update, which would have been to 31.4.0, right before this started.\nAttempts at Mitigation:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have upgraded Ubuntu to 14.10, with no effect\n\n*I have moved my ~/.thunderbird directory to a temporary location, uninstalled Thunderbird, reinstalled Thunderbird, and moved my original ~/.thunderbird directory back to its original location, with no effect\n\n*I followed the \"Rebuilding the Global Database\" instructions, with no effect.\n\n\nAny suggestions on how I can get Thunderbird to allow me to read my emails again?\n\nA: Solution: Look at Tools > Add-Ons and see if you have upgrades that are needed. In my case, Thunderbird Conversations had an upgrade that, for whatever reason, was not automatically applied when the main Thunderbird was updated (I thought they fixed that...). Upgrading the extensions cleared up the problem.\n\nA: Be sure that you are not filtering messages. See the upper left of the inBox screen. Same thing happened to me. I disabled all add-ons. Didn't help. Saw the filters were on. Clicked them off and now I see all my messages.\n", "Q: Is there anything that can let me run 64bit binary executable files?

Try a Live CD or USB with a 64-bit version of the OS (assuming your hardware is 64-bit capable, but it most likely is unless it's old or a low-end netbook).\n\nA: If and only if your CPU is capable of hardware virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V) you can execute a 64-bit application in a virtual 64-bit OS running in a virtual machine such as Virtual Box. Of course this may not be the lightweight solution you need.\n\nA: It depends on your CPU architecture. If you have a 32 bit CPU, no piece of software is going to allow you to run 64 bit applications because the CPU itself is incapable of running the software. \nIf you have a 64 bit CPU you are able to run 32 & 64 bit Ubuntu - but only 64 bit Ubuntu can run 64 bit software (AFAIK - I'll keep looking around a bit more). You can also run 32 bit software within 64 bit Ubuntu - it'll just require some of the 32 bit libraries.\nOne way you can tell if you've got a 32 bit or 64 bit CPU is by running grep --color=always -iw lm /proc/cpuinfo in Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T). If it returns lm (Long Mode) as one of the flags, you've got a 64 bit CPU. \ncc Community Wiki.\nYou can see in this screenshot of my terminal on my laptop with a 32 bit CPU that nothing is returned for that command:\n\nFor a more in depth explanation of the difference between 32 and 64 bit software and Ubuntu, read this Ubuntu Community Help Wiki page.\n", "Q: SD card reader detected but SD storage not shown I have a a multi card reader.

I use 14.04 and I have 2 physical partitions, one of 243Gb and another of rest of 500Gb.\nI want to format the partition of 243Gb using Disks (Open dash and type disks). This partition contains another Ubuntu OS but its damaged so I want to format that partition.\n\nIn Disks s/w when I click on more options it shows me one option to format. But when I click it it pops another window.\n\nand here I'm confused.\nWhat are these three options?\n1. Erase has 2 options\n1. Don't overwrite existing data (quick)\n2. Overwrite existing data with zeros (slow)\n\nWhat should I choose here 1st or 2nd? If I choose 2nd option, what data will be overwritten? Will it format partition of 243Gb and merge it with my another physical partition?\n2. Type shows me various file system options\nWhat should I choose ext4 or ntfs or fat?\n3. And what is the last Names?\n\nA: Firstly, the \"partition merging\" question you ask.  There is no \"merging\" of partitions - the actual 'merging' involves deleting a partition completely and then manually expanding the partition (in layman's terms).  Because there is no 'merging' of partitions, your question on it is going to be answered with a \"No, there will be no merging of partitions\".  I do not reference merging later on in this question because there is no real 'merging' of partitions.\nAs well, in the original quesiton, you actually have only two physical partitions: the 234GB one, and the \"Extended Partition\" - inside the \"Extended Partition\", the partitions are logical, not physical.\nIf you want to expand an existing partition, then you have to have free disk space adjacent to the partition you want to expand on the disk.  You would have to delete the existing partition, and either expand your \"Extended Partition\" to take up the free space (then move the partitions around inside the extended partition in order to resize whichever of the partitions you want to expand).\n\nThe breakdown of what is what on that window is as follows:\n(1) Erase - This is just deciding how you want to format.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quick just nukes the beginning part of the partition which defines what is where on the disk, but leaves the actual content of the rest of the data in the partition intact.  If you forensically examine the disk data with a hex editor, and the right tools, the data can be retrieved fairly easily unless data has started to write to the partition.  (Then, most can be recovered, depending on how much data has been overwritten).\n\n*\n\n*Use this if you do not believe the disk has bad sectors.\n\n\n*If you use the slow method, it fills the 243GB partition completely with zeros (at the byte level) before creating a new partition.  Done correctly this can literally destroy the data that was in the partition.  (This is effectively how brand new hard drives come - completely filled with zeros, except perhaps for the boot record section, which is not relevant to this question)\n\n*\n\n*Use this option if you believe the disk has bad sectors and is the cause of the damaged Ubuntu installation.\n\n\n\n(2) Type is the filesystem you want.  Choose this based on compatibility with other OSes if you have more than just Linux on your system.  If this is an Ubuntu only install then use either ext4 or fat32 depending on your needs (which is based on the size of the files you're storing there).  (NOTE: These descriptions are better worded in the window on the 14.04+ version of the 'Disks' utility)\n\n\n*\n\n*ext4 is Linux compatible, and prevents Windows/Mac compatibility (for the most part).\n\n*ntfs is Windows and Linux compatible (but does not work nicely with Macs).  If you need a lot of data storage and Windows compatibility, use ntfs\n\n*fat  is actually fat32 format.  This format is compatible everywhere on most every device, but only supports files up to  4GB in size.  fat32 is also able to support partitions up to 32GB in size, but any larger will not be supported.\n\n\n(3) Name is just the label on the disk.  Name it whatever you want but keep it relatively short (9 - 10 characters at most).  (This is how you can name Flash Drives - by applying a short label to the disk.  Same applies to actual hard drives too.  It's mainly just for show or to give you a description of what the disk is for.)\n", "Q: RXTX Library Ubuntu 14.04 Soft link to see the serial port I have installed the RXTX Java library rxtx-2.1-7-bins-r2 in Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit machine with JDK8.

It still requires a mapping of directories between the extracted archive and the virtualenv.\n\nA: All that is needed for a virtualenv is the presence of the package files in the subtree of your virtualenv. So as long as you can determine which files got installed into the system Python via apt-get, you can copy those into your virtualenv. This includes files in the site packages directory as well as in other places within your Python subtree (e.g. scripts).\nHypothetical example:\nsudo apt-get python-xyz\n\nAssume it installs a package named \"xyz\" into your system Python 2.7, you may get this:\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xyz/\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xyz-1.2.3.egg-info\n\nCopy the files related to the \"xyz\" package to your virtualenv (assuming a virtualenv /home/user/.virtualenvs/py27):\n/home/user/.virtualenvs/py27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/xzy/\n/home/user/.virtualenvs/py27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/xzy-1.2.3.egg-info\n\nThe difficulty is (1) in determining which files belong to a particular package, and (2) in mapping corresponding subdirectories between the system Python and the virtualenv (e.g. dist-packages vs. site-packages in the example above).\nIf anyone has more experience with this, please comment.\n", "Q: Where is Ubuntu terminal located?

I've read through all of the posts I can find that are relevant but it seems like I'm already doing all of the suggestions.  I'm not sure what I'm missing.\nI'm running apache2 on Ubuntu 12.04. I have a group of directories (and the files within) that are owned by the www-data user. The www-data group has write permissions on the directories and files that I'm trying to write to.\ntestuser is a member of the www-data group. I get a permissions error when I try to sftp into any of these directories as testuser.\nIf I change ownership of these dirs & files to testuser, then I can ftp into them.\nHow should the permissions be set so that a group member can ftp into the directory and write to it?  I'd like to create a guest ftp account and add that to the group as well but I need to get it working for testuser first.\nI added myself to www-data /etc/groups manually. I also restarted apache & when that didn't work, rebooted from the command line. What am I missing?\nwrite_enable=YES in my vsftpd.conf\nchroot_local_user is commented out.  No chroot'ing is happening.\n\nA: Note that despite the name, vsftpd is NOT an SFTP server, it's a plain old FTP protocol server. SFTP is usually handled by the ssh daemon. So any config changes you do in vsftpd will not affect SFTP transfers. \nThe file will be owned by whoever uploaded the file. You may want to check your SFTP client's options for ownership and permission preservation (WinSCP in your case).\n(btw I'm just reformatting the comments as an answer).\n\nA: In my case, setting the target user group as primary one for ftp user helped.\nsudo usermod -g <group> <ftp_user>\n\n", "Q: Random wireless disconnects, can anyone spot a problem in these logs?

Giving 0755 doesn't seems to work.\nIs there any difference between those two?\nAnd how to give rwxr-xr-x permission with umask in fstab?\n\nA: You can think of umask as somewhat opposite to permission.\nBy default Ubuntu uses the base permission of 777 for a directory and 666 for a file. By deducting the umask value from the base permission you get the applied permission of a newly created file/directory.\nIn your case, you have given the umask as 755. Now as the base permission for directories is always 777, what the applied permission we get:\n777 - 755 = 022 i.e. ----w--w-\nTo get your desired permission (755), you need to put the umask as 022.\n\nA: You can also use umask for user as umask u=rwx accordingly for group and other, in case you want to use umask and not chmod.\n", "Q: install avr-libc I'm using Avr controller for programming into Ubuntu, for that I'm installing library using following command, which gives error\n\nasphalak@asphalak-HP-Pavilion-11-x360-PC:~$ sudo aptitude  install\n  avr‐libc\nCouldn't find any package whose name or description matched \"avr‐libc\"\nCouldn't find any package whose name or description matched \"avr‐libc\"\nNo packages will be installed, upgraded, or removed.\n0 packages upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not\n  upgraded.\nNeed to get 0 B of archives.

Where is the source code located? For C++ how would one go about recompiling the source code?\nThank you.\n\nA: Since Ubuntu is primarily a binary package based distribution, the source code isn't \"located\" anywhere on your system unless you explicitly download it; either:\n\n\n*\n\n*by enabling the appropriate source repositories, and then using apt-get source e.g.\napt-get source opencv\n\nNote that this will download the source into the current directory - hence does not need sudo if you are downloading into a location within your home directory. It should also apply any relevant Ubuntu-specific patches such that the built code is equivalent to that of the corresponding binary package.\n\n*by  downloading a source tarball or checking out from the maintainer's git (or similar) source code repository. \nNote that this may get you a more up-to-date version of the software;  however it also won't necessarily have been tested or patched for your current system.\n\n\nIn either case, you will likely need to install additional build dependencies before you are able to recompile the package from source, regardless  of any changes you may have made to it.\n", "Q: Upgrading LTS server using do-release-upgrade fails (could not download all upgrades) I've been trying to upgrade two servers from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS for a few days now using do-release-upgrade.

First, you add an LSB header to your script that defines the runlevel settings you want to use and then put an executable version of the script in /etc/init.d.  After doing this, you can use the update-rc.d command to add the script to your desired runlevels.  Make sure that the settings you use with the LSB header and update-rc.d match or things will explode. \n", "Q: Cloning XBox360 with dd I see a couple of tutorials here on using dd, but I wanted to ask to make 100% sure.\nCan I clone my XBox360 hdd over to a larger hdd using dd? I just dont want to lose my current data thats there. Also, is it really as simple as\ndd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc\n\nIf it matters, Im running Lubuntu 14.04 64bit\n\nA: That depends. If you have two original Xbox 360 drives you can clone one to the other and everything should work just fine.\nUsing a regular 2,5\" drive in an Xbox 360 does not work. Unless you have a drive that can be \"hacked\", e.g. you copy the \"security sector\" with a DOS tool onto the drive's firmware so that the Xbox 360 detects it as a legit drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*No, this is not about modifying the Xbox firmware for warezing games (you're console might not get banned, but it's possible).\n\n*Yes you need a DOS boot disk/drive and a machine that boots legacy. Try to avoid FreeDOS if you're unsure, because I found other programs for modifying firmware that really rely on DOS boot disks the way Windows 9x creates them.\n\n\nI have 2 \"hacked\" drives and backup one to the other using dd without issues. (Just dd'ing to the other drive didn't work.)\nI'm not sure if linking to a certain site that provides the tool and sectors for different disk sizes (including a list of compatible disks) is legal. Search for terms like Xbox 360 hddhackr and stay away from typical download fraud. Using standard drives with the Xbox One seems to be easier.\nNote: dd puts a lot of stress on a drive. If you have a failing drive, try to copy only the necessary data through the Xbox user interface onto USB storage first if that is possible.\n\nA: I would be very careful when cloning disks with dd, as you have to pay attention to the disc's labels, as described by this question. I don't know exactly how the XboX handles this, but I prefer using Clonezilla for performing such tasks. It features a textual user interface and a beginner mode for easy cloning disks. Furthermore, it also offers a special mode for cloning data from one hdd to a larger one.\nNevertheless, I have already copied Cubian OS images to my Cubieboard's SD card using the dd command described by you. Moreover, I have also used the bs argument for specifying how many bytes can be read and write at a time as well as the argument conv=notrunc,noerror,sync for ignoring erros, for avoiding truncating the output as well as for making sure the operations have finished.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 in VMware Workstation split screen issue after updating After updating and restarting my Ubuntu 14.04, I get a split screen, similarly to the issue describe at Ubuntu 12.04 in VMware split screen issue after updating\nI'm running it on VMware Workstation 7.1.4, my host is Windows 7 and kernel version is 3.13.0-45-generic .\n\nA: First I found the exact kernel version using uname -r , then I applied the downgrade fix:\n sudo apt-get remove 3.13.0-45-generic\n sudo update-grub\n sudo shutdown -r now\n\nAfter restarting, it still didn't get fixed, so I reran it again, now downgrading it from 3.13.0-44-generic.

How do I access those files?\n\nA: If your old drive/partition is encrypted with cryptsetup/LUKS, then this command should decrypt it (or at least tell you if it's a LUKS device or not):\ncryptsetup open /dev/<partition> name\n\nand then mounting the decrypted partition with\nmount /dev/mapper/name /newmountpoint\n\nSee man cryptsetup for more info.\nIt's also possible that the decrypted volume (here the /dev/mapper/name part) could have something other than a single formatted filesystem. It could have multiple partitions (\"volumes\") LVM style, or even look like a full disk with separate partitions, and a MBR or GPT, but I don't think Ubuntu normally does \"full disk encryption\" like that.\nAnd like the comment said, if you can just boot from the drive there's a (good?) chance it'll work, and let you copy/backup the decrypted data.\n", "Q: How can I recover files deleted by rm command on 14.10?

I even used it right before I switched to Ubuntu from Windows 8 on the same device.\nWhat can I do be able to use my Bluetooth adapter again?\n\nA: I assume you have a dual-boot system. I am using such a system too on my ASUS N56VZ. Thus I know you have to be careful not to disable your BT adapter when working with Windows. You can check if your Bluetooth adapter is enabled or disabled by using the Bluetooth widget offered by Ubuntu. However, for enabling Bluetooth I first have to open this widget via the start menu, then I have to close it and finally I have to click on the Bluetooth symbol in the tray in the right corner.\nAlternatively, you (at least I) can run the command \"bluetooth\" in a terminal (open with Ctrl + Alt + T or by simply searching for terminal). Here is an example:\nlukas@LUKAS-LAPTOP0-0:~$ bluetooth\nbluetooth = off (software)\n\nlukas@LUKAS-LAPTOP0-0:~$ bluetooth on\nbluetooth = on\n\nlukas@LUKAS-LAPTOP0-0:~$ bluetooth\nbluetooth = on\n\nbluetooth without any parameters queries the state of the Bluetooth adapter and bluetooth on turns it on.\n", "Q: Light Adwaita theme for Ubuntu Unity - toolbar customization! \nThe above snapshot shows some application windows: Nautilus, Rhythmbox, gedit using the Adwaita theme on Ubuntu 12.04 (Unity).

Thanks in advance!\n\nA: An Intel Core i7 process has 4 physical cores. core0 through core3 are the temperatures of each of these physical cores. The temperatures seem perfectly within normal operating range. According to the Intel ARK page for your i7-2670QM processor, 48C is well within accepted parameters (max 100C).\nTemp1 and Temp2 are typically temperature measurements at another point on your computer's motherboard. Exactly where these temperatures are taken on your particular system can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer but it is often taken from the northbridge, southbridge or CPU socket. Since the temperature of Temp1 and Temp2 are the same in the image you've provided as the temperature of the CPU cores, I would suspect that these are taken on the CPU socket and another location very nearby, possibly overall CPU temperature (all 4 cores together).

I've downloaded and installed a deb package of Ubuntu Tweak from its website: http://ubuntu-tweak.com/.\nIs there a way to watch for updates for the package like packages which are in a repository?\n\nA: No, manually installed packages can not be updated automatically.\nHowever whenever a package we had installed manually will become available through our software sources we will get an update if the version in the repositories was higher.\nTo obtain similar comfortable updates for any application that did not make its way to the repositories we can watch out for a personal package archive (PPA) that may provide up-to-date versions of an application we need.\nFor ubuntu-tweak the \"offcial\" PPA repository with build for Ubuntu <= 14.04 can be added by:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\n\nor through the Software Center File > Edit > Software Sources....\nWe then also have to update our apt cache and can install the application with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\n", "Q: How to configure a conceptronic (C100S8) switch for Maas? I thought I had an issue with network configuration, but it turns out I didn't (previous question). The problem is with my switch. As stated in Maas 1.5 doc there are some issues with STP on certain switches. In the case of a Cisco switch it suggests enabling Portfast, but I can't find anything like that for Conceptronic Switch C100S8.\nMy question:\nDoes anyone know how to achieve the equivalent of Portfast on a\nConceptronic Switch?

Can I fix this? This new laptop I have has a weird issue with sound effects: occasionally, I presume due to some low-moderate level of load, the audio subsystem gets stuck, delaying sound effects (and sometimes temporarily freezing my screen in the process) for a few seconds. I imagine this is happening specifically to libcanberra sound effects, such as when I hit tab in gnome-terminal without any completion. (Konversation's sound effects also play with a delay, but not a hard-freezing one, and I've always observed that weirdness, even when using KDE on my old laptop...) After this first delay, the sound effect will work fine for a while, then go back to working as described above after not having a sound effect for a while.\nWorse, however, is using the volume control buttons on my keyboard. The first time, the sound effect will play just fine (with no delay). The second time, the sound effect doesn't play at all. Or sometimes, it will wait a few seconds, then start playing the volume change sound effect repeatedly, up to 16 times in a row, even if I hold the volume change buttons down. Temporary freezing might happen; I'm not too sure... (Using the volume control slider in a GUI controller only has the delay for the sound effect.)\nPrograms that actually play audio (like mpv, fceux, firefox, etc.) work fine with no issues. This specifically affects sound effects, or so it seems.\nI have tried pulseaudio -k. I have tried sudo alsa force-reload. It seems the kernel module snd_hda_intel refuses to be unloaded due to being in use, but whatever it was I tried to find out what was using it (I can't find it anymore :argh: ) reports nothing is using it. Everything works fine again after a reboot until the next time whatever the cause is happens again.\nIs there anything I can do to fix this?\nUbuntu GNOME 14.10\nfglrx-updates 2:14.201-0ubuntu2 installed via Additional Drivers\nLenovo G50-45\nAMD A6-6310 APU with AMD Radeon R4 Graphics\nI'm... not exactly sure what the audio device is; every command-line tool tells me something different, and gnome-control-center's Sound panel only says \"Speakers - Built-in Audio\".\nThanks.\n\nA: Upgrading to Vivid seems to fix the issue for me.

When I go to install Ubuntu after setting up the appropriate partitions within the partition for the operating system, I get the message that it needs to unmount an existing partition (my gaming partition) in order to proceed. \nWill unmounting that partition delete the information stored there?\n\nA: No, it will not delete the data.  You can remount the volume on another directory and all of your data will be there.\n\nA: No, partition was probably automaticly mounted - so, umounting it doesn't remove anything.

It is set up DHCP.\nI need to be able to reach the server via the management network, while at the same time it needs to get out to the world wide inter-webs to get new packages. I do not need the server to act as an internet gateway for other devices to reach the internet. It just needs to reach it on its own.\nIf I configure only eth0 with the gateway of 192.169.10.1, I can reach the server from inside my LAN just fine using SSH.\nIf I configure only eth1 with DHCP, I can get to the interwebs just fine.\nI know enough to know that you can't have two gateways. So if I enable both ports, I make sure to take the gateway off of eth0. In my mind, this should tell the system that all the 192.168.10.x traffic still goes through eth0, everything else goes through eth1. But obviously, it's not working that way.\nThis has been very frustrating. I've been searching the Google all day today for solutions, and can't seem to find one that works.\n\nA: You can try to add route when interfaces go up\nExample:\nput script in /etc/network/if-up.d/\n# Check for specific interface if desired\n[ \"$IFACE\" != \"eth1\" ] || exit 0\n# Adding additional routes on connection\nroute add default dev eth1 via xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nroute add -net yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy/zz dev eth0\nroute add ...\n\nThis will probably route all traffice to eth1 except yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy/zz network.\n", "Q: Problems recognizing Ubuntu Minimal (for Kodi/XBMC) when installing Ubuntu 14.04 Regular Desktop my Goal: HTPC (2 Drives/ 1 minimal Ubuntu/1 Regular 14.04) dualbooting \nSteps i am Trying :\nA.

Even if rsync complains, it will copy everything else anyway. (See here for discussion on this)\nIf you have an encrypted home file system, then the above will just leave you with an unencrypted copy of your files, which is probably not what you want.

Ecryptfs is a system of filesystem-level encryption.\nThe line also shows that the drive is stored on disk as an encrypted container file called /home/cii/.Private.  This is encrypted data that cannot be read or written to unless you decrypt it.  You won't see it, unless your home directory has not been mounted yet, in which case it will appear and just look like jibberish.\nWhen you enter your password, the encrypted data is being mounted at /home/cii.  That is, while this mount exists, your /home/cii is being replaced with a mounted version of your encrypted container.  Your home directory is encrypted as you write to it.  When you log out, this will be unmounted and other people will be unable to read its contents even with root access: they will only see a file called .Private which is indistinguishable from random data.\n", "Q: How to install and configure a TFTP server on 14.04 I've been trying to build a TFTP server on a fresh Ubuntu 14.04 build for a number of weeks using articles that I've found on-line, but all my attempts seem to fail as the TFTP server that I've installed seems not to be responding.

My wireless driver is r8169. \n\nA: Work-around for 14.04:\nCreate the following Bourne shell script in /etc/pm/sleep.d:\nMYNAME=$0\n\nrestart_ethernet() {\n   /usr/bin/logger $MYNAME 'restart_ethernet(r8169) BEGIN'\n   /sbin/modprobe -v -r r8169\n   /sbin/modprobe -v r8169\n   /usr/bin/logger $MYNAME 'restart_ethernet(r8169) END'\n}\n\n/usr/bin/logger $MYNAME 'case=[' ${1} ']'\ncase \"${1}\" in\n   hibernate|suspend) ;;\n   resume|thaw) restart_ethernet;;\nesac\n\nThat should force the r8169 driver to resume Ethernet service after resuming from suspend.\nMake sure that the script is executable (chmod +x).\n\nA: You should (almost) always be able to ping localhost, as this is your own computer, if you cannot there is usually something wrong with your stack.\nFirst check to see what you are connected to with\nifconfig\nNext try these to restart. (you may need to do sudo before these commands)\nIf you see eth0 or any ethX where 'X' is number (ethernet/wired) do:\n\nifdown eth0\nifup eth0\n\nIf you see wlan0 or any wlanX where 'X' is number (wireless) do:\n\nifdown wlan0\nifup wlan0\n\nThis basically sets your card down, then up. If that doesn't work there are other steps.\n\nA: I had same issue. You have to restart network manager:\nsudo service network-manager restart\nThere is bug for this issue:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd-shim/+bug/1184262\n", "Q: iPhone does not unmount properly when unplugged I'm running Ubuntu 14.10 on my netbook, and connect my iPhone via USB cable so that it tethers and I can access the internet.  This all works as expected.\nThe issue is that when the iPhone is unplugged from the USB cable, it doesn't unmount properly, so when the iPhone is next plugged in, a message box appears with the following text:\nUnable to mount iPhone\nLocation is already mounted\nUnplugging and replugging my iPhone throughout the day results in lots of these message boxes appearing.\nThe output of mount when the iPhone is plugged in includes the following:\ngvfsd-fuse on /run/user/1000/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse\n\nThis line is still there after the iPhone is unplugged.  If I manually umount that location, then the message does NOT appear when the iPhone is next plugged in:\nsudo umount /run/user/1000/gvfs\n\nIs there any way (maybe through udev) to automate this?\n\nA: I've found a way to automate this.  The issue was that gvfs-mount -l still showed a mount (afc://<iPhone_serial_number>/) even after the iPhone had been unplugged.  It was this mount that triggered the Unable to mount iPhone message when the iPhone was plugged back in.  This mount was provided by the gvfsd-afc gvfs backend. Killing gvfsd-afc removes the mount.\nTo make udev do this automatically when the iPhone is unplugged, create a file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-iphone-umount.rules and add the following:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ACTION==\"remove\", ENV{ID_MODEL}==\"iPhone\", RUN+=\"/usr/bin/killall -s SIGINT /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfsd-afc\"\n\nThen run sudo udevadm control --reload-rules to get udev to load the new rule.\n", "Q: Why does xterm alt-backspace produce the Unicode character U+00FF?

When I try to start it up I can get to the desktop just fine but if I switch back to my Chrome OS desktop and then back to the KDE Linux desktop it shows a console.\nForgive my extreme lack of knowledge surrounding this; ironically I tried to install linux to learn more about this stuff.\n\nA: Due to the lack of memory and processing power of the chromebooks, it is probably closing kde to save you memory. You can start it again using the command sudo startkde. \nI'm not  100% sure how chromebooks handles crouton and I know that this might not be the ideal answer but I hope that this will at least help you get back to your desktop without having to restart it. \n", "Q: Password for new user I just downloaded ubuntu and it requests a password;\nI entered my registration password and it didn't work.\nIs there an initial password ?\n\nA: It's been a while since I installed ubuntu except for upgrades, but if I remember correctly the initial installation asks you to set a username and password for the administrator. That would be the person doing the install. You can use whatever username and password you like. I think the last time it didn't like the 7 digit password I had used before and it required an Upper case or special character. But at least it did give me a message telling me when my chosen password was unacceptable.\n", "Q: Adobe Flash Projector? Trying to get Adobe Flash Projector, but i'm having some trouble. Can't seem to figure out how to get it running, so I can run the game Realm of the Mad God in it to reduce lag. Please Help.\nPlease note, I am VERY new to Ubuntu, so i'm pretty much clueless.\n\nA: The Adobe Flash Projector for Linux is poor and doesn't build very easily or work in 14.04+.\nThe easiest solution is to install wine, download the Adobe Flash Projector for Windows, open it, and then run the SWF file within that.  (Run the projector executable after downloading it, then open the SWF you want to play.  If it needs internet connectivity, it might not work 100% as expected, though.)\n", "Q: laptop monitor brightness always maximum upon charging My laptop monitor brightness is set to maximum whenever I connect it to charging. I have gone to the brightness settings and changed this, but the problem repeats when I charge my laptop again...what is the best way I can solve this issue...\nI would prefer some shell based solution if there is no way to fix this issue. Some of the requirements for such a program would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*It should detect when laptop is being charged and when the brightness goes to maximum, it should reduce it.\n\n*Must be able to manually change the brightness if required\n\n*Must have a configuration I can change\n\n\nA: To reduce the brightness of you screen by manually is xbacklight is requied open your terminal and type this\n\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nand then type\n\nxbacklight -set 50\n\nthere 50 stands for brightness range we can get it upto 100 from 0. \nyou can also increase and decrease the brightness from present value to specified level.as you mentioned if you want to increase to 10% from current value of brightness then should give this \n\nxbacklight -inc 10\n\nto decrease \n\nxbacklight -inc 10 \n\nRefer this web page is one of the way to reduce brightness manually\n(http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/save-screen-brightness-settings-in-ubuntu-14-04/) \nor\ntry this In some cases the brightness may be controlled from \n\n/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nas is the case with dell vostro 3400 and the brightness range is 0-15.

Until then, is there anyway I can temporarily set my domain, say box.example.com to resolve to an IP address, say 127.0.0.1, locally?\nI don't want to modify my hosts files with sudo echo \"127.0.0.1 box.example.com\" > /etc/hosts because in a few hours, the DNS change would have propagated over the Internet anyways.\nCan I do this without requiring administrative privileges?\n\nA: Your question seems somewhat vague, so I have prepared two separate answers for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*If what you're asking is whether or not you can write DNS records from the server /etc/hosts file, the answer is no. You can change /etc/hosts all you like, but it will only affect the server's view of the corresponding IP address, not the Internet's view of the IP address. That is the purpose of DNS -- to resolve a domain name to a specific IP address Internet-wide. Source: Wiktionary definition of DNS\n\n*If what you're asking is whether or not you can alias an IP address to a domain name, the answer is yes. Editing the /etc/hosts file does just that. In all likelihood, the best way to do that temporarily is simply to sudo nano /etc/hosts, add the alias in question, such as 127.0.0.1 box.example.com, and later remove it. To alias an IP without administrative priveleges, as per your request, I honestly do not believe that it is possible. If I come across any information to the contrary I will update my answer immediately.\n\n\nA: I think you misunderstand what the /etc/hosts file does.\nThe /etc/hosts file does not propagate across the internet.  It only works and affects local lookups on your computer itself.  For example, I have 10.0.50.123        mydmzbox in my /etc/hosts file - that 'hostname' doesn't actually resolve to anything anywhere else, Internet or otherwise, and just exists as a connection alias for my computer only.\nIf you add your entry to /etc/hosts it will only affect your local computer, and nothing else - there's no need to worry about the /etc/hosts change propagating out to the internet.  (What you're thinking of is a zone file within Bind, but that is not the same as putting an entry in /etc/hosts.)\n", "Q: Why did the `files` sidebar shortcut bg turned orange? I has the files shortcut in my sidebar forever, as i opened it it's background always went red, one day as I opened it it's Bg went yellow/orange.\nNothing else seems to have changed except by the bg color.\nI`m very curious as i have never seen this happen before and no one I asked so far gave me an answer.\nWhy did this happen? (14.04)\n\n\n\nA: On top of why the colours are the way they are in this Q&A: What are the different colors on the unity launcher icons?, you received an update to the file manager icon itself, so the background changed automatically as well.\nIf you would want red back: the icons of all applications are located in: /usr/share/icons (and its numerous subdirectories).  Just edit all the system-file-manager.png files and colour the orange drawer in red and the red background will come back.\n", "Q: Alternative way to run a sudo command on startup I am trying to write a script for my Ubuntu system to hibernate, whenever the amount of battery left is (say) 5%. This script will run on startup.\nI can get the battery left using \nupower -d |grep perc\n\nThen I wish to use \nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nwhenever battery reaches <= 5%. But this requires superuser permission. AND I DON'T WANT TO TYPE PASSWORD AGAIN AND AGAIN AFTER EVERY LOGIN.\nOne way is to use add the following line in /etc/sudoers\nyourlogin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: command_here \n\nBut most people recommend against that.\nAnother way is to add a custom startup script in /etc/init.d. But I am not sure whether it is a safe choice.\nAlso, is there any other alternative which would be best for my purpose?\n\nA: Run sudo crontab -e -u root and append the line @reboot /path/to/script to the bottom of the file, then the root user will automagically run your script as root on login. And a friendly reminder to make sure nobody apart from you and root can access the script, otherwise people could run any command as root.\n\nA: Simpler than adding a script to init.d is to write an Upstart configuration. I'd favour this above all. Create a .conf file in /etc/init (say /etc/init/sleep-on-suspend.conf, containing:\ndescription \"Automatic suspend\"\n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nexec /path/to/script\n\nThis will be automatically started on reboot.\nYou could even integrate the script into this file. Instead of the exec line, use:\nscript\n    while sleep 1; do\n    upower -d | awk -F'[ %]*' '/perc/ && ($3 < 5) { exit 1 }' || pm-hibernate\n    done\nend script\n\n\nA: \nThis script will run on startup.\n\nIf you really mean this then you are already talking root privileges.\nWhat does the rest of your script look like?  We can't really judge the security or lack of same from isolated commands.\nOne alternative would be to run it, say, every 5 minutes out of root's crontab.  If you are scared of security consequences, you could create a dedicated user who has limited privileges except within power management.\nAdd this to a new file:\n*/5 * * * * root /usr/local/sbin/hibernate-on-power-low\n\n(where maybe root could be replaced with a dedicated user if you like) and install this in /etc/cron.d/hibernate-maybe.  Obviously, the script which does the real work would have to be installed in /usr/local/sbin/hibernate-on-power-low and properly audited for security and efficiency (probably using a direct kernel interface would be more robust and efficient than grep) and obviously, if you run with adequate privileges already, you don't need sudo to run pm-hibernate.\n\nA: Another alternative is using sudo -S (which is not safe either).\n-S switch of sudo will read the password from STDIN. So, you can use it like:\necho 'password' | sudo -S <command>\n\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu to ask for my password at login screen again? I used to have a password prompt but then I, from somewhere in User Accounts, unchecked \"Require a password for login.\" Now, I want Ubuntu to prompt for a password again at login screen, mainly because I have to manually unlock the login keyring whenever I access Dash or other services, which is a pain at best.\nI also searched another question, namely How do I get Ubuntu to ask me for a password at login again?. It was of no help because the OP's question is \"I have a password but Ubuntu doesn't ask for it.\"\nAlso, the two answers provided there don't solve my problem at all. They discuss completely other things.\nIs there no simple mechanism? Because intuitively, if there's a checkbox option to bypass password requirement, there should be an equally hassle-free facility to again require the password.\n\nA: Start by going into System Settings, Then into User Accounts and Click Unlock in the top right corner ( you will be prompted for your user's/root password).\nThen select your user from the list on the left of the window then toggle \"Automatic Login\" to 'off' , when you are done , be sure to re-click Lock in the top right corner\n\nA: Well I found what was wrong. As I made clear, I had a password. Terminal asked for a password when I attempted a sudo command. Automatic login was already off, but Ubuntu just didn't ask for password even if it prompted for choosing the user at login screen. I could just click on my username and it will log me in without a password.\nI was placed in \"no login password\" group. I did this command:\nsudo gpasswd -d myusername nopasswdlogin\nAnd I was removed from this group. Now my account asks for password...\n\nA: System -> Administration -> Login Screen\nand then tick\nshow the screen who will login\n\nA: I had the same issue under Xubuntu 16.04 and the solution for me was inspired by this answer.\nI had to\nsudo nano -w /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nand then remove the last two lines from\n[Seat:*]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=gord\nautologin-user-timeout=0\n\nleaving just\n[Seat:*]\nautologin-guest=false\n\n", "Q: Unable to copy and paste from Google Calendar App I have found that I cannot copy and paste from the Google Calendar app.  I use the calendar to alert me for bill payments, but under 14.04, I cannot copy information from the calendar window.  And, URLs that work as links in other OSes (Windows, for instance) do not work in 14.04's Calendar App, and I cannot copy the URL to a browser, either.  Does anyone know of a fix?\n\nA: This is a known bug in launchpad.

The command in the script itself cannot be added directly to your startup applications because of the combination of single/double quotes that does not \"fit\" in a .desktop file.\nThe script:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 15&&gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Lenses disabled-scopes \"['files.scope']\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as set_search.sh\n\n\n*Add the (command to run the) script to your Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add.

I am using Firefox 35 as a browser. I have tried to simply download the tar.gz file from the Adobe site, but there is no install file in the folder. I converted the tag.gz file to DEB and installed it and restarted Firefox with no luck. It seems as though it didnt install. I also read links about ubuntu-restricted-extras but that prompted me to remove many dependencies and other applications that I enjoy & still need. I also read about Flashaid which has been discontinued. \nI have checked in about:config in Firefox and got the following results: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shockwave Flash  \n\n*File: libflashplayer.so  \n\n*Path:/usr/lib/flashplugin-installer/libflashplayer.so  \n\n*Version:11.2.202.425  State: Enabled (STATE_VULNERABLE_UPDATE_AVAILABLE) Shockwave Flash 11.2 r202\n\n\nIs there an easy way to simply just update the Flashplayer? I tried using synaptec package manger with no success. \n\nA: What version of flash do you need to upgrade to? Unforunately the Adobe Flash Player about page states that only only Chrome/ium supports versions of flash higher than 11.2.\nYou could have a look into installing the Fresh Player Plugin. I haven't used this so I'm not 100% certain it will work for you.\nAs a last resort you can install Chromium from the Ubuntu Software Center by just searching for chromium and then installing it. Alternatively you can install Google Chrome by downloading the .deb file then double clicking it once it has downloaded, from there it will install in the software center. I personally use Chrome and flash works absolutely fine for me.\nHope this has helped you.\n\nA: Through pipelight you may install the windows version of Flash. It will co-exist with your linux version so you can choose depending on your needs which to use.\nInstructions on the website are very clear and easy to follow.\nPipelight also makes other plugins like Unity and Silverlight (and more) available to Linux users.\n", "Q: Dell Latitude 3340 Twitching mouse cursor when using touchpad or just resting 1 finger on touchpad! So I have been going through many of the forum posts here, even some who are addressing same issue as I have but not with a \"real\" fix!\nMy problem is the mouse pad, when I use ubuntu, acts erratic and twitchy. I can be trying just to move the cursor slowly and it will go nuts/acting up completely going up and down and to the sides very very fast and very very twitchy. The thing happens at random moments, which could be addressed to a pressure issue, but I don't think it is. It makes it impossible sometimes to just mark some text or click minimize on a window!!!!\nWhat I so far found out is people say its most likely the pressure point, But I have tried that now and STILL have the problem (btw problem wasn't there in windows).\nSo far \"only\" thing I tried, as I'm scared of changing something major, is the PressureMotionMinZ, which I changed to 30 instead of the standard 15. But I have experienced the jumping mouse even after changing it. And its badly starting to annoy me. I have disabled as many functions on the touchpad as possible in hopes that it would be something like 2 fingers making the problem. \nI am gonna try to reduce the PressureMotionMaxZ as the next thing, as It could seem to happen when I might apply too much pressure, but I don't think it is (worth a shot though).\nAnyways, someone Please help! As this thing could be my end of using ubuntu, even though I enjoy it way more than Windows, this simple problem is starting to piss me off badly.\nI seem to have found a way to force it out, If I rest my middle finger at the middle of the touchpad and then slowly move my two neighbor fingers towards the mouse pad/touchpad then it at a point starts jumping like crazy, until I lift the neighbor fingers again, like it recognize the other fingers before they even touch the touchpad or my middle finger reaches a specific pressure on the touchpad when I move the two other fingers...

Test-run it by running in a terminal window the command:\npython3 /path/to/change_launchers.py\n\nIf all works fine, add it to your startup applications\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\nimport shutil\n\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndesktop_dir = home+\"/\"+\"Desktop\"\ndata_dirstr = home+\"/desktop_data/desktop_\"\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef get_desktop():\n    return [l for l in get(\"wmctrl -d\").splitlines() if \"*\" in l][0].split()[-1]\n\nwhile True:\n    curr_dt1 = get_desktop()\n    time.sleep(1)\n    curr_dt2 = get_desktop()\n    # alter the set of launchers when workspace changes\n    if not curr_dt1 == curr_dt2:\n        datafolder = data_dirstr+curr_dt2\n        for f in [f for f in os.listdir(desktop_dir)if f.endswith(\".desktop\")]:\n            subject = desktop_dir+\"/\"+f\n            os.remove(subject)\n        for f in os.listdir(datafolder):\n            subject = datafolder+\"/\"+f; target = desktop_dir+\"/\"+f\n            shutil.copyfile(subject, target)\n            subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"chmod +x \"+target])\n\nNote\nIn different localized versions of Ubuntu, the name of the \"Desktop\" folder may differ (In Dutch: \"Bureaublad\"). If in your Ubuntu version the name of the desktop folder is not \"Desktop\", change it in the line:\ndesktop_dir = home+\"/\"+\"Desktop\"\n\n\n2. Extending possibilities, launchers and links\nIf we add a few lines to the script, the setting-per-workspace options can be extended with a altering set of links to directories:\nOn one workspace we have a e.g. a link to the Documents folder, combined with launchers of office applications:\n\nOn another workspace we have a link to the Pictures folder, combined with launchers of Image editors:\n\nHow to setup\nThe setup is pretty much the same as in option 1, but additionally, in the data folders (see option 1), create links to folders (using ln -s <source> <destination>) you'd like to be available on the corresponding workspace:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\nimport shutil\n\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndesktop_dir = home+\"/\"+\"Desktop\"\ndata_dirstr = home+\"/desktop_data/desktop_\"\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\ndef get_desktop():\n    return [l for l in get(\"wmctrl -d\").splitlines() if \"*\" in l][0].split()[-1]\n\nwhile True:\n    curr_dt1 = get_desktop()\n    time.sleep(1)\n    curr_dt2 = get_desktop()\n    # alter the set of launchers & links when workspace changes\n    if not curr_dt1 == curr_dt2:\n        datafolder = data_dirstr+curr_dt2\n        for f in os.listdir(desktop_dir):\n            subject = desktop_dir+\"/\"+f\n            if os.path.islink(subject) or subject.endswith(\".desktop\") :\n                os.remove(subject) \n        for f in os.listdir(datafolder):\n            subject = datafolder+\"/\"+f; target = desktop_dir+\"/\"+f\n            if os.path.islink(subject):\n                os.symlink(os.readlink(subject), target)\n            else:\n                shutil.copy(subject,target)\n\n\nA: Some other desktop environments (like KDE) offer this natively, but this is only partially supported in XFCE.\nWhat works natively in XFCE:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can set a different wallpaper on each workspace, this is fully supported and can be easily configured through the workspace settings GUI.\n\n*You can affect a panel to a specific workspace, but AFAIK there is no GUI option allowing to configure this but the script below will take everything in charge.\n\n\nThe solution I adopted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new panel for each workspace. You can also create supplementary global panels which will be displayed on all workspaces (some elements like the notification bar can be added only once, so the only way to have it visible on every workspace is to add it to a global panel).\n\n*Configure and run the script below to distribute each local panel to their own workspace.\n\n*Configure XFCE to run the script at each start.\n\n*Configure the panels as you will.\n\n\nContrary to the other answer, this script will not run as an endless loop fetching the status each and every second. It runs only once during the session opening in order to associate each local panels to their own workspace, afterwards all the rest is handled natively by the window manager.\n#! /bin/sh\n\n# First panel to move\nstart=2\n\n# Number of panels to move\ncount=$( wmctrl -d | wc -l )\n\ndesk=0\nfor winid in $( wmctrl -l | grep 'dom0 xfce4-panel$' \\\n    | awk \"NR==$start,NR==$(( start + count - 1 )) { print \\$1; }\" )\ndo\n    wmctrl -i -r $winid -b remove,sticky\n    wmctrl -i -r $winid -t $desk\n    desk=$(( desk + 1 ))\ndone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save this script, for instance as local-panels.sh in your home directory, and make it executable (chmod u+x ~/local-panels.sh)\n\n*Configure the script to suit your needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*$start: XFCE numbers your panels, this is the number of the fist panel you want to make local. Here the first panel is kept global, and the panel 2 and onward are made local to their own workspaces.\n\n*$count: The number of panels to make local. By default this is equal to the number of workspaces, ie. one different local panel per workspace.\n\n*$desk: The first workspace to have a local panel. By default every workspace will have a local panel, but setting this variable to a higher value allows you to have no local panel on the first few workspaces if you would like to.\n\n\n*Configure XFCE to automatically start this script upon session opening: go in XFCE Settings Manager > Session and Startup, click on the Application Autostart tab, and then on the Add button to schedule the execution of the script upon each session opening.\n", "Q: Problem in installing phpstorm-8.0.1 I downloaded a file named PhpStorm-8.0.1.tar.gz , in downloads folder , and I don't know how to install this file . Also it don't contain any file with .sh format. \n\nA: According to instructions in https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/ PhpStorm.sh should be in the bin subdirectory\n\nA: The contents of the file Install-Linux-tar.txt lays out the steps as follows:\n\n  Linux Installation Instructions\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Unpack the PhpStorm distribution archive that you downloaded to\n   where you wish to install the program.

You should find strings like\nidea.system.path=~/.WebIde/system\nand\nidea.config.path=~/.WebIde/config\nand change them.\n  \n*Note that we recommend to store data cache (\"system\" directory) at a disk \n   with at least 1G bytes free space\n\nI have copied the extracted folder to the /opt directory and then run the phpstorm.sh file from there. This setup works fine for me.\n\nA: SOLVED!\nSame issue was with me, I was trying download manager(FlareGet) to download PhpStorm but when I downloaded the file with firefox, file was ok and I got PhpStorm.sh file in there.\n", "Q: Terminal: Replacing Ctrl+r with Ctrl+k I'm using Ctrl+r for searching command history in the terminal but this keyboard shortcut is not comfortable for me.\nI would prefer using Ctrl+k\nHow can I update this keyboard shortcut?\n(Updating to Ctrl+k in addition to Ctrl+r is also an option)\n\nA: You can use the shell builtin command \"bind\" for that.  What you specifically want is:\nbind  '\"\\C-k\":\"\\C-r\"'\nPut that in your ~/.bashrc file and it should work each time you open up a shell.  For more details checkout the bind section here.\n\nA: Check this stack overflow question about a similar problem.\nBut my advice is to keep Ctrl+k and Ctrl+r as is and get used to, because Ctrl+k is used to erase from the cursor to the end of the line which is a very useful shortcut.\n", "Q: Possible problem with wifi n standard Hia all,\nI have recently upgraded my internet connection, which included changing the wifi router. Since then, my wifi connection is somewhat shaky, works great sometimes, sometimes completely dead (usually around midnight! very strange...), and these kinds of problems. Everything works great when I use a LAN cable or connect, connect via wifi to other networks, or connect to this network from other devices.\nI suspect that the problem might be related to the fact that I might have disabled my 802.11n wifi. It was some time ago and I don't quite remember what I did  (I asked this question). How would I check if I disabled the n standard, and how would I reverse it? Are there any other wifi diagnostic tools that might help me here?\nThanks\nBTW, I'm running 12.04\nEDIT:\nThanks for all the suggestions.\na) I don't have a iwlwifi.conf in /etc/modprobe.d.

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, I have better luck with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.\nChange the last line to read:\nREGDOMAIN=IS\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor.\nNext, I'd set IPv6 to Ignore in Network Manager: http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/images/netconfig/network-connections-ipv6-ignore.png  This example is for ethernet, but you want wireless.\nIf these changes do not help, please try:\nsudo -i\necho \"options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf\nexit\n\nReboot and test.\n", "Q: Export $DISPLAY value in Shell script I am trying to Print the value of $DISPLAY under my Shell script.\nI have Following shell script which Exports the DISPLAY:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport DIPLAY=:10.0\n\nHere, each time I need to change the Value manually to accomplish the task.\nCan we make the DISPLAY value dynamic using command:\necho $DISPLAY  'Prints the current Display Value :10.0\n\nI have tried with the below code but it won't assigns the DISPLAY value to the variable:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport DIPLAY=echo $DISPLAY\n\nBelow is the complete Code:\n#!/bin/sh \nexport DISPLAY=:10.0 \nexport ANT_HOME=/home/abc/Desktop/Eclipse/plugins/org.apache.ant_1.9.2.v201404171502 \ncd /home/abc/Desktop/auto/Automation/xyz \nant usage clean compile build run makexsltreports sendemail \n\nI am running this shell script every hour using crontab job\nPlease suggest!!\n\nA: echo $DISPLAY won't work. If it did, you wouldn't need to set or export DISPLAY in the first place. You'll need to find out what the appropriate value is using some other way.\nIf you want to find out what DISPLAY your user is currently running, try:\nw -h $USER | awk '$2 ~ /:[0-9.]*/{print $2}'\n\nThen you can do:\nexport DISPLAY=$(w -h $USER | awk '$2 ~ /:[0-9.]*/{print $2}')\n\n\n\n*\n\n*w lists the currently logged-in users and where they are logged in from, with DISPLAY being used for users logged in by GUI.\n\n*With awk, we match the second field, the location, to something that looks like a DISPLAY and print it out.\n\n\nA: I can't comment as I don't have 50 points yet. Just want to comment on the answer by muru: awk needs to print the third column for the DISPLAY number (at least in 16.04), since the second column \"$2\" prints the tty number.\nso instead of:\nw -h $USER | awk '$2 ~ /:[0-9.]*/{print $2}' \n\nit should be:\nw -h $USER | awk '$3 ~ /:[0-9.]*/{print $3}'\n\nI use:\nDISPLAY_M=$(echo \"export DISPLAY\"$(w -h $USER | awk '$3 ~ /:[0-9.]*/{print $3}' | sed 's/\\:/=\\:/')\n\nWhen called it prints the full export DISPLAY=:0.

How I think I got into the problem\nAfter the system installation I proceeded to install upstream kernel, changed /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume by commenting out the RESUME... line and then I run update-initramfs -u. While I now realize that this was probably unnecessary, I did it while following an article describing the system setup with automatically decrypted partitions.\nProblem\nThe default Grub entry now points to the upstream image instead of the latest one coming from Ubuntu and it does not get updated when a new image is installed during upgrades.\nI'd like to stop using the upstream image and go with whatever latest image is installed. Obviously, I can always pick it manually from the Grub menu during boot but I'd like the default entry to get updated automatically.\nQuestions\nQ1: Is the fact that the default entry points to the kernel with higher version preventing the installer to upgrade the entry?\nQ2: How does the installer actually know which entry to update?\nNotes\nI admit I have limited knowledge of Grub and the system in general. Feel free to point out and explain any misconceptions I might have stated.\n\nA: The installer just runs update-grub when any Kernel-package activity happens. This completely rebuilds the grub bootloader (ie it doesn't update single records).\nAnd yes, they are listed by descending version. You can see the listing in the \"Ubuntu (advanced)\" grub listing... But otherwise, the top one is taken.\nThe easiest fix for you is to just remove the kernel packages you installed. update-grub should be run automatically and the default should return to a maintained line.\nIf you want to keep the newer kernel version but just default to a stable one, here  is a great tutorial on manually setting the default kernel version. You should be able to specify \"2>3\" which should pick the next highest Kernel underneath your upstream one, so this should also track them as updates are installed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Gaming Question - Poor Performance So this is sort of a hardware question relating to the performance of games on my laptop. I am trying to play Counter Strike: Global Offensive (Click here for required hardware), and am facing sever difficulties- the game runs at 4-6 FPS! \nI can run this game on XP/Vista/7 and 8 without a care in the world, so I do believe the issue here lies within the system settings of Ubuntu (and how it uses the hardware) or the actual gaming settings, trouble is I am not sure what.

performance\nThe problem will be this:\n GLX Renderer: Gallium 0.4 on AMD KABINI GLX Version: 3.0 Mesa 10.1.3\n\nUnfortunately the KABINI APUs still have quite poor open source driver support, so I suggest installing the proprietry fglrxdriver, which yields better 3D support. Gallium is the open source radeon driver, if this was not clear.\nPs.: I am using an A4-5000M KABINI APU, so I am speaking from experience.\nInstalling the drivers in Ubuntu\nIf you are using Ubuntu, you should just let jockey do its thing and do not hassle with manual installation. Using the latest drivers manually has advantages, but then you have to manage it yourself, no help by the Ubuntu repositories. You should only tread on this path, if you are absolutely sure, that you want this, here be dragons :)\nJockey is also known as Additional Drivers . You just simply need to run it, select the (recommended) AMD driver, click ok, and restart. And now you are running fglrx.\n", "Q: Can't access home directory during boot. Any solutions?

It failed too because of the same reason.\nI've encrypted my home folder. Could that be reason for these failures? If not, does anyone have any solution?\n\nA: Yes. Your home won't decrypt and mount until you log in.\nYou want to move this script to start when you log in.\n\nA: you will need to do additional work to setup Chrome Remote Desktop for Linux (beta by the way).

I haven't installed any add-ons or try to tune up by myself by the time.\nFirefox is the 35.0.1 and thought it was slow on a Ubuntu 14.04 Server too.\nIs it something normal on Ubuntu? \nDo I have to modify some settings on Firefox or Ubuntu to tune up this?\n\nA: What is slow?  Switching between tabs, opening a site, scrolling the window...?  It might be your graphic drivers. If you have an nVidia card try installing the non-free nVidia drivers rather than the stock ones that come with Ubuntu.\nUPDATE:\nOkay, if it's the network access that is slow my guess would be that you have IPv6 enabled. Try running sudo apt-get update from a terminal window, and if you get the same 5-10 second pause then try disabling IPv6. The \"quick\" way to do that (just for testing) would be to edit /etc/gai.conf and add the following line to it:\nprecedence ::ffff:0:0/96  100\n\nRestart firefox and see if that speeds things up. If it does, a better way to disable IPv6 is described in this answer to the question How to disable IPv6 in Ubuntu 14.04?\n", "Q: Unable to install Wine on Ubuntu 14.04 I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04:\nWhen I try to install wine, it wants to remove lots of packages.

I can't use the alarm, because in the morning the accu is empty. Besides, the phone is often very warm; I guess, this consumes quite some energy.\nIs there any solution? Is this problem known?\n\nA: Power management in Ubuntu is far from being perfect, but a battery life of a few hours only and a warm but idle phone are sure not normal. Open Terminal and enter top. It shows a list of processes sorted by CPU usage. You probably have to put the phone to landscape orientation to see full process names. An idle phone should have no processes taking more than 10% CPU time.

(in Window machine, this is easily as you can type VNese with Unikey in any keyboard layout).\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04, I'm using ibus-unikey with my French keyboard. The Solution is to modify the default English keyboard layout (QWERTY) to match my physical French keyboard layout (AZERTY).\nStep 1: Modify the file: /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us based on the fr file (in the same folder). The syntax is not hard to guess. I kinda copy the fr layout into it.\nStep 2: Apply the change: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data.

The reverse is not true; you can see Windows partitions from Linux.\nThe drive/storage systems are totally different: In Windows you have drive letters such as C:, D: etc but in Linux you do not; the physical drives are /dev/sda, /dev/sdb & they will be \"mounted\" in a manner that makes them look like one big file system, without the clumsy C:/ prefixes that Windows uses.\nIf you want to be able to transfer data back & forth, just have one of the Windows partitions mounted in your Ubuntu set-up & use that; but don't try to mount it as your home folder, it will cause problems. I have a /Dos directory on my PC, just copy to /Dos/ & it will be visible in Windows.

I have a certain template file for LO Writer.\nHow can I edit that file directly, i.e. not by creating a new .odt file and saving it as a .ott file again?\nThis question is based on the following experience: under Windows, it is possible to right-click the file and choose something along the lines of Edit this file, which then open the .ott-file itself instead a blank new document.\n\nA: Like most LibreOffice file formats, the .ott file is just a compressed archive. Rename it to filename.zip and open it with the archive manager. You will find several files and folders in it. Most likely you want to edit the contents.xml file. When you're done, compress the files and rename the file to newfilename.ott. Unless you have made a mistake somewhere, you can open this file with LibreOffice. LibreOffice is not very lenient towards errors in the XML markup, and will refuse to open the file if you forget to close a tag, for instance.\n\nA: LibreOffice supports the -o command line parameter which does exactly this:\n       -o file...\n              Opens the given files for editing, even templates.\n\n              Without -o a template file would create a new document derived from that template.\n\nUnfortunately there is no shortcut in the file manager to access this functionality. But I guess you could add your own .desktop file which does this; or you could edit /usr/share/applications/libreoffice-writer.desktop and manually add the -o parameter to the Exec= line.\nAlternatively you can run libreoffice -o MyTemplate.ott command in Terminal to edit the MyTemplate.ott file.\n\nA: Select \n\n\n*\n\n*File -> Templates -> Manage\n\n*Click on the template of interest.\n\n*Click the 'Edit' button that appears in step 2).\nIf your template doesn't appear in the list of templates then you may need to import it.\n\n\n*\n\n*File -> Templates -> Manage\n\n*Click the 'Import' button.\n\nA: The best solution I've found is to open the template file you want to edit; this gives you an \"Untitled 1\" document.\nHowever, you can edit this and save it over the old template file.\nIt's not as slick as using Microsoft Word on Windows, but it accomplishes essentially the same thing.\n", "Q: How i can change root to user directory?

When I now try to install Docker or Owncloud it cannot be found. Nor are the apps/framework available through the WebDM 'app store'. Numerous guides online refer to both these applications as being available already, some from January some from all way back in December.\nI should add that I am using the latest available version of Ubuntu Core (there are no updates when checking - updating has worked in the past, so that is not the issue) with the build number 2.

I cannot really tell exactly how this did happen. Yesterday, I pressed CTRL + C to copy a URL from a web page displayed on Firefox, and it seems I touched something else that wasn't CTRL + C and Firefox loaded a new tab with the home page. Since then just by pressing CTRL Firefox loads the home page. Today I discover that pressing CTRL on a Nautilus window loads my home directory.\nThis is causing me problems when I want to copy something as I used to CTRL + C, CTRL + V keys.\nAfter reading this How can I restore default keyboard shortcuts?, I looked at these locations using dconf-editor:\norg.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys\norg.compiz.integrated\norg.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings\norg.gnome.shell.keybindings\n\nBut I could not find any entry mapping CTRL alone.\nWhere can this key mapping be?\n\nUpdate: I tried to create an empty shortcut in System->Keyboard->Shortcuts and tried to assign an empty command like sh -c \"\", to see if the problem goes away but this has no effect. If I press CTRL key while the new shortcut is waiting for the key combination to be recorded, it records <Primary>HomePage in org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys in dconf-editor. I tried replacing that with <Ctrl> or <Primary> or HomePage using dconf-editor but nothing changes. Also put <Ctrl> alone seems not valid because when I look again in Keyboard->Shortcuts the value Disabled is shown in my custom shortcut.\nUpdate: I tried to reset everything using the command:\ngsettings reset-recursively <insert location>\n\nChanging <insert location> for all four known locations where keybindings are stored, running the command once per location. No effect, CTRL key still loads home page and home dir. Where else can I look?\n\nIf I run xev and press Left CTRL I obtain this:\nKeyPress event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x290, subw 0x0, time 5826943, (952,482), root:(952,534),\n    state 0x10, keycode 180 (keysym 0x1008ff18, XF86HomePage), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyPress event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x290, subw 0x0, time 5826947, (952,482), root:(952,534),\n    state 0x10, keycode 37 (keysym 0xffe3, Control_L), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x290, subw 0x0, time 5827041, (952,482), root:(952,534),\n    state 0x14, keycode 180 (keysym 0x1008ff18, XF86HomePage), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nKeyRelease event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    root 0x290, subw 0x0, time 5827047, (952,482), root:(952,534),\n    state 0x14, keycode 37 (keysym 0xffe3, Control_L), same_screen YES,\n    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: \n    XFilterEvent returns: False\n\nFocusOut event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    mode NotifyNormal, detail NotifyNonlinear\n\nPropertyNotify event, serial 37, synthetic NO, window 0x4c00001,\n    atom 0x13a (_NET_WM_STATE), time 5858181, state PropertyNewValue\n\nKeycode 37 is the same as other of my PCs running Linux. But Key 180 shows only in this PC. What is XF86HomePage? And how it gets mapped to CTRL only by pressing some key combination?\nThis get rids of the annoying behavior of the CTRL key:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 180 = \"\n\nBut I read that I will have problems making it run in every boot as now Ubuntu uses xkb. Permanent xmodmap in Ubuntu 13.04\nWhat I cannot understand is why only because I pressed some key combination by error now my Left CTRL key sends a keycode 37 immediately followed by a keycode 180.\n\nI starting to think that this was not triggered by an accidental key combination, It may have been introduced with some update, I remember that I was downloading updates when the Left CTRL key started to behave weird.\nI think this is related: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/88269/a-single-key-on-keyboard-produces-extra-keypresses-for-each-simultaneously-press\nMy keyboard is also USB, maybe that question was asked a year ago, but the problem is very similar, a single key generating more than a single keycode. Maybe exact keyboard wasn't affected a year ago but some update broke it now. Another possibility is hardware failure, I will try another keyboard and report back.\n\nConfirmed. Only my Genius USB keyboard generates the keycode 37 immediately followed by a keycode 180. I connected a Xtreme USB keyboard to the front panel and confirmed using xev that this keyboard does not generate any keycode other than the 37 when I press the Left CTRL key.\nNow, I'm pretty sure, as I constantly use the CTRL+C combination to copy text, that this Genius keyboard didn't do this before. Maybe it just broke. I will answer this question as soon as I find out how I can disable the keycode 180 without having to run xmodmap all the time.\n\nA: Boring answer. Until somebody else offers a better explanation, this is a case of hardware failure. I replaced the problematic keyboard and no more keycode 180 following a keycode 37.\nCurious thing, not in favor of hardware failure diagnostic, is that the same problematic keyboard don't generate the keycode 180 when CTRL is pressed on the other PC where I connected it.\nJust in case this information is of any use: sorry for saying in my question that the problematic keyboard was USB, actually It is PS2, as the connector was not in my sight until I moved the computer case to do the keyboard replacement. I think I assumed USB because I was thinking in some other keyboard that was previously connected to this PC.\n", "Q: Projector problems in Ubuntu I have problem related to Projectors whenever I try to use projector for slides \"PowerPoint in a class\", it connects and disconnects suddenly so normally I can't use the projector at all.

If you're sending AT commands it's a fair bet you're looking at a modem, in which case 9600 would be an antique model; try setting 115200 or 38400 baud. Without knowing what device you have it's pointless trying to talk about changing it's setting!\nYou will, then, need to play with the PC end - unless you know what speed your device uses. sudo stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 38400 will set your USB to 38400; in Minicom, it's -A then Z then O to get the menu you want.

I solved with sudo dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms (of course, if you didn't install it yet, you can use sudo apt install virtualbox-dkms)\n\nA: It seems like your upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 broke something. You should have kernel version 3.16.0-30\nMake sure that your /etc/apt/sources.list only contains entries with 'utopic' and not 'trusty'. Then make sure that following packages are installed, or install them if necessary: \n\napt-get install linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic linux-signed-generic\n\nAfter that you should be able to remove and re-install virtualbox and rebuild the kernel module.\n\nA: For those who might have same problem:\nMy system is Linux Mint 17.1 (which uses Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty repos).\nI've tried to install VirtualBox with:\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nAnd eccountered same error.\nSolution:\nUninstall bad version of VirtualBox with:\n\nsudo apt-get purge virtualbox\n\nThen get installer from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads and install deb package. Is says same version is in your repositories... but that way it works.\n\nA: I just upgraded an old Ubuntu LTS system from 12.04 Precise Pangolin to 14.04 Trusty Tahr, and a combination of hints in the comments here were required to get virtualbox working.\nStep 0: Try and install virtualbox via sudo apt-get install virtualbox. It mostly worked, but at the end I got the \"No suitable module for running kernel\" error. sudo modprobe vboxdrv failed because there was no such module.\nSo, the fix:\nStep 1: sudo apt-get install linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic linux-signed-generic. apt-get said that the first two were already installed, and installed the 3rd and 4th. \nStep 2: uninstall and reinstall virtualbox. sudo apt-get purge virtualbox and then sudo apt-get install virtualbox. This time, the virtualbox installer compiled a kernel module for the generic kernel. Woo hoo!\nAt this point, virtualbox still didn't work.\nStep 3: Reboot.\nNow, sudo modprobe vboxdrv works, and I can start a VM.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.1 - Strange color depth Hi I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04.1 with Nvidia Drivers. Acceleration works without a problem. \nBut the problem is that I can see strange color depth even when color depth is set to 24 bit. I know the difference between Windows's RGBA and RGB In Ubuntu so I know that 32 bit RGBA is basically 24 bit RGB in Ubuntu.\nI don’t know why the screen is showing such poor colors. Maybe it is just in my eyes but I can see it everywhere in Ubuntu while colors in Windows are okay.\nScreenshots:\n\n\nMy graphic's specs are:\nLenovo y510p nvidia 755m x2 SLI \nI tried to adjust digital vibrancy and it helped a bit and colors looked vibrant but I still see for example a shadow around windows when moved over a white background.\nI tried basically every NVidia driver version including the newest one but with the same result.\nNote that my laptop also has an Integrated Intel Graphics but it is switched on only when the second GPU is removed from the Ultrabay or in Windows 8 when I unplug the power source, so I don’t know much how Optimus technology works in Ubuntu but I am pretty sure it's not even used because it is not listed in VGA/3D device list when asked in terminal, only the two Nvidia cards are listed.\n\nA: I have the same laptop except with dual GT 750Ms. I have just managed to solve this issue. \nThe solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the nvidia-settings utility.\n\n*Click on the section for your laptop display (mine was DFP-1-(LGD)).\n\n*Go to the Controls tab.\n\n*Under Dithering Controls there will be a Depth option. Mine was set to Auto and had two further options: 8 bpc and 6 bpc. Changing it to 6 bpc instantly solved the funny colour gradients that made it look like it was running at a 16-bit colour depth.\n\n\nI hope this helped solved your issue. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can explain why this works and why 8 bpc looks worse than 6 bpc.\n\nA: I was having this same issue with my old GeForce 9500 GT on Ubuntu 18.04 and the solution mentioned by Billal did not work. In my case I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into the nvidia-settings utility.\n\n*Click on the section for your laptop display.\n\n*Go to the Controls tab.\n\n*Under Color Controls there will be a Color range option. Mine was set to\nFull and changing it to Limited instantly solved the problem.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu installed on an external hard disk but not working I have installed Ubuntu on my external hard disk (1TB Western Digital, My Passport). I have only 30GB of free space in my external hard disk, so I partitioned as:\n\n\n*\n\n*1st partition is for my backup data which is of around 900GB\n\n*2nd partition is for Ubuntu, which is of 30GB, in which i have made sub-partitions using GParted\n\n\nFor that, I have already have Ubuntu setup in my USB drive of 2GB, which I created using universal USB installer. The sub-partition is like:\n/boot - 512MB\n/ - 20GB\nswap - 4GB\n/home - rest space left in that 30GB\n\nNow I have completely installed Ubuntu with the help of pendrive of 2GB in / partition. And, boot loader in /boot.\nWhen I restart my computer, it is straightly loading Windows. Then, I searched for the problem here and tried many things such as booting from an external drive active in boot menu. Pressing F2, F8, F9, F10, F12. But the Ubuntu boot is not appearing and the computer directly loads the Windows installed in my internal hard disk. I have a Sony laptop.\nHow can I boot Ubuntu?\n\nA: Because you are installing to an external drive, you need to configure the bootloader to be in the MBR of the drive itself. As such, you do not want to choose the /boot partition for the installation target of the bootloader. \nInstead, select the bootloader installation target as /dev/sdX, replacing X with which ever letter the rest of your partitions are under. /dev/sda is usually the hard drive, so you normally don't want that. Since you are using a USB drive to install and a USB drive as the target, you will see /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc. Choose the one that is the external drive. Please not that the letters can show up in any order and can be associated with any drive, so look carefully.\nThis will make it so that the drive now has a valid bootloader. If there is no loader in the MBR, the computer does not know how to load. For example, when I was running install on a pen drive, I had three partitions. /, /home, and /storage, where /storage was a NTFS partition to be shared between Windows and Ubuntu. / was /dev/sdc1, /home, was /dev/sdc2, and so on. I had the Ubuntu installer point to just /dev/sdc when installing GRUB so that the drive itself would be receiving the install, rather than one of the partitions.\n", "Q: Shutdown button in menu does nothing in 14.04 I have a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04 in which the \"Shutdown\" and \"Restart\" button's bring up the \"Shutdown/Restart\" dialog but upon clicking one of these options, does nothing. By nothing I mean, there is not even feedback from the UI that I've clicked the button until I move my mouse. After clicking either button, the dialog box remains open until I move my mouse at which time the dialog box is closed.\nSteps attempted so far to troubleshoot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ConsoleKit\n\n*Added the following to /etc/pam.d/common-auth:\nsession optional pam_loginuid.so\n\nRunning:\nsudo reboot\n\nand\nsudo shutdown -hP now\n\nwork as expected\nI suspect the issue is related to ConsoleKit but I am not familiar enough with it or the process used for the Shutdown/Restart buttons in Unity to debug further. I have also tried tailing /var/log/* while attempting to shutdown and this came up empty.\nEDIT:\nIt's come to my attention that Ubuntu uses dbus to facilitate the shutdown/restart functions from the menu. As such, I've enabled dbus debugging and HERE IS THE OUTPUT OF:\nsudo dbus-monitor --system\n\nCould use some help making sense of it, though I'll continue trying to do so myself.\n\nA: Figured it out. The solution was the following line missing from /etc/pam.d/common-session:\nsession    optional    pam_systemd.so\n\nI can only assume that this line was added to common-session in a recent update and, because my pam files are managed via puppet, I had yet to reflect this on the template puppet was deploying.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.10 x64 usb printer HP DeskJet AllInOne not detected I bought a new HP Deskjet 1510 AllInOne printer.

It looks like you configured eth0 to have a fixed address and default route, so the one your wireless router is setting is not taking effect (see the network route for wlan0 is OK, but there's no default route so that's why you can't access any sites). Check either in network manager -> edit connections or in the /etc/network/interfaces file.\nAlso, these settings don't change magically by themselves, so try to remember if you changed them at some point by hand and where you did this.\n", "Q: Desktop 'Padding' Is there a way to add some padding to stop windows being completely full screen?\nWhat I'm after is 20-30px of padding around my windows so that the background image shows when I make windows fullscreen rather than having to drag them to the size I want.\ne.g.\n\nWeird...

However CCSM also includes a setting to fix the size of your windows to a certain dimension. This can be used in unison with the Put Top/Bottom/Left/Right/Center hotkeys to achieve the window padding you're after.\nWith the window that you want to fix the size of open, open CCSM and search for the Window Rules setting. Change to the Size rules tab.\n Click New, the + icon, followed by the Grab button. With the Grab button selected, you then move across and click anywhere on your desired window, and the name of that window should pop up in the Value text box. Click Add and then set the desired Width and Height of the window. This will lock the window to that size any time you open it. You can also stop the window from being able to be maximized by setting the appropriate tag in the Matches tab.\nAn example of using the Put Top and Put Bottom hotkeys can be shown in the following screenshot of one of my vertical monitors. Using the Window Rules setting I've set the size of my terminal window to be of a fixed size (you'll notice there is no Maximize button in the top left of the window). With the terminal windows size being fixed, I then put the top terminal using the Put Top hotkey and the bottom one using the Put Bottom hotkey.\nIf you want to see how to use this Window Rules setting for your certain windows, just let me know and I'll run you through that too.\n\nI think this is an example of the window padding that you're after.\n", "Q: HP Pavilion dv6000: Jackd problem: (Ubuntu 10.04) I can't start Rakarrak, Mixx, Internet DJ Console and etc I have Ubuntu 10.04 (I tried higer, but unity is lagging; yes it's Ubuntu 10.04, it's only theme) and I can't start Rakarrak, Mixx, Internet DJ Console and other programs for mixing songs. It's showing me this (rakarrak):\n. \nI tried to start JACK Control server, but it starts and the window goes black and I can't close it. \nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: Although Ubuntu 10.04 is a LTS and it is still supported, I would recommend switching to a more recent version if your PC can handle it.\nHowever, instead of using plain old Ubuntu, I'd recommend that you check out Ubuntu Studio 14.04 which should be ready to run jack, rakarrak and other music software.  Ubuntu Studio is aimed at artists and has software to fit your needs -- music, photography, video editing, graphic design, etc.\nTry Ubuntu Studio 14.04 from a Live disc to see if your computer will handle it.  Keep in mind that running the Live version will be slower than the real thing once it's installed in your computer.  UbuntuStudio runs the Xfce desktop environment which uses fewer resources than Unity and is faster than Unity on older hardware.\nUbuntuStudio\n", "Q: Adware woes on Ubuntu 12.04 I am having trouble with adware specifically the update adobe required, I know its something dumb I did. Being kind of a beginner I would like to see if anybody has a way to find and remove this pain in the behind. I did run clamav with 0 results, any ideas?\nIn more detail I have an old Dell D-500 recently tuned by our local computer person, everything had been ticking along just fine with the exception of occasional hesitation during video playback Youtube, facebook or similar, recently after loaning it to a visitor I noticed that links from facebook would display the \"flashplayer update required\" having read about adware virus by Adobe sites I tried a few suggested solutions with no luck.\nI have installed clamav and run complete scan with no luck, removed and re-\ninstalled flash from Ubuntu downloads no luck, every thing else seems to be OK and can play shooter games alright, but still stuck on the playback problem. I may be completely wrong about the problem altogether just don't know what to try next.\n\nA: Just to clarify what @j0h and @Serg said in their comments and to try to clear up all the confusion, The Adobe Flash security warnings are not a sign of an adware infection. It's highly unlikely that you have any infection at all as in order to effect the operating system your sudo password would be required. The links from facebook are flashing warnings about a security update because a newer version of flash is available for Microsoft Windows (which is easily infected) I wouldn't be concerned about those warnings. In fact the worst I've ever seen on an Ubuntu system is a home page hijack which was easily resolved by changing the home page back. \nThe choppiness on playback is a different issue entirely, likely caused by insufficient hardware specs or a video driver issue.\nIf you are using Firefox, Find updates for installed plugins at http://mozilla.com/plugincheck and you can look at existing plugins by typing about:plugins in the address bar.\nIf you are using Google Chrome, flash is integrated and chrome should automatically update to resolve the issue.\nSource: https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/flash-player-google-chrome.html\n\nA: As far as I understood you loaned it to a visitor who probably didn't know how to use the Internet and they didn't use the guest account, but a user or administrator account and now the browser is acting up (adware/malware) for this account?\nAre other browsers and users affected? If not, deleting/moving/renaming settings and cache should be the solution. Close the affected browser, open the file manager and display hidden files (Ctrl+H in Nautilus, the default Ubuntu desktop file manager) and rename the corresponding folders. For the different browsers, this would be:\nFirefox\n.cache/mozilla/firefox\n.mozilla/firefox\n\nChromium\n.cache/chromium\n.config/chromium\n\nGoogle Chrome\n.cache/google-chrome\n.config/google-chrome\n\nFor example Google Chrome you could reanme .cache/google-chrome to .cache/google-chrome-malware and .config/google-chrome to .config/google-chrome-malware\nTo clarify, this is just about trying to remove possible malicous content from the browser.

Check with that what filesystem the external disk is using if you are unsure. \nIf the disk is formatted with a NTFS the preferred method is to do this with a udev rule.

EFI booting has complicated the installation procedure and these utilities are known to sometimes have problems creating an-EFI installer correctly.\nThere's really no longer any reason not to simply use dd to create the USB installer, especially since you already have a working Ubuntu workstation.\nFirst, use gparted or Disks to reformat the USB stick that you have been using, otherwise it is possible that old, remaining data will cause problems. (I once had a package checksum mismatch error from this problem during installation.) \nThen:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/iso of=/path/to/usb\n\nBe very careful to check what you typed before hitting Enter.

So you might want to try the sudo dmsetup ls command and see what it says, there might be a \"partition\" device like /dev/mapper/securediskp1 that you should try mounting...\n\nOr, this very helpful archwiki page has info on using LVM on LUKS, mainly how to set it up though.\n\nThis very brief webpage indicates \"Mount LVM partitions from an external hard drive\" should be pretty easy, I think it should work after the device has been luksOpen-ed:\n\n\n*\n\n*As root (sudo), run\nvgscan\nvgchange -a y\n\nand all the partitions should have devices created in the form /dev/volumegroup/logicalvolume, \n\n*which you can then mount in the usual way:\nmount /dev/volumegroup/logicalvolume /mnt/somewhere\n\n\nThis link \"How to mount Linux LVM volume partitions on Linux\" has some slightly different info:\n\n\n*\n\n*[root]# pvs\nThis will list the volume groups to which our physical volume /dev/sda2 belonged.

It will look something like this\nLV Name /dev/VolGroup01/LogVol00\n\nIn our case, there were two entries of type LV Name, the other being LogVol01, the swap. The whole output along with it will help you to identify the target logical volume you are looking for.

To fix it i had to have this: \n192.168.56.103 node1-VirtualBox.cs.ucl.ac.uk node1-VirtualBox as second line in my /etc/hosts.\nHowever for making it actually work i had to restart my machines and reinstall Cloudera on my cluster. \n\nA: You are doing everything right like putting the entries in /etc/hosts, server address in /etc/resolv.conf, the /etc/nsswitch.conf looks good too.\nThe problem you are having is due to the understanding of a very specific term \"nameserver\". All the commands used to resolve IP address to hostname and vice versa used the nameserver addresses from /etc/resolv.conf unless mentioned explicitly. You have put nameserver 127.0.0.1 which is not a valid name server because it is not configured as a nameserver. It is there because of dnsmasq which acts as a DNS cacher (and DHCP server) but host, dig, nslookup take data from a valid, configured nameserver only.   \nAs the host, nslookup, dig commands will use the \"nameserver\" mentioned in /etc/resolv.conf (unless specified), hostname resolution will not work using these in your case. Although the programs that use /etc/nsswitch.conf or read /etc/hosts will resolve the hostname to IP addresses and vice versa.\nIf you want to resolve hostnames from /etc/hosts the you need to use getent. For example to resolve \"node1-VirtualBox\", you need the following command :\ngetent hosts node1-VirtualBox\n\n\nA: host/nslookup command utilities try to resolve dns queries directly using nameservers. They do not use /etc/hosts.\nBut the applications do. For example, ping should work. \nThat is, \"ping node1-VirtualBox\" should resolve to 192.168.56.103 in your case.

But when connecting my Mythbuntu 12.04 box, the screen turns on for a second only. Then it is black for a while, then it displays \"no signal\" and after about a minute it turns on for a second again! (and so on)\nThis even seem to be persistent behavior when rebooting the mythbuntu system!\nBut I found a hack: connect the DVI output of the mythbuntu system to my old TV device - works - disconnect it - connect the new TV via HDMI to DVI adapter to the DVI output the old TV device was connected before - voilà, the new TV turns on and shows the mythbuntu screen persistently!\nThe downside (besides the fact that I don't want to do this every time): the resolution is still the lower native resolution of the old tv and not the higher native resolution of the new tv.\nWhen adjusting the resolution at this stage, everything starts from the beginning again.\nConnecting the old tv device via HDMI works without a problem, though. Therefore I am unable to blame a device, interface or protocol...\nNevertheless it seems that the new tv device has some protocol issues with the mythbuntu box and when connecting it via dvi to the old tv prior, the mythbuntu system seems to simply proceed with outputting the video signal - which can be connected to the new tv device then.\nThe xrandr output supports this theory:\nhtpc@htpc7even:~$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1360 x 768, maximum 8192 x 8192\nVGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI1 connected 1360x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 1280mm x 720mm\n   1920x1080      60.0 +   50.0     24.0  \n   1600x1200      60.0  \n   1680x1050      60.0  \n   1400x1050      60.0  \n   1280x1024      60.0  \n   1440x900       59.9  \n   1280x960       60.0  \n   1280x800       59.8  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3  \n   640x480        60.0  \nHDMI2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n  1360x768 (0x46)   85.5MHz\n        h: width  1360 start 1424 end 1536 total 1792 skew    0 clock   47.7KHz\n        v: height  768 start  771 end  776 total  795           clock   60.0Hz\nhtpc@htpc7even:~$\n\nThe new tv device supports up to 1920x1080\nThe old tv device supports up to 1360x768\nThe latter is the exact resolution for the signal informations at the bottom of the xrandr output which is not assigned to any of the output devices; so even xrandr seems to not know where this signal is send to.\nAssuming, this is a complex issue, I request a two-step answer:\nWorkaround: is it possible to get the above described state without connecting the old tv device (or any other device) prior?\nFinal solution: well, how can I solve my issue?\nThanks in advance!\nMythbuntu system data:\nMainboard: Asus P7H55D-M EVO\nGraphics: using onboard Clarkdale graphics!\nSystem: Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\nuname: 3.2.0-68-generic #102-Ubuntu SMP Tue Aug 12 22:02:15 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\nDesktop environment: standard Mythbuntu XFCE\n\n\nUpdate\nI booted my htpc machine with Ubuntu 14.04.1 via usb and this live environment was able to turn on my new tv persistently without a problem.\nBecause I wondered if XFCE may be the problem, I installed Gnome on the mythbuntu system, but this failed the same way as XFCE.\nAdditionally, I noticed that when booted up the mythbuntu system with both tvs connected (the old one via DVI and the new one via HDMI), the XFCE display settings dialog got confused and swapped the supported resolutions lists so that I am unable to adjust correct resolutions.

Previously I saw all kinds of informations there: HDMI1, HDMI2, name of the new tv, name of the old tv.\nEven xrandr listed the wrong resolutions per HDMI output.\nNow I am not sure if this behavior was/is reproducible as I am logged into Gnome currently which listed the supported resolutions correctly and named the tv devices correctly.\nAfter a full system backup I make a release upgrade just now to see if Ubuntu 14.04.1 solves the issue as the live system did.\n\nA: Upgrade to Mythbuntu 14.04.1 solved the issue for Gnome as well as for XFCE desktop environments!\n", "Q: How can I run a program (wine) as a distinct user by shortcut? I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 and I want to run wine under a different account for security reasons. I also want to access it from different accounts. So I made an account called wine and now I want a way to make it easy to run Wine or Playonlinux w/o having to run special commands each time. (I'm setting this up for my family who each have different accounts.)\n\nA: This is a 4-step process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install gksu by apt-get install gksu\n\n*Create a bash script that uses gksu - wine to change to the user wine and then execute the commands needed.  (as that script is used by all users, it should probably go in /usr/local/bin. \n(For the cautious types: try it in ~/bin first)\n\n*Turn X11 forwarding on by adding the following line as last line: export $(dbus-launch) to your /etc/bash.bashrc \n\n*Create a link (or a desktop file) to that script and put it on the individual user's desktop.\n\n\nPro Tip: If you want to run that link without a password, have a look here\n", "Q: MSI GS60-GTX965 - Unable to get Bumblebee to run properly - Could not load GPU drivers I installed Ubuntu 14.10 on my new laptop and while everything works great (save for the wifi card but that's a completely different matter) I'm having some trouble getting Bumblebee to run.\nI followed the guide on this thread to install it and everything seemed to be well but when I try to test it out running optirun glxsheres I get the following error message: \n\n[ 1465.129240] [ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: Could not load GPU driver\n  [ 1465.129265] [ERROR]Aborting because fallback start is disabled.\n\nI know there are an awful lot of threads about this error and I went through several (specially this one and 3 others but I lack the reputation to post the links xD) trying out the solutions posted there to no luck. \nSome hardware info: \n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 06) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd.

I reinstalled and everything seems fine except that \"Enable Wifi\" only shows up (and lets me connect to my wifi network) when I boot from the installation CD. When I boot from the hard disk, my wifi network is listed in Edit Connections with all the same settings that are showing when I boot from the CD, but I can't use it. \nI think this is different from Wifi works on live cd but not when I boot from hd because it was all working fine with the same machine, BIOS, and Ubuntu release a week ago and also because I don't get \"network DISABLED\" when I run sudo lshw -C network.\nThe lsmod output when booting from the CD is so much longer that I'm guessing that one of those modules is what's making the wifi connection possible.

Hope i wont get downvotes for such a simple answer .\n", "Q: What does \"new\" mean to \"dpkg --force-confnew\"? I was recently given the task of maintaining & porting to Trusty an in-house .deb package that overwrites (using --force-overwrite) config files from other packages with customized versions, after which apt-get install -f -y is run to install a bunch of related packages listed as dependencies, some of which are the rightful owners of those config files (Keep your snide comments and screams of terror to yourself).  Note that this package marks the config files as config files rather than as regular files.\nIn the process of trying to clean the thing up, I discovered that if apt-get is passed -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-confold\", then the config files from our custom package will be overwritten by the dependencies' versions, while if -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-confnew\" is used, our package's files will remain at the end.\nHowever, the dpkg manpage states:\n\nconfnew: If a conffile has been modified and the version in  the\n                package  did  change,  always  install  the  new version without\n                prompting, unless the  --force-confdef  is  also  specified,  in\n                which case the default action is preferred.\nconfold:  If a conffile has been modified and the version in the\n                package  did  change,  always  keep  the  old  version   without\n                prompting,  unless  the  --force-confdef  is  also specified, in\n                which case the default action is preferred.\n\nBecause the \"new version\" is installed while the \"old version\" is kept, this seems to imply that the \"new version\" is always the one in the package being installed at that moment, and thus passing -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-confnew\" to apt-get should cause the dependencies' config files to overwrite the ones that our package installed a moment before.  Why is this not the case?  Is the actual meaning of \"new version\" actually based on timestamps (which would just raise further questions)?  Is this a bug in the documentation and/or implementation of dpkg?  Is this just a hairy edge case brought about by two packages laying claim to the same config files that the dpkg developers thought no one would ever be insane enough to stumble across?  What?\n\nA: I believe I've figured out what was going on: Because the dependencies for the custom package are not installed when dpkg -i is run, the package is registered with the package system and neither it nor its config files are installed at that time.  When apt-get install -f is run, the dependencies are installed, and then the package itself is installed, and it's at this point that the config files are installed and the --force-conf* policy passed to apt-get takes effect.  So it wasn't a matter of --force-confnew so much as a matter of order of events when installing a dependency-lacking package with dpkg.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 In uefi mode I have read that Ubuntu 14.04 can be booted and Installed In Uefi (secure boot mode)\nas I don't have a Legacy boot on my Asus Notebook I have tired to boot it this way and\nit always go's back to windows  Can someone help am brand new or will as soon as I get some help.\n\nA: Try to create bootable usb drive with Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator (not sure if it works but worked for me before).\nDon't try to install it before reading more about UEFI bios and the GPT partition system.\nPS: If you mess up your boot loader don't panic and try to boot with >>>Super Grub<<<\n\n    Once you have booted successfully with Super Grub try >>>Boot-Repair<<<\n", "Q: Creating a UFI-bootable Live Ubuntu *DVD* with a Windows 8.1 machine Most or all of the AskUbuntu posts on this subject seem to wind up talking about either USB keys or CD's.  I know Ubuntu 14.10 doesn't fit on a CD, and I don't have a USB drive.\nI'm running Windows 8.1 on a Dell \"Inspiron\" laptop.  Firmware is UEFI, SecureBoot is turned off.  I have set the \"Priorities\" on the Setup screen to #1=UEFI OS, 2=Windows Boot Manager.  I don't really know what that means.  I haven't found the \"Boot Order\" selection I used to see with BIOS.  \nI have downloaded \"ubuntu-14.10-desktop-amd64.iso\"\nRight-clicking on the ISO and selecting \"Send to DVD RW Drive\" is no good -- the disk contains only one file, the ISO itself.\nI opened the ISO using \"Mount as Virtual Drive\" and tried to copy the files in it onto the DVD drive.  Seemed to burn alright, but when I boot the firmware powers up the DVD but seems to simply ignore it.  \nReading about UEFI, it seems to require a FAT-type format on the boot device.  I have \nnot been able to find any way to \"format\" a DVD as FAT.  The Windows \"Format a DVD\" dialog has a \"Format Options => Create an MS-DOS startup disk\" section, but it is always greyed out.\nHow can I make the DVD so that UEFI firmware \"likes\" it, and are there other options on the Setup panel (or elsewhere) I should look at?\n\nA: If you burn the Ubuntu 14.04 or 14.10 x64 ISO image correctly, then the result should be a UEFI bootable DVD.\nThere may be issues with the firmware not allowing to boot from DVD via UEFI, firmware bugs/incompatibilities or an unclear user interface.\nSimply copying the data from the ISO image to a USB stick would be the easier way to create UEFI only live media.\n\nMore technical detail\n\nReading about UEFI, it seems to require a FAT-type format on the boot device. I have not been able to find any way to \"format\" a DVD as FAT.\n\nThe solution to this is El Torito.\nVery short explanation: The ISO image contains a boot catalog with one or more files to boot from. For UEFI it's an image with the FAT filesystem containing the EFI loaders. The image is like a disk dump created with dd.\n$ mkdir iso-img\n$ mkdir efi-img\n\n$ sudo mount Ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso iso-img\n\n$ file iso-img/boot/grub/efi.img\niso-img/boot/grub/efi.img: x86 boot sector\n\n$ sudo mount iso-img/boot/grub/efi.img efi-img\n\n$ ll efi-img/efi/boot/\ntotal 2298\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root root    2048 Jul  21  2014 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    2048 Jul  21  2014 ../\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1355736 Jul  21  2014 bootx64.efi*\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  993144 Jul  21  2014 grubx64.efi*\n\n$ mount | grep efi-img\n/home/livewire/Downloads/iso-img/boot/grub/efi.img on /home/livewire/Downloads/efi-img type vfat (ro)\n\n", "Q: Revert to upstart Is it possible to revert an ubuntu 14.10 install to a upstart or a SysV init system. \nThe \"loggin\" and other issues with systemd has caused me issus with being unable to read the dmesg as normal and determine if my stability issues are from systemD or something else.\n\nA: You might want to follow that https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemdForUpstartUsers guide.

The systemd option is still available in the grub menu under \"Advanced options > Ubuntu, with Linux ...

Control returned to the console BUT the gedit program was still running fine.\nThis is different behavior than how sudo behaves if used in the previous call (which I do NOT recommend doing).  By using sudo, ^C returns control to the console AND closes the gedit program.\nI am new to Linux... is this normal behavior, and why?\n\nA: That's the normal behaviour of a normal gksudo/gksu, at least on Xubuntu & Linux Mint XFCE. Killing (CTRL+C) gksu gedit (gksudo is a link to gksu) leaves gedit still running.\nman gksu has this potentially useful info:\n\nAlso\n         notice that the library will decide if it should use su or sudo as backend using\n         the  /apps/gksu/sudo-mode gconf key, if you call the gksu command. You can force\n         the backend by using the  gksudo  command,  or  by  using  the  --sudo-mode  and\n         --su-mode options.\n\nBut testing with either option results in the same behaviour. \n\nThis test might be enlightening:\n$ gksu gedit\n\n[then in another terminal]\n$ ps -ef|grep [g]edit\nUID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD\nmint      6878  6701  0 23:04 pts/0    00:00:00 gksu gedit\nroot      6879  6878  0 23:04 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/sudo -H -S -p GNOME_SUDO_PASS -u root -- gedit\nroot      6880  6879  0 23:04 ?        00:00:00 gedit\n\n[After killing (CTRL+C) the gksu gedit in the first terminal, it doesn't stop sudo or gedit]\n$ ps -ef|grep [g]edit\nroot      6879     1  0 23:04 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/sudo -H -S -p GNOME_SUDO_PASS -u root -- gedit\nroot      6880  6879  0 23:04 ?        00:00:00 gedit\n\n[Killing the first sudo (with another sudo) does kill gedit]\n$ sudo kill 6879\n$ ps -ef|grep [g]edit\n\nJust like running sudo gedit in a terminal will start gedit, and CTRL+C sudo will kill gedit. But also, if I close the terminal, sudo and gedit still keep running.\nSo, sudo doesn't care if the program that called it (gksu or a terminal) gets killed, it and whatever it's started keeps running too.\n\nAnd these excerpts from man sudo might be helpful too:\n\n\nProcess model\n         When sudo runs a command, it calls fork(2), sets up the execution environment as described above, and calls the execve system call in the child\n         process.  The main sudo process waits until the command has completed,\n         then passes the command's exit status to the security policy's close\n         function and exits. \nSignal handling\n         When the command is run as a child of the sudo process, sudo will relay\n         signals it receives to the command.  Unless the command is being run in a\n         new pty, the SIGHUP, SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals are not relayed unless\n         they are sent by a user process, not the kernel.  Otherwise, the command\n         would receive SIGINT twice every time the user entered control-C.  Some\n         signals, such as SIGSTOP and SIGKILL, cannot be caught and thus will not\n         be relayed to the command.  As a general rule, SIGTSTP should be used\n         instead of SIGSTOP when you wish to suspend a command being run by sudo.\n\n\n", "Q: Cannot install WGET in Ubuntu 12.04.5 lts What do you think are the reasons that causes this error? \nThe program 'wget' is currently not installed.  \nYou can install it by typing:sudo apt-get install wget\n\nIf I type sudo apt-get install wget the output is this:\nReading package lists...

I have internet connection. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS server. This is newly installed. I'm trying to install asterisk on this one but cannot get started. Any information will be a great help.\n\nA: Check that you are root when running apt-get. Then if you are:\nTry:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get remove wget then install wget\n\n*try sudo apt-get upgrade then try all these things again.\n\n\nA: You can find out what files were installed by using  \ndpkg -L wget\n\nOn my system (YMMV) it shows me that /usr/bin/wget is one of the installed files.  \nI suspect that your $PATH is set incorrectly. Please show us the result of  \necho $PATH  \n/bin/ls -l /usr/bin/wget\n\nand check your ~/.bashrc for how PATH is set up. \n\nA: sudo apt-get install --reinstall wget will replace any deleted files.\nWhen the bash shell's default command-not-found handler in Ubuntu--which is what displayed the message you saw when you tried to run wget--tells you that a program isn't installed, but the package that it says provides it is installed, this usually means that the file was deleted. In that case, you can reinstall the package, and the file will be replaced.\nJust running the command that it tells you to run won't do that, because if reinstallation of already-installed packages were perfomed by default when you use apt install or  apt-get install, then users would constantly be reintalling things they didn't mean to reinstall.\nTo reinstall a package, pass the --reinstall flag as well. In your case, for the wget package:\nsudo apt-get --install reinstall wget\n\nThe apt command also accepts this syntax, i.e., you can replace apt-get with apt in that command, in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and later, though that command still works fine. (It's fine to use apt-get, even on systems that have the apt command, too.)\nThe alternative of removing and then reinstalling wget in two separate steps is inadvisable, because if you remove wget with the remove or purge action, then any packages that depend on it will also be removed. Those packages are not automatically reinstalled when you subsequently install wget (though if you explicitly install them, then the wget package gets installed if it wasn't already, assuming the package manager knows it was missing).\nFor information about how to investigate such problems, and other possible causes, see below. What follows is secondary and not needed in most cases.\n\nIf you want to check first...\nAs described above, a missing file is the most common cause of the problem, but there are other causes that reinstalling the package can also solve--see below--so I suggest simply proceeding to do so. However, if you feel like checking if the file has been deleted, then you can run:\nls -l /usr/bin/wget\n\nIn general, if you don't know what file should be providing the command, you can run dpkg -S wget to see a list of files provided directly by any package that have wget in their names, or (as waltinator suggested) dkpg -L wget to list all files that the wget package directly provides. However, I suggest instead using https://packages.ubuntu.com/ to look it up, since the interface is easy to use and it will give you the right answer even if your system's package manager turns out to be broken or misconfigured.\nSee also How do I find the package that provides a file?\nThis is not likely to be caused by a PATH problem.\nThere are other possible causes, but in my experience they are much less common. In particular, if your PATH is set incorrectly, that will usually not cause the command-not-found handler to suggest installing a package:\nek@Kip:~$ nonexistent-command\nnonexistent-command: command not found\nek@Kip:~$ curl\nThe program 'curl' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:\nsudo apt-get install curl\nek@Kip:~$ wget\nwget: missing URL\nUsage: wget [OPTION]... [URL]...\n\nTry `wget --help' for more options.\nek@Kip:~$ PATH=\nek@Kip:~$ nonexistent-command\nbash: nonexistent-command: No such file or directory\nek@Kip:~$ curl\nbash: curl: No such file or directory\nek@Kip:~$ wget\nbash: wget: No such file or directory\n\nAnother possible cause is a deleted symlink used by the alternatives system.\nA more plausible cause for this kind of problem--besides the file being deleted as described above--would be if the alternatives system maintained the command as a symbolic link to an executable, and the symbolic link itself had been deleted, while the actual executable remained.\nIn that situation, you wouldn't have to reinstall the package--but reinstalling still typically would fix it, because it would usually set up the newly installed command as the default by remaking the symbolic link and having it point to the executable that was installed.\nFurthermore, wget in Ubuntu is not managed by the alternatives system because there is only one implementation of wget in Ubuntu's repositories. So this is not the cause of the situation described specifically in the question here, though it is occasionally the cause of problems that manifest similarly.\n\nA: This sounds like a problem with your $PATH.

Then, on exit, either have a terminal to launch the standard gui or set it up to launch automatically when emulation station closes.  \nThinking power button direct to emulation station with no GUi present until emulation station is stopped.  \nWishful thinking?\n\nA: Not so wishful if you turn the question around: instead of disabling the GUI, install the minimal system (it has no GUI) and make the login to your application work (nail that down first) \nAfterwards, if you're satisfied without the GUI (automatic log out and everything) install the GUI, set the auto-log-in to a different user (who has a GUI) and just switch between two users (TTY and GUI) \nI've personally never done an auto-login for a TTY user before, but I don't see why it would be impossible.\n", "Q: Upstart vs Systemd Performance Has anyone measured difference in performance between these 2 systems on Ubuntu?\nSystemd is coming, and it has it's merits, but I fear Upstart will be tough to beat on Ubuntu, since it had years of tuning. Please note that it's only performance on (*)ubuntu that I'm asking about.\n\nA: boot performance under systemd can be measured with the \n    systemd-analyze plot\ntool. Realize that Ubuntu running systemd is very similar to Debian, which is very similar to every other GNU/Linux distro.\n", "Q: advanced boot options ubuntu 14.04 dvd I have been trying to access the advanced menu when booting from a ubuntu 14.04.1 32 bit dvd. I have tried f6, f12, all the f's actually, and I cant stop it from loading the graphical menu where you choose to try live or install. The md5 sum for the iso is right. Is there any reason I wouldn't be able to get to the advanced options?\nEDIT: I should also mention that I have tries other keys, like letters, arrows, etc., and I have done all this when the little logo was at the bottom of the screen.\n\nA: I would try pressing any other key that's not one of the f* keys when the small logo appears at the bottom of the screen during the boot process.  That's the way to access the advanced boot options in the Ubuntu DVD.\nFor more details on this go to the Boot Options page.\n", "Q: What does the -l in ksh -l do? If I use the command:\nksh -l\n\nDoes it call the file profile.ksh? And what does the -l option do?\n\nA: \nksh is a command interpreter intended for both interactive and shell\n  script use. Its command language is a superset of the sh shell\n  language.\n-l \n\nLogin shell. If the basename the shell is called with (i.e. argv[0]) starts with ‘-’ or if this option is used, the shell is\n  assumed to be a login shell and the shell reads and executes the\n  contents of /etc/profile and $HOME/.profile if they exist and are\n  readable.ksh-OpenBSD\n\nSee also ksh-Linux man page\n", "Q: GRUB Failing to Boot to graphical interface First time install. Have attempted to install UBUNTU 14.04 server version from a USB key a couple of times now. After installation it would appear the Grub boot process fails and the screen goes into \"Out of range\" mode. I have read a few posts about this problem, have attempted to follow these recommendations, all without any success. Getting a little frustrated, that I appear to have installed everything, but the boot process is letting me down. What can I do to get a vanilla version of Ubuntu running with the LAMP stack? Are there alternatives to the GRUB boot loader, so I can get this install up and running?\n\nA: you can try boot repair, it resolves the out of range error. First try recommended repair, if still you get error then boot to live usb, then get the boot repair and then advanced options. Here you can select the out of range error check box. \n", "Q: viewing everybody connected to my network I am using ubuntu 12.04 right now. I am wondering if there is an app that lets me view everybody connected to the network I am connected to with their computer name and IP address. And also if possible, I would like to search names of computers and get their ip address or the other way around. If there is any app that will satisfy all my needs, then perfect. If not, I would like to get the searching feature most of all. I am a new user to Ubuntu and I do not know English that well. So please, excuse my errors.\n\nA: You can use netdiscover\nInstall with command\nsudo apt-get install netdiscover\nUsage is sudo netdiscover -r xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy\nwhere xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is you network and yy is subnet.\nalso you can use arp-scan\nInstall with command\nsudo apt-get install arp-scan\nUsage is sudo arp-scan -local\nYou will be got output like this in netdiscover\n\nLinux do not provide NetBIOS name but if you have samba installed on you PC\nyou can use smbtree to see win shares and mashines on local network.\nOutput is some thing like this\n\n\nA: Maybe you should try with nmap or it's graphical equivalent zenmap you can get both in ubuntu with sudo apt-get install nmap and sudo apt-get install zenmap\n", "Q: channel 34: open failed: connect failed: Connection refused I'm using a ssh-tunnel to a server (Linux 2.6.32-431.11.2.el6.x86_64 x86_64) with a socks5 proxy. To build up the connection I'm using the following command:\nssh -D 62378 user@server.de\n\nThe socks5 proxy works fine: over http://www.whatismyip.com/ I get the IP from the server I'm connected to.\nBut sometimes I get the following information on the servers command line:\nchannel 34: open failed: connect failed: Connection refused\nchannel 63: open failed: connect failed: Connection timed out\nchannel 67: open failed: connect failed: Connection timed out\n\nWhen the server throws this messages the connection still works fine. So what does this mean?\n\nA: Okay, I think I've found out whats going on here:\nThe socks5 proxy has a connection limit and when there are too many requests, the proxy throws these messages. This message also appears when the proxy server does not respond at all.\n", "Q: Themes don't show in tweak manager I downloaded a few themes, extracted the tar balls and copied the folders to both ~/themes and /usr/share/themes, but they still don't show up in gnome tweak manager.

This just looks at each line on its own. If it's a name, we stick a newline in and print the name, if it's not, we stick a comma in (without a newline) and print the hobby.\n$ awk -F: '$1==\"Personname\" {printf(\"\\n%s\", $2)} $1==\"Hobby\" {printf(\",%s\", $2)}' data \n\nMark,chess,tennis\nTom,swimming,badminton,boxing,music\nNick,swimming\nfabio,swimming,badminton,boxing,music\n\nαғsнιη's suggestion in the comments switches the logic around to use a ternary condition to decide what string to write. It's neat but I'd explicitly check we were looking at a Personname or Hobby line and not a blank one or not a Hobby called Personname. Something like this should do it:\nawk -F: '{printf $1==\"Personname\" ? \"\\n\"$2 : $1==\"Hobby\" ? \",\"$2 : \"\"}' data\n\n", "Q: Can't install software from repository I want to play games from mini clip website, tried it in Firefox.

I already configured the security group to allow HTTPS traffic from anywhere (as the server should be accessible from anywhere on the internet). We already have a domain name bar.com registered at another domain hosting company. But we want to point foo.bar.com to this owncloud installation.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which IP-address do I use to configure the DNS at this domain hosting company. Because the public ip-address and public DNS of the EC2 instance is renewed every time the instance restarts.\n\n*How do I generate the SSL certificate for HTTPS configuration of Apache2? More specifically, which common name (CN) do I need to put in the certificate. Because the public dns of the EC2 instance is changing on every restart. I think if I put the foo.bar.com CN in the certificate that the browser will throw a certificate error once the user gets redirected from foo.bar.com -> .compute.amazonaws.com, am I right?\nIn short: how do I deploy https on a EC2 instance at Amazon AWS with a dns at a third party domain name service?\n\nA: 1 st Question Answer:\nYour IP is changing continuously because you dont have take Elastic IP\nSo please create Elastic IP and Select  particular Instance for that. Then your issue of changing IP every restart will slove.\n2nd Question Answer:\nYou need to install SSL certificate for that to HTTPS\nYou can be install SSL on AWS by selecting Classic Load Balancer.\n", "Q: Starting eclipse from unity launcher I downloaded the eclipse from its site.

Gedit alternative? As the question states, gedit has a few annoying bugs (cursor disappears, etc). I just need tabs, syntax highlighting, and line numbers. I will use it mostly for programming. I am using Lubuntu.\nedit: Thanks for the many suggestions, I am trying sublime now but it doesn't natively support Fortran code, I forgot to mention that in my question, but however Sublime seems really nice. Which of these support fortran?\n\nA: Use Sublime Text. You can download an ubuntu installer from that link or, at least on my machine (Ubuntu 14.10), you can install it through apt:\nsudo apt-get install sublime-text\n\n\nA: Maybe Geany would work for you.\n\n\nA: Geany \n\nGeany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.\nIt was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few\ndependencies from other packages. It is using only the GTK2 toolkit\nand therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.\n\n\nAs a long time Gedit user, I shifted to Geany last year as my main text editor, I found it the closest alternative.\nI found Geany supports the features you require and comes with many more features and plugins available in Ubuntu than gedit.\nI find the code completion, symbol browser, code folding and tree browser useful,  as well as having a more power find and replace tool as well as the ability to configure launching of command line tools from the menu.\n\nA: I'm going to suggest my favorite editor, vim. Plugin support means it can help with your Fortran code with a few additional plugins. Of course, vim has a steep learning curve, so if you prefer something simpler to learn to use, it's not a good option.\nAnother suggestion is to look at the Fortran community's ideas on suitable editors:\n\nA: Somehow no one's mentioned it yet. Try emacs. \nIt's the perfect programmers editor. It does come built in with Fortran mode, which supports indentation, highlighting, etc.  The editing shortcuts can take some getting used to if you are coming from most other editors (although this is not nearly as true as it is with vim). CUA mode can help here. I suggest running through the tutorial (when you first start it up, it will tell you how).  In the long run, you'll find emacs to be far more powerful than any other editor. Nothing, except for vim, even comes close.\n\nA: GitHub's Atom (in a Lubuntu 14.04 VM):\n\nLike Sublime Text, currently not as polished, but open source. Developed in CoffeeScript and the like - ie, simply extensible, but a bit slower than Sublime.\nYou can install it from WebUpd8's ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/atom\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install atom\n\nIt supports Fortran via language-fortran package, converted from Textmate's bundle. You can install it from the Settings menu (Ctrl + ,, Install, search for Fortran and click Install):\n\n(gif made on Mac, but exactly the same applies to Linux version)\n\nA: Kate is quite nice. I've never used it for Fortran personally, but have seen it recommended.\nsudo apt-get install kate\n\nAn example can be seen here:\n\n", "Q: VIm: using substitute command I'm trying to use the substitute command in VIm but don't get the result I excpect:\nI'm editing an html file, and for example I'd like to replace all \"é\" characters by the é code (yes it's in French and yes I really like to complicate my life :).\nThen I use this command: :s /é /&eacute; /gc to replace all é by é in the line with asking for confirmation. This time it says the pattern hasn't been found, but when it finds it, it adds and don't replace, so the result is that the word \"piétons\" is replaced by the word \"piéétons\" ... the character é isn't deleted.\nCan someone explain what I'm doing wrong please?\n\n\n\nA: You have to escape the & sign. Try that:\n:s /é /\\&eacute; /gc\n\nNotice, I don't know if it is desired, but your substitution only replaces é if it is followed by a space. To replace all é's, use that command (without the spaces):\n:s /é/\\&eacute;/gc\n\n\nA: ... or install recode and\n:%!recode -d utf-8..html\n\n", "Q: How to create a live CD? I am new to Linux distributions, currently working on Ubuntu 14.04. How do you make a live CD from a live installation? Earlier there was \"REMASTERSYS\".\n\nA: It seems remastersys is not well supported in latest distribution. I suggest you use systemback. It also has some extra nice features. I have been able to successfully create an iso with it and written it to a 4G memory stick. However it failed to write to a 16G memory stick. I had to use unetbootin for that. My suggestion is to use systemback for creating an iso file and then unetbootin for writing to USB.\n\nA: Ubuntu Customization Kit, also found through apt-get, or synaptic, and then for added flexibility there is UCK-flow\nThere are a few extra dependencies you might have to install, but 'uck' and 'uck-flow' are python scripts to help unpack, modify, and repack ISO images.\nEdit:  I just checked the .deb file for uck-flow it went catatonic on installation.  I could easily build it from the source.\nUnpack the archive;\nsudo python setup.py build\n\nand then \nsudo python setup.py install\n\nthe executable is located /usr/local/bin/uck-flow, but there is also a menu entry at System Tools (in mine;-)\n", "Q: failed to mount HDD Comes with this message:\nError mounting /dev/sda2 at /media/ubuntu/8686DD7986DD6A67:\nCommand-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=999,gid=999,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda2\" \"/media/ubuntu/8686DD7986DD6A67\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: Windows is hibernated, refused to mount.

Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume read-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nWhat do I type into the CLI, I just need to access the drive to backup the data?\n\nA: Looks like the same problem to this post. Can you boot into that Windows partition at all? If you can, boot into Windows and then just make sure you properly shut it down and then try again.\nIf you can't boot into that Windows partition it looks like ntfsfix would be your next best option. To use ntfsfix you would have to install it and then run sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda2.\nHope this helps you out.\n", "Q: Can I get a 100% dedicated CPU to my critical process? I am looking for a way to get a consistent time measurement (<1% difference between the different runs) for my program under Ubuntu 14.04. perf stat shows that I still get quite a few context switches although my program never gives control to OS (no I/O, no memory allocation etc.). I do run the program using sudo nice -n -20 on a shielded CPU (my Intel i7 CPU has four physical cores, hyper-threading is disabled in BIOS) with -k on switch to cset shield.\nI understand that the unmovable kernel processes are the source of context switches. So, my questions is: is there a way to set up shielding at boot, so that those unmovable processes run on the non-shielded CPUs to start with? In the case that the answer is \"no\", is there another way I can obtain a pure environment for my critical process under Ubuntu?   \n\nA: Im going to stick my neck out here and say that this isnt possible on Linux in general.\nIn SMP systems there is a scheduler running on each core, which is why you are still getting context switches. If your application is really that critical, perhaps you should be using some kind of RTOS, rather than linux. \n\nA: Take a look at the schedtool package.  It offers CPU locking facilities, and a choice of CPU schedulers to the user.  \n\nWorried about the GUI affecting things?  From a virtual terminal, kill X and see.  Probably with an i7 CPU, there are enough cores to make that irrelevant.  It's all a matter of controlling shared resources, with the CPU being only one such resource.  Some resources are so plentiful, it's hard to remember they're shared, like memory. The more you ensure your \"critical process\" is not delayed by anything else, the worse your general purpose Linux OS will behave from a user interaction viewpoint.\n\nA: When I want run to run comparable experiments I: Lock the CPU clock frequencies or governor, so as to avoid possible response differences; Force the task to run on a specific CPU (if not multi-threaded); If there is any disk I/O involved, or any other source of caching, flush the memory cache between runs for a fair comparison.\nFor my experiments that has always been good enough, but perhaps not for yours.\nI'll edit this with more details if desired.\nEdit: I forgot to mention, and very important. I only use Ubuntu server edition for this type of work. Desktops have way to much other stuff always running. and so an otherwise \"idle\" computer really is no where near idle. On an idle server, there is only the occasional cron job, which can and does mess up that run of the experiment.\nFor example I did 262 runs of a program that takes on average 5.6217 seconds to execute. The run time standard deviation was 0.0119 seconds and very worst cases overall were +0.68% and -0.56%. I forced CPU 7 and forced performance mode (but note that even in performance mode intel i7 processors can back off the clock frequency by themselves.)\nFurthermore, if I disable the intel_pstate frequency governor and use the acpi_cpufreq one in \"powersave\" mode, basically locking the CPUs at the minimum pstate (lowest frequency), then I get about +/- 0.01% run time variations on an average run time of 13.22 seconds.\n\nA: I don't know what you mean by non-shielded processors but they way to assign any process to a cpu is to use taskset. You can even use it on kernel modules to force crude NUMA policy.\n", "Q: mysql does not start automatically I'd like mysql to start on boot but it does not, because I had removed rc.something (don't remember what was it) previously when I wanted it to not start automatically. \nNow in order to run it I need to run:\nsudo service mysql start\n\nEach time that I power on my computer, which is annoying. \nHow to resolve this?\n\nA: The command you are looking for is probably\nsudo update-rc.d mysql defaults\n\n\n/etc/init.d/mysql\nDefault script:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n# upstart-job\n#\n# Symlink target for initscripts that have been converted to Upstart.\n\nset -e\n\nINITSCRIPT=\"$(basename \"$0\")\"\nJOB=\"${INITSCRIPT%.sh}\"\n\nif [ \"$JOB\" = \"upstart-job\" ]; then\n    if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n        echo \"Usage: upstart-job JOB COMMAND\" 1>&2\n        exit 1\n    fi\n\n    JOB=\"$1\"\n    INITSCRIPT=\"$1\"\n    shift\nelse\n    if [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n        echo \"Usage: $0 COMMAND\" 1>&2\n        exit 1\n    fi\nfi\n\nCOMMAND=\"$1\"\nshift\n\n\nif [ -z \"$DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE\" ]; then\n        ECHO=echo\nelse\n        ECHO=:\nfi\n\n$ECHO \"Rather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)\"\n$ECHO \"utility, e.g. service $INITSCRIPT $COMMAND\"\n\n# Only check if jobs are disabled if the currently _running_ version of\n# Upstart (which may be older than the latest _installed_ version)\n# supports such a query.\n#\n# This check is necessary to handle the scenario when upgrading from a\n# release without the 'show-config' command (introduced in\n# Upstart for Ubuntu version 0.9.7) since without this check, all\n# installed packages with associated Upstart jobs would be considered\n# disabled.\n#\n# Once Upstart can maintain state on re-exec, this change can be\n# dropped (since the currently running version of Upstart will always\n# match the latest installed version).\n\nUPSTART_VERSION_RUNNING=$(initctl version|awk '{print $3}'|tr -d ')')\n\nif dpkg --compare-versions \"$UPSTART_VERSION_RUNNING\" ge 0.9.7\nthen\n    initctl show-config -e \"$JOB\"|grep -q '^  start on' || DISABLED=1\nfi\n\ncase $COMMAND in\nstatus)\n    $ECHO\n    $ECHO \"Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\"\n    $ECHO \"Upstart job, you may also use the $COMMAND(8) utility, e.g. $COMMAND $JOB\"\n    $COMMAND \"$JOB\"\n    ;;\nstart|stop)\n    $ECHO\n    $ECHO \"Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\"\n    $ECHO \"Upstart job, you may also use the $COMMAND(8) utility, e.g. $COMMAND $JOB\"\n    if status \"$JOB\" 2>/dev/null | grep -q ' start/'; then\n        RUNNING=1\n    fi\n    if [ -z \"$RUNNING\" ] && [ \"$COMMAND\" = \"stop\" ]; then\n        exit 0\n    elif [ -n \"$RUNNING\" ] && [ \"$COMMAND\" = \"start\" ]; then\n        exit 0\n    elif [ -n \"$DISABLED\" ] && [ \"$COMMAND\" = \"start\" ]; then\n        exit 0\n    fi\n    $COMMAND \"$JOB\"\n    ;;\nrestart)\n    $ECHO\n    $ECHO \"Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\"\n    $ECHO \"Upstart job, you may also use the stop(8) and then start(8) utilities,\"\n    $ECHO \"e.g. stop $JOB ; start $JOB.

I use http://onlineclock.net/ in order to wake up in the mornings. It is absolutely vital to me that this site work correctly. My phone alarm simply does not wake me up. If this site does not work correctly, I will miss my morning class, which is extremely important to me.\nOn two different occasions, now, however (though, fortunately neither time on a tuesday or a thursday, when I have this class), when Online Alarm Clock has redirected to its Alarm page, the alarm has not gone off. Instead, a message is displayed at the top of the page, saying, \"Firefox has prevented the outdated plugin Adobe Flash from running.\"\nBoth times, I happened to wake up naturally within a half hour after the alarm was supposed to go off, noticed this message, and updated my Adobe Flash Player, fixing the issue temporarily. But now that this has happened on two different occasions, I absolutely cannot allow it to happen again. I need a permanent solution.\nI notice that, on the message bar, there is an option to force Firefox to run the plugin anyway, despite that it is outdated. However, this is only a one-time thing. What I need is for this to be permanent (at least for this particular website).\nHow do I make Firefox always run Adobe Flash, even when it is outdated?\n—\nSpecs – I am on a 64-bit laptop, running Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: If you want, you can disable the blocklist using about:config:\nextensions.blocklist.enabled false\n\nor using prefs.js:\nuser_pref('extensions.blocklist.enabled', false);\n\n\n\n*\n\n*blocklist.xml\n\n*prefs.js\n\nA: I don't think forcing an insecure version of Flash is really the answer you want. Firefox is disabling it for a very good reason: Your alarm might not go off at all if somebody hacks your computer through Flash and encrypts your documents for ransom.\nWhy not install Alarm Clock or use something like Evolution's calendar and alarm functions? Both will work without Flash. Both will work without an internet connection... And there must be at least a hundred more alternatives. Keeping time is a very old problem.\nAs a side-note, you might want to submit a bug report to onlineclock.net to suggest they stop requiring Flash. You can play Alarm noises and videos without it and it's very easy to have them fall-back to something if Flash isn't installed.\n\nA: The site OnlineClock.net also has a mobile version that works without Flash.

I have an Ubuntu server running as a kvm host. The host has three 1.5TB disks and the host uses lvm and has a 4TB volume group, on which I've created a 3 TB logical volume called nfsserver.I want to create a guest running ubuntu server, which I'll use as a 3TB fileserver.\nUbuntu vmbuilder uses mbr for the guest filesystem, which cannot handle >2TB harddisks.I've searched but cannot find any guides or howtos telling, or even mentioning, how to create a guest using GPT for the guest filesystem.\nIs there another solution to this that I'm missing?\nThe command I'm using to create the guest vm:\nvmbuilder kvm ubuntu --suite=trusty --flavour=virtual --raw=/dev/server1/nfsserver --rootsize=3000000 --domain=nfsserver --arch=amd64 --mirror=http://dk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu -o --libvirt=qemu:///system --user=admin --name=Admin --pass=PassXXXX --addpkg=unattended-upgrades --addpkg=acpid --addpkg=linux-image-generic --addpkg=openssh-server --mem=1024 --hostname=nfsserver --bridge=br0\n\nWith the rootsize set, the vmbuilder fails with \"partition length ... exceeds the msdos-partition-table-imposed maximum\".\nWithout it the guest is build and works just fine, but with just the default size disk. When inside the guest system fdisk -l can see that the disk (sda) is 3TB, and the sda1 root partition uses only a few GBs of this. I've tried resizing the partition, but that fails with a similar 'msdos.. max..' error.\nI'm aware that I could probably, from inside the guest system, save the small sda1 partition, repartion the filessystem, and change it to use gpt and copy back the saved sda1 partition (to a new 3TB root partition). But that seems like a difficult workaround to me, and I'm thinking that there must be a simpler solution.\nlvdisplay on the host:\n    --- Logical volume ---\n  LV Path                /dev/server1/nfsserver\n  LV Name                nfsserver\n  VG Name                server1\n  LV UUID                F8wWeB-GSUI-rxd3-TDQ1-yjcI-af50-s9jdXZ\n  LV Write Access        read/write\n  LV Creation host, time server1, 2015-02-02 15:56:20 +0100\n  LV Status              available\n  # open                 0\n  LV Size                3.04 TiB\n  Current LE             797964\n  Segments               3\n  Allocation             inherit\n  Read ahead sectors     auto\n  - currently set to     256\n  Block device           252:1\n\n\nEDIT: Thomas' answer below was very helpful in solving my problem, for the benefit of others browsing by this question, here is a detailed description of what I did:\n\nI have a VG called server1 with 4TB of space. To prepare some disks for the guest I created and formatted some LVs:\nlvcreate -L 3000G -n nfsserver server1\nlvcreate -L 6G -n nfsserver-root server1\nlvcreate -L 200M -n nfsserver-boot server1\nlvcreate -L 2G -n nfsserver-swap server1\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/server1-nfsserver-boot \nmkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/server1-nfsserver-root \nmkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/server1-nfsserver \nmkswap -f /dev/mapper/server1-nfsserver-swap\n\nI installed virtinstall (apt-get install virtinst), because you cannot use vmbuilder for this, as it will create partitions, and as Thomas points out we actually don't need/want partitions for this. With virt-install you can create a guest and run the ubuntu server installation in the guest when it boots - this lets you control what the different disks should be used for. You do need a partition on the disk to be used as /boot though, because the installer is either unable to make the partition itself or will fail at installing Grub.

I downloaded the latest Ubuntu LTS\nwget http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.1/ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso\n\nAnd ran virt-install:\nvirt-install --name=nfsserver --ram=1024 --os-type=linux --os-variant=ubuntutrusty --cdrom=/home/user/ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso --disk path=/dev/mapper/server1-nfsserver-boot --disk path=/dev/mapper/server1-nfsserver-root --disk path=/dev/mapper/server1-nfsserver-swap --network bridge=br0 --vcpus=1 --vnc --noautoconsole\n\nIt runs very quickly and boots the guest from the dowloaded iso. Using virt-manager from my desktop computer on the same network as the host, I could connect to the guest and go through the installation. When you come to the point with the partitions, the installer can see all your LV's as disks, and it's just a matter of telling which should be used for what.\nI added the 3TB disk afterwords: Shutdown the guest, edit the guest and start it agian:\nvirsh shutdown nfsserver\nvirsh edit nfsserver\n\nThis opens the guests xml-file defining the guest, I added my 3TB LV as an extra disk below the other disks already present:\n<disk type='block' device='disk'>\n  <driver name='qemu' type='raw' cache='none' io='native'/>\n  <source dev='/dev/mapper/server1-nfsserver'/>\n  <target dev='vdd' bus='virtio'/>\n</disk>\n\nThen\nvirsh start nfsserver\n\nAnd lastly, in your guest you can mount your new drive:\nsudo mount /dev/vdd /your/mount/point\n\nAnd if it mounts, then to make it permanent add this line to your /etc/fstab:\n/dev/vdd /your/mount/point ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 0\n\nThat's it! You now have a guest with a huge disk. Thanks to Thomas' advice you now also have it amazingly easy, if you want to clone your guest or resize the drives.\n\nA: I would just not recommend you to install the guest system on a single 3 TB disk. GPT could solve your problem, but personally I think you get more benefits if you use a more modular approach, and for what reason do we need partitions in a virtual machine anyway? ;) well, MBR is still ok for booting :)\nOver the last years I found the following setup to be the most flexible when it comes to guests:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda (100 - 200 MB disk with plain old MBR just for booting)\n\n*/dev/sda1 mounted on /boot (ext4 or similar)\n\n*/dev/sdb mounted on / (4 - 6 GB, NO partition, directly formatted with ext4 or similar, used for the base system)\n\n*/dev/sdc mounted on /srv (in your case ~3 TB, NO partition, directly formatted with ext4 or similar)\n\n*/dev/sdX: swap or /var or something else and only if we need it, again: NO Partition\n\n\nFirst of all I would install a basic ubuntu machine using sda and sdb. as this setup will only consume around 4 GB, you could use it as a template for other guests as well.\nAfter you finished the setup, add the 3 TB disk to your guest so it will be recognized as /dev/sdc. Directly format /dev/sdc and mount it under /srv (or any other location you prefer).\nWhen not using partitions you can also resize disks anytime, even while the system is running and even the / partition.\nHope this helps, happy KVMing!\n", "Q: How to use Tamil typewriter keyboard in ubuntu?

In that case we can skip the startswith() function:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport sys\nfile = sys.argv[1]\n\nwith open(file) as src:\n    lines = src.readlines()\nfor l in [[l for l in lines if f in l][0] for f in set([l.split()[0] for l in lines])]:\n    print(l, end = \"\")\n\n\nA: You can do this in a script like this:\nfirst_occurence.sh (set it to be executable)\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set bash to separate words by newlines only, not spaces\nIFS=$'\\n'\n# read input\ninput=(\"$(cat)\")\n\n# get a list of unique keys - split input by space with awk for any length\nunique_values=($(printf \"%s\\n\" \"${input[*]}\" | awk -F' ' '{ print $1 }' | uniq))\n\ncur=0\n\n# check each line of input for the key\nfor line in ${input[@]};\ndo  \n    # wildcard matching\n    if [[ \"$line\" == \"${unique_values[$cur]}\"* ]]\n    then\n        # print line if match, and move on to checking the next key\n        printf \"%s\\n\" \"$line\"\n        cur=$((cur + 1))\n    fi  \n    # break the loop if we have used up all of our unique keys (only duplicates remain)\n    if [ $cur -ge ${#unique_values[@]} ]\n    then\n        break\n    fi  \n\ndone\n\nRun by piping the file in:\n./first_occurence.sh < filename \n\n\nA: I think steeldriver's solution using sort is the best, although if you want to try something else check the following Python script:\n#!/usr/bin/python2\nimport re\ndef checking():\n        if not check_list:\n            result.append(list_of_lines[index - 1])\nwith open('/path/to/the/file') as f:\n    list_of_lines = f.readlines()\n    result = []\n    for index in range(1, len(list_of_lines)):\n        regex_current = re.search('^[0-9]_[0-9]+', list_of_lines[index])\n        regex_previous = re.search('^[0-9]_[0-9]+', list_of_lines[index - 1])\n        check_list = [x for x in result if x.split()[0] == regex_previous.group()]\n        if regex_current == regex_previous:\n            checking()\n        else:\n            checking()\nprint ''.join(result)\n\n", "Q: How to boot from USB containing full ubuntu installation on a MacBook I know this question has been answered earlier, but none of the answers were clear enough for a newbie in Ubuntu. So the problem is I have installed Ubuntu on a flash drive, using another flash drive, containing Ubuntu live installation. I am able to boot this flash from a Windows based pc, but when I insert the flash to my MacBook Air and restart while holding down option key I only get to choose to boot into Macintosh HD or Windows (on bootcamp) how do I make my Ubuntu USB drive visible in the boot options? Please help :)\n\nA: The problem is that apple has a proprietary boot manager. When you installed to your USB drive, Ubuntu tried to make some changers to the boot manager, which Apple happily ignored.\nHere's what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into OSX. If you are working with an apple machine, DO NOT run this in anything but OSX.\n\n*Download rEFInd. You can find it on sourceforge. (Sorry - really do wish there were somewhere less sketchy I could point you!)\n\n*Decompress it, navigate to the directory and run install.sh.\n\n\n*\n\n*$cd refind-bin-x.xx $./install.sh\n\n\n*reboot osx, with your USB install of ubuntu plugged in.\nYou should now see a slightly less slick looking bootup screen, and an option to boot into Ubuntu. If this doesn't work the first time, try booting one or two more times until it does.\nIt's remarkable how simple this is... and how hard that information was to find. I hope that this helps!\n", "Q: how to list all processes as sorted names As far as I know, ps -ewill list all processes in ubuntu. But the results are sorted based on pid.

After downloading Ubuntu 14.10, I decided to download Steam using wine so I could play a couple of new games that I brought (Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim). The installations were successful, however all three games were running incredibly slow. I previously had Windows 8.1 and the games ran smoothly with only small amount of fps drop here and there during game play. Everything from cut scenes to loading screens, menus and actual game play are horrendously slow and I've never had this issue before considering I'm using a mid-range laptop. Whilst it would probably be best going on to winehq forums to discuss this matter, I thought I would come to askubuntu to see if anyone here would be able to answer my question. My processor is an AMD E1-6010 APU with AMD Radeon R2 Graphics × 2 and my graphics are Gallium 0.4 on AMD MULLINS. I am currently using an open source driver (AMD/ATI Display Wrapper). Is this a matter of installing the proprietary driver or is there another alternative?\n\nA: Open source drivers don't use the hardware to its fullest capacity, therefore your games are going to run slower. You should use the proprietary drivers for your GPU. They're maintained by AMD themselves; only they can write a driver that uses the GPU to its fullest potential.\nAdditionally, Wine provides rather rough compatibility for Windows applications. Considering the nature of Wine, your performance could take a hit.\n", "Q: [Ctrl][Alt] causing windows to maximise vertically Ubuntu 14.10, Unity, running Windows under KVM.

Then I would just like to install Ubuntu.\n\nA: This question ultimately becomes not a matter of policy within the company you are employed by.\nYou say this is a company laptop and the BIOS is not accessible (assuming administrative lockout), and the force boot to an encrypted hard drive.\nThere are two problems you have here then: (1) The company went to some decent (and possibly expensive, if PGP Desktop / Symantec PGp Encryption was used) lengths to encrypt the computer and put administrative lockouts on BIOS to prevent what you are trying to do; and (2) the laptop is not yours and is actually owned by the company.\nIn the IT Tech Support world these are red flags.  If someone comes to me and says \"Hey this is my work laptop and its encrypted can you decrypt the files and give me a copy\" I say \"No, you don't own the machine.  Have your boss contact me if they want it.\"  This is a matter of system ownership vs. authorized user - you are an authorized user of the laptop but you are not the owner of the machine.\nAttempting to bypass the encryption and access your files is almost definitely a breach of the Encryption Policy at your workplace, and a violation of approved terms of use.  Following a method like you request to alter the system like you want would most definitely result in heavy disciplinary action against you.\nIt is therefore not possible within the scope of this site and within the moral and ethical scope of the Ubuntu community to try as help you bypass the encryption and the BIOS lockouts as you do not own the laptop and because we do not typically assist individuals with bypassing such security measures that are in place.\nYou need to reach out to your company's IT support staff to have them fix the machine and attempt to recover files.  We cannot as a matter of policy, ethics, morals, and (in some countries, or in the case if some companies) law.\n\nA: Thanks for your input.\nI will get the data via our IT support and then the laptop can be re-installed.\nI was hoping to save me several trips to the office to get this done, but this is how it will be.\nMy conclusion is that it is not possible to run Ubuntu without rebooting the PC with an installation device (CD, USB, ...).

I periodically run Bleachbit 1.0 on my Lubuntu machine (kernel 3.13.0-35-generic). Last time, I checked the option to wipe free disk space, mainly to try it. The program got stuck on a message saying it would be done in about one minute. I killed it after several hours, but I am afraid my Linux system is messed up. First, I found a new folder containing several hundred thousand files in my home directory (can't remember its name: it looked like a random alphanumeric sequence). I was able to remove it using \"rm -rf \", it took almost one hour.\nThe problem is that, when I checked my inodes with \"df -i\", I got a huge amount for IUsed: \n    Filesystem        Inodes   IUsed     IFree IUse% Mounted on\n    /dev/sda6        2899968 1725783   1174185   60% /\n    none              220155       2    220153    1% /sys/fs/cgroup\n    udev              215362     514    214848    1% /dev\n    tmpfs             220155     521    219634    1% /run\n    none              220155       3    220152    1% /run/lock\n    none              220155       1    220154    1% /run/shm\n    none              220155      16    220139    1% /run/user\n\nAlmost two million inodes?

I can't be sure that my problem is caused by Bleachbit but I read (too late) that several people complained about Bleachbit getting stuck while attempting to wipe free space. Bleachbit might warn users that the wiping feature is experimental and possibly harmful.\n\nA: If you want to remove all those mini files, I might suggest running these two commands:\ncd /    \nrm -r 6jF8vak8\\ H\n\n(if \"/6jF8vak8 H\" is the directory hosting all those files like you mention in the comment.)\nIf this command fails, it might be because you lack permission to write to that directory, in which case you would need to use sudo - which is potentially dangerous in the root directory.\nUse extreme caution and double-check your spacing. In fact, I would recommend typing in the terminal \"rm -r 6jF\" (or whatever the first few characters are) and hitting tab, which should auto-complete the directory. If it doesn't auto-complete (and you are in the root directory), don't run the command. Using this method will ensure that you don't accidentally run rm -r on the root directory itself.\nOther warnings:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have no idea what effect removing those files will have on bleachbit.\n\n*Running this command on a million files will probably take a significant amount of time.\n\n", "Q: Formatted casper-rw - schoolboy error Please don't laugh, a bit of an embarrassing question here.  \nI'm rather new to Ubuntu (12.04) and run it from a USB stick.\nI didn't understand (or check!) what casper-rw was, and did a 'format' on it.\nI got some strange error, so hoped I hadn't broken anything.\nUbuntu still worked but then failed to boot then next time I restarted (insert sad face here).\nI renamed casper-rw using a Windows 7 PC to casper-rw-old, and used a Windows utility to recreate a casper-rw.

I have read the basic docs. \nI have just installed Filezilla. I first tried apt-get but the repository does not appear to be up to date.

Sorry if I am missing something easy but thanks for helping a newbie :)\n\nA: First of all, welcome to Linux and Ubuntu.\nThe messages you see in the command line are not to worry about. They are related to the FileZilla GUI and are more warnings than anything else; if the programme runs as expected leave it be.\nThe easiest way to execute Filezilla from the command line as you ask is by creating an alias. Type the following command:\nalias filezilla='~/Desktop/Filezilla/bin/filezilla' \n\nTo make the alias permanent you must add it to the ~/.bash_aliases file:\necho \"alias filezilla='~/Desktop/Filezilla/bin/filezilla'\" >> ~/.bash_aliases\n\nAfter that you can simply type filezilla to execute the programme.\nBetter still is to make Unity awere that FileZilla is installed. To do so you need to create a file named filezilla.desktop in the ~/.local/share/applications folder. The contents of this file could look like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=FileZilla\nIcon=<path/to/fillezilla/icon>\nExec=/home/<user>/Desktop/Filezilla/bin/filezilla\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;Java;\nComment=\n\nWhere you should replace <path/to/fillezilla/icon> for a path to the FileZilla icon and <user>for your user name. After creating this file, you need to log out and log on again for the FileZilla element to appear in the Lens.\n\nA: You could add Desktop/Filezilla/bin/filezilla to you bash search path (where bash looks when you try to run a program). The command to do this is export. This post and this article have more information about adding to the search path.

If the webserver is not yours, however, ignoring the robots.txt file is considered rude.\n\nA: The Problem isn't with wget inserting a robots.txt file where it doesn't belong, it is with the server you are mirroring content from. The server is evidently miss-configured to handle type 200 requests, and thus, when wget looks for a wget page, it recreates a 404'd request. \nI was looking at the wget source code a while ago. I think what it came down to was that wget always looks for a robots.txt file. But, in most cases, if it is left blank wget deletes it. In your case, it is filed by the 404 page it gets when wget tries to access it. \nUnfortunately, I do not know how to fix a type 200 HTTP request error, for that, we would need more info about the server.\n", "Q: default package: tar .xz or tar .bz2? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32 bit, 2 GB of memory.\nWhich default package should I select when asked before downloading an application like the Opera Web Browser?\n\nA: Normally in Ubuntu the packages that you can install directly via command line (sudo apt-get install <package>) or software center has the .deb format. Here all the dependencies will be automatically fixed, so you don't need to worry about anything just use the command line or software center to install a package, the package manager will take the  right decision for you.\nIf you want you can also download the source files (sudo apt-get source <package>) of the packages available at the repositories, normally have the format of compressed archive i.e. tar.gz or tar.bz2 format. Normally you don't need to download the source files of the packages that are already available at the .deb format. If you need to really build from source you can check this.\nNow what about a package that is not available at repository? Well, in that case you need to look for a .deb availability of the package. If .deb is found you can install it via dpkg(sudo dpkg -i package.deb), but remember you need to satisfy the dependencies yourself. \nWhat if the .deb format is not available then you can download the source file of the package in .tar.gz ot tar.bz2 or any other format and then uncompresses and compile the package yourself. Normally there would be a README file inside telling what you need to do to install the package.\nOpera 32 bit :\nIn case of Opera 32 bit, go to this page and just hit \"Free Download For Linux i386\", don't bother about the package format as it will be downloaded as a .deb package (you typically don't need need tar.gz or tar.bz2 when .deb is available). Then install it via command line taking help from here.\nXen2050 made a good point that you can also use official repository or a PPA to download Opera. If you do so you the can just use apt-get as usual to install Opera directly. For example you can do the following to add the official Opera repository and install opera: \nsudo bash -c 'echo \"deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list'\nsudo bash -c 'wget -O - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | apt-key add -'\n\nNow as the repository and GPG key has been added you can just issue the following to install Opera:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install opera\n\n", "Q: (NEWB) Installed Ubuntu from LiveCD, now what?

So I went into the BIOS and I found out that there is no HDD in the boot order list. But I can see HDD information in the Advanced tab of the BIOS.

And you do want an efi partition on the flash drive and grub installed to that drive.\nBut when I installed a second Ubuntu to my HDD, it overwrote the efi partition on my SSD. So backup main drive's efi partition. You can then just copy efi partition from main drive to flash drive if it still overwrites.

The standard installer is buggy when it comes to USB flash drive installation and it writes the new UEFI configuration files to the HDD, breaking also the HDD installation. Luckily, the HDD installation can be easily restored with boot-repair.\nA full installation to flash drive is possible, though, if you manually do part of that which the installer was supposed to: that is, if you manually make an EFI partition in your flash drive, if you produce a new grub.cfg and if you copy to the EFI partition several files that are already in your /boot/efi directory.

I usually use Asunder to rip CDs for personal usage, and most of the times the CDDB database retrieves the correct tags for my disc. Sometimes however I stumble upon CDs that are either missing from the CDDB database, or need some minor adjustments. When I make such modifications, I would much rather share them (for others to use, or for my own use in the future) than have them rot on my local system.\nIn the past Grip had an option to submit modified CDDB entries from within the app, but nowadays neither Asunder nor EasyTAG provide such functionality.\nIs there an easy way to submit a modified CDDB entry?\n\nA: see freedb \"submit new entries\" howto:\nhttp://www.freedb.org/en/download__miscellaneous.11.html\nBasically you can use email and HTTP POST submission but for details see the doc.\nAlso email method with example described here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1669680&p=10883530#post10883530\nbasically best is to use some program to do it for you. But I couldn't spot any searching now half an hour.\n\nUPDATE:\nOption 1: I managed to update freedb. Use grip to generate the file in ~/.cddb/diskid, you can grep in the dir for it. I couldn't upload with grip perhaps because local mail is not setup. If you have local mail program working, you could as well use the cddb-tool to send email to server.\nThen I went to gmail, create new message to freedb-submit@freedb.org with subject cddb folk 0510db11 where you change folk to your CD genre and use the proper disk-id. Copy paste the cddb file into the message body. Switch to plain-text format. Last thing is very important. And it worked!\nOption 2: use musicbrainz.org. Install picard. Open it and lookup CD. Then click manually lookup CD. There is a link to simple upload. Click it and enter CD information. Then create an account and click on the stub page you just created import as MusicBrainz release. Then enter a lot more information and you are done. Both things work for me. I wouldn't call that very easy...\nIf I knew everything, maybe option 1 is little easier as long as you are comfortable using command line and properly send the email. Option 2 is easier for GUI lovers.\nFinally tested with k3b and it can download CD from both sources. I wish somebody created a freedb submit form..\nP.S. FYI the test freedb email did not work for me. I've got no reply.\n\nA: There are several clients that support freedb submissions. I've recently had success with fre:ac, which has a self explanatory process for this. If you prefer a command line option, jack is in the official repos and is supposed to support submission. An indicator on good clients may be the client submission statistics.\nNote that the CCDB is a proprietary database by Gracenote, which seems only to support submissions from a few proprietary applications such as iTunes and QMP due to \"licensing issues\".\n\nA: As of mid 2020 FreeDB is no longer available: Freedb.org Is Shutting Down, message from March 2, 2020. The former FreeDB Website URL currently redirects to MAGIX, a company selling proprietory music and multimedia software for Windows.\nTrying to find an alternative I only found MusicBrainz, but you have to create an account and log in for adding/editing DiscIDs, album titles, song titles... A suitable software to do this seems to be Picard, although I haven't really used it myself (yet). It's in Ubuntu's universe repository and should be easily installed:\nsudo apt-get install picard\n\nI would also be insterested in how to submit a database entry using the Linux command line, but it may be better to use Picard (which is a GUI) because it allows to lookup pre-existing data and change it if necessary. I say this because using abcde I wasn't able to get the CD data, but using Picard I later found that it would have been available on MusicBrainz already. It seems I have to either setup abcde to use MusicBrainz or that the FreeDB Gateway isn't configured in my abcde settings, or that it is but doesn't function properly... I have to check, but this doesn't change anything regarding FreeDB being shut down...\n", "Q: Ubuntu touch - OpenVPN Is there something available or on the horizon (network settings or an app) to use OpenVPN with Ubuntu touch?\nMy secondary solution would be to switch to read-write (although I'd hate loosing over the air updates) and apt-get install openvpn, plus probably some more configuration to route all web traffic through the connection. Would you see any general problem with that?\nCheers\nPhilipp\n\nA: Yes. Ubuntu phone/tablet images now have OpenVPN support. The configuration is a bit arduous, being a phone, but it is now usable on the images by default.\n\nA: Currently I am not aware of any other option than installing OpenVPN client via apt-get. \nYou can turn the read-write mode off if you need an OTA upgrade, but you probably need to reinstall OpenVPN again after the OTA. Saving the install steps to a small bash script would probably make this a reasonable hack until somebody creates a snap to install via the Touch GUI. However since the OpenVPN Ubuntu client is basically a plugin to network-manager this might not be that straight forward.\n", "Q: Convert Linux URI-encoded filenames and paths in a text file to Windows paths I have .m3u files generated in Linux which can't be read by Windows programs due to different way to treat special characters in paths.\nFor example, how can I convert this Linux path:\nMusic/Timo%20Rautiainen%20&%20Trio%20Niskalaukaus/07%20H%C3%A4mmennys%20ja%20viha.mp3\n\ninto this path readable in Windows:\nMusic/Timo Rautiainen & Trio Niskalaukaus/07 Hämmennys ja viha.mp3\n\nin a text file?\nIt would be easy if I could just replace all instances of %20 with spaces, but as you can see above there are special characters (äöñ etc.) in the paths and filenames which need to be converted, also. These are too varied to be done with regex, and I don't even have a list of all special characters in use in my files.\nedit: as mentioned in comments, the above is a result of URL/URI encoding, rather than reasons I postulated.\nEasy fix was to use an online URL encoder/decoder, which fixed the paths very quickly. This is the URL decoder I used. Accepted answer below with a native Linux Python method.\n\nA: If you don't like Perl, use Python! ;-] Seriously, this or an equivalent Perl one-liner is the easiest way, if you can't use a different application to generate M3U lists.\nfrom sys import stdin\nfrom urllib.parse import unquote\n\nprint(*map(unquote, stdin), sep='', end='')\n\nRun with:\npython3 [script file] < [quoted m3u file] > [unquoted m3u8 file]\n\nNote that the .m3u8 extension gives the reading application a hint, that the file is UTF-8 encoded.

Just to give a example  rsync -ax  /home/snapshot/my_user_folder  /home/my_user_folder where /home is my home folder and /home/snapshot is my snapshot of my home folder.\n\nA: With btrfs a snapshot is also just a subvolume which uses the same files as the original. A copy of this file is created when these files get overwritten in one of the subvolumes. You can move these subvolumes around as much as you want. If you want to restore the snapshot, you could just move the folder. Issue mv /home/username /home/snapshot/backup and then mv /home/snapshot/somesnapshot /home/username. This will make the snapshot the new home. If you want to keep the snapshot clean, create a new snapshot of this snapshot.\nYou can also delete the subvolume the snapshot was based on without issue with btrfs subvolume delete /home/snapshot/backup ones you're sure it's ok. Because the original files belong to both.\nrsync will index the files and copy/overwrite the ones needed.

That would make it easy for me to browse, and put them together in albums.\nWould there be an idiot-proof way of doing this? Also, a link to a helpful forum discussion on this could help me a lot.\n\nA: Script to reorganize photos into /year/month directories\nThe script below does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*It determines the month the picture was taken\n\n*Inside your targeted directory, it creates (if necessary) sub directories per year (if photos were found)\n\n*Inside these year directories, it creates sub directories per month\n\n*If the script is unable to find an appropriate date, it creates a folder named \"undetermined\"\n\n\nFolders per year\n\nSub folders per month\n\nHandling duplicates:\n\n\n*\n\n*An important thing is to take care of duplicates in an appropriate way: digital cameras take shots in similarly named series (like IMG_1.jpeg, IMG_2.jpeg etc). Therefore duplicates need to be automatically renamed, or either the script will break or a large number of photo's will be lost. \nThe script renames duplicates like:\nIMG_1.jpeg, duplicate_1_IMG_1.jpeg, duplicate_2_IMG_1.jpeg etc\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses exif to read the meta-data:\nsudo apt-get install exif\n\n\n*copy the script below into an empty file.\n\n*In the head section of the script, define the directory where you want the photos to be copied to (targeted directory):\n#---\nsave_to = \"/targeted/directory\"\n#---\n\n\n*save the script as reorganize.py.\n\n*Create the targeted (superior) directory if necessary\n\n*Run the script, with the source directory (the folder with your photos) as an argument, by the command:\npython3 /path/to/reorganize.py <source_directory>\n\nI made the target directory set in the script, because you might want to add other dorectories (new pictures) to the same directory, organized automatically, while the source directory will be different in future situations.\nImportant notes\n\n\n*\n\n*The dat format can differ slightly per camera. In the script, I took into account the following formats:\nDatum en tijd       |2013:08:18 15:58:46\n\nand\nDatum en tijd       |2013-08-18 20:21:32\n\nIt might be different on other cameras. If the script does not work properly, you need to post the output of the command exif <image>, but most likely, it will work as it should.\n\n*The script as it is copies the photos into the new (sub) directorie(s), since you probably don't want to mess with the original directory until you verified all went well.

Now even when load is 0-2%, the frequencies I see are usually between 2.5 and 3.1 GHz, which means the CPU is almost always Turbo Boosting. \nMy Ubuntu also uses significantly more power than Windows (where the CPU is often in the 0.8 - 1.8 GHz range) with little load, so I'm thinking it's not just a wrongly displayed frequency.\nI haven't manually changed any setting or installed anything that should affect the CPU behaviour. Below is the content of my cpufreq and intel_pstate, which looks right to me:\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver \nintel_pstate\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq \n800000\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq \n3400000\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq \n2852437\n\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/min_perf_pct \n23\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct \n100    \n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo \n0\n\nHas anyone seen this before or knows how to avoid using high frequencies for no reason?\nJust to mention, I know Turbo Boost can be disabled, which would probably limit the max frequency to 2.4 GHz, but that seems like overkill, since I don't want to limit my CPU performance when I need it.\nThank you.\nEDIT: The scaling governor is set to powersave:\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\n\nThese are the frequencies:\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq\n2492343\n2740218\n2502562\n2438625\n2435718\n2782500\n2783250\n2697000\n\nNothing is using my CPU. As I said, usage is at about 1%.

This one is marked as fixed, but this other one is new, with people reporting it's not yet fixed. \nThere seems to be something going on with putting the computer to sleep. The CPU runs normally, i.e. at low frequencies while idle, just after a reboot, but is stuck to high frequencies after waking up from sleep. After a fresh reboot, my frequencies looks like this (compare to what's posted in the question):\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq\n1588875\n800062\n800062\n800062\n928500\n2112937\n800250\n1911750\n\nI guess for now we just have to wait until this is fixed.\n\nA: This should be a comment, but I don't have enough points yet:\nPlease post the output as per this example:\ndoug@s15:~/temp$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\n\nA very aggressive CPU frequency Verses load curve should only occur when the scaling governor is set to performance. However, and currently, it doesn't take much load, even in powersave mode to raise the CPU frequency from the minimum pstate.\nCould you edit your post to show all CPU frequencies. Example:\ndoug@s15:~/temp$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq\n1627750\n1627750\n1627750\n1627750\n1627750\n1627750\n1627750\n1627750\n\nYou could also try the acpi-cpufreq driver instead of the intel_pstate driver. Change this line in grub to do so (in this example I have a couple of other items on the line also):\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"ipv6.disable=1 intel_pstate=disable crashkernel=384M-:128M\"\n\nIf you do try the acpi-cpufreq driver, please post back here your findings.\n", "Q: No audio in Firefox, Chrome, Spotify, etc. on Ubuntu 14.04 I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit and I'm having some issues with my audio.

The GPU(PowerVR SGX545, I believe) is not supported for any acceleration tasks. I currently run Xubuntu 14.10, but I dislike XFCE. What DE relies least of all on hardware acceleration? RAM footprint is not very important. \n\nA: According to me, MATE would be the best option. It is lightweight and at the same time, quite powerful with respect to the set of applications installed by default. The default window manager, Marco, does not use composting by default and therefore will give good performance on systems without hardware acceleration. Also, the upcoming releases will include an option to switch to Compiz for fancy desktop effects, although it is not recommended for less powerful systems.\n", "Q: Cannot install vsftpd - E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) After running sudo apt-get install vsftpd I got:\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n/var/cache/apt/archives/vsftpd_3.0.2-1ubuntu2.14.04.1_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI tried to delete /var/cache/apt/archives/vsftpd_3.0.2-1ubuntu2.14.04.1_amd64.deb, but it still doesn't work.\nroot@:~# sudo apt-get install vsftpd\nReading package lists...

I use Ubuntu LTS 12.04 and according to udisks, both have the same block size, 512, and the same file system, NTFS.\nNow I've copied a massive amount of folders from one to the other as a backup using Dolphin and I've noticed that afterwards some of the copied folders had slighty different sizes compared to the original folders, although their contents were identical (and also of the same size).\nTo be more precise: One folder had size 73.487.984 and the other one, the original, 73.492.080 bytes according to Dolphin. Both contained only two files (and no other hidden files - I've looked with both Dolphin and Nautilus which are the only file managers I use and the original files and folder were managed using Nautilus, although now I use Dolphin), which were identical in size in both folders: one had size 72.251.560 and one 1.236.424 bytes, which adds up to the size of the first folder, 73.487.984. \nThis makes me wonder: Why is the other folder bigger ?

Storing small files on a filesystem with\n  large clusters will therefore waste disk space; such wasted disk space\n  is called slack space. For cluster sizes which are small versus the\n  average file size, the wasted space per file will be statistically\n  about half of the cluster size; for large cluster sizes, the wasted\n  space will become greater. However, a larger cluster size reduces\n  bookkeeping overhead and fragmentation, which may improve reading and\n  writing speed overall. Typical cluster sizes range from 1 sector (512\n  B) to 128 sectors (64 KiB).\n\nAlso, this Q&A will make you to understand better, probably.\n", "Q: recover flash drive (no need to recover files) I was writing a file of 4GB on my flash drive.

You obviously need to have it installed, so do that.\n\n*Set it up as follows (ignoring the Profile title - that's just my custom profile):\nYou need to select Record OpenGL (experimental), then set the FPS you want to record at - 30 FPS & 60 FPS are what most Youtubers use. \nAnything above 60 FPS is just wasted and harder to work with, since you can only upload to Youtube in up to 60 FPS.\n\n\nMethod 1: Launching via Minecraft Peep's launcher\nIf you installed Minecraft/run Minecraft via Minecraft Peep's launcher, this is fairly simple. \nSince you can launch Minecraft from the terminal via the command minecraft, you simply put that in for the command:\nMinecraft Peep's-specific steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Minecraft Peep's Minecraft Launcher (works in 12.04 through 14.04) via:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:minecraft-installer-peeps/minecraft-installer\nand then\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install minecraft-installer. \nThis should install the launcher and make it so you can launch Minecraft via the program in the launcher and via the command minecraft. Note: You'll still need to install Java to run Minecraft.\n\n*After installing the Minecraft Peep's launcher and setting up SimpleScreenRecorder for OpenGL recording (detailed above), click on OpenGL settings... and set the next windows as such:\n\nYou need to type in minecraft in the command text box and then select Launch Automatically.\n\n*Record! You can set the rest of the parameters as you like.\nMethod 2: Launching via java -jar command\nThis is probably the most common way that people launch Minecraft on Ubuntu, by downloading the Minecraft.jar file and launching it manually either in the terminal or by Alt+F2.\nManually launching-specific steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Minecraft.jar file from the Minecraft website. You'll also need to install Java.\n\n*Put the jar wherever you want. The place where you launch it from won't change how it works (unless it's stored on an external HDD or USB stick.) I personally just leave it in my /home/USER/Downloads folder where I downloaded it to. \nJust remember where it's stored.\n\n*After downloading the Minecraft.jar file from the site and setting up SimpleScreenRecorder for recording OpenGL (detailed above) click on OpenGL settings... and set the next windows as such:\n\nIf you simply downloaded the Minecraft.jar file you can just enter into the command text box the following:\njava -jar ~/Downloads/Minecraft.jar\nand it should work!\nIf you moved the downloaded Minecraft.jar file, you'll need to enter java -jar followed by the full path to the file.\n\n*Record! You can set the rest of the parameters as you like.\n", "Q: How do I download a .crt file to a certain folder/directory in Ubuntu I want to download:\ngd_intermediate.crt \nfrom:\nhttps://certs.godaddy.com/repository\nand add to my:\n/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/\n\nThen I would like to check if certificate works.\nWhat is the most efficient command line command to do so?\n\nA: *\n\n*Download the file from your link and (by default) the file is downloaded to Downloads in your users home. \n\n*Go to command line (open Terminal from Dash) and type\ncd ~/Downloads\n\n\n*And copy or move the file over to the directory using your admin acount.\nTo copy:\nsudo cp gd_intermediate.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/\n\nor to move:\nsudo mv gd_intermediate.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/\n\nThis will overwrite the current file if there is already one named like this. \n\nFirefox has in preferences an advanced options that lets you view certificates. But I would assume the easiest method to test this certificate is to visit the website it is linked to and see if it still throws an \"untrusted website\" notification.\n", "Q: Dell 1521 laptop - bluetooth not working I bought this dell without the bluetooth care and just recently bought and installed the bluetooth card on my motherboard but im still getting \"no adapters found\" - im lost and stuck!\n$ lsusb | grep Bluetooth    \nBus 005 Device 005: ID 0a5c:4500 Broadcom Corp.

She needs the Nvidia 840m for games but still wants to use the Intel igpu for power saving.\nI get the nvidia 340 drivers installed for the 840m and as long as I dont update from ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa afterwards it logs in just fine. However if I run the updates or have bumblebee installed the computer boots with the splash showing, and then I hear sound of the login screen but its blank and theres no display unless I drop to console. From console I can remove nvidia drivers and get it working again. Not updating from the ppa the computer works okay with the gpu aside from the screen freezes. \nsome of the things Ive tried\n(Ubuntu 14.04 and Nvidia GeForce (840M) compatability on 64-bit laptop)\n(Nvidia 840M driver installation Acer E5-571)\n\nA: Same here, with a HP-Envy15, Nvidia 840M as well, Ubuntu 14.10.\nUpdating packages including xorg-edgers PPA gives a black screen on boot,\nthen the only way I found was to CTRL + ALT + F2, login, completely uninstall Nvidia packages, reinstall ubuntu-desktop, reinstall ccsm, launch ccsm, CTRL + ALT + F1 and re-enabling Ubuntu-desktop-plugin from CompizManager.\n\nA: The standard Ubuntu NVidia drivers generate some problems on slightly older and slightly newer NVidia hardware.\nIf you want more then the standard Ubuntu repository drivers, install the xorg.edgers PPA.  As the xorg.edgers group ask not to give installation instructions directly without linking to their page, this is the best I can do for now...\nIf you don't know what a PPA is or need some guidance afterwards about rolling forward and backward of driver versions after reading their page, leave a comment below.\n", "Q: Problems with apache2 hierarchy I'm new to using Ubuntu, and specifically, the terminal. I've set-up a VPS to run Apache on.\nUnfortunately, Apache seemed to already have been installed, so I used the command apache2 to run it.\nHowever, the installation was messed up, and the config file didn't exist among other files. I removed the apache2 package, and reinstalled it, but found the same problem existed.\nMy question is, how can I completely reset the file hierarchy for Apache? It appears that removing it and installing it again doesn't work.\nUPDATE\nI have used sudo apt-get purge apache2 and then sudo apt-get install apache2.\nThe command apache2 is returning this:  \n[Sun Feb 08 00:44:30.834898 2015] [core:warn] [pid 11011] AH00111: Config variable ${APACHE_LOCK_DIR} is not defined  \n[Sun Feb 08 00:44:30.834983 2015] [core:warn] [pid 11011] AH00111: Config variable ${APACHE_PID_FILE} is not defined  \n[Sun Feb 08 00:44:30.834996 2015] [core:warn] [pid 11011] AH00111: Config variable ${APACHE_RUN_USER} is not defined  \n[Sun Feb 08 00:44:30.835000 2015] [core:warn] [pid 11011] AH00111: Config variable ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP} is not defined  \n[Sun Feb 08 00:44:30.835013 2015] [core:warn] [pid 11011] AH00111: Config variable ${APACHE_LOG_DIR} is not defined  \n[Sun Feb 08 00:44:30.837863 2015] [core:warn] [pid 11011:tid 140685188798336] AH00111: Config variable ${APACHE_LOG_DIR} is not defined  \n[Sun Feb 08 00:44:30.838044 2015] [core:warn] [pid 11011:tid 140685188798336] AH00111: Config variable ${APACHE_LOG_DIR} is not defined  \n[Sun Feb 08 00:44:30.838052 2015] [core:warn] [pid 11011:tid 140685188798336] AH00111: Config variable ${APACHE_LOG_DIR} is not defined  \nAH00526: Syntax error on line 74 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:  \nInvalid Mutex directory in argument file:${APACHE_LOCK_DIR}\n\nAnd the command sudo service apache2 start returns this:  \n* Starting web server apache2\n\nA: I just installed Apache2 and these are the config files that were installed onto my computer.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/122705406/Google%20Drive/server%20default%20config/apach2e.zip\nDownload it, unzip it then replace the /etc/apache2 directory with this folder.\nAlso, start the apache server with\nsudo service apache2 start\n\nand you might want to try \nsudo apt-get purge apache2\n\ninstead of apt-get remove.\n", "Q: Cannot boot up computer I installed ubuntu and burned the iso file to the d drive.

What else I can do?\n\nA: 1. Check that you have burned the correct image\nMake sure the image that you downloaded was a x32 image.\n2. Try reinstalling  the image\nI've used Pen Drive  Linux in the past, but for live USBs. Maybe it will help with some issues, but do some research first. I'm not sure if it will work on hard drives since it is meant for USBs.\n\nA: Better re-image  your system, all i can understand is that your system and OS is having compatibility issue.. So check one more time carefully and then install it should work\n", "Q: tmux in terminal forcing 16 color approximation In the Ubuntu version of gnome-terminal I'm seeing a weird problem with colors that I know is somehow related to gnome-terminal because this same setup works fine with iTerm2 on my Mac.\nFrom terminal I ssh into a remote computer running Ubuntu 14.04 (14.10 on local, though). From here if I run vim I have 24bit color support as evidenced by the way my theme appears. Then I attach to a tmux session and run vim, but now I see weird colors in vim because it is continuing to use the 24bit color version, but is approximating to 16 colors.\nThis only happens from terminals on Ubuntu, though. In Mac OS X, for example, if I use iTerm 2 to do the same thing, the colors display correctly when running vim inside tmux.\nI have already confirmed that I have 24bit color support in gnome-terminal. A couple of things of interest to perhaps note:\n\n\n*\n\n*setting t_Co=256 in .vimrc is required for me to get 24bit color to work in gnome-terminal, though not in iTerm 2 where I can leave it unset. Looking at my color theme file this suggest that it's because has(\"gui_running\") is true when run under iTerm 2 but not from gnome-terminal\n\n*it seems like the color downgrade is some interaction between tmux and gnome-terminal, since when not combined I can get colors to work right (either tmux with iTerm 2 or gnome-terminal without tmux)\n\n\nAny suggestions on ways I might be able to get gnome-terminal and tmux to work well together to display 24bit color (or even just 256 color) in vim?\n\nA: Nevermind, turns out that I just needed for force tmux to believe I have 256 colors (this became clear once I realized what it really meant that I was only seeing 16 colors inside tmux; I had previously mistakenly thought I was getting 256) using the -2 option.\n", "Q: Cannot join wireless networks on Ubuntu 14.10. Macbook pro 7.1 I've got an Ubuntu 14.10 live usb I'm fiddling with. At some point in the 12.xx cycle my wifi started getting funky in Ubuntu, and it's never recovered.\nI've got a mid-2010 Macbook pro (7.1) using the b43 open source driver.\nWith the STA proprietary driver I don't list any networks, with b43 I can at least see what's around me. HOWEVER I can't join any of them. I live in military housing and the only network available to me is an open network that is mac-filtered via a logon after joining, I don't know if I can for some reason join encrypted networks. Does anyone have any debugging suggestions? I'd love to start using Ubuntu again.\n\nA: I don't know much about ubuntu as I am trying it I installed it on my lenovo dual boot with windows and had the same issue. I did some search and fixed it by using the b43 answer i forgot all details how. but i did install ubuntu again in my other presario old laptop dual boot aswell and had the same problem. here what solved the issue for me: you have to install the b43 driver and remove the STA driver to make your wireless detected and connect wirelessely. \nTo install the b43 drivers\n1. sudo apt-get firmware-b43-installer \nTo remove the STA drivers\n2. sudo apt get remove bcmwl-kernel-source \nRestart your computer. \nIt worked for me, and hope it will help others.. sorry if its not what you are looking for.\n", "Q: Disappearing Conky Every time I launch my conky, and I click anywhere on the desktop, it disappears, and I have to keep relaunching it, does anyone have a solution?\n\nA: Open your conkyrc file with \nnano .conkyrc\n\nand then \nmade the changes for the following lines\nown_window yes\nown_window_class Conky\nown_window_type normal \nown_window_hints undecorated,below,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager  \nown_window_transparent yes \n\nThen kill your conky and try again launching. \nlet us know if any issues.\ncredit goes here\n\nA: {own_window_type panel}\nalso seems to work, but omits the window border et. al. present if you use\n{own_window_type normal}\nThe important thing is that somehow either one does prevent the conky window from being covered by the desktop. \nWhen you do a File Save on .conkyrc then conky will reload without need of a formal kill and restart.\n\nA: I tried every option for own_window_type to get Conky to persist on my desktop, all to no avail. I finally found that setting\nbackground=false;\n\nin .conkyrc and making sure to not autostart conky with the -d flag did the trick once and for all.\n", "Q: Viber aborts unexpectedly while launching

YMMV\n\nA: According to https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1633207#p1633207 this bug is caused by some unindentified change in Linux kernel version 4.3 or 4.4. Workaround is to use kernel version 4.2 or older, or update to version 4.6 or later. I don't know if kernel version 3.x has this bug.\nFor Ubuntu 16.04 the fix is simple:\nsudo apt install linux-generic-hwe-16.04\n\nor (to get better performance as a side-effect)\nsudo apt install linux-lowlatency-hwe-16.04\n\nSome hardware may not be compatible with lowlatency kernel so you need to test if your system works.\nInstalling unofficial development drivers from https://launchpad.net/~paulo-miguel-dias/+archive/ubuntu/mesa or https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers may also fix the issue.\n\nA: I fixed this problem with a very easy solution , just go to ubuntu settings>universal access> large text turn on. log off from ubuntu or restart, log back in and again go to settings>universal access >large text and turn off. hope it helps.\n", "Q: Disconnected external monitor stays the primary monitor after disconnecting If I disconnect my external monitor, simply by unplugging the HDMI connector, Ubuntu seems to think it is still there.

I am trying to put in place a mail server following this tutorial: http://www.starbridge.org/spip/spip.php?article12 \nBefore starting I was wondering if I had ta create a virtual domain on apache.\nmy hostname is: server01\nmy domaine name is (for the example): domain.net\ndo I have to create a sub domain name mail.doamin.net or server01.domain.net\nI am a bit confused when I see in different tutorials the use of url like hostname.domain.net (is that the FQDN?)\nThanks in advance for your help\n\nA: You would only need a virtual domain in Apache if you're going to run some type of webmail application (SquirrelMail, Roundcube, etc.)\nThe hostname  of host.example.net is important for a couple of reasons. First, it allows you to assign specific services such as mail and web requests for your domain to be routed to particular servers if you need those services running on dedicated servers. Second, it allows that manipulation to be done in your DNS records rather than having to try routing specific ports to specific machines once the traffic reaches your network.\nJust make sure that you put an MX record entry in your DNS records so that mail service is properly routed. The MX record can point to your actual hostname or it can refer to a CNAME record that points to your hostname. \nA FQDN is any domain name that resolves to an actual hostname IP address.\nEDIT\nTo clarify an example of DNS records you would need, it would look something like:\nexample.net           IN  A      12.34.56.78\nserver01.example.net  IN  A      12.34.56.78\nmail.example.net      IN  MX     server01.example.net\nwww.example.net       IN  CNAME  example.net\n\nI'm ignoring the TTL and the MX priority values as you will set those when modifying your DNS and can use the default TTL value; an MX priority of 10 is pretty standard.\n", "Q: installing 7zip from terminal not working? installed  7zip, from the following code :- \nsudo apt-get install p7zip  \n\nIt asked for my password and it proceeded to download the package.\n But it is not found in unity menu.What am I missing?\n\nA: p7zip and p7zip-full command-line programs use the Archive Manager application as a GUI front-end. Archive Manager is installed by default in Ubuntu. You can open Archive Manager from the Dash or by right-clicking a compressed archive and from the popup context menu selecting Open With Archive Manager.\n\nA: p7zip is a CLI program so it will work only from command line, that is the reason you are not getting it in the dash or via graphical interface. \nQuoting from man p7zip:\n\np7zip is a gzip-like CLI wrapper script for 7zip\n\n", "Q: Update Error on my Ubuntu 14.04 I am getting this error while my update never completed fully.\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/iaz/battery-status/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, E:Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\n\nA: The error is occuring because the mentioned PPA may not be available now. So, you need to remove it from the sources.list so that apt will ignore it.\nFrom a terminal open the file (using sudo) /etc/apt/sources.list and find the line containing the mentioned PPA.

The problem is that it starts the copy file operation , and after nearing completion, it just stops there, and it doesn't respond. I tried it for every file and with two pendrive just to make sure there is nothing wrong with the file.\nWhat is happening?\n\nA: What is happening is very simple: Ubuntu is using the cache (basically your RAM) to copy and while the file is being copied to the cache, it starts emptying the cache to the USB.  When it arrives at the end, only the cache needs emptying, so it is just waiting for the USB stick to catch up.\nThis is a feature of the kind of USB stick you buy: MLC USB sticks have this much more pronounced then Single Level Cell (SLC) ones.  However, SLC USB sticks are about 3-4 times more expensive then SLC ones, so normally they're not on display in stores and you have to order them.  The advantage is they're 4-8 times as fast and last 4-8 times as long as SLC ones, so in the end you win twice by only buying MLC drives (or just waiting for the SLC to finish!)  ;-)\n", "Q: Error running .exe compiled with i586-mingw32msvc-g++ and SFML So well, I'm fighting with WINE and MinGW32 right now. \nSo I have a file, sortem.cpp which is compiled with a Makefile and linked and all from that Makefile.\nsortem.cpp\n#include <windows.h>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <SFML/System.hpp>\n#include <SFML/Window.hpp>\n#include <SFML/Audio.hpp>\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\n\nint main ()\n{\n    sf::RenderWindow window;\n    window.create(sf::VideoMode(720,480),\"Sort 'em!\");\n    while (window.isOpen())\n    {\n        sf::Event event;\n        while (window.pollEvent(event))\n            {\n                window.clear();\n                switch (event.type)\n                {\n                    case sf::Event::Closed:\n                        window.close();\n                }\n                window.display();\n            }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nMakefile\nLD = ../bin\nLIBS= $(LD)/sfml-window-2.dll $(LD)/sfml-system-2.dll $(LD)/sfml-graphics-2.dll $(LD)/sfml-network-2.dll $(LD)/sfml-audio-2.dll\nOBJECTS= sortem.o\nCXX= i586-mingw32msvc-g++\nall: sortem.exe\n\nsortem.exe: $(OBJECTS)\n     $(CXX) -o ../bin/sortem.exe $(OBJECTS) $(LIBS)\n\n%.o: %.cpp \n    $(CXX) -c $<\n\nclean:\n     rm *.o \n\nSo the program compiles perfectly, but when running sortem.exe with WINE, it says the program must exit.

Or -exec rm {} + (no support for -execdir either) or the xargs solution that Rinzwind suggests.\n\nA: find . -type f -name \"*.jpg\" -exec rm -vf {} +\n\nThis will remove \"files\" (and not \"directories\") ending on \".jpg\".\nMind though: you should NOT do this as root. A mistake in the command can kill your system and when not using root would error out on a permissions error.\nThere is no way back from this unless you created a backup. \nIf you do a \nfind . -type f -name \"*.jpg\" | more \n\nyou will get a list of the files about to be deleted (the | more will show you the result in pages).\n\nfind . type f -name \"*.jpg\" -print0 | xargs -0 rm\n\nworks too. Same principle: the results are piped to the xargs command that does an rm for every file found. \n\nA: For really old versions of BusyBox (as sadly used by my QNAP NAS), the suggestions using -print0, -exec and -delete won't work.\nI had to resort to building a list and using a loop:\nIFS=$'\\n' aFiles=( $(find . -name '*.jpg') );\nfor sFile in \"${aFiles[@]}\"; do rm \"${sFile}\"; done\n\nThe command being split into two steps does allow for one to check if the found files are correct before deleting them.\n", "Q: Difference between Snappy and Click I don't understand the difference between Snappy and Click.

But I'm wondering is is possible to install it without having a OS installed, and how would I do this.\n\nA: As it's a gaming rig, the key questions are \"Will my games run under Linux, or do I need Windows?\" and \"Does Linux support my hardware (especially my graphics card)?\" If you need Windows and have only one HDD in your system it's much easier to instal Windows first and then put Ubuntu on afterwards. There is plenty of help and advice about how to do this in the Ubuntu forums and elsewhere on the internet.\nIf you don't need Windows then go right ahead and instal from DVD or USB stick. This is what I did with my new build, which wasn't a gaming rig. I just went with Ubuntu's suggested options and all went fine.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to install Ubuntu without having an OS installed. First download the Ubuntu ISO you want to install, then you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn the ISO to a DVD, then boot from the DVD from BIOS boot menu.\n\n*Raw copy the ISO to an USB stick, then boot from the USB stick from BIOS boot menu.\n\n\nFor a more detailed description of these installation methods see: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop (thanks @David Foerster)\n\nA: You will need an Ubuntu installation disk.\nIf you have another computer you can download Ubuntu and burn it to a DVD or an USB. You can do that from any operating system. How you do that from anything other than Ubuntu  I leave up to the reader. Ubuntu has an option called \"startup disk creator\" so we have it pretty easy.\nProblem arise if this is the only system you have. Besides using the computer from someone else (parents, siblings, friends etc.) you can also purchase an installation DVD. You can buy a single dvd for 5.04 pounds with the 64-bit version. If you want a 32-bit version this is no longer an option (current systems will not be 32-bit).\nInstalling it is the same as with a system with an operating system in you: you boot from the media it is on and follow the instructions.\nWhat you also need to consider is that Ubuntu is NOT a gaming platform at the moment. Yes we have games and there is a game tool called Steam. But it is very limited in what games you can play. You can forget about playing high end Windows games. Valve will announce an update to the OpenGL driver soon and it looks pretty promising. If you want to play those you will also need to purchase a Windows operating system. \n\nA: Yes you can install Ubuntu. For your \"high-end games\" install Wine: sudo apt-get install wine. If you're not too savvy with Wine install Playonlinux: sudo apt-get install playonlinux. Works with most Windows based games like World of Warcraft and others. You have to have the installation CDs still. Hope that helps.\n", "Q: File Deletion system I understand that for instance on a Windows system that when you delete a file that in fact it is not deleted as such immediately, but that the file is just marked meaning that other files can override it. This means then that some deleted files can then be recovered after their deletion.\nIs there a similar system on Ubuntu? And if so is there a way to get it so that the deleted files, before their actual deletion, are encrypted or something so that if they are recovered then they cannot be read?\nI am running Ubuntu 14.10.\n\nA: You're looking for wipe.  I'm not sure if there's a way to make that the default delete handler though.\n\nA: This is actually a property of the filesystem, not the OS. Most filesystems don't delete the contents since it more efficient not do so. This is true for ext4 as well. Recovering file data is, therefore, possible; metadata, on the other hand, is more difficult.\n", "Q: How can I delete menus in Glade? I'm writing a program using Quickly and I can't figure out how to delete menu bar entries.\n\nA: There are 2 different ways to edit the menu items.

Click that to bring up a new dialog where you can change the entries.\n\n*In the \"Hierarchy\" tab you'll see all entries which can be added/removed/edited.\n\n\n\n\nOption 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Search and select the menubar in the widget tree\n\n*Unfold the child widgets\n\n*These are your menu entries.

I've set \"PermitEmptyPasswords yes\" in the config file and restarted the service.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS.\n\nA: What you're looking for is anonymous SSH access. I found an article for SFTP, which applies to SSH too, if you leave out SFTP-specific stuff:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user:\nadduser --disabled-password anonymous\n\n\n\n*Make the password actually empty:\nsed -i -re 's/^anonymous:[^:]+:/anonymous::/' /etc/passwd /etc/shadow\n\n\n\n*Allow blank passwords for SSH sessions in PAM: edit /etc/pam.d/sshd and replace the line that reads @include common-auth with:\nauth [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so nullok\nauth requisite pam_deny.so\nauth required pam_permit.so\n\n\n\n*Allow blank passwords for SSH sessions of anonymous in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nMatch user anonymous\n    PermitEmptyPasswords yes\n\n\n\n*Restart sshd:\nsystemctl reload ssh.service\n\nI didn't try it myself, but it looks plausible, since my first thought for the culprit was PAM.\n", "Q: How to restore btrfs snapshot with out reboot?

Frequently it happens that some programs such as Google Chrome browser consume 100% CPU and most of my laptops memory.\nI want to have a responsive OS all the time, it means that I want to be able to switch between programs and move my mouse on the screen or switch to a tty and give commands to the OS. Therefore I look for a way to configure the OS to reserve lets say 10% of system resources for itself. Currently Ubuntu does not behave this way, frequently chrome consumes all my CPU and memory and then the system becomes unresponsive, and of course I can't wait more that a minute or two so I have to long press power button.\nIs there any way to make Ubuntu to be always responsive? At least to that extent that I can kill the resource hungry program? ( I know the kernel will eventually kill some programs to free some space but I want to force it to do it either faster or reserve more resources for itself)\nVersion: UBUNTU 14.04\n~$ uname -a\nLinux spielplatz 3.13.0-45-generic #74-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 13 19:36:28 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz\nRAM: 8GB\n\nUpdate (8 October 2017)\nThe best solution that I have found so far is using cgroups. There is a gist for that.\n\nA: I've used  cpulimit to \"throttle\" out-of-control CPU hungry programs before (Xfce4 Mailwatch Plugin gets hung up & grabs 100% CPU sometimes). cpulimit is a:\n\n\ntool for limiting the CPU usage of a process  \ncpulimit is a simple program that attempts to limit the CPU usage of a process (expressed in percentage, not in CPU time). This is useful to control batch jobs, when you don't want them to eat too much CPU. It does not act on the nice value or other priority stuff, but on the real CPU usage.\n    Besides it is able to adapt itself to the overall system load, dynamically and quickly. \n\n\nIt works by monitoring the target process, and sending \"the SIGSTOP and SIGCONT signals to a process, both to verify that it can control it and to limit the average amount of CPU  it  consumes.\" See:\n\n\n*\n\n*cpulimit on packages.ubuntu.com\n\n*http://limitcpu.sourceforge.net/\n\n*How To Limit CPU Usage Of A Process With cpulimit (Debian/Ubuntu)\nIt should make the rest of your OS more responsive, but I've tried it on Firefox and it tends to render it much less responsive, so may not be the best answer for the Chrome browser. Searching for ways to speed up Chrome itself might be more fruitful.\nIf you just want a good way to see how much CPU & RAM is in use, and what processes are using them, I'd suggest a system monitoring program (like top, htop, I prefer conky), then when you see something eating all your cpu or ram you can close/restart, etc.\n\nIf you're interested in knowing what programs get scheduled to run first, look into scheduling priority & \"niceness\". Perhaps you could make Chrome act \"nicer\" without crippling it.\nHere's a clip from info coreutils 'nice invocation':\n\n\n'nice' prints a process's \"niceness\", or runs a command with modified\n    niceness.  \"niceness\" affects how favorably the process is scheduled in\n    the system.  \nNiceness values range at least from -20 (process has high priority\n    and gets more resources, thus slowing down other processes) through 19\n    (process has lower priority and runs slowly itself, but has less impact\n    on the speed of other running processes).  Some systems may have a\n    wider range of niceness values; conversely, other systems may enforce\n    more restrictive limits.  An attempt to set the niceness outside the\n    supported range is treated as an attempt to use the minimum or maximum\n    supported value.\nA niceness should not be confused with a scheduling priority, which\n    lets applications determine the order in which threads are scheduled to\n    run.  Unlike a priority, a niceness is merely advice to the scheduler,\n    which the scheduler is free to ignore.  Also, as a point of\n    terminology, POSIX defines the behavior of 'nice' in terms of a \"nice\n    value\", which is the nonnegative difference between a niceness and the\n    minimum niceness.  Though 'nice' conforms to POSIX, its documentation\n    and diagnostics use the term \"niceness\" for compatibility with\n    historical practice.\n\n\nAnd here are a few useful-looking links about scheduling\n\n\n*\n\n*Scheduling (computing) - Linux - Wikipedia\n\n*Completely Fair Scheduler - Wikipedia\n\n*Scheduling in Linux - Project CSCI 560 - Old, but looks like a good overview (despite the spelling error in the 2nd sentence)\n\n\n\nAnd muru's comment/post on Cgroups (on ArchWiki) looks good, about limiting ram, looks like it could limit CPU cores & \"shares\" too (\"By default all groups have 1024 shares. A group with 100 shares will get a ~10% portion of the CPU time\").\nThe first paragraph of the ArchWiki article also mentions this potentially useful  option, though I think they're mainly for limiting users/groups, see:man pam_limits & man limits.conf\n\n\n*\n\n*User Limits Made Easy ServerWatch.com tutorial\n\n*Understanding PAM limits, pam.d, pam_limits.so, and /etc/pam.d/login\n", "Q: How to spoof a USB device's Product and Vendor ID?

I have more experience on Solaris)\nThis might be related to the problems I faced configuring Samba on Ubuntu 15.04 over the last few days. In my configuration, I was simply trying to set up shares on several Ubuntu desktops and a Windows 10 desktop, on a home network.\nThe symptoms I experienced were that Nautilus would be able to browse the network, but when I tried to authenticate, it would either fail and re-prompt for the password, or appear to succeed, but then cause Nautilus to crash or hang. On other occasions, it would connect, and I could successfully create files in the shared directories.\nAfter reading a very large number of posts by others on similar subjects, I set debug level 10 on both the smbclient and the backend nmbd and smbd daemons and compared successful and unsuccessful connections.\nThe comparisons highlighted two problems which, once I'd fixed both of them, resolved my problems. \nFirst, my host names were resolving to multiple IP addresses. This is because I have, in the past, connected the same machines to the router via WiFi and via ethernet. Because each interface has a different MAC address, the router has DHCP'ed different IP addresses to them, but used the same hostname.\nThis outcome can be observed if you use something like nslookup to resolve your hostname (here, home-file-svr only has a single address fortunately):\n\n$ nslookup home-file-svr\nServer:     127.0.1.1\nAddress:    127.0.1.1#53\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   home-file-svr.home\nAddress: 192.168.1.68\n\nI made the mistake of changing the hostnames the router used for these systems by adding -wifi and -wired suffixes in its home network setup (on the router), and then found that it wasn't resolving the names to local systems at all, and had bizarrely resolved to names on the Internet. So, in summary for this section, ensure that your hostname resolves to a single address.\nSecond, and much harder to debug, was why an smbclient connection would fail the first time, then work, then later fail again.\n\n$ smbclient //home-file-svr/public -U tim\nEnter tim's password: \nsession setup failed: NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL\n smbclient //home-file-svr/public -U tim\nEnter tim's password: \nDomain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 4.1.13-Ubuntu]\nsmb: > \n\nFurthermore, this only happened when there was more than one system up on the network. The culprit turned out to be winbind. Comparing the traces showed that the first connection attempt tries to create a cache entry for the GID to SID mapping with a large negative time (using the Unix zero time date - 1970). The second attempt didn't, and succeeds.\nRemoving winbind from all Ubuntu systems worked for my network as I don't have/haven't set up a Windows domain on my network.\n", "Q: How do I create a .conf file? On start up I get this message:\nSupport for cores revision ox17 and ox18 disabled by module param allsupport=0. Try b43.allhwsupport=1\n\nI found an answer which stated I needed to create the file /etc/modprobe.d/local-b43.conf\nI don't know how to do this. At the moment it will boot the system without the Network Manager which I can then manually switch on by typing:\n   gksu service network-manager start\n\n\nA: I don't think your system in helped by having both Network Manager and Wicd competing for control. I recommend you remove Wicd. Let's create the .conf file. In a terminal:\ngksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/local-b43.conf\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you haven't the text editor gedit. Add a single line:\noptions b43 allhwsupport=1\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor. Reboot.\nIf it still doesn't work as expected, from the terminal:\nsudo -i\nrm /etc/modprobe.d/local-b43.conf\necho \"blacklist b43\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\necho \"blacklist ssb\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nexit\n\nReboot and tell us the result.\nYour /etc/network/interfaces asks eth0 to start automatically, however, you are using wireless. Please do:\ngksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces\n\nChange the file to comment out the eth0 stanza:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n#auto eth0\n#iface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nProofread carefully, save and close the text editor. Reboot and test.\n\nA: If you wish to create a blank file, simply do touch /etc/modprobe.d/local-b43.conf. I'm assuming you'll need to add stuff to that file, and opening it in vim, nano or any other editor will automatically create it upon save.\n", "Q: Upgrade to 14.10 messed up resolution Upgrade from 14.04 to 14.10 eliminated the 1920x1080 screen settings that were in use under 14.04.

How can I delete a snapshot  that contain in itself other snapshots?

In order to delete the top-level, you must first delete the lower levels.  \nYou can get a list of the subvolumes with the btrfs subvolume list command.  The -o option should let you filter the results to just the ones you care about, but feel free to experiment.

(There is only 1 .deb file on my desktop - the correct driver). \n\nA: I suggest that you download the DKMS package* and all dependencies that you don't have on a computer with a working internet connection.\nThen, simply put it on a USB drive and plug it into your PC. Run\nsudo dpkg -i /path/to/file/dkms_2.2.0.3-1.1ubuntu5_all.deb\n\nand enjoy the WiFi.\n\nAlternatively, plug your Mac into an Ethernet port and download the package that way. You'll get all the dependencies without too much complication.\n\nA: The package you installed has unresolved dependencies. Run\napt-get install -f\n\nto install them and configure the bcmwl-kernel-source package. This would be the most simple course of action, but unfortunately you need a working internet connection, so this is only possible, if you can establish a temporary wired internet connection through some way.\n", "Q: Oracle Java plugin not recognized by Firefox 35.0.1 I have added symbolic links pointing to libnpjp2.so of jdk1.8.0_25 (in jdk1.8.0_25/jre/lib/i386/) to the following locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins\n\n*/usr/lib/firefox-extensions/plugins\n\n*/home/(myusername)/.mozilla/plugins\n\n\nWith no success. Going to about:plugins and about:extensions shows that firefox is not seeing the links, or not using them successfully. I have restarted both firefox and my computer and the problem persists.\nThe same symbolic link worked fine prior to firefox requesting permission to update. After finishing updating and restarting, the plugin is not recognized or used. I am currently using the 32-bit plugin from 32-bit Java with 32-bit firefox on a 32-bit lubuntu installation.

Fresh install and everything.  I have a GeForce 610 video card with an HDMI out, and the PC is hooked up to a TV.  The video transmits fine - but the audio does not.  There is no audio at all.  When you go to the volume control, it says that the GF119 HDMI Audio Controller is there, and shows the volume from the screen - but the port (HDMI / DisplayPort) is \"unplugged\".  Obviously, since I can see the video, that is not true.\nThe weird thing is that, at one point while setting up the computer, I did manage to get sound.  However, I rebooted later (adjusted some video settings) and the sound was gone.\nI realize that this might have very little to do with ubuntu, and is probably an NVIDIA problem, but I am at my wits end here (I'm been fighting this thing for over a year, and now this new solution is SO CLOSE, and yet so far).\nOther info:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am using the proprietary driver for NVIDIA (no other driver seemed to transmit the video correctly).\n\n*Going through the NVIDIA configuration, there are no configurable options for the audio output that I have found.\n\n*NVIDIA driver version is 331.113\n\n*When updating my video card settings (which is what prompted the reboot), I had to save a xorg.conf file to preserve the settings over the reboot.  This was generated by the NVIDIA program\n\n\nAgain, at one point during the setup, I did indeed get sound over the HDMI to the TV.  At that time, it registered that the HDMI audio output was not unplugged.  However, whatever triggered that wonderful success is not there anymore, and I am having the damnedest time fixing it.\nAny articles I have found on the topic are 2 years old, and even after trying their solutions, they don't seem to work for me.\n\nA: As it turns out, I am a dork.  When in the audio settings, in the farthest-right tab of profiles, the profile for the HDMI was set to \"unplugged\".  Why that is even an option, who knows.  However, I changed it to the \"plugged in\" profile, and everything worked fine.\n\nA: In my case, xrandr displayed:\nHDMI-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nHDMI-2 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 509mm x 286mm\n...and the default sound output was HDMI-1, when I changed it to HDMI-2 the sound worked fine.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.10 won't update or shutdown I started up my computer and used the terminal to check some network settings, but when I tried to turn it off again, a message shows up at the bottom of the shut down menu:\n\"GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied: Operation not permitted\"\n\nI figured it had something to do with needing to update, but when I tried to do that, it gives me the message:\nYou are not allowed to perform this action\n\nYou don't have the required privileges to perform this action.\n\nWhy would it tell me that when I'm the ONLY user!?\nI'm currently using Lubuntu 14.10, please help me!\n\nA: I have a similar problem on Lubuntu 14.04, with the added nuisance of a bunch of error boxes popping up on booting.

I have a computer that only accepts CD's, can't boot from USB at all, and I have a bunch of 600MB CD's. The Lubuntu install image is closer than many, at 700MB, but not quite close enough to be able to burn it. I don't want to start from a server install as it doesn't have wireless (it's a desktop) and I'm sending it to someone after installation so they need to be able to, as novice computer users, autonomously set up the thing. I need it to install with the full GUI but none of the normally included programs, like the mail client, music players, that kind of thing since they can install all of that on site with direction once it's connected to ethernet and they open the browser. Any ideas how I can install Lubuntu on this thing from an image that will fit on a CD?\n\nA: Instead of using CD's you could try network-boot the machine on the minimal ISO (if Lubuntu comes with netboot stuff)\nI would then install Lubuntu to the desktop, followed by rebooting to the desktop hard drive and running \nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-core\n\nYou may need to modify /etc/apt/sources.list to a non local server and then run \nsudo apt-get update\n\nYou may also want to use \nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-core --no-install-recommends\n\nHowever I have not tried this.\n\nA: Yep, you can use the mini.iso instead. It's like 32mb total and it does an install similar to tasksel like Debian or Ubuntu server where you can choose what to install and it will install it. This also allows the option to not install all the bloat you normally get with a desktop install.\nBTW, I do not believe you should install any of the \"live\" desktops listed. I believe those are not for installation purposes.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nI believe 14.04 installs a minimal command line environment first, then reboot and type\ntasksel\n\n14.10 and newer have a better interface that lets you choose the desktop or apps to install right away. Just choose command line install or graphical install (I think they are actually the same).\nNOTE: because of a bug in tasksel, DO NOT use tasksel to uninstall packages. ONLY use tasksel to install.\n\nUPDATE\nI think I found what you are looking for, it's called \"alternate install\" for Lubuntu and it's for pcs that can't handle the full Lubuntu version and or need to install using a CD rather than a DVD or a USB. The iso is 617mB, however, when you burn the iso to disk it should fit within 600 because the 617 includes reserved space, title of the file, etc ...\nhttp://cdimages.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/trusty/release/lubuntu-14.04-alternate-i386.iso\nAlso, other processor versions (for older processors) are available at the Lubuntu/Alternate_ISO wiki.\nFinally, if you don't have more than 700mB of RAM, you should select the installer from the first boot menu and do not select the installer from the \"try Lubuntu\" interface as the \"try Lubuntu\" option uses 200mB RAM to run the desktop.\n\nA: I suppose the machine has USB. Then it's possible to boot from Ultimate Boot CD and run Plop Boot manager from it to boot from the usb stick. (other boot managers on UBCD but Plop was the one I got working)\n\nA: I found an alternate method that works...I created a grub rescue CD and then used that to chain load a LiveUSB stick, but at the same time I'd still really like to know how I could custom make an install image without some of the included software suite...all of it being possible to obtain from the ubuntu software center.\n\nA: There are some bigger CDs out there(700MB+). If you are able to buy them, try it out and get yourself a live CD, with the normal install. I, myself, have a 12 year old PC that runs Windows XP and I installed the normal installation, works perfectely. If you're really afraid that full/desktop won't work, try out the alternate, as @mchid said. I think 15.04's .iso is too big for a CD, so I think 13.04 or similar will suffice.\n", "Q: Awesome WM eof expected near end I'm trying to add the network usage widget shown in the Awesome wiki but I'm running into an error.

I have problem when do tiling terminal in Xubuntu 14.10. Those terminal emulators (I've test with xfce4-terminal, xterm, and gnome-terminal) can be resized only by width/height of font they are using, thus it can not resized by 1px, see Fig 1.\n\nFig 1: When I hold mouse cursor at bottom-right corner of terminal window (cursor not included in the figure), they show current size of the window. If I moves cursor to the right, terminal window will expand its width by size of 1 character at a time.\nNow when I do full screen tiling (maximizing window), the terminal window will stretch its body to cover all screen, see Fig 2.\n\nFig 2: Maximize terminal window, you can see a line [ NORMAL > ... < 100% < 1:1 ] ends with blank space that its width is shorter than font's width.\nBut when I do partial tiling (for example, left-tiling by moving the window to left edge so it expand to eats up half-left of the entire screen), the terminal window will not trying to stretch like when I do maximizing, see Fig 3.\n\nFig 3: Left-tiling terminal window that leaves space from right-tiling web browser and bottom edge.\nHere's the problem, if I do partial tiling and then open a new terminal tab (ctrl+shift+t), terminal window will expand it's size vertically, which will kick some lines out of screen (Fig 4). That's very annoying.\n\nFig 4: Last line (:q!) of left-tiling terminal is kicked out of the screen after a new tab is opened.\nThis problem is not occur with maximize window (like in Fig 2).\nThis problem is also not occur in Unity/Ubuntu 14.10.\nSo I wonder if a window (not only terminal) can be partially maximize? Or there are other workarounds out there? (or this is just a bug and should be reported to issue tracker?)\n\nA: I have the same problem using Xubuntu with the default terminal emulator and window manager and have nearly gone insane trying to fix it. I have a partial answer and, unfortunately, no real fix for you.\nAs you mentioned, the window size in a terminal emulator (at least in xterm and xfce4-terminal, the ones that I tested) is handled in terms of font size rather than pixels, which one might expect. This is acceptable behavior according to the X window system manpage: \"The WIDTH and HEIGHT parts of the geometry specification are  usually measured in either pixels or characters, depending on the application.\"\nThis is why there are gaps around the terminal window when doing partial tiling: the window manager maximizes the window within that half of the display while using whole multiples of the font size for the dimensions. There may be a way to add offsets or fix this with in-depth xfwm or X configuration tweaks that are beyond me (I'm still pretty new to Linux).\nThe reason that the window takes up the full screen area when maximized seems to have to do with a setting that (I think) is on by default in a new Xubuntu install. If you open the Xfce4 settings manager, go to Window Manager Tweaks, and click the Accessibility tab, there is an option to \"Hide frame of windows when maximized.\" When this option is checked, there are no gaps around the maximized terminal window; when it is unchecked, there are. \nUnfortunately, this option only applies to maximized windows and not windows that are \"maximized\" to half of the screen by partial tiling. Disabling it will at least make the gaps around the windows consistent in both cases.\nAs far as your issues with the tab bar pushing lines off of the screen, tiling the window again after opening a new tab will bring the bottom of the window back into view.

Such problem happens to Windows 7 and XP too. I don't know thy only a few computers have this problem. \n I have searched a lot online and haven't found solution. \n\nA: It´s probably a windows problem. Windows assumes that it is the only OS running on your computer (and so it is trying to load the entire hard drive but it can´t). Try to mount the windows partition into ubuntu and save your required data. After you finished that step you have to reinstall windows and declare that you wish to install it parallel to Ubuntu. After installing you need to reinstall your programs and load your data back from the hdd used for saving it.\nA different (but really complicated) way of solving the problem is to mount the windows partition and fix the NTFS headers manually. But for doing such things you REALLY need to know what you´re doing. If you do so: you need to fix the partition size inside the 'registry of your windows partition' from the entire hard drive size to the new size of your partition. But note: I tried this several times and it only worked once for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 on Thinkpad T440S keyboard Issue I installed Ubuntu Trusty on a brand new lenovo Thinkpad.

However, files outside user’s home directory\n  need to be changed manually.\"\n\nWith that said. Your UID will not be changed automatically for any files outside of your /home/USER directory.\nIn order to regain access to your drive mounted in the users /media/USER directory, once again, I recommend following the above article to make sure you correctly changed the UID of all your files both in and out of '/home/USER`, so naturally your drive should be plugged in.\nHere is the code provided on the article mentioned above:\nTo assign a new UID to user called foo, enter:\n# usermod -u NEWUIDHERE foo\n\nTo assign a new GID to group called foo, enter:\n# groupmod -g NEWGIDHERE foo\n\nTo manually change files with old GID and UID respectively: (Outside of your home directory)\n# find / -group NEWUIDHERE -exec chgrp -h foo {} \\;\n# find / -user NEWGIDHERE -exec chown -h foo {} \\;\n\n\n\"The -exec command executes chgrp or chmod command on each file. The -h\n  option passed to the chgrp/chmod command affect each symbolic link\n  instead of any referenced file. Use the following command to verify\n  the same\"\n\n# ls -l /home/foo/\n# id -u foo\n# id -g foo\n# grep foo /etc/passwd\n# grep foo /etc/group\n\nThank you to Vivek Gite for this wonderful article!

(For ex. Utopic Unicorn) I was quite quizzed about, why Ubuntu is having this Code name. This names for the format of \"Adjective Animal\" (for ex, Trusty Tahr, Utopic Unicorn etc), it follows a rule of Adjective and Animal should start with same char and that too in alphabetical Order.\nI was just thinking, when this code names are really used, If I have a 14.04 version, I would say that I have a Ubuntu 14.04 rather than saying I have a Utopic Unicorn. But, I just like to know how peoples normally use this words.\n\nA: It is referenced in 'public speak' (you'll see it on this site a bit too). Generally it gets shortened to just the Adjective though. Trusty, or Oneric etc. It is also used in things like the apt repo lists also, eg: \ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty multiverse\n\nMy assumption is that it stems from Debian's use of codenames such as wheezy or sid or squeeze etc.\nTo me the version and codename are used interchangeably in the industry, though the codename is usually shortened to the adjective only.\n", "Q: Theoretical question about memory usage I'm wondering about following issue:\nTaken some abc console(no matter if bash,zsh or something) in some *nix system.\nIf I start some process stuff which uses 2MB of memory and then launch second instance of process stuff, how much memory will be used in total?\nIs it true that 4MB of memory now will be used?\n\nA: If the processes are both launched independently, we should assume that each process would run as if no other \"twin\" process is started (as long as they don't need to control the same resources, e.g. files). I think this is the case for most simple programs without GUI or any need to care about multiple instances.\nHowever, the system can avoid this and share constant static data between all process instances. This data can consist of the binary code, constants, shared libraries, etc... \nAdditionally, when you only care about physical RAM usage, you also have to think about the swap. Linux will push rarely used data to the swap partition/file on the hard disk to free some faster RAM as cache.\nSo to conclude: It is hard to tell how much memory will be used by many equal processes, because the kernel optimizes the usage by sharing constant data between the different instances, but you can be almost sure that it will be less than n times the usage of one single process.\n", "Q: bypass boot menu by listing all operating systems at grub menu i have installed two windows operating systems (windows 7 and windows server 12) then i installed  ubuntu 14.04. all are working fine. but now the problem is when my computer starts first grub screen appears with option (ubuntu and windows 7 loader ) when i select windows 7 loader , it takes me to other screen which shows boot menu ( windows 7 and windows server 12 ).\nit annoying, everytime i start my laptop i have to go through 2 selections, is there any way i can get list of all 3 operating systems at grub only , so that i can bypass one selection.\n\nA: Try Grub Customizer It allows the edit of menu entries contents or even create new ones. \nTo install, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

These are considerably easier to install from than Windows.\n\n*PPAs (Personal Package Archive) these are mini-repositories that can be created by anybody which which to store and redistribute software. Many applications have a developer PPA where they keep their nightly builds. After you add a PPA to your system, you can browse from the SC.\n\n*Other repositories: Some software (eg Chrome) hosts their own repository. You add the repo, and then you can install the software with one command or a few clicks via the SC.\n\n*.deb files. The options above are just databases containing .deb \"packages\" but they are also sometimes distributed on their own. They can be installed by double-clicking (which will open them in the SC). Automatic updates are not provided unless a newer version is available in the repos.\n\n*Binary installers (eg .run and .sh files). The above only work natively on Debian-based Linux distributions so some closed source software is only available as a cross-distribution installer. Automatic updates are generally not available so these are probably most equivalent to .exe installers.\nPast that point, yes, you're looking at needing to extract, make and sudo make install (or sudo checkinstall which creates a package and makes removing/updating easier)... But I need to stress that you would go through exactly the same battle on Windows if there wasn't a binary build for you. I freely admit it's rare in Windows, but it's actually also a lot harder to compile things there.\n\nFor the examples you gave:\n\n\n*\n\n*Teamspeak does have a binary installer, just like a .exe and this can be run from the GUI, you just need to mark it as executable (which is more work than in Windows, but for safety's sake)\n\n*Powerpoint doesn't have a Linux version. Your fight represents needing to install and use Wine. You could have just used LibreOffice Impress which comes with Ubuntu. It'll do 90% of what Powerpoint does.\n\n\nNot all your old applications will work, you'll need replacements.\nYou need to learn to adapt. Some things are just objectively easier from the command line but they'll seem perverse or scary if you're not used to doing things like that. I understand that; relatively few of us started on Linux. It all gets better with time.\nAs for other problems, we try to help where we can but you have to respect that Ubuntu isn't Windows by design. Some things are going to be different. Some people find change hard. If you can accept that philosophy, you'll find using Ubuntu a much more enjoyable experience.\n", "Q: How to force particular protocol through particular connection?

I usually obtain required packages from a system with the same os installed. But when I install programs this way I usually ended up with broken packages on my system which is not fixable with the following:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -f \n\nSometimes the last command wants to delete grub or some obviously essential packages from my system! or after performing the last command i can't install some programs for example:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n mysql-client : Depends: mysql-client-5.5 but it is not going to be installed\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nhow should i fix such problems?\nis there any way to save system status before installing programs this way and restore system to its previous state if installing process doesn't go well?\nis there any way to fix such problems manually without depending on package manager?\nI wish in Ubuntu it were possible to install programs isolated from each other like it is in windows.\n\nA: Firstly, you mention this is not the case in Windows.  You're actually wrong - in Windows the dependencies for software need to be downloaded too.\nNow to your issue.  The problem with trying to install all the packages you need from an offline state is that you have no way to fix dependency problems.  What apt and such do is they pull a list of all the dependencies, determine which ones need to be installed, and then try and install them.  If it cannot install the dependencies, it fails.\nYou bring up mysql-client as an example.  That's a metapackage, as in it refers to other packages, and doesn't contain any real executables.  It relies on specific versions of mysql-client as well and needs to download them.\nThere's no real way to avoid this with an offline box.  The only real way to avoid this issue is to actually connect your box to a network with either a Debian mirror on it or internet access, and set up firewall rules to restrict outbound traffic to only reach to update servers.\n\nA: You didn't say how you install the packages you downloaded. If you simply get the .deb files from the other system, then I bet you're using dpkg --install to install the .deb directly.\nAs you have found out by now, dpkg can't resolve and handle dependency issues like apt can.\nOne way to \"roll back\" the changes is to use apt-get to remove the packages you tried to install.\nOne thing you could try is dpkg-offline (disclaimer: I wrote it). On your on-line system, get an ISO for the Ubuntu version you have on your off-line system. Run dpkg-offline indicating which packages you want to install. It will use apt-get to download the packages and all their dependencies, and give you a tarball with a few helper scripts to run on the offline system. It will add an \"offline\" repository for those packages, so then you can use apt-get and have it work out the dependencies.\n", "Q: uninstalling 'no-ip' from the terminal - how?
