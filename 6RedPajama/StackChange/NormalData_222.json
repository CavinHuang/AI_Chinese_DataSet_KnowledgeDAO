["Q: Drivers for ASUS mid-audio 892 I'm running 14.04. I installed an ASUS mid-audio 892 card that's supposed to be supported, but the system just won't see it. I found drivers for Red Hat, etc., but not for Ubuntu/debian.  Help?  Thanks.  CC \n\nA: Though am deaf to sound on any devices in the world here, I know how this works on Ubuntu. This is because of missing libraries:\nEasy work-around can work it out:\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install synaptic (the debian-package manager with enough packages)\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall amarok rhythmbox --fix-missing\nsudo reboot\n\nIn case still no sound you should not be frightened by upgrade-suggestion to Ubuntu 15.04.03 (LTS3) only when there is a window popping up, but this is not a must. Only if wished and if necessary then do in the end :\n\nsudo apt-get install dist-upgrade (takes longer time)\n\nIn case of still-no-sound ... let me know, and I adjust this thread.\n", "Q: Redirection to ad pages in browsers I have a serious problem when visiting web pages, with anything in any moment, as you can see in the screenshots.\nphoto1 - ubuntu-es | photo 2 - ask ubuntu |\ni.imgsafe.org/373b693.png | i.imgsafe.org/647e06c.png | i.imgsafe.org/638cecf.png | i.imgsafe.org/61d3cf8.png | i.imgsafe.org/373b693.png\nWhen I visit a page it is caught and present \"Sponsored\", \"Search Results\", \"Sponsored Listings\" or in spanish too, \"fichas patrocinadas\" \"enlaces patrocinados\".\nThe phishing? take the icon of the web and put an star yellow icon width a dark background. The URL doesn't change. If I refresh many times the page can or cannot show correctly.\nI thought that only happens in Firefox for the fake flash plug-in, or something like that, but the same thing occurs in Chromium. Looking at the page code I can't find anything, just some suspect scripts, but don't know.  The pages voodoo.com, doubleclick.net appear in the code, and sometimes redirections go to those sites.\nThe same thing occurs in another machine with no contact with my notebook, on another internet connection, and a friend time ago had the same problem.\nI reinstalled Firefox, but nothing happened, upgraded my software and the same.\nSorry for my English, but what's happening with my Ubuntu installation? Has someone had the same problem? Is it adware, a worm, a package, a malicious plug-in? Ubuntu is the newest version, I only installed a PPA for fingerprint but now I delete them. What can I do?

About the router hijacked it sounds a bit more credible.\nAre you sure isn't an Ubuntu problem? And if that true, how can I know it?, what can I do?\nI rent an apartment that came with a network connection, but without easy physical access to the router, because a neighbor shared to me, how can I check if my router is effectively hijacked? And what countermeasure can I apply?  Suggestions or links are welcome!\nThis is my /etc/resolv.conf:\nnameserver 127.0.1.1\nsearch fibertel.com\nAnother strange thing: At work with Firefox when searching in google repeatedly I had a page that ask me for a captcha, supposedly for strange traffic networking, unusual traffic from my computer network, because I distrusting it, don't put the captcha and reinstall my Firefox, don't appear again. At home it happened two times, don't know if normal. Searching, the page is legit and is really a Google page, but why does the Captcha appear? I'm not behind a proxy in my home. I mention it because the problem is simultaneous, and hasn't happened to me before since have Ubuntu many years ago. Thanks again.\n\nUpdate 2, thanks to user4901968\n(the comment was too long to put it behind yours)\nI upgraded my router but at the moment nothing seems to change, but it seems you are right in that it is my router configuration.\nI have a dlink-300 router, it was at version v1.04 and now in 1.05, I do it with my saved configuration file, because if I only change firmware I keep without web connection, some thing in that configuration file is specific to give me connection, and perhaps have the malicious code, I need to contact with owner to ask him. I put in the nameserver you told me to (I didn't know it, thanks!) but it seems the same.\nIt's early to say whether the problem continues, because it doesn't always appears, or I don't know how to directly find it. For example, if I go to support.dlink.com.br, which is an invalid link it give me the page with ads, and if I visit it with my smartphone connection it only gives me an error, but at moment it doesn't happen with valid links like askubuntu.com luckily.\nAt the moment it is not a problem with Ubuntu, but let me continue asking here, where if not?  So far you've directed me to go by, so I appreciate you continue doing :)\n\nA: You should check to see if your router is hijacked (yes, it is possible), specifically the DNS settings.  Also try booting from an Ubuntu Live CD and see if the problem is also there.  Try disabling all extensions and plugins temporarily to see if it fixes it.  Also make sure your system is not using a proxy and is getting DNS settings from your router.  Your router config page should be able to be accessed at 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1  Try reseting all of the settings to default, then running a firmware upgrade.  If you cannot access the router config page, you can try replacing the contents of /etc/resolv.conf with:\n    nameserver 208.67.222.123\nIn the DNS setting of the router config, set the first server to:\n208.67.222.123\n\nand the secondary server to:\n208.67.220.123\n\nIt seems your system is using the DNS server I had you set it to first, and if it has no entry for a valid site, uses the bad DNS server as the secondary server. This explains the ad pages on non-existent domains, but proper function of valid pages.\n", "Q: Errors when installing wine in ubuntu 14.04 LTS I have followed the below procedures to install wine in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:\nadd-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa \napt-get update \napt-get install -y wine\n\n\nHowever, I see the below error messages:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n\n unity-control-center : Depends: libcheese-gtk23 (>= 3.4.0) but it is not going to be installed\n                        Depends: libcheese7 (>= 3.0.1) but it is not going to be installed\n\n wine : Depends: wine1.6 but it is not going to be installed or\n                 wine1.8 but it is not going to be installed\n\nE: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.\n\n\nAfter I did a check on the system, unity-control-center has already been installed.

However my lockscreen has a very small font for everything and it's really hard to see it. Sometimes when I close my laptop and it enters sleep mode, I'll open it and lockscreen will have a bigger font and everything just looks bigger, but then it'll go away\n\nA: High DPI Screens Configuration\nPreparations\nInstall dConf and the Unity Tweak Tool from the Ubuntu Software Center.\nAlternatively install from terminal: \nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor unity-tweak-tool\nAccept any other dependencies it may require. This programs let you change values for different settings of the system.  \nScale the Display\nUsing dConf look for scale-factorUnder under com->ubuntu->user-interface. This property will change the size of many things but it will change the size of the icons you want to change.\nOn my laptop\nScale 8:\nScale 13: \nAs you can see the icons change size. You will notice other things also change size.\nThe scale value is specific for each display. In my examples HDMI2 is the external HDMI monitor and eDIP is the laptop integrated monitor.\n\nPer monitor scale factor for all user interface components. The values are stored in a dictionary where the keys are IDs of monitors and the values are the scale factors. The scale factors are not the traditional float scale factors that one might expect. Instead they are integers that need to be divided by 8 before being used as regular scale factors. That limits the number of possible scalings applied to the UI without jeopardizing flexibility (there is still enough possible scalings for all devices out there). This limiting allows for better testing since there is now only a finite number of possible scalings. The scale factor also maps directly to the grid units used in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit where one grid unit is exactly equal to 'scale factor' number of pixels.\n\nI suggest you change the value only by 1 at first to test that you are changing the scale of the correct monitor.\nLauncher Icons\nIf you don't like the size of the Unity Launcher then you can go into System Settings -> Appearance and change the size of the Launcher icons. This will not change back the size of the other icons.\nAlternatively you can use dConf again under org->compiz->profiles->unity->plugins->unityshell modify icon-size to change the size of the Launcher Icons.\nLogin Screen\nAs of changing the size of the icons at the login screen (ubuntu-greeter) it is not as straight forward. A bug has been reported on this subject but its importance appears as undecided.\nFirefox\nFrom this site, I found that entering about:config in the Firefox address bar will let you change some settings.\nChange the value of layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to 1.5 or 2. It takes a floating(Decimal) value so play with it until you like it.\nFont Size (Including Firefox)\nInstall the Unity Tweak Tool. From here you can change the system wide font sizes.

Installing Virtualbox and Extension Pack via terminal finally worked for me:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ext-pack\n\n\nA: i ran into this issue but the solution was rather simple. Just downgrade the Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack (instead of 5.1.12-112440 used just 5.0.0).\nGood luck yall.\n", "Q: Distinct overwrite/insert cursor in GNOME Terminal or shell I remember the good old MS‑DOS use to show a block cursor in overwrite mode and a thin vertical line cursor in Insert mode.\nIs there a way to achieve a similar distinction (not necessarily shape based, this may as much a colour distinction) in GNOME Terminal or in a shell ? The latter, is because I feel this may perhaps be the Shell who would have to handles this, while I'm not sure. Or maybe the TTY emulation? Finally, I don't even know which track to follow.\n\nA: The terminal doesn't have the concept of insert vs. overwrite mode. It's only known by the application running inside (e.g. shell, text editor...).\nSome terminal emulators (including gnome-terminal) allow the cursor shape to be set via escape sequences.\nSo what you need is to modify the desired application to set the cursor shape according to its state.\nAs far as I recall, neovim does this.\n", "Q: How can I easily scale a screenshot, taken from a high-DPI screen? Since I switched to a High DPI display, the screenshots I post are awkwardly big, example below.\nIs there a way to quickly make them look normal?\nPreferably something faster than firing up GIMP.\nIn particular, is there a hidden option for this in gnome-screenshot?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*There is probably no perfect tool, since the way to adapt Ubuntu to High DPI is not uniform (fonts, window decorations, programs, might have different scales), but a good tool would read these settings and figure out what's the best scale to use.\n\n*Preferably I would like to keep the ability of selecting only part of the screen (as in SHIFT+PRTSCR), and choosing the name of the file.\n\n*In case that matters, I always save my screenshots in $HOME/Pictures.\n\n\nA: 1. Make a screenshot as usual, then automatically scale the latest screenshot you took with a shortcut key.\nPlaced under a shortcut key, the script below will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the last added screenshot in your screenshot directory (which is ~/Picures, as you mentioned in a comment)\n\n*Scale the image into an arbitrary percentage\n\n*Rename and save the image as renamed_filename.png, where filename.png is the original filename.\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs the python3-pil library to be installed, which might not be the case on your system:\nsudo apt-get install python3-pil\n\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as resize_screenshot.py\n\n*Test- run the script by taking a screenshot and subsequently run the script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/resize_screenshot.py 80\n\nwhere 80 is the desired output size percentage. The script now created the resized copy of the last screenshot.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key: System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom SHortcuts. Add the command:\npython3 /path/to/resize_screenshot.py 80\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom PIL import Image\n\npercent = float(sys.argv[1])/100\n\n\npic_list = []\n# list all .png files in ~/Pictures\npic_dir = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/Pictures\"\nfiles = [pic_dir+\"/\"+f for f in os.listdir(pic_dir) if \\\n         all([f.endswith(\".png\"), not f.startswith(\"resized\")])]\n# create a sorted list + the creation date of relevant files\npics = [[f, int(os.stat(f).st_ctime)] for f in files]\npics.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n# choose the latest one\nresize = pics[-1][0]\n# open the image, look up its current size\nim = Image.open(resize)\nsize = im.size\n# define the new size; current size * the percentage\nnewsize = [int(n * percent) for n in size]\n# resize the image, save it as renamed file (keeping original)\nim.thumbnail(newsize, Image.ANTIALIAS)\nnewfile = pic_dir+\"/resized_\"+resize.split(\"/\")[-1]\nim.save(newfile, \"png\")\n\nAn example\nAn example of your image, resized by:\npython3 <script> 80\n\n\n\n2. Fully automatic option\nWhile the script above does its job on a shortcut key, you can make it fully automatically with a background script. All thye script does is check for new files in ~/Picures, and perform the rescale action as in the first script.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport time\n\npercent = float(sys.argv[1])/100\npic_dir = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/Pictures\"\n\ndef pics_list(dr):\n    return [pic_dir+\"/\"+f for f in os.listdir(pic_dir) if \\\n            all([f.endswith(\".png\"), not f.startswith(\"resized\")])]\n\ndef scale(f):\n    #open the image, look up its current size\n    im = Image.open(f)\n    size = im.size\n    # define the new size; current size * the percentage\n    newsize = [int(n * percent) for n in size]\n    # resize the image, save it as renamed file (keeping original)\n    im.thumbnail(newsize, Image.ANTIALIAS)\n    newfile = pic_dir+\"/resized_\"+f.split(\"/\")[-1]\n    im.save(newfile, \"png\")\n\np_list1 = pics_list(pic_dir)\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(2)\n    p_list2 = pics_list(pic_dir)\n    for item in p_list2:\n        if not item in p_list1:\n            scale(item)\n    p_list1 = p_list2\n\nHow to use\nThe setup is exactly as the script above (\"How to use\"), but instead of [4.], add it to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\npython3 /path/to/resize_screenshot.py 80\n\n3. Fully automatic option with a scale dialogue\nPractically the same script, but now with a scale dialogue, immediately after you saved the image to ~/Pictures:\n\nThis screenshot was automatically resized to 80% :)\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport time\nimport subprocess\n\n# --- change if you like the default scale percentage, as proposed by the slider:\ndefault_percent = 80\n# --- change if you like the screenshot directory\npic_dir = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/Pictures\"\n# ---\n\ndef pics_list(dr):\n    return [pic_dir+\"/\"+f for f in os.listdir(pic_dir) if \\\n            all([f.endswith(\".png\"), not f.startswith(\"resized\")])]\n\ndef scale(f, size):\n    #open the image, look up its current size\n    im = Image.open(f)\n    currsize = im.size\n    # define the new size; current size * the percentage\n    newsize = [int(n * size) for n in currsize]\n    # resize the image, save it as renamed file (keeping original)\n    im.thumbnail(newsize, Image.ANTIALIAS)\n    newfile = pic_dir+\"/resized_\"+f.split(\"/\")[-1]\n    im.save(newfile, \"png\")\n\np_list1 = pics_list(pic_dir)\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(2)\n    p_list2 = pics_list(pic_dir)\n    for item in p_list2:\n        if not item in p_list1:\n            try:\n                size = subprocess.check_output([\n                    \"zenity\", \"--scale\",\n                    \"--value=\"+str(default_percent),\n                    ]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n                scale(item, float(size)/100)\n            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n                pass\n    p_list1 = p_list2\n\nTo use\nSetup is exactly as above, apart from the command, now without scale percentage:\npython3 /path/to/resize_screenshot.py\n\nNote\nAs always, the background script practically uses no resources, unless your ~/Pictures directory is insanely huge :).\n\nA: With gnome-screenshot we can not scale the output.\nTo do so automatically we may assign another screenshot terminal application to a shortcut.\nExamples for screenshots at 50% size:\n\n*\n\n*Image Magick \nimport -resize to percent of original\n\n\n*\n\n*take screenshot of the whole desktop:\n     import -window root -resize 50% [-delay <value>] shot.png\n\n\n\n*take screenshot of a window (selectable by mouse):\n     import -window $(xdotool selectwindow) resize 50% shot.png\n\n\n\n*take screenshot of a window and display result:\n     import -window $(xdotool selectwindow) -resize 50% shot.png && display shot.png\n\n\n\n*load screenshot to any other external viewer (e.g. eog)\n     import -window $(xdotool selectwindow) -resize 50% shot.png && eog shot.png\n\n\n\n*scrot \n(manpage) output to Image Magic convert for selecting a screen area\n scrot <options> -e \"convert \\$f -resize 50% shot.png && rm \\$f\"\n <options>\n -s select window or rectangle with mouse\n -u use currently focused windows\n\nBelow example will display, then save a half-sized (50%) screenshot of a selected area or window using scrot's default filename (date/hour/minute/second/size) in our pictures directory:\n    scrot -s -e \"convert \\$f -resize 50% ~/Pictures/\\$f && display \\$f && rm \\$f\"\n\n", "Q: Is it safe to install Ubuntu on Samsung Laptop from 2013 What do I need to do to install Ubuntu on my Samsung Laptop from 2013?\nI heard that I can brick it. If I need to do an update then please give me instructions. Sorry for asking such an easy question. I'm a linux noob.\n\nA: It is NOT safe to install Ubuntu on that kind of laptops in UEFI mode.\nI tested it not long ago and got the laptop almost bricked.\nI had Ubuntu already installed and just wanted to test if the kernel workaround works OK for the well known firmware bug. So I swithched to UEFI mode.\nIt works partially. It is possible to revive the laptop, if you can find a relevant firmware and find a way to flash it. \nIt was not a total brick, because it was possible to reflash firmware from the external DVD using Windows and cleaning NVRAM, but still it is not an easy procedure, because Samsung does not provide download links for the firmware and the utilities do not let to flash firmware the same version as it is installed. I made really lots of efforts to restore booting.\nThe problem is with bad UEFI software that does not comply any standards.\nBut if you boot in CSM aka legacy mode, you can safely install Ubuntu.\nSamsung firmware developers and other people made two many obvious mistakes:\n\n\n*\n\n*They made a firmware that can be completely broken in UEFI mode from any OS installed. That is unaceptable for many reasons including security. Malware can brick the laptop easily using Windows too.\n\n*It is possible to flash firmware only using a Windows utility that checks the installed virsion and downloads firmware from Samsung sites. No direct download links.\n\n*Support of some models has been dropped and even the Windows utility does not find anything to flash now.\nIt is more funny that I bought a NP300E5X without Windows pre-installed. And it is not possible to restore firmware without having Windows.\nBut the hardware is good. And it is well suported by Linux.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu and Ubuntu-Mate at the same time? Can I install \"Ubuntu 15.10\" and \"Ubuntu-Mate 15.10\" at the same time in my PC?\n\nA: yes, you can. \nif you are asking about dual booting it won't cause any problem and it's a simple procedure. if you are looking for installing mate in your current ubuntu machine use mate ppa for ubuntu 15.10 or use there commands\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mate-dev/wily-mate\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mate-desktop-environment-core\n\n", "Q: what is the difference between freerdp and xrdp? i am new to ubuntu and rdp. \ni need to install rdp on ubuntu. what is the difference between freerdp and xrdp? are these two the same or equivalent? does installing xrdp also install freerdp? I have installed xrdp but now want freerdp, how to get freerdp?\nthanks!\n\nA: FreeRDP is an implementation of the remote desktop protocol (http://www.freerdp.com/) to connect to RDP-Servers.

Upon opening nautilus you will get the a full screen nautilus. F11 does not do anything and in the nautilus options is nothing to disable fullscreen mode.\nI uninstalled nautilus, reinstalled it, deleted its folder in ~/.config, rebooted several times without any success.\nThis seems to be a bug with compiz because this is not the first time I got windows stuck in such states. \nWhat can I do to get nautilus working normal again?\nUsing SUPER+S to get into the desktop overview lets you move nautilus to the side like in the second screenshot, but as soon as you click on it, it will turn to fullscreen mode again.\n\n\n\nA: First you need to kill all nautilus instances (not as root):\nkillall /usr/bin/nautilus\n\nThis should not show any running instances:\nps ax | grep nautilus\n\njust something like:\n4556 pts/18   S+     0:00 grep --color=auto nautilus\n\nThen just change the window size settings in dconf with:\ndconf write /org/gnome/nautilus/window-state/geometry \"'640x480+0+0'\"\ndconf write /org/gnome/nautilus/window-state/maximized false\n\nThis should resize the window settings.\n\nA: You can also accomplish this with a GUI in dconf-editor. \nFirst, killall nautilus (not as root). \nUnder org > gnome > geometry, set that to something less than the size of your monitor, and set Maximized to off.   \nNote that you may keep having to repeat this step.  If you accidentally move a Nautilus window to the top of the screen, it may repeatedly over-ride this setting and decide it will maximize without a top bar.  Set the size to 640X480 or something like that.  \n[EDIT]  despite having done these steps, I still get the issue occasionally.  I don't see an \"org > gnome > geometry\" field in dconf-editor under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  However there is a field \"org > gnome > nautilus\" where it is possible to affect the geometry of a window and whether it is maximized.  This only affects how nautilus starts a window if I understand correctly.  If I slide a window to the top of my home monitor, it automatically maximizes and the top bar dissappears, also it always stays on top of all other windows.  So far the only fix I've found is to \"killall nautilus\" and start again.  I've verified that the standard keyboard shortcuts and right-click options do not do anything but minimize the window, will not make it unmaximize.  \n\nA: If you want to use a visual interface, in Ubuntu 20.04 do this:\nopen dconf-editor; click in \"Go to\" and paste this path: \"/org/gnome/nautilus/window-state/\". Click the \"maximized\" option and then choose \"Use default value\". Then, \"go to\" again and paste \"/org/gnome/nautilus/window-state/\" then click \"geometry\" and choose the value that fits your taste. I used 640x480+0+0.\nThat's all\n", "Q: NTM - Network Traffic Monitor GUI I installed NTM and I have a few queries:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to launch it both from cl or using the icon but I do not know if it is running !\n\n*Whenever I tried to launch it from terminal I am getting \"Vector smash protection is enabled.\"\n\n*I keep receiving a message from OS (in the upper right corner) saying:\n\" NTM - Time slot An additional slot was used\" ?!\n\n*I would like to have&use the GUI because I am not that savvy with cl.\n\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: Click on terminal\nType in:\ngnome-system-monitor\n\nThen on the icon bar, right click on it and lock it to the bar.  \nYou'll be GUI from then on.\n\n", "Q: Terminal snap resizing issue I like having multiple terminal windows above having tabs, so I tile them up into separate corners. \nNow my question is if there's a way to fix these gaps that occur when snapping to corners. \nI'm using Ubuntu 15.10 (4.2.0-23-generic). It only happens with the terminal window, other applications do it without gaps.\nManually aligning by resizing doesn't work either, it moves in character increments.\nTo me it seems like an unnecessary limitation, seeing as the window resizes perfectly to the edges if snapped to the bottom or top of the screen, like this.\nCheers.\n\nA: Why don't you use Terminator?\nsudo apt-get install terminator\n\nYou can then split your terminal in so many tiles as you wish.

After installing Ubuntu and updating the system, the first thing I usually do is make sure that all applications use the preferred locale.

It will also cover Firefox and Thunderbird, for example. It is intended to use with apt-get together:\nsudo apt-get install $(check-language-support -l en)\n\n\nA: According to this guide, you first edit the file /etc/default/locale, or use:\n$ update-locale LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=POSIX\n\nand then you run:\n$ dpkg-reconfigure locales\n\n", "Q: How can I copy all files in a sub-directory of Downloads folder into another sub-directory in var/www/? I downloaded Magento 2.0 into Downloads folder and extracted all the files into temp_extract.  Now I want to copy all files inside temp_extract into var/www/magento.  I cannot figure out how to do it.  I tried several copy command-lines, but none worked. Also, I tried several file managers, including Gentoo, Xfe, PCManFM, and Nemo.  None of them helped.  I have given all permissions, i.e., d rwx rwx r-x, to magento directory.  With most file managers when I copy and paste the files, they say that I do not have permissions.  With Gentoo, I ended up transferring temp_extract into magento directory, but I couldn't figure out the command-line to move from temp_extract into magento.  I am using Ubuntu 14.04.  Can anyone help?  Thanks.\n\nA: The file mangers gives you a permission denied error as you are copying files in to a folder owned by root, /var,you should not change the permissions of system folder like /var, you have two options to move these files, first\nsudo cp /file/you/want/to/copy /folder/you/want/to/copy/to\n\nIf you like to move them via a gui you can run a root gui like this\ngksu nemo\n\nYou can swap nemo for the name of your favourite file manager.\nTo copy the specific files you requested, this is the correct syntax\nsudo cp -R ~/Downloads/temp_extract/ /var/www/magento/\n\nAs you say in comments      \n\nI haven't yet figured out how to install magento\n\nYou should provide the download you used and any tutorial you followed as it seems unlikely you would need to copy these files manually, there is possibly some kind of installation script you can run to automate the processes.\n\nA: You have to be superuser in order to copy something to /var/www and since you are copying a folder you need to include the -R parameter to the cp command for it to copy recursively. It would be something like this:\nsudo cp -R ~/Downloads/temp_extract/ /var/www/magento/\n\n\nA: If you want to just copy all of the files from one dir to the other recursively, you can use something like this:\ncp -r /home/user1/dir1/* /var/www/dir2/\n\nIf you wanted to copy the entire directory recursively, it would look more like this:\ncp -r /home/user1/dir1 /var/www\n\n", "Q: Run Shell Script after click on button - YAD I have three shell scripts and I would like to run each script after click on button in yad - lets say - I have one yad session with three buttons - if I click on one button I will open 1. script - second button open 2. script and so on..

Ubuntu installed succesfully but now I am unable to boot into Windows as it is not showing up as an entry in grub.\nI tried boot-repair but it doesn't seem to work. Although I got the url http://paste.ubuntu.com/14429794/ It keeps repeating the message to 'unmount partitions' even in a live-usb system. I then tried bootscriptinfo which gave the output given below.\nAlso, I am sure that the whole windows partition is intact as I can see all the files in Ubuntu, it's just that I can't boot from it.\nEDIT: I also tried the setroot method in the grub command line but it gave an error saying that the EFI path is not valid.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated as I have already spent much time scouring forums and searching on Google.\n                  Boot Info Script 0.61      [1 April 2012]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => Windows is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda.\n => Syslinux MBR (4.04 and higher) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdb.\n\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /efi/Boot/bootx64.efi /efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi \n                       /efi/ubuntu/MokManager.efi /efi/ubuntu/shimx64.efi\n\nsda2: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        \n\nsda3: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /boot/grub/grub.cfg /efi/boot/bootx64.efi \n                       /efi/boot/grubx64.efi\n\nsda4: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ext4\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n    Mounting failed:   mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda4,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\n\nsda5: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Windows/System32/winload.exe\n\nsda6: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        \n\nsda7: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ext4\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n    Operating System:  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n    Boot files:        /boot/grub/grub.cfg /etc/fstab \n                       /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf\n\nsda8: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        \n\nsda9: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        \n\nsda10: _________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista/7: NTFS\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        \n\nsda11: _________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       swap\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n\nsdb1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  SYSLINUX 4.05 20140113\n    Boot sector info:  Syslinux looks at sector 10154144 of /dev/sdb1 for \n                       its second stage.

I had a broken Ubuntu (due to some unknown Nvidia driver issue) and lost Windows boot loader.\nAssumption being made: \n\n\n*\n\n*Your Windows OS was installed using MBR mode (like mine).\n\n\nIf those were true, I would suggest you could \"Create a Windows Recovery Disk\" from another Windows 10 machine, which would provide you a minimal command line tool you could use. Then follow this answer to fix mbr (assuming your Windows OS lives in drive C): \nbootsect /nt60 C: /mbr\n\nThen reboot your computer. This will restore the Windows boot loader.\nMore Information\nI later learned about the relationship of MBR, BIOS mode, GPT, UEFI mode. Basically, MBR would pair with BIOS mode and GPT would pair with UEFI mode. (Source)\nThe boot loader mess was caused by the mismatching of Windows OS boot mode and Ubuntu boot mode.

I check in these cases which kernel I am running with cat /proc/version.\nSince the version you are running at that moment is boot-able I remove all older kernels using:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-4.2.0.*version*\nYou can use regular expressions in this, so you are probably running 4.2.0-22 and can remove all older. That can be done by:\nsudo apt-get remove linux-image-4.2.0-1.*\n(Check for more detail here)\nDo not just trow away the files which are not in use, though it will work it will keep on generating grub errors on updates.

Always start reading error messages from down upwards.\n\nA: Python is whitespace sensitive, this means you have to indent code correctly; otherwise you'll get errors...\nAfter an if block, you need to indent the code, you can use Tab to do this.\nYour code should look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport shutil\n\n# --------------------------------------------------------\nreorg_dir = \"/media/ashwin/Work+Entertainment/Untitled Folder\"\nexclude = () \nremove_emptyfolders = True\n# ---------------------------------------------------------\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk(reorg_dir):\n    for name in files:\n        subject = root+\"/\"+name\n        if name.startswith(\".\"):\n            extension = \".hidden_files\"\n        elif not \".\" in name:\n            extension = \".without_extension\"\n        else:\n            extension = name[name.rfind(\".\"):]\n        if not extension in exclude:\n            if extension==\".jpeg\" or extension==\".jpg\" or extension==\".JPG\" or extension==\".png\" or extension==\".PNG\":\n                new_dir = reorg_dir+\"/Pictures\"\n            elif extension==\".docx\" or extension==\".doc\" or extension==\".pdf\" or extension==\".xlsx\" or extension==\".ppt\" or extension==\".pptx\":\n                new_dir = reorg_dir+\"/Documents\"\n            elif extension==\".mp3\" or extension==\".MP3\":\n                new_dir = reorg_dir+\"/Songs\"\n            elif extension==\".mp4\" or extension==\".MP4\" or extension==\".avi\" or extension==\".AVI\":\n                new_dir = reorg_dir+\"/Videos\"\n            elif extension==\".db\" or extension==\".DB\":\n                new_dir = reorg_dir+\"/Databases\"\n            elif extension==\"*.*\":\n                new_dir = reorg_dir+\"/Others\"\n\n        if not os.path.exists(new_dir):\n                os.mkdir(new_dir)\n            n = 1; name_orig = name\n            while os.path.exists(new_dir+\"/\"+name):\n                name = name_orig\n                n = n+1\n            newfile = new_dir+\"/\"+name\n            shutil.move(subject, newfile)\n\ndef cleanup():\n    filelist = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(reorg_dir):\n        for name in files:\n            filelist.append(root+\"/\"+name)\n    directories = [item[0] for item in os.walk(reorg_dir)]\n    for dr in directories:\n        matches = [item for item in filelist if dr in item]\n        if len(matches) == 0:\n            try:\n                shutil.rmtree(dr)\n            except FileNotFoundError:\n                pass\n\nif remove_emptyfolders == True:\n    cleanup()\n\n\nA: You have to add identation on that line and below. Python uses identation to identify code blocks and the code below the if statement should be identated since it belongs to the if block.

Fully 80% of the journal is full of these messages.\n\nUntil this is fixed a workaround is to just drop these log messages.

Use parameter 'forcepae' to enable at your own risk! This kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU:\npae\nunable to boot-please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU.\nMy question is what is a pae kernel, how do I find an \"appropriate\" kernel?\n\nA: PAE stands for Physical Address Extension, and it's a CPU feature that was added approximately at the Pentium III generation in order to handle large RAM sizes.  Despite this feature being part of the P3 architecture, a few P3 and P4 generation CPUs support the feature but incorrectly report they don't have it.  The first thing to try is adding the \"forcepae\" parameter to the boot line GRUB uses -- that may solve the problem for you.\nIf that doesn't work, you'll need to find a non-PAE kernel build of Ubuntu, or change to another distribution that has non-PAE versions available (I've successfully used antiX in the past on Pentium 2 processors, but that distro was getting a little long in the tooth last time I looked at it).\n", "Q: If I have clamav do I need to install rootkit hunter So I have clamav the antivirus but is that a protection against rootkits or do I need to install rootkit hunter as well with clamav? \n\nA: Clamav only acts as an anti-virus, and does not protect you against rootkits. In the opinion of most people viruses are not such a big threat on Linux, however we can all agree that rootkits are so it is good to protect yourself against them.\nThough rkhunter will need to be installed on a fresh install before any software or updates are installed because it looks at changes in the system, and assumes the system it is installed on is safe, and then compares that to the system's state later on when you do a scan.\nSo if you have a rootkit already, and you install rkhunter, it won't be able to tell if you have one or not.\nAnother option is OSSEC HIDS (Host Intrusion Detection System - which is not required to be installed on a fresh install, and will be able to detect a rootkit on a system even if it is installed after the rootkit (in most cases)) which can detect rootkits as well as a larger range of system activities.\n", "Q: Installation of netbeans 8.1 from the .sh file in ubuntu 14.04 I have the installation file netbeans-8.1-linux.sh in the Others folder of Downloads.\nNow when I am using the command from the Netbeans official site to make the installer file executable i.e.\nchmod +x <netbeans-8.1-linux.sh>\n\nIt is showing the following error\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'\n\nSo what do I have to do??

The locate command does a good job and outputs the results (after I build the index with updatedb).\nHowever I would like to see only genuine files, not directories. Can I manipulate locate into such a behavior?\n\nA: I'm not aware of any locate implementation that checks file types.\nYou can use Bash to filter the locate output:\nwhile read -r -d $'\\0' f\ndo\n    [ -f \"$f\" ] && echo \"$f\"\ndone < <(locate -0 something)\n\nOr you can use find with the -type f option:\nfind / -name something -type f\n\n", "Q: How to use timestamp option in ping I noticed that there is a timestamp option -T in the ping help.

Is it necessary to create a small boot partition on sdb and will this solve the problem? Or is there something else I am missing?\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: It appears that your Windows installation is in EFI mode and your Ubuntu installation is (probably) in BIOS mode. This is a recipe for headaches. There are numerous possible solutions. The two easiest are likely to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in the firmware, boot an Ubuntu emergency disk, and run Boot Repair on the computer. This should install the EFI version of GRUB 2, which should work better than what you've got now.\n\n*If it's not already disabled, disable Secure Boot in your firmware. Then download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, prepare a medium from it, and boot it. This should enable you to boot either Windows or Ubuntu. Test both, and if both work, install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package from Ubuntu.\n\n\nAs a side note, disk identification (/dev/sda vs. /dev/sdb) is somewhat arbitrary, so don't read anything into the fact that Windows is on what Linux identifies as /dev/sdb. Such mappings can even vary from one boot to the next, although that level of arbitrariness is uncommon.\n", "Q: Cannot disable Display Port via grub boot options When I run xrandr on the terminal I see DVI-0 connected and DisplayPort-1 connected. I only use DVI-0 as my output. I don't have two screens, or anything else connected to my computer, so I don't know why DisplayPort-1 is even presented. I use an HDMI to DVI adapter..\nSince DisplayPort-1 is presented, I am getting some weird behavior when changing the resolution. If I run xrandr -s 1024x768 and I was previously in a resolution of 800x600, then I will get a cut off screen because for some reason I'm changing the resolution of the DisplayPort. This also happens going the other way, from 1024x768 to 800x600.\nIn the past I would add video=DP-1:d to the grub boot options to hide this \"phantom\" display. This would fix all the funny problems. However, this grub option no longer works! After adding it to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub and doing an update-grub, the computer still comes up with the phantom DisplayPort-1 output.\nI'm running Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS. Any ideas?\n\nA: I was able to disable the display port by adding video=DP-2:d to the grub boot options. Notice that xrandr was showing DisplayPort-1 even though in reality DP-2 was enabled.\nHere's how I was able to find out which was the real output device thanks to the ArchLinux wiki:\n*To get the name and current status of connectors, you can use the following shell one-liner:\n$ for p in /sys/class/drm/*/status; do con=${p%/status}; echo -n \"${con#*/card?-}: \"; cat $p; done\n\nDVI-I-1: connected\nHDMI-A-1: disconnected\nVGA-1: disconnected\n\n", "Q: How do you give two users access to a single dropbox folder? I have two accounts on my computer. One has a password, the other doesn't. They both need access to the same files but I'd also like to keep these files backed up. I'm doing stenography and these are my personal dictionaries. They're going to change a lot over time and I'd like to have access to those changes from one account to the other.\nI use the stenography account because it's a clean desktop which isn't cluttered with thousands of icons from all my other interests (game-dev, communications programs, etc). It's where I do transcription services for work.\nWhat I need:\nI do not want the other account having access to my home folder. It's not password protected so anyone could get into my stuff. I need a single folder, which is automatically backed up whenever changes are made (preferably in my dropbox folder), to be accessible to both accounts.\nI've tried 777ing the folder and putting a link in the / directory of the hard drive. That didn't work.\n\nA: I would create a new group, add both user accounts to that group and then set the directory's group recursively to that one and give it the read and write permissions for all files, then finally set it up that all new files and folders are automatically owned by the new group:\nsudo addgroup newgroup\nsudo adduser user1 newgroup\nsudo adduser user2 newgroup\nsudo chgrp -R newgroup /path/to/shared/folder\nsudo chmod -R g+rw /path/to/shared/folder\nsudo find /path/to/shared/folder -type d -exec chmod g+s {} +\n\nThe commands above assume that your two user accounts are user1 and user2, the new common group will get named newgroup and that the location of your files to share between the accounts is /path/to/shared/folder. Alter those to fit your situation.\n", "Q: Sublime text 3, everything is so small I just installed Sublime Text 3 on Ubuntu 14.04 and everything is so small, how to fix it?\n\n\nA: In the dash type.\nDisplays\n\nand then hit enter.\nIn this window you should see scale for menu and title bars.  This might have an effect on the program.\nIf this doesn't work you can also adjust the text size of Sublime Text it self.  You can find it outlined here - http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/font.html\nwhich says\n\nChanging the font can be done via adding these lines to\n  Preferences/Settings - User:\n\"font_face\": \"Courier New\",     \"font_size\": 10\nand then change as desired. The font will change when you save.\nYou can see other settings to change by browsing through\n  Preferences/Settings - Default. There are many things that can be\n  customized in Sublime Text.\n\nFinally if none of this works you could always use a lower resolution.  I personally find I run into problems with a lot of programs that where designed with 1080p in mind.  Obviously not something some one wants to hear when they purchase a nice 2k, 4k+ monitor.  On the plus side if you are on a laptop lowering the resolution to 1080p gives you better battery life and still looks good at least for me on my 2015 Razer Blade.\n", "Q: Cant get the wifi to work on Macbook air early 2015 (Ubuntu 15.10) As i have low internal memory only 128 GB. so i do not wish to install in my hard drive.

What is the thought behind this behaviour?\nAnd is there a way to force removing all permissions in one step, without having to execute sudo chmod g-w * afterwards?\n\nA: From man chmod (emphasis mine):\nA  combination  of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the\nfile will be changed: the user who owns it  (u),  other  users  in  the\nfile's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users\n(a).

See comments #4 and #5 in this bug report.\n$ touch 1; ll\ntotal 0\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 muru muru 0 Jan  9 03:17 1\n$ chmod -rwx *; ll\ntotal 0\n---------- 1 muru muru 0 Jan  9 03:17 1\n$ umask\n002\n$ umask 072; chmod ug+rw *\n$ chmod -rwx * \nchmod: 1: new permissions are ---rw----, not ---------\n$ chmod a-rwx *; ll\ntotal 0\n---------- 1 muru muru 0 Jan  9 03:17 1\n\nDon't be a lazy ass.

So I'll have to boot either using the Intel GPU (but I'll be able to use the NVidia for CUDA stuff/rendering or VGA pass-through to VM) or using the NVidia GPU (for Steam)?\nOr is Optimus/Bumblebee also available on the desktop, driving the monitor using one cable with the cards \"automagically\" aware of one another?\nWhat are your set-ups/experiences?\n\nA: I just want to close this question by adding what happened in the end.\nI installed the nvidia driver using the additional drivers configuration option, to make sure any voodoo that might be doing gets done. Then I installed bumblebee and nvidia-prime. I started out with nvidia-361 on 16.04, but am using nvidia-367 on 16.10 at the moment.\nThe config files need to be adapted manually in /etc/bumblebee. I am using the following for the nvidia driver:\nIn bumblebee.conf:\n[driver-nvidia]\n# Module name to load, defaults to Driver if empty or unset\nKernelDriver=nvidia-367\nPMMethod=auto\n# colon-separated path to the nvidia libraries\nLibraryPath=/usr/lib/nvidia-367:/usr/lib32/nvidia-367\n# comma-separated path of the directory containing nvidia_drv.so and the\n# default Xorg modules path\nXorgModulePath=/usr/lib/nvidia-367/xorg,/usr/lib/xorg/modules\nXorgConfFile=/etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia\n\nThe xorg.conf.nvidia file:\nxorg.conf.nvidia \nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier  \"Layout0\"\n    Option      \"AutoAddDevices\" \"false\"\n    Option      \"AutoAddGPU\" \"false\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"DiscreteNvidia\"\n    Driver      \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName  \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n\n#   If the X server does not automatically detect your VGA device,\n#   you can manually set it here.\n#   To get the BusID prop, run `lspci | egrep 'VGA|3D'` and input the data\n#   as you see in the commented example.\n#   This Setting may be needed in some platforms with more than one\n#   nvidia card, which may confuse the proprietary driver (e.g.,\n#   trying to take ownership of the wrong device). Also needed on Ubuntu 13.04.\n    BusID \"PCI:01:00:0\"\n\n#   Setting ProbeAllGpus to false prevents the new proprietary driver\n#   instance spawned to try to control the integrated graphics card,\n#   which is already being managed outside bumblebee.\n#   This option doesn't hurt and it is required on platforms running\n#   more than one nvidia graphics card with the proprietary driver.\n#   (E.g. Macbook Pro pre-2010 with nVidia 9400M + 9600M GT).\n#   If this option is not set, the new Xorg may blacken the screen and\n#   render it unusable (unless you have some way to run killall Xorg).\n    Option \"ProbeAllGpus\" \"false\"\n\n    Option \"NoLogo\" \"true\"\n    Option \"UseEDID\" \"false\"\n    Option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"none\"\nEndSection\n\nYou need to make sure that the driver version matches what you have, and the BusID is important as well.\nThis basically allows me to switch the GPU using the nvidia settings app (requires logging out and back in) or launching apps on a specific GPU using \"optirun -b primus\", which I add to Steam games in the launch settings and has worked flawlessly for me ever since.\n", "Q: How to make shared partition on dual boot between Windows 10 & Ubuntu 14.04 I want to make dual boot with Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04 and have a shared partition between both OSes. I know that it should be with NTFS file system and I am going to make it the last partiotion, after all other partiotions are set.\nIs all I have to do, just create the NTFS partiotion ? I red a tutorial where the OP creates a linux directorie and wants to  mount the ntfs partition to be there, he is searching the UUID of the partition and he tweaks some code in /etc/fstab file. But it seems this tutorials are a little bit older. \nOn other places I red that all you need to do is creat the partition and it will be visible in nautilus and in Windows.\nI want to share files on this partition when I want, and not to automatically be shared between the OSes. Example I would have Windows drives C: for Windows D: for data and separate software(like games) and let's say E: which is going to be shared paritition with the Ubuntu and I would put data when I need it to be on both systems so I don't have to always upload and download the data I need to be shared. Same for Linux I would have /, /home and for example /home/storage = E: directorie which will be the shared partition.\nIf I have to do more, than just creating the partition. Please write the steps as simple as possible and explain. Thank you.\n\nA: (I don't have reputation to comment so..) \nI had installed windows 8.1 on drive C:. I then installed ubuntu 15.10 on drive D:. Now, all the ntfs partition including C: is visible and accessible to Ubuntu but drive D: is no longer ntfs and hence not visible to windows. If this fits your needs, I will explain steps of doing so. \n", "Q: Is there any gui to make a global (system and devices) search in Ubuntu? I've searched for this topic but it seems that I'm the only one with this problem.\nThe search for files default app allows to search only in a specific place. I would like to search, let's say, for a video in all my usb hd (4), in my home, in my video folder, sub folders, etc. at the same time. I need to see the preview of my video (or my videos sharing the same part of name). It's surprising for me that a \"search in the computer\" tool, largely used in other O.S., is not installed by default in Ubuntu. I'm using Ubuntu Mate 15.10. Any suggestion?\n\nA: Try Catfish, it is very light and fast file searching GUI.\nIn the terminal do:\nsudo apt-get install catfish\n\nA: I tried it in the past, thanks, but it's not what I need. It forces you to make a choice on where to search like the default search app. I don't want to make a choice, I want to search everywhere in my computer, system and devices, at the same time.

Presumably Ubuntu proceeds with an automatic update.\nTo update virus database manually, you have to stop daemon by typing in CLI:\nsudo /etc/init.d/clamav-freshclam stop\n\nNow you can update virus signatures:\nsudo freshclam -v\n\nFinally, restart daemon with\nsudo /etc/init.d/clamav-freshclam start\n\n\nA: This is likely to be because the update is currently being run automatically, or you are running it somewhere else (you would know about this). You can change how often it is run automatically, and also stop it being run automatically by running the following:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure clamav-freshclam\n\nAfter completing the setup you will be able to run sudo freshclam without error (unless you set it to cron and you happen to execute the command at the time it automatically checks).\n\nA: Another thing to do is to edit the /var/log/clamav/freshclam. conf file and change the 1 to 0. This is the only datavthat you will see in the file,  if not LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!!!  and wait. \nDo this ONLY IF THE OTHER  SOLUTIONS  DO NOT WORK! \nWhile this is a drastic step, what it does is to tell Freshclam that it hasn't run yet. \nREMEMBER THIS IS ONLY THE FINAL SOLUTION if the other  suggestions  do not work. \n", "Q: Lubuntu 15.10 32-bit, Can I install Windows 10 or Ubuntu 64-bit without installation media? Long story short, I lost the hard drive that contained my windows 10 64-bit installation, and at the same time I lost my windows installer USB. I had been working on an older computer for a friend, so I had a USB installer for Lubuntu 15.10 32-bit, which I installed on my PC.\nHere is the rub: unetbootin can't create a bootable usb apparently because of the brand of drive Im using, \"startup disk creator\" fails when installing the bootloader, and I am too much of a noob to install/compile mintstick to even try it. Does anyone have any ideas? Ideally, I'd like to reinstall windows, as I play a few games that don't work with wine, but I would also be happy if i could install Ubuntu 64-bit. As of right now, all I can think of is to borrow a friend's PC to make the USB. I don't have any burnable disks, either.\nAlso, a side question, in this lubuntu installation ctrl and alt seem to be mapped to \"shift\", so that I have 6 shift keys instead of two of each, is there a way to fix that?\n\nA: If you need Mintstick, in any Ubuntu-based distro:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tsvetko.tsvetkov/trusty-backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mintstick\n\nBur that is NOT for putting Windows on a stick.

For TCP connections, Linux tends to use a \"half-duplex\" close sequence where either side of the session can initiate connection termination via a single 2 way FIN-ACK handshake (which puts the connection into the CLOSE_WAIT state), instead of a full 4 way FIN-ACK handshake. The one rule 7 that you posted is likely a left over FIN packet from after the connection has already been closed and forgotten, thus it did not traverse your RELATED,ESTABLISHED rule and ended up at rule 7.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 updates - Failed to download repository information - check internet connection I had previous problems like this, first it did not want to update anything.

Solutions? Suggestions?\n\nA: (I don't have reputation to comment so..) \nThis may be because you don't have Internet access. When I installed ubuntu 15.10, I also faced similar problems. Was unable to access Internet even though I was connected to wifi. So to solve this you may do as follows(if you have not done this already) :\nClick on wifi icon on top panel. \nClick on edit connection. \nChoose your connection and press edit \nNow, add 8.8.8.8 as your additional dns\n\nThis worked for me. \n", "Q: UEFI boot not working afte succesful install - Ubuntu 15.10 I am not able to UEFI boot a computer after a successful USB install of Ubuntu 15.10. I prepared the bootable USB with the newest version of Rufus, using GPT for UEFI mode. After a successful OS install, the computer leads to the firmware on rebooting. In the firmware, UEFI Harddisk shows up as the first boot option. Boot is set to UEFI, fast boot, secure boot is disabled, quiet boot enabled. Legacy mode install is even worse, it leads to grub-rescue on rebooting after installing the OS. \nBoot-repair did not resolve the problem either. Here is the bootInfo: http://paste.ubuntu.com/14442720/\nMy system: OS (Ubuntu 15.10), MB: ECS FM2A55, Processor A4 6300.I don't intend to dual boot this computer. Thanks!\n\nA: Your Boot Repair output looks correct, at least at first glance. Chances are the firmware on your computer is defective. I recommend you try going to the manufacturer's site and updating the firmware. (The manufacturer probably calls the firmware a \"BIOS,\" although technically it isn't a BIOS.) If that fails, I recommend you return the motherboard and buy a new one from a different manufacturer, since you shouldn't be accepting defective merchandise. (Note that the defect is something that would be in all motherboards of that model with the same firmware version; I'm not talking about a sample-specific manufacturing defect.) If you return the computer, be sure to tell the manufacturer why you did so. They'll keep delivering junk if people keep accepting it; and if you don't tell them why you returned junk, they won't know what needs fixing.\nIf you really MUST keep that motherboard, you can work around the problem as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot an Ubuntu emergency disk.\n\n*Mount /dev/sda1 somewhere convenient -- say, /mnt.\n\n*Type sudo cp -r /mnt/EFI/ubuntu /mnt/EFI/BOOT.\n\n*Type sudo mv /mnt/efi/BOOT/shimx64.efi /mnt/efi/BOOT/bootx64.efi.\n\n\nThis procedure copies the boot loader to the fallback filename, which the firmware should launch when it fails to launch it under the name registered in NVRAM. This workaround, however, means that GRUB updates (that is, updates to GRUB, not updates to GRUB's configuration) won't be fully installed unless you repeat these steps.\n", "Q: Font smoothing not working for Windows fonts I'm having an issue with Windows fonts not being smoothed in Ubuntu 15.10. I copied the contents of the Fonts directory from my Windows 10 install to /usr/share/fonts/truetype/windows10 and ran fc-cache -fv. Afterwards, I rebooted, and the fonts seem to work, but they are not smoothed. Screenshot below. What's odd is that they are smoothed in the font selection menu, but not in the document. Another thing that's odd is that the i, f, and t characters are smooth, but not the other ones. How do I fix this? I'm running the latest Libreoffice 5.0.4 from the Libreoffice PPA (ppa:libreoffice/ppa).\nEDIT: I've confirmed that the font smoothing issue is system-wide. \n\n\nA: LibreOffice doesn't use anything but the freeware font engine so all MS and Monotype fonts will look bad as they are hinted or prepped for the Windows font engine.\nAlso, LibreOffice doesn't license any fonts from monotype so it's not the best solution if you create a document in Times New Roman in MS office, then open it up in LibreOffice - it will default to some random opensouce (typically poor quality) font.\nUpdate:\nIf the bug is only with a single font:\nYou can find the fonts in /usr/share/fonts/truetype and edit them with any application you like.\nRemember that in the Ubuntu repository you can find alternative versions of almost any character; often, open versions are better than proprietary ones.\nIf the bug is with many fonts:\nA temporary solution is to use substitution table in character styles options to substitute the bad font with the good ones. You can also set the default fonts in the Writer options.\nAnother solution can be to tweak the characters options for the page: right click -> characters -> position -> distance. And make it fixed by disabling the default, it should be better.\nIf you can't solve, please consider of downgrading your libreoffice with Synaptics package manager (Menu -> Package -> Force version).\nHope you solve, my eyes would implode with a similar bug. :)\nEDIT: if one of the following solutions works try to tweak the font rendering configuration by editing the files in /etc/fonts/conf.d/; use sudo nano /etc/fonts/conf.d/FILENAME on a terminal to do it.\nFor example try to disable font antialiasing by editing 10-antialias.conf (replace true with false); the same for 10-hinting.conf. If nothing changes symply re-replace false with true.\nPlease note that you will disable these features for the whole system, so revert the changes if they doesn't help.\nThe last possible cause of your problem can be the graphic rendering of the driver itself. You can try to execute sudo nano /etc/libreoffice/soffice.sh and ENABLE/DISABLE the OpenGL support. Restart Libreoffice after each edit.\nIf you can't solve downgrade or use OpenOffice or an equivalent suite, for your eyes (I'm not kidding).\nI'm sorry if I wasn't of great help, but I don't know the source code of LibreOffice, I'm only trying various possibilities. :-)\nLet us know if you solve or if you discover interesting things.\nPS: I copied it from Ugly LibreOffice font\n\nA: I fixed the issue by installing Infinality using this guide: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html\n\nA: System-wide font smoothing (anti-aisling)\nThis really isn't a Libreoffice problem but as you point out a system-wide problem. The easiest way I know to solve it is with the Tweak Tool. In my case I'm using unity-tweak-tool. Install it with:\nsudo apt install unity-tweak-tool\n\n\nUsage\nStart it from Dash or the command line using unity-tweak-tool.\nClick on the icon \"Fonts\" and notice this part of the screen:\n\nThe Text scaling factor is only increased for HDPI (High Dots-Per-Inch) monitors such as 1920x1080.

For whatever reason they were not dynamically created. \nThe solution to the issue was to create the /etc/resolv.conf manually with the following two steps in command line:\nsudo tee  /etc/resolv.conf <<< \"nameserver 127.0.1.1\"\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nSidenotes\n\n\n*\n\n*127.0.1.1  address is to allow dnsmasq service to use the dns provided from the router. It  could be replaced with custom dns, such as 8.8.8.8 or 208.67.220.220 if one so wishes\n\n*Since having static /etc/resolv.conf file works, that's a sufficient solution for 90% of the needs, however if one desires one could reconfigure the resolvconf package to dynamically (automatically) create that file. The command for that would be sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nA: I search and searched and searched and everything I found was basics and not fixing anything.

Can I still use MAAS to roll out and manage systems?\n\nA: Yes, the MaaS server itself, does not need to be PXE Boot enabled, that would be the nodes that are connected to the private network that would be in PXE Boot.\n", "Q: What to do about a false positive in clamtk I am getting a message from clamtk antivirus after running a scan on the download folder the result said 10 viruses found how can 10 viruses  be found if nothing in the download folder but some files that I personally know is safe? \n\nA: clamtk is a gui front end for clamav & allows for some customization: under Preferences, go to \"whitelist\", and simply add the files there you want clamav to ignore. Alternatively, for well-known applications & system files (vs your own files), you can report them to clamav as false-positives: http://www.clamav.net/contact\n", "Q: can not install skype on ubuntu 15.10 o@lifebook:~$ sudo apt-get install skype\n[sudo] password for o: \nReading package lists...

I am one of the developers of the commandline ripper/encoder abcde. Development is moving fast and I would like eager Ubuntu abcde users to be able to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Debian package from the git head\n\n*Then update the source with:\ngit pull\n\nand subsequently upgrade their installed abcde with an incrementally versioned upgrade.\nThe abcde git repository can be accessed as follows:\ngit clone http://git.einval.com/git/abcde.git --depth 1\n\nDebian packaging information is already available in the source but the complexity of getting a versioned upgrade that works within the existing Ubuntu packaging structure has so far defeated me...\n\nA: The fastest way to provide packages to your users is by creating a PPA, especially as you said development is moving fast. It has an option for nightly builds, which you might find desirable.\nThis way, you can produce stable releases as they come out, and automatically build for several Ubuntu releases and architectures without much trouble.\nWhen development becomes more or less stable, consider including the package in Debian, which will make it available to a wider audience (including Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based distributions).\n", "Q: How can I use multiple accounts with Telegram? Is there a way to have two copies of telegram app in Ubuntu each with a different account?\nIt seems copying the app in another folder does not work.\n\nA: If you still want a tidier option using the abumalick's answer, you can add additional action(s) to the original launcher to add extra profile(s).\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ~/.local/share/ goes to the directory where Telegram Desktop data are stored under your home hierarchy;\n\n*mkdir Telegram2 makes a new folder for the second Telegram profile;\n\n*gedit applications/telegramdesktop.desktop opens Telegram Desktop launcher in text editor;\n\n*Finally, add the following lines to the end:\n\n\n(Address the Telegram executable file for Exec and also replace your username instead of $user)\nActions=SecondAccount;\n\n[Desktop Action SecondAccount]\nName=Second Account\nExec=/home/$user/complete/address/to/the/Telegram -many -workdir /home/$user/.local/share/Telegram2\n\nYou may need a log out to see the changes take effect.

Also available as a snap).\nThis is an improved version from this answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Before the first run, edit 'config' file to create telegram profiles.\n\n\nThe config file is located under .telegram-cli directory. Depends on your  installation method, you can find the file under $HOME/.telegram-cli/ (if built from source) or $HOME/snap/telegram-cli/25/.telegram-cli/ (if installed using snap).\nOpen the file and edit the following:\n## This is an empty config file\n## Feel free to put something here\nprofile1 = {\nconfig_directory = \"path/to/profile1\";\nmsg_num = true;\n};\n\nprofile2 = {\nconfig_directory = \"path/to/profile2\";\nmsg_num = true;\n};\n\n\n\n*Once profiles are created, run the command like the following (on different terminals):\n\n\ntelegram-cli -p profile1 and telegram-cli -p profile2\nYou will be asked different phone numbers for each profiles that you have created. Also telegram-cli will create a different folder for each profiles.\nTIPS: I find it very convenient using a telegram username in place of profile1 or profile2\n\nA: For Creating Multiple Desktop Shortcuts for different Telegram accounts, you need to create a bash-script file for running each telegram accounts and call it from inside the desktop shortcut scripts. \n\nThis is because, without the bash-script the script won't work\n  directly in desktop shortcut file\n\nNow if you don't know how to do the above yourself, just follow the below steps one by one:\n\n\n*\n\n*create two folders and call them 1stTelegram & 2ndTelegram. \n\n*Inside each of the folders created above, create a folder call data. \n\n\n\nThe data folder holds each Telegram account data.\n\n\n\n*First Telegram shortcut\n\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Telegram Science\nExec=\"/home/my_user/Programs/1stTelegram/runner.sh\" \nIcon=/home/my_user/Programs/1stTelegram/icon.png\nName[en_US]=TelegramSicence\n\n\n\n\n*Second Telegram shortcut\n\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Telegram\nExec=\"/home/my_user/Programs/2ndTelegram/runner.sh\" \nIcon=/home/my_user/Programs/2ndTelegram/icon.png\nName[en_US]=Telegram\n\n\n\n\n*create first runner.sh within /home/my_user/Programs/1stTelegram/ directory\n\n*Edit the first runner.sh bash Script for the first instance of the telegram with associated data folder as follows\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/home/my-user/Programs/Telegram -many -workdir /home/my_user/Programs/1stTelegram/data\n\n\n\n\n*Create second runner.sh within /home/my_user/Programs/2ndTelegram/ directory\n\n*Edit the second runner.sh bash Script for running the second instance of telegram with associated data folder as follows\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/home/my_user/Programs/Telegram -many -workdir /home/my_user/Programs/2ndtTelegram/data\n\n\nTake note that both instances use the same Telegram app to run\n\n\n*Give both runner.sh enough permissions to run\n\n\n\nchmod a+x runner.sh\n\n\n\n*repeat the steps for adding additional accounts\n\n\nRun the desktop shortcuts and enjoy!\n\nA: What I do is run the Telegram binary as a different user\ncd ~/Downloads/Telegram/\nsudo -u otheruser ./Telegram\n\n\nA: You can use Franz.\n\nFranz allows you to add each service many times. This makes Franz the\n  perfect tool to manage multiple business and private accounts at the\n  same time. You could even use five different Facebook Messenger\n  accounts at once, if some inexplicable reason urges you to do so.\n\n\nA: Well, no need to go through all these hassle, install the telegram desktop app on linux via apt and then simply use another package manager like snap or flathub to download another telegram app.\n", "Q: Xubuntu lock screen appearing twice I'm running Xubuntu 15.10.

Once I enter my password on this second lock screen, I'm returned to my desktop session.\nI don't know enough about light-dm/light-locker and friends to know where the issue is. Can anyone help?\n\nA: If you don't want light-locker, you can safely remove it using:\nsudo apt remove light-locker\n\nand Xfce will use only its own locker.\n\nA: Solution\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings → Screensaver and turn off all switches.\n\n*Then go to Settings → Screensaver → Lockscreen and turn off all switches.\n\nCause\nThis must be happening because LightDM and your default screensaver are conflicting with each other. So turning off all your screensaver settings enables only the LightDM greeter to show in lock screen.\nThe above worked for me.\n", "Q: Eject button on internal drive Why is there an eject button on my internal 4tB hard drive? For an internal drive connected by sata, wouldn't you want to unmount the drive but leave it powered and only power it off when the computer turns off?

Python 3.5.1 came out on December 7th 2015 and as a beginning Python coder I would like to try the very latest version on my Ubuntu installation. At the moment Wily Werewolf 15.10 ships version 3.4 and there are some great improvements in the newest version.\nI am currently running Wily Werewolf and I would be keen to hear some methods to update Python to 3.5.1.\n\nA: Solution 1: Use Docker\nI would suggest that you use Docker If you would like to test out a newer version of Python without overwriting your system Python (which it is very important that you don't, because Python 2.x and 3.x are different enough that 3.x will have breaking changes and will cause problems for packages that depend on Python 2.x)\nDocker is a way to run lightweight Linux applications in a containerized way.  Think of them like a more lightweight Virtual Machine, or a chroot with a layered union filesystem plus the management & system resource separation provided by cgroups.\n\n\n*\n\n*To install Docker, follow the Ubuntu Installation instructions here.\n\n*To run a different version of python inside a container:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick a version from the list here\n\n*Run: docker pull python:<your_version_here>\n\n*Run: docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v \"$PWD\":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp python:<your_version_here> python your-daemon-or-script.py\nIf you develop an application that you'd like to package up (optionally with dependencies) inside a container, you can create a Dockerfile with build & dependency setup instructions, then build an image to distribute on Docker Hub.  Doing so is a bit beyond the scope of your question, but the docker-library/python docs give a quick summary for how to get started.\nSolution 2: Use packages from the \"dead snakes\" PPA\nThere is an archive of old & new versions of Python here.  To install an alternate version of Python:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run: apt-get -y install software-properties-common\n\n*Run: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes\n\n*Run: sudo apt-get update\n\n*Run: sudo apt-get -y install python<your_version_here> python<your_version_here>-dev\n\n*To run a Python script with one of these versions, use the alternate binary that was installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run: python<your_version_here> your-daemon-or-script.py\n\n*For Example, with Python 3.5: /usr/bin/python3.5 your-daemon-or-script.py\nIf you need to install a specific minor version of the package, you can find the available versions with apt-cache madison.

Simplest - use Ctrl + Z shortcut while process is running. The way it works can be read in bash's manual:\n\nTyping the suspend character (typ‐\n         ically ^Z, Control-Z) while a process is running causes that process to\n         be stopped and returns control to bash.   Typing  the  delayed  suspend\n         character  (typically  ^Y,  Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped\n         when it attempts to read input from the terminal,  and  control  to  be\n         returned  to bash.  The user may then manipulate the state of this job,\n         using the bg command to continue it in the background, the  fg  command\n         to continue it in the foreground, or the kill command to kill it.  A ^Z\n         takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing\n         pending output and typeahead to be discarded\n\nHowever, considering that update is more important than downloading file, I wouldn't recommend pausing the update/upgrade process; pause the file download first, resume later. Or avoid mixing both\n", "Q: Why was the mongodb-dev package removed from Ubuntu after 14.04? It is still present in Debian, but the latest version of Ubuntu that has it is 14.04 LTS. I wonder why?

I am familiar with Ubuntu and was reading you can install XenHypervisor as a standalone package inside a Ubuntu OS. Kind of like installing Hyper-V on windows server instead of installing Hyper-V Server. The reason I stayed away from KVM is that I couldn't find a good GUI for management, but I liked XenCenter GUI for XenServer.\nMy question is:\nIf I installed Ubunutu Server 14.04 and then follow this guide to install  xen-hypervisor-amd64 could I use the XenCenter windows application to view/manage the Xen Hypervisor?\n\nA: Have a look at LibVirt and VirtManager, both completely free alternatives to XenCenter, and they support more hypervisors than Xen alone.\nUbuntu Server 14.04 should have the packages readily available via\n apt-get install libvirt0 virt-manager\n\nOnce done, fire up VirtManager from the command line with virt-manager. It should connect to your Xen daemon immediately if you're running Xen 4.2+ (where xl is the default toolstack).\nIf you're not running Xen 4.2+ (or are using xm as the toolstack), then you'll have to modify a few lines in /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp in order for LibVirt to connect to Xen:\n (xend-http-server yes)\n (xend-port 8000)\n\nAfter making the above changes, run service xen restart and then run service libvirt-bin restart (or service libvirtd restart if libvirt-bin doesn't work). VirtManager should now connect successfully to Xen.\nHOWEVER\nIf you really want XenCenter to work with your configuration, you will need to install the XCP/XAPI packages in the Ubuntu repository. These packages contain the xe (XenServer) toolstack to communicate with Xen, but they are heavily outdated and no longer maintained. They may have already been removed from the Ubuntu 14.04 repository as well.\nMore info on XCP/XAPI can be found here: \nhttp://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/XCP_Overview\nhttp://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_/XCP/_XAPI_Overview\nhttp://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Project_Kronos aims to provide the ability to install the XAPI toolstack onto a pre-existing OS deployment\nHope this helps\n", "Q: May a Linux kernel package have config files that remain in storage after removing the package?

This is also reinforced by the lack of .conffiles for these packages in /var/lib/dpkg/info/.

In Vim,\n :%!ls \n\nexecutes ls command and prints its output to the current editable file.\nBut what do % and ! mean separately in vim?\nIs it possible execute ls and not put its output to document?\n\nA: According to VIM Tutorial:\n%\nMove cursor to the matching bracket.\nPlace cursor on {}[]() and type \"%\".\n\n!\nfilter through external command \nAny UNIX command can be executed from the vi command line by typing an \"!\" before the UNIX command.\nAutowrite can be intentionally avoided by using \"!\" to avoid the save when switching files.\n\nfor more information see Vim Commands Cheat Sheet, and VIM Tutorial\n\nA: I had this same question and found this in :h cmdline-special, which was the meaning I was looking for:\n%   Is replaced with the current file name.       *:_%* *c_%*\n\n\nA: None of these answers is properly correct. At the beginning of a Vim command line statement, you can specify a range over which to operate. % is a common range for specifying the whole file, shorthand for 1,$, i.e. line 1 to end of file. See  See :h cmdline-ranges for more.\n\nA: Within Vim, run :h :! and :h :% to know what each does.\nNow, the :% is used to replace the contents of the file with the output of the shell command run using :!. If you don't want to touch the contents of the file, don't use %. Just do:\n:!ls\n\n\nA: In order to understand what is happening we are going to break this in two parts. First, range and then filter.\nRange is the way vim uses to signalise where the operation is taken place, as per ':help range' we can have these:\nLine numbers may be specified with:             :range E14 {address}\n        {number}        an absolute line number\n        .               the current line                          :.\n        $               the last line in the file                 :$\n        %               equal to 1,$ (the entire file)            :%\n        't              position of mark t (lowercase)            :'\n        'T              position of mark T (uppercase); when the mark is in\n                        another file it cannot be used in a range\n        /{pattern}[/]   the next line where {pattern} matches     :/\n        ?{pattern}[?]   the previous line where {pattern} matches :?\n        \\/              the next line where the previously used search\n                        pattern matches\n        \\?              the previous line where the previously used search\n                        pattern matches \n        \\&              the next line where the previously used substitute\n                        pattern matches\n\nNotice '%' will apply the operation for the entire file.\nThe other part is the filter operation, as per ':help filter', one of ways of filtering is:\n:{range}![!]{filter} [!][arg]                           :range!\n                        Filter {range} lines through the external program\n                        {filter}.  Vim replaces the optional bangs with the\n                        latest given command and appends the optional [arg].\n                        Vim saves the output of the filter command in a\n                        temporary file and then reads the file into the buffer\n                        tempfile.  Vim uses the 'shellredir' option to\n                        redirect the filter output to the temporary file.\n                        However, if the 'shelltemp' option is off then pipes\n                        are used when possible (on Unix).\n\nNotice the first part of the command is to inform the range.\nSo, bringing to your case, :%!ls is informing to vim perform the ls command and apply the result to the entire file.\n\nA: Command mode operation of Vim\n:% select all the contents of the file\n:! filter through external command\n:%!ls does ls | vim - in Bash Terminal\nBut :pu!in this case, ! means current position\nCompare :pu does normal mode p\nand :pu! does normal mode P\n", "Q: System time is incorrect until i use internet... but hwclock is correct REAL TIME : 4:06 PM\nrouter@router:~$ sudo hwclock\n\n*Sat 09 Jan 2016 04:06:55*   [ 4pm is the actual time]\nrouter@router:~$ date\n\n*Sat Jan  9 1:06:44 NPT 2016* [but ubuntu shows time as 1pm]\nbut as soon as i connect my internet :\nrouter@router:~$ date\n\n*Sat Jan  9 16:06:44 NPT 2016* [1pm corrects to 4pm only when i connect internet.... else won;t]\nhow to sync time time with hwclock???\n\nA: The hwclock does not know about timezones and daylight saving, and different OS's deal with it differently. Because the old DOS did not know any other clock then the RTC/hwclock it was set in local time. I think this is still the default of all current Windows systems. The default in (most?) Linux based systems is to expect the hwclock to be set to UTC.  \nBecause systems can boot several different OS's Linux can not demand the hwclock to be in UTC. Therefor it has a parameter to adjust time from hwclock to kernelclock / UTC in case of the hardwareclock is running localtime. Programs normally want to show you localtime so there is a different parameter to adjust for timezone and daylight saving.\nIt seems like in your system there is a discrepancy between your hwclock, UTC correction and timezone / daylight saving.\nYou can see what your hwclock is running with timedatectl, it will show you all data you want:\nLocal time: za 2016-01-09 17:46:05 CET\nUniversal time: za 2016-01-09 16:46:05 UTC\nRTC time: za 2016-01-09 16:46:05\nTime zone: Europe/Amsterdam (CET, +0100)\nNetwork time on: yes\nNTP synchronized: yes\nRTC in local TZ: no\n\nIf I change my hwclock to:\nLocal time: za 2016-01-09 17:52:10 CET\nUniversal time: za 2016-01-09 16:52:10 UTC\nRTC time: za 2016-01-09 17:52:10\nTime zone: Europe/Amsterdam (CET, +0100)\nNetwork time on: yes\nNTP synchronized: yes\nRTC in local TZ: no\n\nand restart*, the hwclock will be used to set the initial kerneltime. Hwclock will give me then 17:52 after restart while date will give me a wrong localtime 18:52. After communication with an ntp server it adjust kernel time and you will see the correct time with date again.\n* Some Linux distributions nowadays set the hwclock from systemtime when shutting down, so the hwclock might be adjusted to UTC after restart. \n", "Q: How to resolve dependency conflict for xserver-xorg-input-evdev I am trying to run a script provided by d3pd (updated by faf0) in an answer to how to install driver for middle button clickpad scrolling.

Most often F2 or del.\nThere you'll have to choose your ubuntu partition as first priority to boot from. This all depends on your motherboard and your bios version.\nSearch for your motherboard if you're not able to figure out which button to press on startup.\n\nA: It looks like you're machine is using UEFI. I assume that the new grub bootloader is not being recognized by the BIOS and hence it boots Windows. I observed this behaviour at a laptop which refused to boot into Linux (GRUB) unless \"legacy boot\" was selected.\nThis gives you two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*try to open the one time boot menu at startup by pressing F12 or Esc (could be some other key, e.g. F9) and select something like legacy boot\n\n*open the BIOS settings with F2, Del (or some other key), navigate to startup resp. boot management and look for an option \"enable legacy boot\" or comparable there and activate it\n\n\nIf one of these steps work you know that it's an UEFI problem and your bootloader is still intact and working.\nThe other approach would be to check why UEFI now refuses to boot into Ubuntu even though it worked before. This can be caused by:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot priority setting in the BIOS\n\n*GRUB fingerprint / signature has to be added to UEFI to be accepted as a legit boot loader\n\n*your GRUB is damaged and you could reinstall the bootloader from a Ubuntu Live CD\n\n\nA: Windows 10 loves to see itself as the only installed OS on your computer, thus making you unable to boot into others. What you need to do is to set GRUB as the default boot manager in Windows through an admin Command Prompt or PowerShell. \nRun this command: \nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nIf you use PowerShell, run this command: \nbcdedit /set \"{bootmgr}\" path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nRestart your computer then grub should show up after the HP logo. \n\nA: Here's the problem, from lines 1220-1221 in your Boot Repair log:\nefibootmgr: Could not set variable Boot0002: No such file or directory\nefibootmgr: Could not prepare boot variable: No such file or directory\n\nTranslated to English, the efibootmgr utility (a key part of installing an EFI boot loader from Linux) tried to create a new variable (Boot0002), but when it tried to set that variable as the default, it had disappeared from the firmware's memory. Basically, this indicates a bug in the firmware (or possibly in efibootmgr), or at least some sort of firmware glitch or misconfiguration. There are several possible solutions and workarounds, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade your firmware (what the manufacturer probably calls a \"BIOS\") and try again. This may fix the bug.\n\n*Locate the firmware option to reset everything to factory defaults, use that option, then try again. This may clear cruft out of the firmware's data store, thus making things work more smoothly.\n\n*Register GRUB with the firmware in some other way, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using bcdedit in Windows, as described in my answer to this question.\n\n*Using the GUI EasyUEFI tool in Windows.\n\n*Using an EFI shell, as described in the Arch Linux wiki.\n\n*The point of all of these options is that it's possible that at least part of the problem is in efibootmgr, so using another tool may work better.\n\n\n*If the computer's new enough, return it to the store for a refund and buy one that isn't broken by design.\n\n*Use the \"Advanced\" Boot Repair option to back up and rename boot loaders. This will put GRUB in place of the Windows boot loader, thus hijacking the working Windows entry, and put a copy of the Windows boot loader elsewhere. This is an ugly hack of a workaround that's likely to come back and bite you later, since most tools won't know about the highly irregular state this workaround creates. Nonetheless, it may be the only solution in some extreme cases.\n\n\nI'd try the solutions in roughly that order until one works, although you can try them in any order you like.\n\nA: Had similar Problem: Win 7 and Xubuntu 15.10 -> Grub never started.\nWhen I tried to restore grub got similar message:\nCould not set variable Boot000B: No such file or directory\n\nSo I used (under Windows as Admin) bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi as written above.\nGrub now working fine, but without Windows choosable.\nAdding Windows to grub:\nI followed https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB_2/Skripte/ (german) \n->Create a executable skrip \"29_windows\" in  \"/etc/grub.d\"\n#!/bin/bash\n# EFI-Partition suchen und auswerten\nif [ -f /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi ]; then\n    EFI_UUID=$( grub-probe -t fs_uuid /boot/efi/EFI )\n    echo \"Menüeintrag für Windows eingefügt\" >&2\n\ncat <<EOF\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 Pro (UEFI)\" {\n    insmod fat\n    insmod chain\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root ${EFI_UUID}\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\nEOF\nfi\n\nand run\nsudo grub-mkconfig\nsudo update-grub\n\nGrub found the Windows via script and automatically.

How can I do it?\nThis is my current scheme ( I need to create 2 more paritions, that I'll do on the other setups):\nPartitions scheme\nMy Fstab is:\n   # <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\n   # / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\n   UUID=7b9d4f44-0bed-4cac-b3dd-50f1eefc1dd8 /               ext4       errors=remount-ro 0       1\n   # /sharing was on /dev/sda6 during installation\nUUID=20e3ac2f-6fb5-4e91-9585-dd1ba552beb1 /media/sharing        defaults       0       2\n   # swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\n   UUID=c49ea5a9-6899-4097-9b38-e78f76ea271b none            swap    sw              0       0\n   /dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0\n\n\nA: I’m not sure if that is your actual problem but I guess your shared partition is not automatically mounted, is it? That may be because your /etc/fstab line for the /media/sharing mount point looks incomplete:\nUUID=20e3ac2f-6fb5-4e91-9585-dd1ba552beb1 /media/sharing        defaults       0       2\n\nIt seems that the field with the filesystem type is missing (before the mount options field with the current value defaults), see also man 5 fstab. Instead, try a line like the following:\nUUID=20e3ac2f-6fb5-4e91-9585-dd1ba552beb1 /media/sharing        auto    defaults       0       2\n\n", "Q: udev rule seems not working properly to force the usb device into fix location I've created a udev rule to force my usb devices into fixed folders at /dev/\n(one, is a webcam into /dev/video1 and the other one is a framegrabber into /dev/video0 ) I need to do this because, by default, I attach webcam after the framegrabber into my computer (so far so good) but if I reboot the system (while they're still attached) the webcam will be assigned to /dev/video0 and the framegrabber to /dev/video1 which will lead to the failure of the apps trying to use them as recording resources (gstreamer pipeline, in this case)\nI put the 25-video-devices.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/ and reload the udev rules, even restart the udev service but after rebooting the system the result is still the same... \nSUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"5555\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"3500\", NAME:=\"video0\", OPTIONS:=\"link_priority=100\"\nSUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"046d\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0843\", NAME:=\"video1\"\n\nIt seems udev rule doesn't function properly or I'm doing something wrong or missing something?\nCan you please help me with that?\np.s: I got the vendor and product ids using lsusb\n\nA: From man 7 udev (highlighting by me):\n\nThe kernel usually just assigns unpredictable device names based on the order of discovery. […] The name of a device node cannot be changed by udev, only additional symlinks can be created.\n\nIn other words, I think you won’t be able to use /dev/video0 or /dev/video1 reliably. Instead you should create and use stable symlinks. Something like the following might work instead:\nKERNEL==\"video*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"5555\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"3500\", SYMLINK+=\"myframegrabber\"\nKERNEL==\"video*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"046d\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0843\", SYMLINK+=\"mywebcam\"\n\nYou would then use /dev/mywebcam and /dev/myframegrabber in your applications.\nBy the way, as recently mentioned in a similar answer:\n\nThere is a chance that video4linux has already provided you with stable device names. You may want to check the directories /dev/v4l/by-id/ and /dev/v4l/by-path/ for this.\n\n", "Q: LTE Smartphone Ubuntu-Touch like BQ Aquaris E5 LTE (not Meizu) I really like the BQ Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition, but is has no LTE. The newer version from BQ with LTE is not available with Ubuntu. I don't want to buy the Phone from Meizu. \nWill there be a version from BQ with LTE and Ubuntu Touch?\n\nA: When BQ is ready to announce new devices, they'll do so themselves.  If you haven't seen any announcement from them, then there is no public information to report.\nFor now if you need an LTE phone running Ubuntu, the Meizu is your only choice.\n", "Q: MaaS server with local kvm - How to bridge to dhcp interface I have a MaaS server, it has two network interfaces. One external eth0, and one for the internal network eth1(Nodes network). eth1 is where the DNS and dhcp server managed interface. I want a mix of physical servers, and one KVM VM run on the MaaS server. I manage to create VM's to PXE Boot, and created a bridge br01 bridged with the eth1 interface.\nauto br0\niface br0 inet dhcp\n        bridge_ports eth1\n        bridge_stp off\n        bridge_fd 0\n        bridge_maxwait 0\n\nAnd that bridge is associated with the VM's network.\nNow this works if created on an external server connected to the eth1 network(tried earlier as proof of concept).\nBut what I want is to move this KVM setup over to the MaaS Server itself(to free up a physical server as Node), and then this network configuration is not working.\nThe network part of the VM's xml file:\n<interface type='bridge'>\n      <mac address='52:54:00:3c:a5:18'/>\n      <source bridge='br0'/>\n      <model type='virtio'/>\n      <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x03' function='0x0'/>\n    </interface>\n\nI created the VM using:\nsudo virt-install --name=bootstrap-juju --ram=2048 --vcpus=1 \n--disk path=/var/kvm/images/bootstrap-juju.qcow2,bus=virtio,size=20 \n--pxe --graphics=vnc --hvm --network bridge=br0,model=virtio \n--os-variant=ubuntuprecise\n\nIt seems that there is a problem with the bridge, when I sudo ifup br0 I get:\nDHCPDISCOVER on br0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3 (xid=0xcb27ff35)\nNo DHCPOFFERS received.\n\nSo it seems the bridge is not getting DHCP address from the internal dhcp server.\nDoes anyone have any pointers here?\n\nA: Ok, I had a few problems.

The fonts in the resulting svg file are not the ones used in the pdf file and it looks cluttered. At least in inkscape and also if I open the file with firefox or chromium not I am on Ubuntu 15.10.\nThere is a related question here: How do I install fonts?\nbut I need to know where to find the names and the files for the xelatex fonts etc.\n\nA: Latex fonts installed via font packages should be automatically available in inkscape. It may be necessary to run sudo fc-cache in the font directory /usr/share/fonts to update the font cache.\nAn obstacle is that the latex name for the font may differ from the system name. When a pdf file is imported in inkscape, the font name are (depending on the options) not replaced or not necessarily replaced by the proper name for the system font (the 'most similar' name is chosen in this case). \nFonts can be selected in latex with, e.g, \n\\usepackage{fontspec}\n\\usepackage{tgpagella}\n\\setmainfont[\n  Ligatures=TeX,\n  Extension=.otf,\n  UprightFont=*-regular,\n  ItalicFont=*-italic,\n  BoldFont=*-bold,\n  BoldItalicFont=*-bolditalic,\n]{texgyrepagella}\n\nHowever, there is no system font called texgyrepagella.

I've used it on a chromebook and it works perfectly, as well as when I connect an external touchpad to my chromebook (in this case the Logitech t650.) my question is, is it possible to install it on a desktop and get similar performance on an all-ubuntu system or will I just royally mess things up?   \nHere's a link to the Github for the driver: https://github.com/hugegreenbug/xf86-input-cmt\n\nA: I found a PPA for Ubuntu with this driver, you could use this to test it, if something does go wrong, it is easy to remove from a PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hugegreenbug/cmt\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xf86-input-cmt\nsudo reboot\n\nThe PPA also contains the dependencies libgestures libevdevc so it should work out of the box.\nIf you face any issues, just remove the driver like this\nsudo apt-get purge xf86-input-cmt \n\nFrom what I can see this is tested and working on Chromebooks with Ubuntu, although not by me.\nHere is a link to the repository\n", "Q: Somehow I created a nondeterministic sh script I created the following script:\n#!bin/bash\ncat > Top10 <<EOF\nLinux Mint 17.2\nUbuntu 15.10\nDebian GNU/Linux 8.2\nMageria 5\nFedora 23\nopenSUSE Leap 42.1\nArch Linux\nCentOS 7.2-1511\nPCLinuxOS 2014.12\nSlackware Linux 14.1\nFreeBSD\nEOF\nsed -ri \"s/^[^0-9]*$//\" Top10\nsed -r \"s/(.*)([[:space:]][[:digit:]]*.*)$/\\2\\1/\" Top10 | sed -r \"s/([[:space:]])([[:digit:]])/\\2/\" | sed -r \"s/([[:digit:]])([[:alpha:]])/\\1 \\2/\" > Top10\nsed -r -i \"s/(.*)/\\L\\1/\" Top10\nsed -r -i \"y/[aeiou]/[AEIOU]/\" Top10\nsort Top10 -g -o Top10\ncat Top10\n\nWhen I run it a few times the following happens:\n \nAs you can see sometimes the Top10 file turns out empty and sometimes it turn out the way I needed it to be. I know that the command which replaces the extensions from the end to the front of a line is done poorly. I ran this script on a VMware virtual machine. Could that be the reason?\n\nA: More specifically, pipes are not deterministic.\nI.e. in a pipe such as this one:\ncommand1 file | command2 | command3 >file\n\nit's not guaranteed that command1 file will be executed before command3 >file.\nSo the race condition between command1 file and command3 >file makes it so that sometimes the file is first read by command1 file and sometimes the file is first truncated by command3 >file, giving the expected output in the first case and a giving an empty output in the second case.\nThis can be fixed by using sponge (in the moreutils package) to write the output to the file, to make sure that the output gets written to the file only after the rest of the pipe has finished executing:\ncommand1 file | command2 | command3 | sponge file\n\n\nA: sed -r \"s/(.*)([[:space:]][[:digit:]]*.*)$/\\2\\1/\" Top10 | sed -r \"s/([[:space:]])([[:digit:]])/\\2/\" | sed -r \"s/([[:digit:]])([[:alpha:]])/\\1 \\2/\" > Top10\n\ncauses the file to be first overwritten with > Top10 and only then processed by sed (the file is empty at that time)\n\nA: There is no reason to run 6 sed commands when you can do it in one:\nsed -ri 's/^[^0-9]*$//; s/(.*)/\\L\\1/; y/[aeiou]/[AEIOU]/; s/(.*)([[:space:]])([[:digit:]]*.*)$/\\3 \\1/' Top10\n\nNote, in particular, how the second pipe of sed commands could be combined into one expression if you just grouped your matches differently. Since you wanted to discard the leading whitespace anyway, and then add a space after the version, you could do that in the original match itself, by grouping the leading space and the version separately.\n", "Q: Is information about a filesystem's bad blocks preserved after formatting a partition? I have a drive with bad blocks. The filesystem is aware of them, and I read that you can feed e2fsck with a badblocks repport to inform the file system that there are some bad blocks. (I think the option -c in fsck is doing the same thing.)\nIf I format the partition and get rid of the file system, so is all information about bad blocks lost? Need I inform the new file system about bad blocks? Or will the SMART system do so for me?\nThanks!\n\nA: From the vastcough amount of research I've come across in the last five minutes, for instance this and this (from SU.SE), it would appear that device-wide metadata about bad blocks is stored in the Master Boot Record or GUID Partition Table (the disk's partition table that starts at address 00000000: 0x00).\nIt seems unlikely it would be stored in the partition's filesystem's table of contents. Anyways, the information will only go away if you write the disk a new partition table, which will irreversably destroy all data on the entire disk.\n\nIf you're using a disk that has bad blocks for anything remotely mission-ciritical (or even your own data), that disk is bound to fail irreparably in the near future, and it's cheaper and easier and safer to buy a new disk.\n", "Q: What is /usr/lib/tracker?

The advantage of Tracker\n  over the default search feature in Ubuntu (Nautilus -> Search for\n  files...) is that results are returned much more quickly and all of\n  the metadata (such as title, artist, track, album, composer, date,\n  etc.) of the file is included in the search. Tracker also very small\n  and efficient, consuming only abou 6 MB of RAM when indexing, and ~3\n  MB when idle.\n\n\nA: Tracker is a Gnome thing:  https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tracker\n\nTracker is a search engine, search tool and metadata storage system.\nIt allows you to find the proverbial needle in your computer's haystack as well as providing a one stop solution to the organisation, storage and categorisation of your data.\n\n", "Q: Installing OpenVpn on Ubuntu 15.10 I am trying to install OpenVpn on Ubuntu 15.10 and running into issues.

So I'd suggest doing something more like\ni=1\n\ncd \"$dir\"\nfor old in *.\"$ext\"; do \n  printf -v new '%s%02d.%s' \"$newbase\" $((i++)) \"$ext\"\n  echo mv \"$old\" \"$new\"\ndone\n\nafter assigning newbase=\"$1\", ext=\"$2\", dir=\"$3\" (with suitable existence checks of course). Play with it and remove the echo once the printed output looks correct.\n", "Q: Prevent all commands from being defined as an alias Is there a way to prevent all commands from being defined as an alias?\nFor example a user shouldn't be able to define rm or any other command (Ubuntu default commands) as an alias name.\n\nA: This is quite a pointless endeavor, as muru's answer shows. But there are some options, but they are not perfect. \nAccording to bash manual, functions always take precedence over aliases, thus we could do the following:\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ function alias { echo \"Aliases are no-no\" ; }\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ alias TEST='rm'\nAliases are no-no\n\nYou could place function definition into the systemwide .bashrc , however as muru pointed out, smart users will find way to get aliases by sourcing a different bashrc file for example.\nAnother idea I've played with is enable built-in.\nalias is a shell built in, and bash has nice enable command that allows enabling or disabling builtins. For instance, here's me disabling alias.\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ enable -n alias\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ alias\nNo command 'alias' found, did you mean:\n Command '0alias' from package 'zeroinstall-injector' (universe)\nalias: command not found\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ alias TEST='rm'\nNo command 'alias' found, did you mean:\n Command '0alias' from package 'zeroinstall-injector' (universe)\nalias: command not found\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ enable alias\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ alias\nalias egrep='egrep --color=auto'\nalias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'\nalias grep='grep --color=auto'\nalias l='ls -CF'\nalias la='ls -A'\nalias ll='ls -alF'\nalias ls='ls --color=auto'\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ \n\nAgain, using systemwide bashrc is an option here.\n\nA: There is no way you can prevent a user from defining whatever aliases they prefer. Consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*You disable aliases in /etc/bash.bashrc. They enable it wherever they chose to.\n\n*You delete all mentions of aliases in /etc/bash.bashrc, and all ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_aliases via a script. They put their aliases in another file and source it.\n\n*You run a command in PROMPT_COMMAND that disables certain aliases. They redefine or undefine PROMPT_COMMAND.\n\n*You trap DEBUG and undefine aliases. They remove the trap.\n\n*You chown all files sourced at invocation to root. They use another file and source it manually as the first command they run.\n\n*You disable the builtins unset, builtin and enable; make alias a function; declare -rf alias to prevent users from modifying the function; and export the function. They run /bin/bash with --rcfile and --init-file to start a new shell, where said builtins are now enabled.\n\n*...\n\n\nYou could disable aliases at compile time, then it would be up to you to keep bash up-to-date and make sure you aren't affected by the next Shellshock. Of course, the users could build their own bash.\n\nA: TL;DR\nThe only way to prevent a user from creating aliases is to provide them with a shell that doesn't support aliasing. This is generally an X/Y problem, where X is really a threat model that should be solved with appropriate controls or architectures rather than trying to solve the problem post-facto after a user is given a shell on a shared system.\nBelow, I provide a technically-correct answer, as well as some guidance on what problems this will and won't solve. I also provide some additional guidance on alternative controls.\nUsing the Bash Restricted Shell\nYou can use Bash's restricted shell by assigning rbash as the user's login shell. For example:\nfoo:x:2001:2001:restricted user:/home/foo:/bin/rbash\n\nYou must then disable the alias built-in for the user, preferably without breaking everyone else's shell too. As an example, you could add the following to a file such as /etc/profile.d/rbash.sh:\n# Limit effect to users in a specific UID range.\nif ((UID >= 2000)) && ((UID < 3000)); then\n    # Check shell options; disable alias builtins when shell is restricted.\n    if [[ $- =~ r ]]; then\n        enable -n alias\n        enable -n unalias\n    fi\nfi\n\nCaveats\nUnless you've placed the user into a chroot jail or provided them with a modified PATH that doesn't include access to other shells, there's nothing stopping the user from simply typing bash at the prompt and getting an unrestricted shell.\nIn addition, by design the restricted shell prevents many common activities such as changing directories:\n$ cd /tmp\nrbash: cd: restricted\n\nbut doesn't prevent other scripts or programs in the PATH from doing so. This means you have to carefully craft the user's environment, and specifically that you need to prevent them from being able to modify the PATH in their startup files, because even though rbash makes PATH read-only it does so after initialization.\nBetter Choices\nEven if you use rbash, you need to do so as part of a broader set of controls. Some examples may include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prevent non-technical users from accidentally invoking dangerous commands by providing default aliases such as rm -i, mv -i, and cp -i in the /etc/bash.bashrc file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Given your original example, this is probably the most sensible solution.\n\n*You can combine this with enable -n alias if you like.\n\n*This won't prevent knowledgable users from changing the aliases, but it may be sufficient to prevent non-technical users from doing whatever it is you're concerned about.\n\n\n*Traditional Unix permissions or POSIX ACLs to protect files and directories.\n\n*Logins that perform a single non-interactive command. For example:\nfoo:x:2001:2001:run foo.sh:/home/foo:/usr/local/bin/foo.sh\n\n\n*Use per-key SSH forced commands. For example:\n# ~foo/.ssh/authorized_keys\ncommand=\"/usr/local/bin/foo.sh\" [remainder of line]\n\n\n*Use the OpenSSH ForceCommand option with a conditional Match block.\n\n*Use special tools like gitolite or scponly designed for your specific use case.\n\n*Use a chroot jail.\n\n*Use virtualization such as Xen, OpenVZ, LXC, VMware, VirtualBox, or other technologies to provide a segregated environment.\nOnce you have accurately defined your threat model, you can identify the most appropriate controls for your use case. Without a more meaningful understanding of why you want to prevent aliasing (e.g. what real-world problem does it solve?) you can't select the most appropriate controls. \n\nA: You could define (in /etc/profile) a function called alias which does the validation you want (probably using type -p) (after all \"Ubuntu default commands\" are \"executables in $PATH\") before calling the builtin alias, BUT, as others have pointed out, your users could get around that. Why not get a different set of users, or educate them (\"Defining an alias that overrides a command is a Very Good Way of Shooting Oneself in the Foot, and causing confusion (e.g, Why does ls prompt for my password?))?\n", "Q: Virtual Box: Add Host Only Adapter I try to create the network first in file-> preferences.\nI get the error:\nFailed to create the host network interface.\nVBoxNetAdpCtl: Error while adding new interface: VBoxNetAdpCtl: ioctl failed for /dev/vboxnetctl: Inappropriate ioctl for devic.\n\nResult Code: NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)\nComponent: HostNetworkInterfaceWrap\nInterface: IHostNetworkInterface {455f8c45-44a0-a470-ba20-27890b96dba9}\n\n\nA: Must be related with current VirtualBox Version 5.0.16, I had the same issue, installed Version 5.0.14 from Ubuntu package archive and it worked for me.\n", "Q: Unable to connect to 'openconnect' through LAN I am trying to access 'openconnect' VPN through my WiFi and it works perfectly fine.

Or is there an alternative to Solaar ?\nAny help would be appreciated...\n\nA: According to the this answer to the original question about solaar, there is no longer a need for a ppa as solaar is now included in the Ubuntu \"universe\" repositories.\nIf you already have the \"universe\" enabled then you can install it via the Software Center by searching by it for name.\nIf you do no have it enabled there are a couple of ways to do that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Software Center to search for solaar. It should find it but tell you that is is avialble tru the \"universe\" repos and where the install button should be will be a button to \"Use Source\" click this and the rest should happen automatically.\n\n*If searching in the Software Center does not work, or you wish to do it yourself, you can do this with Software and Updates.  Search for it using the dash, click on it and you will get window like this\n \nThe second box down needs to be checked to allow universe sources.  Check the box, enter your password in the box that pops up.  This will enable the source.  When you close the Software and Updates window, it will ask you if you want to reload you software sources.  \nAnswer Yes and your software sources will update, you will then be able to find and install solaar in the software center.  \nNote: If you want the indicator and better integration with Unity(or Gnome shell), look in the \"optional add ons\" section on the More info\" page of the software Center.  You will want to click on(or make sure it is already selected) the \"solaar gmone3\" addon or you will only have the terminal version of solaar. \n\nYou can also install via the terminal by sudo apt-get install solaar-gnome3\nThis will install the packages needed to integrate with Unity and Gnome DE and will pull in and install solaar as well.\nIf you only want the command line of solaar, you can get that by sudo apt-get install solaar.\n", "Q: Ubuntu opens with guest log in i cannot switch to user log on I did receive a previous possible solution using a Terminal command but\nsince i was logged in as a guest the program was not authorized.\n\nA: Firstly try:  Ctrl-Alt-F5 to open a new terminal session, it will require that you login.\nTry to run your commands there.\nFailing this, You'll need to boot into single-user mode and complete the terminal commands there:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/132965/how-do-i-boot-into-single-user-mode-from-grub\nBear in mind that this will log you in as the root user, which is normally disabled, and the root user is extremely powerful.\nOnce your changes have been made, run the command \"reboot\" and all will start up normally.\nI hope this helps!\nKind Regards\n", "Q: How to rescue the Panel 0 How can I recover XFCE the Panel 0?\nI screwed up something here and now I don't know what to do: I erased the XFCE Panel 0 (the default-standard horizontal panel where are the typical application icons).\nI can not to find a way to recover it, not in the Configuration Panel, not in the Menu Configuration.\nHow can I \"rescue\" it?

But hopefully someone here will be even faster.\nAs mentioned in a different thread, I finally got Ubuntu 15.10 installed on my E5 573G-71L9. At first, the wireless LAN was not working, but I managed to find and install the presumably correct drivers.\nWhat I did was: first ensure that I had the correct r8168 driver for the Realtek card, downloaded from the Realtek site.\nAs wifi still didn't work, I also figured out that it was the Atheros card that needed a proper driver. I followed this method (I basically just copied-pasted all commands without understanding them completely): Qualcomm Atheros Device [168c:0042] (rev 30) Wi-Fi driver installation\nThis brought my wireless connection to live, but I got disconnected frequently, about every two minutes. According to the network manager, I am still connected, but I can't even ping the DNS server (I can ping localhost). Sometimes the connection gets restored after some time, other times I need to 'disconnect' and reconnect again.\nIn addition, I purged the r8168 driver that I downloaded from Acer and installed the r8168 from the Ubuntu Software Center - no difference. I also replaced the Atheros driver with the one that solved the problem for a person with the same system configuration (see other thread). For me, it did not work.\nMy regdomain is set to Germany (where I live).

I've just been fussing over it so much, looking at methods of configuration, reading guides and other help requests, and mostly just got myself confused, outside my range of skills, burnt out, and on the verge of just saying it's good enough that the pressure sensitivity and pen works.\nThis is kinda my last-ditch try here; seeing if anyone can make sense of this.\n\nAn update here. I have messed with it on and off over the months. With newer Ubuntu distros, its behavior changed slightly, but the problems persisted. But I do have a slight update that may explain it a bit better.\nMaybe I'm gonna get lucky and someone will be able to identify what the heck is going on.\nFrom what I have figured out:\nBy default, tablet drivers read it as having all possible tablet functions, though it should only have Pen and Keyboard. So it shows up 5 times, all controlled by evdev.\nInstalling Digimend makes a change: Pen is detected as Wacom in the following reset, then that too goes away after another reset, at which point neither xinput nor xsetwacom can detect anything. Inspecting the syslog, while I can't understand all that's there, I can understand it's reading the tablet (10594) being present.\nMay 27 07:22:09 Garnet kernel: [12090.086359] usb 3-1: Product: 10594\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet mtp-probe: checking bus 3, device 5: \"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1\"\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet mtp-probe: bus: 3, device: 5 was not an MTP device\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet kernel: [12090.404882] input: 10594 Pen as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/0003:256C:006E.0003/input/input7\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet kernel: [12090.404998] uclogic 0003:256C:006E.0003: input,hidraw2: USB HID v1.11 Device [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input0\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet kernel: [12090.405199] input: 10594 Mouse as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.1/0003:256C:006E.0004/input/input8\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet kernel: [12090.405331] uclogic 0003:256C:006E.0004: input,hiddev0,hidraw3: USB HID v1.11 Mouse [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input1\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet kernel: [12090.405882] input: 10594 Keyboard as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.2/0003:256C:006E.0005/input/input10\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet kernel: [12090.513450] input: 10594 Consumer Control as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.2/0003:256C:006E.0005/input/input11\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet kernel: [12090.513579] input: 10594 System Control as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.2/0003:256C:006E.0005/input/input12\nMay 27 07:22:10 Garnet kernel: [12090.513769] uclogic 0003:256C:006E.0005: input,hidraw4: USB HID v1.11 Keyboard [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input2\nMay 27 07:22:13 Garnet /usr/lib/snapd/snapd[4416]: daemon.go:170: DEBUG: uid=1000;@ GET /v2/snaps?sources=local 67.924µs 200\n\nMay 27 07:38:04 Garnet kernel: [   56.311313] usb 3-1: Product: 10594\nMay 27 07:38:04 Garnet mtp-probe: checking bus 3, device 5: \"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1\"\nMay 27 07:38:04 Garnet mtp-probe: bus: 3, device: 5 was not an MTP device\nMay 27 07:38:04 Garnet kernel: [   56.454322] uclogic 0003:256C:006E.0003: hidraw2: USB HID v1.11 Keypad [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input0\nMay 27 07:38:04 Garnet kernel: [   56.454643] uclogic 0003:256C:006E.0004: hiddev0,hidraw3: USB HID v1.11 Mouse [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input1\nMay 27 07:38:04 Garnet kernel: [   56.455162] uclogic 0003:256C:006E.0005: hidraw4: USB HID v1.11 Keyboard [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input2\n\nhidraw2: USB HID v1.11 Keypad [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input0\nMay 27 07:41:33 Garnet kernel: [    8.330450] uclogic 0003:256C:006E.0002: hiddev0,hidraw3: USB HID v1.11 Mouse [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input1\nMay 27 07:41:33 Garnet kernel: [    8.330924] uclogic 0003:256C:006E.0003: hidraw4: USB HID v1.11 Keyboard [10594] on usb-0000:00:14.0-1/input2\n\nSo.. I guess the uclogic module is properly grabbing the tablet, but somewhere in the process of getting it to the wacom profile it fails?\nIs the problem something stupid, like the fact that inside the tablet itself it's labelled as \"10594\" and so despite being the Huion H610, it's not being read properly due to a different product ID? I did try changing some of the recommended Huion configuration files to it, fruitlessly, a few times during my messing with it.\nEither way, while I understand it all a bit better, the darn thing still doesn't work, and has been nothing but compulsively driving me to get the buttons work, and supplying me with endless frustration.\n\nA: I finally got it working. Kinda disappointed that after four months, I finally answer it myself.\nI was right; it was the different name causing the problem. All the instructions I've been trying for over a year should have worked... but no instructions on any other help/request page, or Digimend tell you to match the pen and pad names from xinput to the matchProduct item in the xorg conf file.\nDidn't even find that as the answer, or know how the conf syntax worked: I just read the Digimend instructions for WALTOP, took a guess how the conf files worked, and it works fine after making two profiles in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/52-tablet.conf for \"10594 Pen\" and \"10594 Pad\".\nxsetwacom --set \"10594 Pad pad\" to the GIMP hotkeys for Button 1 2 3 8 9 10 11 12, and it's now in completely functioning order. Finally.\n\nA quick addendum; I also am using 14.04 LTS on another system. 16.04 still breaks all tablet detection with digimend installed, so having figured out configuration or not doesn't help there if the driver doesn't even work. Seeing if I can figure that one out since I would prefer to use the tablet on the other system.\n\nA: For 16.04 you want to install from the latest source code which you can get from https://github.com/DIGImend/digimend-kernel-drivers\nDo not use the .deb v6 installer, it will not detect the tablet.\nClick on the green \"Clone or download\" button to get the latest digimend-kernel-drivers-master.zip\nsudo rmmod hid-uclogic\n\nNavigate to the unzipped digimen-kernel-drivers-master\nmake\n\nuninstall the current driver if there is one with the sudo make uninstall\nsudo make uninstall\nsudo make install\n\nAfter this I have often had to do a sudo insmod hid-uclogic.ko to import the new driver.\nAnother excellent resource is HUION H610 Tablet. That link will cover your question about buttons and almost anything else H610 related, it is odd that the name of your device is different, maybe the newer driver will fix this.\n", "Q: How do I fix my partitions? I installed Ubuntu for an rPi 2 on an 8GiB micro SD card. However, when I subsequently set about installing software I ran out of space. That's because I forgot to repartition immediately after installation. However, I think I screwed up my repartitioning attempt and am wondering whether I can undo things to get back on track.\nHere's what I did:\nFirst, I checked df -h:\nFilesystem                          Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/root                           1.7G  1.6G     0 100% /\ndevtmpfs                            458M  4.0K  458M   1% /dev\nnone                                4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nnone                                 93M  380K   93M   1% /run\nnone                                5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone                                462M     0  462M   0% /run/shm\nnone                                100M     0  100M   0% /run/user\n/dev/mmcblk0p1                       64M   20M   45M  31% /boot/firmware\n\nI then ran sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0, and viewed the partition list:\nDisk /dev/mmcblk0: 7948 MB, 7948206080 bytes\n4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 242560 cylinders, total 15523840 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\n        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/mmcblk0p1   *        2048      133119       65536    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n/dev/mmcblk0p2          133120     3670015     1768448   83  Linux\n\nNext, I deleted the second partition, and recreated it as a primary, this time allocating all available space. I typed w to write it, then exited and rebooted my pi.\nHowever, after a reboot the output of df -h looks the same.

After this i searched for ''Adobe flash player firefox'' then noticed it was not installed (maybe because i updated Adobe flash firectly from Firefox), anyway i clicked on the result that appeared, it was the Adobe flash plugin installer for mozilla, then scrolling a bit down the page I selected all the Optional extensions then i clicked Apply and installed all of it, After closing Firefox and re-open it on Trainstation portal page i noticed the scrollbar moving smoothly so far. \nBoring and serious if Adobe definetely stops upgrading flash versions for firefox, hope this for good not happen through we Linux users.\nI thank you for the answer.\n", "Q: rsync not setting the correct UID and GID on destination files I am testing whether I use the correct options on rsync because I want to copy a large amount of files from my old server to the new server keeping exact permissions.\nOn the old server, the file exists like this:\n$ ll -n\ntotal 0\n-rw-r--r-- 1 1002 1000 0 Jan  9 22:56 testfile\n\nThen I use rsync to copy the file like this:\n$ rsync -e ssh -avP . 10.10.10.254:/home/someuser/test\nEnter passphrase for key 'newserver.key':\nsending incremental file list\n./\ntestfile\n           0 100%    0.00kB/s    0:00:00 (xfer#1, to-check=0/2)\n\nsent 125 bytes  received 34 bytes  28.91 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 0  speedup is 0.00\n\nOn the new server, there is no user with ID 1002 and no user with the same name.

I recently installed Ubuntu into a chroot on my Chromebook, and installed a lot of software. Today, after rebooting and re-entering unity, I see weird black bars around menu items, and over top of almost all windows. I've tried everything I can think of. I've reset unity and compiz multiple times, reinstalled ubuntu-desktop and unity, but nothing has worked. I can't even take a screenshot of the problems because the screenshot window is also just a black box. I still have access to the command line. Please help.\nEDIT: I was able to take a picture with my phone and upload it.\nBlack boxes\n\nA: As mentioned in my comment I had this issue (U 15.10) after installing an update involving some intel graphics. Using TTY1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1) -- as the GUI terminal was unusable -- running apt-get dist-upgrade upgraded some other parts of the intel graphics (didn't take note of what). After that and a reboot all was well.\n", "Q: Freeze on shutdown/restart and randomly - Xubuntu 15.10 - Acer Aspire ES1-512 I recently bought an Acer Aspire ES1-512. I wiped the disk and installed Xubuntu 15.10 64bit (dual boot with Windows 7 - BIOS, not UEFI).\nWhen I started using Xubuntu, I realized that at random points, it completely freezes with the screen retaining it's contents but nothing being responsive, and the only possibility being to hold the power button and force a restart.\nI also noticed that initiating a shutdown or a restart or a standby all result in the same problem (the freeze).\nTo test whether older versions of the OS don't have the problem, I tried installing a bunch of them on a flash drive and trying a live boot. All of the versions 14.04.3-desktop-amd64 / 15.04-desktop-amd64 / 15.10-desktop-amd64 had the same problem (freeze on shutdown), however 14.10-desktop-amd64 shuts down successfully.\nAny suggestions?\nEDIT: I tried turning off ACPI by adding acpi=off to /etc/default/grub, and I noticed that this solves the random freezes, but it didn't solve the shutdown/restart problem. Also, turning off ACPI disabled some features like keyboard media (fn) keys and the built-in MMC card reader as well as the battery meter, so this is not a good solution..\nEDIT: I tried a memtest for 10+ hours and it passed.\n\nA: Here's the solution to the shutdown problems:\n\n[...] In the BIOS settings I had to disable the \"xHCI support (external USB 3.0 controller)\". Maybe not the best solution, but it works for me.\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that I disabled UEFI in the BIOS and using legacy mode instead [...]\n\nSource: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1529860#p1529860\n\nA: There have been reports of Acer laptops failing to shutdown or restart properly with some recent kernels. Disabling XHCI USB3 support in the BIOS seems to workaround the issue. This will have the disadvantage of slowing down any USB3 devices to USB2 speeds. It is probably the same USB3 issue  reported as bug #1485057 which is likely to be fixed in recent kernels, so you could installing a recent mainline kernel instead of disabling USB3. \n\nA: I had the same problem with my Acer ES1-512. I tried ubuntu, mint, loki, freya, manjaro and they all had the same problem, they didn't shutdown. \nThen I figured it that there must be a problem with the pc and not with the os.\nAfter a few minutes looking in BIOS I saw that boot was in legacy mode. \nI sitched it to UEFI and reinstalled os. After that everything worked great.\n\nA: This seems to be a problem with the version of X.Org shipped in the newer versions (14.04.2+ gets the X.org version from 15.04).  This laptop seems to use Intel Graphics, try getting the latest version at:  https://01.org/linuxgraphics/downloads/intel-graphics-installer-linux-1.2.1.  This might allow 15.10 to work if the bug has been fixed.  As a workaround you could use Xubuntu 14.04.1\n\nA: I had exactly the same problems with my Acer ES1-711 laptop, and all is started when bios was upgraded from version 1.02 to 1.05 (Insydeh20). After much searching on forums (firstly i'm not suspected the bios has fault because on those days i tried many distros and was thinking problem is created by some package from downloaded updates, kernel or so...) finally decided to downgrade bios to a previous 1.02 version and problem is gone, at least now i can to properly shut down or restart...Recently the Xubuntu 15.10 kernel was upgraded to 4.2.0-27(from .0-25), will see how system is going now, if any problem - i'll post here a message, if all is ok - then problem created by bios, at least for me. p.s. \"suggests shutdown/reboot issues can be worked around by blacklisting dw_dmac and dw_dmac_core. – bain Jan 13 at 17:11\" - had to do this with EVERY distro of linux, if not - problem whit shutdown/restart persists(but not freezes).

I can't download Winusb, UNetbootin doesn't work, and neither does startup disk creator. I've tried Rufus and Microsoft's official usb tools through Wine and nothing has worked. Does anyone have any idea how to make it work?\n\nA: If you've booted in Ubuntu, you can use dd. In a teminal, type\nsudo dd if=input.iso of=/dev/sdX\nwhere input.iso is the source windows iso and /dev/sdX (X will vary) is the destination USB drive you want to wipe entirely and replace with the windows iso. I use gparted to make sure I'm writing to the device I think I'm writing to, as dd will nuke whatever you point it at.\n", "Q: Ubuntu drive partition after installing Ubuntu 14.04 I am using Toshiba Satellite C660 laptop and I moved from Windows 8.1 to Ubuntu. I may have made some mistake during installation as before installing ubuntu I had 4 partitions but after it, only one partition with the size equals to the size of hard drive. Is it possible to create partitions as this is the only partition as of now. What tools will be required and please provide with the terminal codes that needs to be used.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: @devansh. Brother you didn't make any mistake if you think why there is only one partition. In Ubuntu there is only one partition called the Home or the root unlike that of Windows in which you can partition your hard drive upto a maximum of 4 drives. I don't think if you can partition after installation but there is a step to logically partition your volume size before installation. I think it will be clear now \n", "Q: How to know the version of iBus I'm using?

I'm still personally trying to figure out how to update it myself\nedit: I found a post that breaks down installing the newest version of ibus, link. \nAlso in case you run into the same error I did when attempting to install it, if you run into the error saying your intltool is too old run:\nsudo apt-get install intltool\nWhen you run the make command stated in the above link, you might get a lot of missing packages. For the most part just install them one by one and if need be google to find the source package for some.\n\nA: The version of iBus or any package that you are using is normally found using apt-cache policy package where \"package\" is the name of the package that the software belongs to.

Any advice?\n\nA: I had a similar problem when trying to fool around with a similar /dev/sdb device, my problem was that the sdb was trying to \"start at boot\" i cant remember what i did exactly to change it back. If you can access your desktop then go into the disks program and edit the mount options and remove the \"start at boot\" check box.

That way all the programs added and changes I have made can transfer right into the new laptop as the main OS without having to do it all over again?\nThank you very much for your help and time!\n\nA: You'll need to boot from a live USB (you might be able to use the same source USB).\nAssuming your USB is located at /dev/sdb and that your hard drive is located at /dev/sda then you can simply run the following:\ndd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sda\n\nAnd that will copy bit for bit everything on the USB to your hard drive.  You should be able to boot from it then.

So for example OpenJDK provides java and java-devel. And every package that Requires it will grab it as well.\nThe problem is that there is no other providers for java and java-devel, Oracle JDK cannot be redistributed by license, rarely anyone cares packaging IBM or Azul JDK, other JVM implementations are not feature-full enough.\nSo the only workaround for your issue is:\n1. establish the alternatives as suggested by aramboi.\n2. create a synthetic package that will not have anything inside but will Provide java and/or java-devel.\nThat will be the trick to make dpkg think you have everything needed in place and it will not download openjdk any more. About 8 years ago that could cause the problems with software linked to libjvm.so, but I doubt there's anything left that still links to libjvm.so instead of just running the java executables.\n\nA: I think better approach is to use additional repository ppa:webupd8team/java for installing Oracle JDK 7,8,9.\nDetails you can read here: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html.\n", "Q: Touchpad is not working I bought a new acer E5-574g-50XN laptop with linpus linux.

Try: -R '\\?C='\nQuick Demo\nSet up an different empty directory, for example\n$ mkdir ~/experiment2\n$ cd ~/experiment2\n\nThen a shorter version of your command, without the recursion and levels in order to do a quick one page test:\n$ wget --tries=inf --timestamping --convert-links --page-requisites --no-parent -R '\\?C=' http://ioccc.org/2013/cable3/\n\nAfter wget is done, ~/experiment2, will have no index.html?C=... files:\n.\n└── ioccc.org\n    ├── 2013\n    │   └── cable3\n    │       └── index.html\n    ├── icons\n    │   ├── back.gif\n    │   ├── blank.gif\n    │   ├── image2.gif\n    │   ├── text.gif\n    │   └── unknown.gif\n    └── robots.txt\n\n4 directories, 7 files\n\nSo it has indeed excluded those redundant index-sort index.html?C=... directories while keeping all other index.html directories, in this case just index.html\nImplement\nSo just implement the -R '\\?C=' , by updating your shell function in ~/.bashrc:\ncrwl() {\n  wget --tries=inf --timestamping --recursive --level=inf --convert-links --page-requisites --no-parent -R '\\?C=' \"$@\"\n}\n\nThen remember to either test in a new terminal, or re-source bash to make it effective:\n$ . ~/.bashrc\n\nThen try it in a new directory, for comparison:\n$ mkdir ~/experiment3\n$ cd ~/experiment3\n$ crwl http://ioccc.org/2013/cable3/\n\nWarranty\n\n\n*\n\n*wget 1.14 and up only. So if your wget -V says it is 1.13 this may not work and you have need to actually delete those pesky index.html?C=... yourself, or try to get a more recent version of wget.\n\n*works by specifying you want to -R or reject a pattern, in this case pages with ?C= pattern that is typical of the index.html?C=... versions of index.html.\n\n*however ? happens to be a wget wildcard, thus to match a literal ? you need to escape it as \\?\n\n*don't interrupt wget. Because it seems the way wget works with browse-able web pages is to actually download first, delete later, as if it needs to check in case those pages have further links to crawl. So if you cancel this halfway you are still going to end up with index.html?C= files. Only if you let wget finish, then wget will follow your -R specification and delete any temporarily downloaded index.html?C=... files for you\n\n\nA: Try this after download, if you do not want to use wget's removal mechanism or are on a system not suporting this option.\nFIND=$($WHICH find)\nPWD2=$($WHICH pwd)\nSH=$($WHICH sh)\nECHO=$($WHICH echo)\nLESS=$($WHICH less)\n\nCommand:\n$FIND \"$($PWD2)\" -regextype posix-egrep -type f -regex '^(.*?html\\?C=[DNSM];O=[AD])$' -exec \"$SH\" -c 'o=\"{}\";$ECHO -f -v \"${o}\"' \\; | $LESS\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the output, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Issue the following command (see below box)\n\n*Replace $ECHO with $RM in the above command.\n\n*Remove the pipe (|) and the $LESS, to get actual output.\n\n\n(I'm not responsible for when you delete your whole file system, therefore this way.)\nRM=$($WHICH rm);export RM\n$FIND \"$($PWD2)\" -regextype ... ;$RM -f -v \"${xox}\"' \\; \n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Laptop screen brightness change seems to affect color, not backlight I have a problem with my laptop (Acer Aspire 5750G), I can't change the screen brightness.

It seems to decrease the brightness in color, not in the backlight of the laptop strength. I wasn't completely sure at first, but I tested it now with black color, and there is no decrease in the darkness of black, because the backlight never decreases, just the colors get darker if you decrease this brightness.\nI think a lot of people on the forums failed to notice this phenomenon, however it's real. And it's bad, it does affect the eyes negatively as well as the battery performance.\nCan anybody tell me how to decrease the brightness in terms of the laptop screen backlight strength?\n\nA: OK, seems I figured out how to change the brightness after all, all you  have to do is:\necho 100 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nthe path should be /sys/class/backlight/ and whatever the path is relevant for your monitor.\nthe echo 100 is the amount for the screen brightness, I think max is 976 or something, I don't know what the lowest is, might be 1 or something, but this finally worked for me, despite browsing countless forums and stack questions I finally found it.\nEDIT:\ndecided I'd like to share with you, how I modified my discoveries to make the brightness increase and decrease when called:\n$ screenlight=`cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness`; echo `expr $screenlight - 100`  | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness \n\n750\nThe 100 in here can be replaced with any suitable value for you, with 100 you would have approximately 10 brightness steps.\nNow you can just map this command to a keyboard key or keyboard shortcut and you have a working screen brightness control on your laptop...\n", "Q: How to import a profile into qTox?

You can teach Linux to recognise the Magic Mouse 2 and load the hid_magicmouse module (as it would for the original Magic Mouse and Trackpad) by modifying the udev and modprobe configs.

I'm using a bluetooth keyboard with Ubuntu Touch (N7), it connects fine but its single Alt key sends the key code for AltGr. I need it to be mapped to Alt / L_Alt (Emacs standard Meta key, as atm I have no Meta key). Emacs documentation says that one should do this sort of key mapping within Linux and not within Emacs. \nThe tutorials I've read for desktop Ubuntu reference xmodmap for basic key mapping. xmodmap isn't installed in Touch although it's available via apt-get as part of the X11-utils, although again it's not clear to me how much use X11 is with Touch generally (same for xkb and console-setup). I may be misunderstanding things, but the maliit mappings seem to be only for the onscreen keyboard. I also poked around the Android partition as I assume it's actually handing the bluetooth input, but wasn't sure how to experiment with the keymappings I found there when I couldn't mount the partition RW using the usual sudo mount -o remount,rw. \nThis should be a small fix somewhere - can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: Your question seems to match to this bug report: 1529049\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-keyboard/+bug/1529049\n", "Q: Using rsync with sudo on the destination machine Having a problem that rsync does not set UID and GID as expected, my gut feeling is that rsync should be run as root on the destination machine.\nI can't login as root via SSH, since that's disabled for security purposes. The user on the destination machine is able to use sudo.\nIs it possible to use rsync with sudo?\n\nA: You can have the remote sudo ask you for your password through X-windows. Here's a way to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure ssh-askpass is installed on the remote host (and that you are using X-windows, of course)\n\n*Make sure this is in /etc/sudo.conf:\n\n\n# Path to askpass helper program\nPath askpass /usr/bin/ssh-askpass\n\n\n\n*Add these options to rsync: -e \"ssh -X\" --rsync-path=\"sudo -A rsync\"\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh -X will forward your X-windows information and port to your\nremote session\n\n*sudo -A will make sudo use ssh-askpass to ask you for your password\n\n\n\nA: If there is no access to sudoers file,\njust create a wrapper script for the ssh command.\nssh_sudo:\n{ \n  echo $PASSWORD;\n  cat - ;\n} | ssh $* &\n\nAt first, this passes the password to the ssh client's sudo process in order to start rsync on the remote side. Next all input coming from the local rsync is piped to ssh.\nFinally call rsync e.g. with:\nPASSWORD=<SUDOPASS> rsync -avzue ssh_sudo --rsync-path \"sudo -S rsync\" SRC DST\n\nI guess the security aspect here is not that bad, you'll only have to save the password locally as env var. Reading it from a file should work as well...\n\nA: The solutions which suggest modifying /etc/sudoers or echoing the password into a pipe didn't feel comfortable.\nInstead, I've found success with the answer posted here.

Can't upvote or comment using my account (not enough reputation points), so I'll post this as another answer:\nSimon's solution not only is the safest alternative in that it requires no changes to sudoers and passes the password using the environment (so that it will not pop up in history files and logs), it also works without changes to the target machine, which is very convenient if you want to rsync to lots of fresh machines and do not want to reconfigure them just for this command.\nAfter playing around with it a bit, I've managed to inline the shell commands used for wrapping ssh on the host machine as well, so it is possible to just use a single rsync line:\nPASSWORD=<SUDOPASS> rsync -avzue '/bin/sh -c \"{ echo $PASSWORD; cat - ; } | ssh $0 $* &\"' --rsync-path \"sudo -S rsync\" SRC DST\n\nHappy syncing ;-)\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu Live CD to create disk image? My Windows laptop (ThinkPad W520) has issues. Windows cannot repair itself. I have used a USB adapter to verify that the HDD is fine and also managed to boot it up using an Ubuntu Live disk. I want to create an explorable image of my HDD before I wipe it clean and install windows 7 on it again.\nI want to know if it's possible to utilize this Ubuntu live disk and make an image of my laptop's HDD and save it onto my external hard drive? I want to create an image which I will be able to browse from my new windows installation on my laptop. \nIs this doable?\n\nA: Boot your Ubuntu live system and connect the external HDD where you want to save the image. You do not need to (or should not?) mount the Windows HDD.\nOpen gnome-disks by searching for it in the Dash's application lens (Super+A), entering it into the HUD (Alt+F2) or launching it from a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T).\nWhen the window below opens, select your source drive on the left (the 250GB Hitachi HDD in my example, see red circle). Then open the drive context menu by clicking on the hamburger button on the right (see red arrow).\n\n\nIn the appearing context menu above, select Create Disk Image... to open another dialogue window:\n\nEnter a nice file name for the disk image file to create and select a location (the external HDD) where to save it.

I answered this question about do-release-upgrade not allowing an upgrade of 14.10 to 15.04 only to 15.10, I assumed it was due to 15.04 being end of life.\nA user (@xangua ) posted that it was not possible to skip a release with do-release-upgrade, so I looked in to this information by running the command on my 14.04 box, but this is where the confusion began.\nMy 14.04 wants to upgrade straight to 15.04? \nOf course this invalidates my answer as 15.04 is end of life, but why does this command seem to be skipping versions, if not based on end of life? \nThere is no indication any thing from 14.10 is being downloaded by the upgrade and software-updater says Ubuntu 15.04 is now available for download, some clarification of this would be great.\n\nA: do-release-upgrade doesn't know anything about \"jumping versions\". It simply downloads the upgrade plan from the Ubuntu repository maintainers. This is specified in do-release-upgrade README:\n\n2) The upgrade tool must be able to download updated information\n     how to perform the upgrade (e.g. additional steps like upgrading \n     certain libs first)\n\nAlso, in the specification about Automatic Upgrades:\n\nA meta-release file with information about the available distributions is stored on a central server and it is If-Modified-Since tested on each run of update-manager. If a new version is found, update-manager shows that visually. \n\nThis is what allows do-upgrade-release and any other tool to upgrade seamlessly.\n\nA: Your original guess was right. 15.04 is supported through 2016-02-04, so do-release-upgrade is trying to upgrade you to the next supported release compared to the one you have.\nHere's the description of normal upgrade prompting mode from /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades:\n\nCheck to see if a new release is available.  If more than one new release is found, the release upgrader will attempt to upgrade to the release that immediately succeeds the currently-running release.\n\nSo if I'm on 14.04 it should be trying to take me to 14.10, but right now do-release-upgrade is trying to take the OP (and me) to 15.04 instead.\nSo reading through /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/DistUpgrade/MetaRelease.py it looks like we skip unsupported releases when figuring out what release to upgrade to (unless you're using the developer flag):\n    # then see what we can upgrade to\n    upgradable_to = \"\"\n    for dist in dists:\n        if dist.date > current_dist.date:\n            # Only offer to upgrade to an unsupported release if running\n            # with useDevelopmentRelease, this way one can upgrade from an\n            # LTS release to the next supported non-LTS release e.g. from\n            # 14.04 to 15.04.\n            if not dist.supported and not self.useDevelopmentRelease:\n                continue\n            upgradable_to = dist\n            self._debug(\"new dist: %s\" % upgradable_to)\n            break\n\nI should add that I do not recommend trying to get around this with do-release-upgrade -d. When I tried it with prompt=normal, I got 404s, since 14.10 is EoL. I also think in my delirium I must have tried do-release-upgrade -p, which tried to take me straight to 16.04. By the time I realized it was taking me to xenial everything was broken and I had to restore from factory. In the end I decided I'll wait until 16.04 is released and do a fresh install.\n", "Q: Intel Core i7-3612QM multi-core CPU not being utilised properly I have a Dell Inspiron 7520 with an Intel Core i7-3612QM CPU that repeatedly cycles through 100% usage of each individual core while barely using any other core as shown in the screen shot below.\n\nThis happens regardless of what I'm running and might be what's causing my laptop to heat up, how would I go about making my laptop use all of the cores concurrently? \nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n\nA: It's not possible to spread a single threaded processes over multiple cores evenly. A single threaded process can only run on one core at a given time and the kernel might move the process/thread to another core while the programm runs. \nIf one process is running at 100% on one core all the time you should check for that process and why it is utilizing one core.\n", "Q: Sidebar configuration Used to run Unix on HP servers, many years ago, and several years ago started dabbling with Linux.

slow. \nMy clock speed id : 1603.000\nDesktop environment is Unity.\nWhat's the solution to make it function with a better speed?\nInstalling other desktop environments like xfce or Lxde will help getting better speed?\nAny disadvantages of installing them?\nPlease help!\n\nA: I have a few suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change desktop environment. Changing to a more lightweight environment WILL speed up your machine (a lot), since Unity is one of the most bloated ones. I recommend Xfce for your machine. LXDE is a bit TOO lightweight and it's not worth it. Xfce is highly customizable and beautiful. No big cons. To install it in Ubuntu, run the command sudo apt-get install xubuntu-core (don't use xubuntu-desktop since it will install some possibly unwanted programs).\n\n\nMy computer is a 9 year old fighter with an Intel Celeron CPU @ 2.8GHz, 1512 MB of RAM and a GeForce 6200 GPU, and Xfce runs incredibly smooth.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install proprietary drivers\n\n\nIf you have NVidia or AMD drivers, look for the \"Additional drivers\" program, which comes preinstalled in Ubuntu. Install all proprietary drivers, reboot and feel the performance difference. Intel hardware usually won't need any extra drivers, since they are included in the kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Xfce, disable Window compositing in the \"Compositor\" settings. You won't have that much eye candy such as shadows in the back of windows or transparency but the system will run better.\n\n", "Q: Cannot install Atom on Ubuntu Mate I have Mate 1.10.2 and have been trying to install Atom text editor (use it on my windows 10) but can't get it to install.

I am mainly a Windows user, but need to install Qt/QtC for testing purposes under Ubuntu 14. \nAfter downloading the installer (as described here: https://wiki.qt.io/Install_Qt_5_on_Ubuntu ) it wants to install under my home directory /home/myuser/Qt It works (I have tested it), but wonder if this is the correct place.\nShould it not be in /opt , or what is the best place to install it? It should be available for all users, not only me.\n--- Edit ---\nI need at least Qt 5.5 (soon Qt5.6) to be in sync with my Win environment. To me it looks like (dpkg -L libqt5core5a -> /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so.5.2 ) 5.2 is the default installation. \n--- Edit 2 ---\nInteresting, if I run sudo ./qt-unified-linux-x64-2.0.2-2-online.run the installer automatically proposes /opt/Qt as install dir.\n\nA: \nIt should be available for all users, not me.\n\n... answers your question. I would go for /opt/ purely so you separate it from your main system. Even though it might not 100% completely match the /opt/ definition it is the best place to put it.\nSet it up with a group and add all the users needing it to that group.\n\n/opt/\nThis directory is reserved for all the software and add-on packages that are not part of the default installation. For example, StarOffice, Kylix, Netscape Communicator and WordPerfect packages are normally found here. To comply with the FSSTND, all third party applications should be installed in this directory. Any package to be installed here must locate its static files (ie. extra fonts, clipart, database files) must locate its static files in a separate /opt/'package' or /opt/'provider' directory tree (similar to the way in which Windows will install new software to its own directory tree C:\\Windows\\Progam Files\\\"Program Name\"), where 'package' is a name that describes the software package and 'provider' is the provider's LANANA registered name.\n\n\nA: Qt is already installed on Ubuntu. If you want to develop Qt5 applications with QtCreator, then simply install the qtcreator package.\nIf you do need to install a newer version, then the installer from Qt likely installs based on how you run the installer. To install in /opt if that is what you wish to do, you will need to run the installer as root, such as by running sudo Qt5Installer.run (or whatever the command may be). If you run as your normal user, it will only allow you to install into a path where your user has write access, and generally this is somewhere under $HOME.\nAnother option is to use the Ubuntu SDK Release PPA, which has the ubuntu-sdk-ide package, which includes it's own private version of Qt (currently 5.4.1 as of this post, it seems). This should be following what the Ubuntu phone images ship, which will soon be upgraded to 5.5, and also soon to 5.6.\nUnless you're actually depending on new APIs only available in the latest Qt release, then I'd recommend only building against the newest version of Qt which you absolutely need.\n", "Q: When does an active Ubuntu version expire? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\nThe EOL date for Trusty Tahr (14.04) is blank.

If yes, and if you want to keep Windows, you'll need to set it up on dual boot, which with UEFI might be tricky for a beginner.\nFor your project, a Live Linux USB stick might be sufficient.  The advantage is that you won't have to worry with installations and fear of data loss (again, assuming your laptop runs Windows).

I'm planning on installing lubuntu on my laptop and buying an external monitor for it. I have 2 questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will it work right when I plug it in?

I want to use my external monitor only, so I want to close the laptop, make sure the laptop screen turns off, but the external monitor has to work.\n\n\nThank you very much for any answers. whether I will install lubuntu on my laptop will depend on whether I can or can not use an external monitor.\n\nA: Question 1 : Your Nvidia GPU driver should work by default but it will be using the open source driver by Nouveau. Typically on the Nvidia cards the open source drivers are not as fast as the proprietary drivers provided by Nvidia. However, the drivers by Nouveau tend to be more stable. \nTry the open source ones first if you don't get the performance you like then try the Nvidia proprietary ones. To change GPU drivers go into the additional drivers settings. \nQuestion 2 : This just takes some tweaking in the settings. There is usually power settings in every distro that will let you set things like this. For instance set the close lid setting to “do nothing” when you close it. The external should work just fine. \n", "Q: Uninstalling Google Earth. Something that I can't find anywhere in the web I usually don't ask for help unless I really can't find the answer myself.

I'm experiencing some crazy issues regarding my internet speed using Ubuntu 15.04. I can't get anything greater than 10Mbps down,but I'm achieve 30 Mbps up. \nMy laptop doesn't have an Ethernet port, but uses a Intel 7260 Dual Band wireless card. I figured that this card was the source of all my problems. \nUsually they are 4 sources of internet issues.\nISP level, Router Level, Driver Level, Hardware Level. \nBut I haven't been able to narrow it down. My ISP is fios and every other device in the house performance is great. It is not the router, as once again other wireless devices are having no issues.\nSo I'm thinking it must be the driver or hardware, the wireless card is prone to issues in Ubuntu and Windows. However I had a Sony WLan adapter and I figured I would use that until I replace the card. Well the performance still is the same, around 10 Mbps down and 30 Mbps up. \nI have never seen anything like this. \nAlso in Connection Information the speed says 130 Mbps, but the actually throughput still stays under 10Mbps. \n\nA: So this answer help me. \nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/638554/491662\n\nTurn off bluetooth (use rfkill or turn off in Bios)\n  Turn OFF 802.11n mode (in /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf add options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1)\n  Turn ON link aggregation (in /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf add options iwlwifi 11n_disable=8)\n  Turn OFF watchdog (in /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf add options iwlwifi wd_disable=1)\n  Turn off power saving features ($ sudo iw wlan0 set power_save off)\n  Set regulatory domain ($ sudo iw reg set )\n\nAll my research has me to believe that bluetooth is a major culprit. For instance I realize this problems didn't start until I started using a pair of bluetooth headphones with my laptop. Also If I follow those instructions but skipped turning of bluetooth, the performance will increase until a bluetooth device is connected. \nI still don't know why bluetooth would only interfere with the download speed and not the upload speed.\nAs suggested , bluetooth isn't the main culprit\nI have made another change which as dramatically improved performance. The router supplied by Fios has two internal wireless access points. One operates at 2.4 GHz and is (b,g,n capable) while the other operates at 5 GHz (n,ac capable). They were set to the same SSID. Once I changed the ID my connection to the routers says at around 130-200 Mbps. \nThere still might be another problem, on other ac capable routers I get around 500 Mbps. But my actual bandwidth from FIOS is no where near that, and I'm not doing any local networking stuff some I'm fine with this improvement.\n", "Q: How to grant root privileges when I generate an OTR key in Pidgin I recently installed Pidgin on my Ubuntu machine along with OTR plugin.

You should use gksudo (kdesudo on Kubuntu) to run such\n  programs. gksudo sets   HOME=~root, and copies .Xauthority to a tmp\n  directory. This prevents files   in your home directory becoming owned\n  by root.   (AFAICT, this is all that's special about the environment\n  of the started     process with gksudo vs. sudo).\n\nSo gksu is basically a graphical frontend for sudo that allows graphical command to be run without the need to run an X terminal emulator and using su directly\nReference: This Question\n", "Q: libatlas package I am new to Ubuntu.

But every now and then I screw something up, and I miss the Grub2 option of booting into \"recovery mode\" and then dropping into a root shell that has access to my Ubuntu system.  \nIs there any way to do something similar in rEFInd when using an iMac (I mention this because this seems to imply that shell doesn't play nice with Macs)? I tried calling the shell option on the showtools line of local.conf, but nothing shows up in rEFInd.\nI also tried to use rEFInd'sInsert or F2 for more options option, but there was no shell option there either.  \nNOTE:\nWhen using an Mac, to access rEFInd's Insert or F2 for more options, you need to press the fn key (which is where the Insert key is on a Windows keyboard) and the f2 key simultaneously.  This brings up the boot options, which are set (on a Linux system) at /boot/refind_linux.conf. \n\nA: First, understand that when booting Linux, various options are passed to the kernel to modify how it acts. In most cases it's necessary to pass a root= option to identify where the root (/) filesystem resides. It's common to pass other options, too, although the details vary from one distribution and installation to another. Boot managers, including both GRUB and rEFInd, provide menus that enable you to pass different collections of options by selecting them from menus. For simplicity, the menus seldom show you the details of the options; instead, they summarize the options with names, like \"boot 4.2.0 normally\" or \"boot 4.2.3 in recovery mode.\" You must examine the boot loader's configuration file to decipher what options any given menu entry passes. Thus, the GRUB \"recovery mode\" option isn't a GRUB feature per se; it's just a menu entry that boots Linux with extra (and/or omitted) options.\nI just checked the GRUB entry for a (pre-release) Xenial installation I happen to have running, and its \"recovery\" entry specifies, in addition to a root= option, ro recovery nomodeset. To duplicate this in rEFInd, you can do either of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can hit F2 or Insert twice to enter the boot options editor, and modify the options appropriately. You must ensure that ro recovery nomodeset is present. Depending on the configuration, you might want to remove the quiet splash options, too. You should not modify the root= option or the initrd= option, though.\n\n*You can edit /boot/refind_linux.conf and create a new entry (or modify an existing one) that makes equivalent changes to the boot options. This entry will then become available when you hit F2 or Insert once at the rEFInd menu.\n\n\nThe first approach is usable on any system using rEFInd and launching Linux kernels directly (unless the relevant features have been disabled in refind.conf); but manually entering the options is a nuisance. The second option is more convenient if you want to enter this mode even remotely frequently.\nUnfortunately, recovery features vary greatly from one distribution to another, which is why this isn't part of rEFInd's standard configuration. rEFInd does provide a \"single-user\" option in its default menu. This option passes single to the kernel, which tells it to boot into single-user mode. This is more standard than the Ubuntu-specific \"recovery mode,\" but I doubt if it does the same thing. (I honestly have never used Ubuntu's \"recovery mode.\")\nOh, and rEFInd's shell feature launches an EFI shell; but the shell is a separate EFI binary that you must install yourself. The EFI shell enables you to run arbitrary EFI programs, edit files, etc.\nIncidentally, the keyboard issues you note represent quirks of some Macs' (and some other computers') keyboards; the function keys on some keyboards do double duty as something else, such as to control volume, screen brightness, etc. Such keyboards have a \"Fn\" key to toggle between use as a traditional function key and to control the media (or whatever). This type of setup is most common on laptops, but I've seen a few USB keyboards with similar setups. On some keyboards the function key is the default and other times the media-control function is the default.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 won't boot I have just completed a fresh install of ubuntu 15.04.

This might or might not be the source of your problem, but it is a possible source of problems, and if you're experiencing some other problem, you might fix that problem and then run into a Secure Boot problem, which might make you think that your fix was ineffective. Thus, disabling Secure Boot is in order. If you want Secure Boot to be active, you can try re-activating it once you've got the basics working.\nWith that done, you might try booting with a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. If you can boot rEFInd, it should show you option to boot both Windows and Ubuntu. Test them both. If they both work, you can install rEFInd to your hard disk via the Debian package or PPA. Alternatively, once you've booted Ubuntu via rEFInd, you can install the grub-efi package in Ubuntu and then run grub-install. This will install GRUB to your hard disk, which should work -- but because you didn't boot via GRUB, that's not quite as certain.\nBacking up again, the symptoms you report generally indicate either a Secure Boot error or an improperly-prepared boot disk. You say you've tried preparing your USB drive \"thousands of way[s],\" which of course is an exaggeration. It's possible that you made some fundamental error in all of your attempts; or perhaps your firmware is very picky and you happened to use methods that ran afoul of your firmware's pickiness. In any event, trying (yet) another tool may work.\nAs I said, Secure Boot is one possible complication. Ubuntu is theoretically compatible with Secure Boot, and in practice it usually is. Some EFIs, though, are picky or buggy. I know of two specific problems that can occur, and which have different solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buggy firmware -- One computer I own (an Intel NUC DC5427HYE) came with firmware that refused to recognize Ubuntu's Shim. (Shim being a program signed with a key that Microsoft uses for third-party boot loaders.) It should have accepted this key, but because of a bug in the firmware, it didn't. Updating the firmware to the latest version fixed this problem and enabled the system to boot. I've heard of similar problems with some other computers. Such problems are rare, but if you happen to be running into it, updating your firmware (what the manufacturer probably calls a \"BIOS\") may fix the problem.\n\n*Missing Secure Boot keys -- I've corresponded with one person who discovered that his computer had the public key tied to the one that Microsoft uses to sign its own boot loaders, but lacked the public key tied to the one used to sign third-party boot loaders (including Ubuntu's Shim). Thus, this computer booted Windows just fine, but wouldn't boot any third-party tool. The easiest solution in such cases is to disable Secure Boot. If Secure Boot is a requirement, the only option is to take full control of the computer's Secure Boot keys, as described on this page of mine. Taking this sort of control is beyond most peoples' comfort zones, but it is possible.\n\n\nBoth of these problems present very similar symptoms. The easiest way to distinguish between them is to type efi-readvar (this command comes in the efitools package, which you may need to install). Look for the following line in the output:\nC=US, ST=Washington, L=Redmond, O=Microsoft Corporation, CN=Microsoft Corporation Third Party Marketplace Root\n\nThis line is part of the identification of the public key required to run Ubuntu's Shim, so if it's not present, you're faced with the second problem I identified; but if it is present and an Ubuntu disk boots OK with Secure Boot disabled but not with it enabled, you're probably facing the first problem. Note that the key part of this line is near the end -- namely, CN=Microsoft Corporation Third Party Marketplace Root. The key Microsoft uses to sign its own boot loaders is similar, but reads CN=Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011. Ordinarily, both keys should be present (along with some others).\n", "Q: Disable Plank Mouse Hover Tooltips Is there any way to disable launcher mouse hover tooltips in Plank ?

I have noticed that there is a huge jump between the minimum screen brightness, where the backlight is completely off, to the next lowest. The second lowest seems to be much brighter than the lowest setting on Windows 10.\nI use this computer a lot at night, and it would be really nice to have a very dim setting where the backlight is still on. Is there a way to change the brightness steps?\n\nA: I used the top answer on this as basis for my own script for managing backlight brightness: Brightness Controls Not Working on a Dell Inspiron N4010 Laptop\nUnlike OP (\nuser152748 ) there and similarly to you, backlight controls were basically working, but i just wanted the ability to fine tune it. This method will not affect how your normal backlight brightness adjustment works.\nSo what you need to know is if /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness is the correct file for your system. \nYou could test it with sudo echo $VALUE | tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness where $VALUE is a number you want to try. Your permitted values are probably different from mine (0 to ~4000). In the case of my Dell laptop, it just doesnt work if i try an incorrect value.\nIf this method works for you, then you just have to make a script and assign hotkeys to it. My modified version of bcbc's script is this one (at the lower end adjusts by increments of 1; the higher the brightness level, the bigger the increment):\n#!/bin/bash\n# Dell N4010 brightness control workaround\n# Note: add the following to /etc/rc.local\n#       chmod 777 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n# The file .config/khotkeysrc should contain the hotkeys CTRL+SHIFT+F4/F5 to\n# adjust brightness down and up respectively.\n#\n# Usage:\n#    ./brightness.sh up   # bump up brightness\n#    ./brightness.sh down # bump down brightness\n#\ncurr=`cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness`\nbump=$(( $curr / 50 ))\nif [ \"$1\" == \"up\" ]; then\n  curr=`echo \"$curr + $bump + 1\" | bc`\nelse\n  curr=`echo \"$curr - $bump - 1\" | bc`\nfi\n# Set the brightness to the new level. 0 is the lower limit. Cant set it lower than that.\necho $curr | tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\necho $bump\n\nIf you're interested i can walk you through the code step by step. \nAs the comments in the code indicate, you need to edit the file /etc/rc.local (which is run at a certain point in the boot process) to include this line chmod 777 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness (changes permissions of this brightness file to allow anything to it by anyone) before this line: exit 0 (because in rc.local all code must be before exit 0).\nYou also need to set up your hotkeys which can be done via GUI (The link at the top has instructions how to do that in Ubuntu or you can search the web for \"how to set custom hotkeys ubuntu\"). You have to choose some key combination for it (i prefer something close to the original brightness adjustment keys). The second half of setting up custom hotkeys is telling it what to do when said keys are pressed. You want 2 hotkeys, one running $path_to_your_file/your_file.sh up and the other one $path_to_your_file/your_file.sh down.\nAlternatively you can manually edit the file where hotkeys are stored on Ubuntu and its derivatives: $home/.config/khotkeysrc\nIll be happy to elaborate anything unclear.\n", "Q: Headphones and internal speakers suddenly broken Ubuntu 14.04 I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 on a Sager laptop (or Clevo P750ZM).

I recently installed Ubuntu 15.04 on my white MacBook (circa 2007 or so) because I didn't have any use for it anymore.  I chose to wipe everything and install Ubuntu over everything.  I'm trying to install Kali Linux from a USB by booting up the computer and holding the \"option\" key once the white boot screen comes up.  All I get is a mouse cursor and no other boot options.  Also, all I get when I boot up is a white screen, then Ubuntu starts.  What am I doing wrong here? Or did I totally overwrite my boot?\n\nA: Sounds like your USB stick isn't been recognised. \nThe Mac will boot from USB sticks but they need the correct partition scheme (MSDOS in this case). It's possible either the boot flag isn't active or the partition isn't recognised (needs to be FAT32).\nThe white screen you get while waiting for Ubuntu to load is perfectly normal. It's because Apple has proprietary firmware in there to display the boot screen. So long as Ubuntu pops up eventually, you can be sure it's fine.\nI recommend writing an OpenELEC image to your USB device (it's small and boots rapidly into Kodi) to eliminate any other possible issues.\nOne you know that's working, you can safely put Kali on the stick and work from there.\nYou can download the 64-bit OpenELEC here: http://openelec.tv/get-openelec\n", "Q: ddclient with google domains dynamic DNS to ssh into my desktop So I want to be able to SSH into my home desktop.

For example you can use _ and also use pattern grouping so that you can use back-referencing in substitution:\nsed -r 's_(<property name=\"encryptData\">)false(</property>)_\\1true\\2_' /Users/User/Desktop/mirth.cfg\n\nAlso it is always a good idea to take a backup while using the -i option:\nsed -ri.bak 's_(<property name=\"encryptData\">)false(</property>)_\\1true\\2_' /Users/User/Desktop/mirth.cfg\n\nNow the original file will be kept as /Users/User/Desktop/mirth.cfg.bak and the modified file will be /Users/User/Desktop/mirth.cfg.\n", "Q: Fixing USB Drive & Installing Archbang I'd like to install Archbang on top of my Ubuntu installation.

Is it possible for Rhythmbox to fetch the cover art for a song that was downloaded from YouTube to show the cover art instead of the blank, white icon?\n\n\nA: Sort of is the strictest answer.\nIf you have a closer look at the screenshot, the song title, artist and album are a little messed up.\nYou need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Either right click the track in rhythmbox and change those values that you see to what they are seen within LastFM / MusicBrainz, Or\n\n*use an track editor such as Picard or EasyTag and actually change the ID3 tags (if an .mp3 track) for the song title, artist and album\n\n\nThe latter option is better since this actually changes the audio track itself.\nThe first option changes sometimes does not write the tags to the audio track - it writes it just to the internal database.  Writing to the audio track is only supported for some audio types - think from memory .ogg and .mp3.\nOnce corrected - make sure you have the coverart search plugin enabled and play the track.  You album art should be found ... again this is dependent that the album art is actually available on LastFm / MusicBrainz.\n\nIf the album art is not available then you can update the album art by dragging and dropping a suitable .png/.jpg file onto that white square.\nThus grab a screen-shot from the youtube video and save as a .png and drop the .png/.jpg onto that square.\nThese Q&A explains further:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change or delete the album cover image shown in rhythmbox?\n\n*How can I get Rhythmbox to display the correct album cover art?\n", "Q: Apache not showing PHP Pages correctly Initially the problem was PHP files on my server were displayed as plain text(the whole code was shown).

I'm running Ubuntu on a Dell Chromebook 11, which has two USB 3 ports, and an SD card reader. I was trying to establish whether the SD card reader would be capable of USB 3 speeds (and thus whether it's worth buying a 130MB/s SD card), but I can't tell whether it's physically connected to USB 3 internally.\nOne way I thought I might do this is to run lsusb after plugging in an SD card - however, if I plug in a USB2 device to one of the USB 3 ports, it comes up as being connected to the USB 2 hub anyway. If I put a USB 3 device into the very same port, it shows as a being connected to the USB 3 hub.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does lsusb show USB2 devices connected to a USB3 port as being attached to the USB 2 root?\n\n*Is there a way to get the physical rather than logical mapping of USB ports to hubs?\n\n*Coming back to my original reason for looking into this, is there a way to tell what speed the internal SD card reader is capable of before buying one?\n\n\nA: \nWhy does lsusb show USB2 devices connected to a USB3 port as being\n  attached to the USB 2 root?\n\nAnswer : \n\nIn USB 3.0, dual-bus architecture is used to allow both USB 2.0 (Full\n  Speed, Low Speed, or High Speed) and USB 3.0 (SuperSpeed) operations\n  to take place simultaneously, thus providing backward compatibility.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0\nFor instance, on a machine that contains two 2.0 USB ports and one USB  3.0 port, the output of the lsusb command shows:\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub \nBus 003 Device 002: ID 8087:8004 Intel Corp. \nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0008 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 058f:6386 Alcor Micro Corp.

As a result of this, when you connect USB2 devices into  USB3 port, they are shown connected to 2.0 root hub.\n\n\nIs there a way to get the physical rather than logical mapping of USB\n  ports to hubs?\n\nAnswer:\nUse lsusb -t \n-t     Tells lsusb to dump the physical USB device hierarchy as a tree.\n\nSource: lsusb man page \n\n\nComing back to my original reason for looking into this, is there a\n  way to tell what speed the internal SD card reader is capable of\n  before buying one?\n\nThis can be done by using the following steps.

The server is used only by me, both from within and outside my LAN.\nI think that I need to use tcpdump in a shell script to monitor the port or the IP and, if there is no incoming, it will react to it. \nI have an idea to do this, because I have looked around on the internet for 2 days, and tried a lot of things, but I can't succeed.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: I'm assuming that \"no incoming data\" means: tcpdump is not printing any line. Therefore we have to start a 30 minute timer and reset it whenever tcpdump prints a line.\nStarting it is fairly simple:\nsleep 30m && poweroff\n\nHow do we reset it? Simple: we kill sleep and restart it.\nHow do we detect new lines from tcpdump? A good old while read -r loop.\nPutting everything together:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nshutdown-timer() {\n    # Waits 30 minutes and shuts down the computer.\n    sleep 30m && poweroff\n}\n\nreset-timer() {\n    # Kills 'shutdown-timer' (if it's running) and\n    # restarts it, saving its PID in 'timerpid'.\n    if [[ -n \"$timerpid\" ]]\n    then\n        kill \"$timerpid\" || true\n    fi\n    shutdown-timer &\n    timerpid=\"$!\"\n}\n\n# Start the timer for the first time.\nreset-timer\n\ntcpdump | while read -r line\ndo\n    # A new packet was sent or received.\n    reset-timer\ndone\n\nNote that there might be disturbing packets every now and then. For example you might have configured APT to check for updates every 5 minutes. This will prevent the computer from shutting down, because the timer would be reset every 5 minutes.\nIf you need, you can filter the output of tcpdump using grep or whatever tool, like this:\ntcpdump | grep -v archive.ubuntu.com | while read -r line\n\n", "Q: Latest Stable Kernel 4.4: VirtualBox 5 kernel modules ...FAILED!

I want to change some power management options from the terminal (I don't have GNOME or a GUI installed, and I don't want to either). The current behavior is:\n\n\n*\n\n*The laptop goes to sleep/hibernate, causing the server to stop working, when I close the lid. Ideally, I'd be able to close the lid, have the screen turn off, but still have the server working.\n\n*The laptop turns off the screen after some short time of inactivity (which is fine, I just list this to be complete). After some hours of inactivity, the laptop shuts down completely by itself, even when plugged in.\n\n*A brief press of the power button shuts down the system. I want to avoid this, as it is quite easy to press the power button: I'd rather have to shut it down explicitly via the terminal.\n\n\nI have tried some solutions found on askubuntu, but none of them works. Specifically, I have removed acpid from the system. Weirdly enough, this didn't change anything. After that, I commented out the relevant lines in /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn. Again, this didn't change anything: the system still shuts down after a brief touch of the power button. Acpid no longer runs, but it still seems like /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh is executed (which was the action for powerbtn). I have looked at the ubuntu manpage entry for acpi to try to figure out if it was still running somehow, but I'm not experienced enough to understand it completely.\nAny help would be welcome.\n\nA: I found my solution in this answer here. In /etc/systemd/logind.conf, I edited the lines\n#HandlePowerKey=poweroff\n...\n#HandleLidSwitch=hibernate\n\nto\nHandlePowerKey=ignore\n...\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\n\nAnd then reboot the system.\nThe laptop shutting down overnight was actually something else. I used a power socket in a weird place for the server, to prevent the plug from being accidentally pulled. The socket turned out to be controlled by the same button that I use to switch the lights on and off. When I switched the lights off at night, I denied power to the server. In the morning, I would turn on the light, check the server, found out that it turned off again and boot it (without a problem because the power would work again after switching on the lights).\n\nA: I solved this issue on my \"laptop server\". In addition to the steps described in this answer, I had to complete some additional steps:\nBe sure to un-comment the settings by removing the leading # !\nThere are a number of related settings, including importantly, HandleLidSwitchExternalPower, which if you have your laptop plugged in, must also be set.\n# Additional power options I have not yet tested:\n#HandlePowerKey=ignore\n#HandleSuspendKey=ignore\n#HandleHibernateKey=ignore\n\n# Main items I set to ignore for lid:\nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\nHandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore\nHandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore\n\n# More Additional items I have not yet tested:\n#PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=yes\n#SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=yes\n#HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=yes\n#LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=yes\n\n", "Q: Winecfg doesn't run anymore on ubuntu 14.04 Winecfg doesn't launch anymore so my games either.

What I mean by partial is that the sound quality becomes somewhat usable but there are still glitches in the audio as some users also pointed out in the bug reports above.\nI have also tried using VNC instead of Spice but the client does not come with sound support. Following this bug report I understood that audio can be sent through the regular backends if the VNC client does not support it by changing the user and group the VM runs under to my current user and adding a VNC setting in the /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf like so:\nvnc_allow_host_audio = 1\nuser = \"yourusernamehere\"\ngroup = \"yourusernamehere\"\n\nbut also making my user part of the kvm & libvirtd groups and furthermore adding this line in /etc/default/libvirt-bin:\nexport QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=pa\n\nDoing this gave me the desired effect and the guest audio would run smoothly but the host audio would not work until I would have closed the guest. Looking at the host processes I noticed that libvirt spawned another Pulseaudio instance under my current user (effectively having 2 Pulseaudio instances) instead of using the instance that was already available.\nAfter a bit more Googling I found that pulseaudio can share it's audio with other users if the module-native-protocol-tcp was enabled. Unfortunately this is where I stopped finding useful information. Every article I found explaining how to enable this suggests running Pulseaudio in system mode which, obviously, is a security issue, but would also make my pulse audio widgets in Plasma5 not work as expected. I have managed to track down this article for Fedora 12\nexplaining that it is possible to run Pulseaudio as an unprivileged user (aka. my current user) but I don't understand how I can share audio with myself.\nDoes someone know how I can use Pulse so I can share audio with my VM or provide another solution for mixing sound from the guest and host without glitchy audio?\n\nA: Okay, after a lot of trial and error I finally managed to get it working as it should, without any hiccups.\nSome of the following steps might not be required in order to make it work, but it did work for me after making them. If someone wants to modify the answer and get rid of the unnecessary steps then  please do it. \nBesides what I said above when using VNC (changing the settings in qemu.conf & libvirt-bin and making sure my user was part of the required groups) I also made sure my user was part of the pulse & pulse-access groups.\nI copied everything from /etc/pulse in .pulse my home directory:\ncd ~\nmkdir .pulse\ncp /etc/pulse/* .pulse/\n\nIn ~/.pulse/client.conf I commented/modified the following lines:\nenable-shm = yes\nauto-connect-localhost = yes\nauto-connect-display = yes\n\nIn ~/.pulse/daemon.conf \ndaemonize = yes\nallow-module-loading = yes\nuse-pid-file = yes\nenable-shm = yes\n\nAlso I installed paprefs (apt-get install paprefs) and checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make discoverable PulseAudio network sound devices available locally\n\n*Enable network access to local sound devices\n\n*Don't require authnetication\n\n*Enable Multicast/RTP reciever\n\n*Add virtual output device for simultaneous output on all local sound cards\n\n\nAfter you made all the changes you can reboot you computer or just logout/login and restart libvirt-bin and everything should work perfectly when you start a VM.\nPS: If the audio from the VM is crackling then make sure the VM has the same sample rate and bit depth as the host and it should work.\nUpdate: It became apparent to me that the audio can still have issues in the guest (carckling sound) because libvirt may not be able to load the pulse config, from what i saw in the domain logfile(/var/log/libvirt/qemu/yourdomain.log). You can disable the profile temporarily or just add:\n@{HOME}/.pulse/** rw,\n\nin /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/libvirt-qemu and reload the apparmor profiles with: \nsudo invoke-rc.d apparmor reload\n\nNote: I configured libvirt to run as my current user in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf for security reasons.\n\nA: This is a bit old, but maybe will save time for somebody walking around this. What worked for me was to configure unix socket and use global pulseaudio config instead of TCP connection module-native-protocol-tcp specified for user as most of the online guides suggest.\nI think the pulseaudio was not picking up the individual user, for whatever reason.\nSo I ended up editing pulseaudio config in /etc.\nI edited /etc/pulse/default.pa with line:\nload-module module-native-protocol-unix auth-anonymous=1 socket=/tmp/system-pulseaudio.socket\n\nIn /etc/pulse/client.conf I added line:\ndefault-server = unix:/tmp/system-pulseaudio.socket\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu weird terminal mode When using the terminal, instead of typing \"exit\", I accidentally typed \"`xit\" instead.\nThen the terminal entered a weird mode like this, and would't respond to anything I type:\n\n\nA: Short solution: \nYour terminal is waiting for input. You can interrupt it with CTRL+C.\n\nExplanation:\nYou typed `xit. Backticks (`) are used in bash for command substitutions (like $()). Because of the leading `, bash now expects a closing `, which is not found. This is actually a helpful feature, if you want  to distribute commands over several lines, like \ncat `find -name \"foo*\" |\n> grep .txt` \n#will output the content of foo.txt\n\nIf you now type the missing `, your bash will execute your command (and probably crash, because of unknown commands). Therefore you should cancel your started command with CTRL+C and type exit again.\n\nA: You can stop every process which is running in the foreground with ctrl+c which sends a kill (I think). \nThe > is a prompt like your $ when you start a new terminal (shell), or if you type python there is a >>> prompt. This one you can exit, by typing exit or pressing ctrl+d, which sends a logout.\nThe prompt means you started a program which has its own prompt, instead of the shell one. I don't know what exactly the ` (backtick) starts, maybe someone can give the answer.\nThere are tons of those useful shortcuts.\nsummary:\nctrl+c = kill a process\nctrl+d = logout\n\nA: In Bash the backtick character (\"`\") is interpreted as the start of a command substitution.\n\nCommand substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed as follows: $(command) or `command`\nBash performs the expansion by executing command and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.\n\nSo whatever you type in afterwards is interpreted as part of the command substitution until another backtick is entered.\n", "Q: How can I import all my Windows files into Ubuntu? My Windows 10 has crashed, and now I would like to go with Ubuntu 14.04. I have my working files in other drives. How can I import  my files from Windows to Ubuntu without loosing them?\n\nA: What I normally do, is inserting a live-medium, DVD or USB-Drive with Ubuntu. Then I attach my external drive to the computer and open a file-browser. After a click on the HDD with Windows you can just copy every file to that external medium.\nAfter the installation is completed you can recopy the files to your internal HDD.\nBe aware to copy all files you need, typically folder like musik, documents, own files, desktop,etc.\nLinux don't care if there is a working OS in that HDD. But if your HDD failed (Hardware-Defect) Ubuntu will not be able to mount it.

How can I solve this?\nP.s. No problem on Ubuntu 14.04.3. \n\nA: Ubuntu installation discs don't setup a Squashfs volume. What you are seeing is an error message caused while reading from the installation disc. This is unusual for virtual machines where you just mount the ISO. This may be an issue with handling the software correctly and may not be reproducible (if you found a way to reproduce it either VirtualBox or Ubuntu developers may be interested in a bug report), which is why it was gone on the next boot. Just check that the installation disc is not mounted to the virtual machine and it should boot as usual.\n", "Q: How can I install google-chrome-stable on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS?

They did not go to my Trash, but are no longer in the home folder. I still have the same amount of disk space remaining as I did before I tried to delete them. I do not have a Lost+Found directory, either.\nI tried running btrfs balance start '/' but that didn't free up any space.\n\nA: Turns out the quasi-deleted files were moved to a root-only directory called .Trash-0\nIn order to remove them, I opened that directory as root, as well as another (in my case Documents), and had to cut and paste the files from .Trash-0 to Documents in order to properly delete them.\n\nA: Despite being not really clear your post I am assuming you are looking about how to find out what data is filling up your disk space.\nTo find out, first of all you will need to check your file system capacity:\ndf -ah\n\nThe above command will show you the FS capacity.\nI don't know if you have set up separate partition or all in one partition in your system. I am going with the assumption that you have all in one partition which /.\nTo check where is the offending data which is filling the system you can use du command as follow (use sudo if you are not root):\ndu -sh /*\n\nThis will show you all subdirectories of / filesystem with the data size.\nLet's say you found out that your /home is the biggest size, so you can proceed further, again using du:\ndu -sh /home/*\n\nAnd you will see which is the biggest data in your home directory and so on.\nIf you want to remove the data, you can do it either using GUI based file explorer (i.e. thunar, nautilus, etc.) or in command line as follow:\nrm -rf /home/foo\n\nIn the above command you are removing whatever foo is, can be either file or directory (mind -r option, removes recursively).\nPls be aware that removing files with -rf option are not sending your data in your trash but they will be erased permanently. So keep in mind and think twice before removing anything, especially in the system side (out of your home dir).\n", "Q: How to connect WiFi from CLI? On Raspberry Pi (2 B) I have ubuntu.

Run, in a terminal:\nwine uninstaller\nFind Photoshop and remove it.\nAfter doing what CiberSheep said, run sudo apt-get autoremove to remove dependencies.\n\nA: You can type this in the terminal.\nsudo apt-get purge wine\n\nThat would be enough to uninstall and purge it.

Let's say that in my folder ~/list I have a large amount of folders each with their own sub-folders and sub-sub-folders etc, and there are lots of files almost on each level. However some of these files and folders are empty, so how can I recursively search through them all to find the empty files and folders? And then have them displayed in a list of file locations so that I know where each one is (it should also be clear which is a file and which is a folder because not all files have file extensions). I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\nPlease note that it would also be very useful if it would also tell me if a file looked empty but wasn't (for instance if it had spaces or linebreaks in it or something). And would differentiate between a real empty file and one that just looks empty in the output.\n\nA: From man find\n    -empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.\n\nSo to find both empty files and directories it is sufficient to do\nfind ~/lists -empty\n\nTo indicate the type, you could use the %y output format specifier\n          %y     File's type (like in ls -l), U=unknown type (shouldn't happen)\n\ne.g.\nfind ~/lists -empty -printf '%y %p\\n'\n\nor make use of an external program like ls, which includes a --classify option\n    -F, --classify\n          append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries\n\ni.e.\nfind ~/lists -empty -exec ls -Fd {} \\;\n\n\nIf your definition of 'empty' is expanded to include files containing only whitespace characters, then it becomes more complicated - and more computationally intensive, since now you need to actually open at least any non-empty files and examine their contents. The most efficient way I can think of off the top of my head would be something like\nfind ~/list \\( -empty -o \\( -type f -a ! -exec grep -qm1 '[^[:blank:]]' {} \\; \\) \\) -exec ls -Fd {} \\;\n\n(either empty, OR a file AND grep does not detect at least one non-blank character). Likely there is a better way though.\n\nA: From ~/list folder:\nfind . -empty -type d\n\nfor listing empty directories and\nfind . -empty -type f\n\nfor listing empty files.    \nfind . -type f -exec bash -c 'if [ `cat \"{}\" |wc -w` -eq 0 ]; then echo \"file - {}\";fi' \\; -or -empty -exec bash -c \"echo dir - {}\" \\; \n\nfor listing empty folders and files including whitespaces and empty lines\n", "Q: How to install downloaded scanner driver When I try to use my Epson 1630 scanner in Ubuntu 15.10, with either Scanlite or Easy Scan software, I get a message saying I need to download the driver from the Epson web site first. \nThe Epson web site has both tar.gz and rpm versions of the driver. \nWhich one should I use and how do I install it?\n\nA: *\n\n*First download drivers from http://support.epson.net/linux/en/iscan_c.html\n\n*Extract the .tar file with - tar -zxf iscan-bundle-1.0.0.x64.deb.tar.gz\n\n*move into directory with - cd iscan-bundle-1.0.0.x64.deb/\n\n\n*run sudo bash install.sh\n`Hope This works !  \n\nA: In addition to installing iscan-bundle-1.0.0.x64.deb.tar.gz you have to modify two files:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/sane.d/epson2.conf\n\n*/etc/sane.d/epkowa.conf\n...to modify the following line in both:\nnet 192.168.1.xxx ### put local printer/scanner\n\nWith this I solved the problem of not detecting the scanner.\n", "Q: How to have a forward slash in a file name? I understand that this will likely break and confuse the hell out of my system, but is it possible to name or rename a file so that it has /s in its name (this is needed for a file which needs to go to an equally crazy server - well, sort of, it's more of a crazy workaround)? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, and I have tried to do this with most programs, and they either make a folder with the file because they treat what is before the / as the folder and what is after it as the file name, or just give me an error.\nReason:\nThe specific reason why I need it is because I set up a server which is stubborn and now won't change it's mind about where its config file is. However I accidentally put a / in the name of the file so it believes that the config file rather being in ~/configuration/files/config1.conf is in ~/configuration/files/con/fig1.conf... So you might say that I should just create a folder in files and call it con and then have the config file called fig1.conf, however the server doesn't even currently allow the creation of new directories or anything really... So I think that my only hope is going to be to put the forward slash in the file name for now until it goes out of its lock down mode.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to name or rename a file so that it has /s in its name [...]?\n\nNo, it's not, for obvious reasons.\nE.g. consider you have a directory containing:\n\n\n*\n\n*a directory named \"foo\" containing a file named \"bar\"\n\n*a file named \"foo/bar\"\n\n\n/path/to/foo/bar # file named \"bar\" in the directory named \"foo\"\n/path/to/foo/bar # file named \"foo/bar\"\n\nReferencing either of the two would be ambiguous.\nIf you're curious as to where the limitation is imposed, that's at the kernel level, in order to comply with the filesystem's specifications.\nIn general, any character can be used in a filename aside from / (unicode 002f) and \\0 (unicode 0000), and filenames such as . and .. are disallowed as well.\n\nA: In the Mac OS terminal, you can replace the slash with a colon (:) when you're renaming, and when you view the file in Finder (graphic file manager) the file name should have the slash at the place you typed a colon. This probably also works in Linux.\n\nA: It CAN be done,  not easily,  not well,  and not recommended (it creates problems when trying to remove the file. \nSimply use a unicode substitute. It's better explained at linuxanswers.com.\nbash shell example using the unicode \"fractional slash\" U+2044\nbash# >test$'\\xe2\\x88\\x95'file\nbash# ls --show-control-chars\ntest∕file\nbash# ls\ntest???file\n\nI don't know if however the server can then access the file,  but Ubuntu can.  You may have to alias it at the server end,  if possible.

One of the most recent community releases (Tahrpup) uses the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS packages.  \n\nA: Answering the question\nSince you ask on AskUbuntu, here's an answer to what you're asking for.\n\"boot without changing anything on the HD\"\nThe regular (not the alternate or server) ISOs of major flavors of Ubuntu, whether 32-bit or 64-bit, can all boot live on a machine to test drive without installing.\nI personally booted Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu from live USB (and in older years, CD) to get a graphical desktop and run some tools, even sometimes on machine without storage.\n\"fit a 700MB CD\"\nMost of these ISO are bigger that 700MB.  But some Lubuntu ISO are smaller\nThis link: Lubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (Trusty Tahr) shows the current Lubuntu ISO sorted by size.\nYou can see that nearly all desktop ISOs of the first release (i386, amd64+mac, amd64) are smaller than 700MB (683MB to 694MB). Only the powerpc variant is over 700MB.\nUpdated  tend to be bigger.  So, if 700MB is a hard limit for you, use an ISO of the first release.\nOther solutions considering your need: \"old server that crashed\"\nThat said, since you mention rescuing an old server:\n\n\n*\n\n*If for your rescue task you can figure out the tools you need, find them use them on your own, then a live Ubuntu (or derivative system) is handy (or any environment you're already familiar with for that matter).  This has the benefit that once booted on the machine, even if a needed tool is not on the ISO, one can use apt-get or aptitude to get tools from the Internet... assuming the machine can access the Internet.  I actually happen to often keep in my work bag some USB sticks with Xubuntu and they saved the day sometimes.\n\n*In other cases, e.g. not savvy enough, not sure about the work to be done, cannot access the Internet), it might make sense to use a dedicated rescue live distribution.  Being dedicated to a smaller subset of tasks, they can (1) often guide the user, e.g. with a menu (console-based or graphical) to a list of (2) highly relevant tools that wouldn't be included in a generic live system, or (3) tools to fix problems on other widespread operating systems.  Also, (4) not running a full desktop may make sense the old target machine doesn't have much RAM (more RAM will be available as e.g. disk cache to boost performance instead of being dedicated to eye candy).\nDistrowatch offers a filtering interface that may help find what is best for you.  Here's an example: Linux + Data Rescue + Under 700MB distributions according to Distrowatch offers 6 options, including the well-known SystemRescueCD\n\nA: You can alternatively use a convenient tool called Plop Boot Manager. It’s a small bootloader that provides a menu to select the device you want to boot from. If your BIOS doesn’t support booting from USB devices but still detects the devices at boot, this should be all you need.\n\n(Taken from the screenshots page)\nThis is Plop’s interface – you just hit the down key to highlight USB and press enter. On some computers I’ve noticed USB devices are displayed as hard drives, so if that doesn’t work be sure to try drives other than the boot drive (typically the first one).\nThe download contains an ISO image that any CD burning tool will accept. It's only a few megabytes in size.\n\nA: You might check with OSDisc.com. I don't know how many MB their live/install cd's have, but you could email them and ask. They usually run $5.95 to $19.95 and will refund your money.  I'm using a live/install Ubuntu on an old Dell Inspiron laptop to get familiar with the os and it works fine, but it was not purchased from OSDisc.com. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Question regarding video card support / monitor resolution I have set up a dual boot system with Windows 7 and Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 using  a bootable USB for the install process and while in the 'try ubuntu' enviroment there were no problems at all. \nAfter installing Ubuntu, my PC booted and started GRUB but ended up with a a black screen issue, which I resolved by entering radeon.modeset=0. I know that this means that there is some sort of incompatibility with the video card Radeon HD 6620. \nI tried to address this issue before by going into the Additional drivers window and clicked the option to install the proprietary driver but I don't believe I did it correctly, because after that, the GRUB screen was black again. \nI notices that every time I boot into Ubuntu I have to enter (radeon.modeset=0), to get output to the monitor. This however is no where near to the resolution that I was getting from the bootable USB 'Try Ubuntu'. \nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: Run the following in a terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\nFind the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line anc change it so it looks like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.modeset=0\"\nHit Ctrl+O then Enter to save and Ctrl+X to exit. Now run in the terminal:\nsudo update-grub\nThe radeon.modeset=0 paremeter will be now automatically appended to the kernel during boot time. Reboot and see.\n", "Q: List of safe to remove applications I would like to ask if there is any list of pre-installed applications in Ubuntu which are safe to remove.\nOnce, I tried to uninstall unnecessary applications from Software center, but it created some bugs. For example, I lost some icons from System settings, and then I had to do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop to recover lost data.\nI would like to remove unnecessary applications, but I don't want to break my system.\n\nA: You first need to define what considers \"break my system\". A system without a desktop is not broken as is.\nBesides that: the safest way is what you did and to take a look at this by \"category\" from Ubuntu Software Center and the \"installed\" group.\nAccessories\nBooks & Magazines\nDeveloper Tools\nEducation\nFonts\nGames\nGraphics\nInternet\nMedicine\nOffice\nScience & Engineering\nSound & Video\nThemes & Tweaks\nUniversal Access\n\nBesides \"accessories\" any of these should be safe to remove and will not remove anything important since they all point to applications. Remove them 1 by 1 and do pay attention to the list of packages it is offering to delete just in case. \nAnd when in doubt check the packages online for what is depending.\n1 more comment: what you did was probably overkill; to get those icons back in system settings all you had to do is re-install that specific packages. This should have been enough to fix it: \nsudo apt-get remove unity-control-center\nsudo apt-get install unity-control-center\n\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with a lot of GNOME applications pre-installed for giving the users an overall good desktop experience. Many of them have a deep system integration ... so it's not recommended to remove them - a good example is nautilus. But there are features that are quite safe to remove ... such as the controversially discussed online search integration that Canonical provides in Ubuntu.\nAs this is an aspect being more opinion based ... I give you a list of packages that I have removed :  \naccount-plugin-aim  \naccount-plugin-facebook  \naccount-plugin-flickr  \naccount-plugin-jabber  \naccount-plugin-salut  \naccount-plugin-yahoo  \naisleriot  \ngnome-mahjongg  \ngnome-mines  \ngnome-sudoku  \nlandscape-client-ui-install  \nunity-lens-music  \nunity-lens-photos  \nunity-lens-video  \nunity-scope-audacious  \nunity-scope-chromiumbookmarks  \nunity-scope-clementine  \nunity-scope-colourlovers  \nunity-scope-devhelp  \nunity-scope-firefoxbookmarks  \nunity-scope-gmusicbrowser  \nunity-scope-gourmet  \nunity-scope-guayadeque  \nunity-scope-musicstores  \nunity-scope-musique  \nunity-scope-openclipart  \nunity-scope-texdoc  \nunity-scope-tomboy  \nunity-scope-video-remote  \nunity-scope-virtualbox  \nunity-scope-zotero  \nunity-webapps-common\n\nNote :  \nUninstalling unity-webapps-common removes the Amazon Search feature from the Unity desktop environment. In Ubuntu 15.10 I had to reinstall unity-webapps-service afterwards.\nThe reinstallation of the package unity-webapps-service wasn't necessary in Ubuntu 14.04.\n", "Q: How to get an alert when my input volume is turned on and turn it off if I so desire? As you can tell by the name, I am an extra paranoid Panda and in order to keep my bamboo safe I don't want my input volume to be on just in case if I get some spyware which listens to my sound input. Basically I just want to be as safe as possible so that no other Panda listens in on my Panda bamboo secrets (where I put it all).\nSo basically this is what I want, a script which:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checks whether or not the input volume for my microphone (or any sound input devices) is on 0% at regular intervals\n\n*Alerts me via notify-send every 5 minutes if it is on\n\n*An option within the script (like a boolean or something) which is not on by default, but if it is turned on will make it so that when the input volume is on I will be alerted that it was on and has been turned off, and for the script obviously also (probably before alerting me) to turn the input volume off\n\n*Is able to scan multiple input sources so that for instance if I have 2 microphones, 1 is muted, but the other not, it does not just assume that all is well\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18. How can this be done? I don't expect there to be one (that's why I'm asking for a script), but if there is an application which can do this, then please recommend it.\n\nA: Here is a simple script that scans a given pulseaudio input source for being muted*.\nThe source can be given as pulseaudio source index number as can be listed with:\npactl list sources\n\nIf the source was not muted a warning message will be displayed in a desktop notification.\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# Forces a pulseaudio source to be muted\n#\n# Usage:\n# micmute <source> <wait> <--force>\n# <source>: pulseaudio source index number\n# <wait>: seconds to wait for checking\n# <--force>: force muting microphone and notify\nsource=\"$1\"\nwait=\"$2\"\nforce=\"$3\"\n\necho \"Scanning input #$source every $wait seconds.\"\n\nwhile true; do\n    if ! (pactl list sources | sed -n '/^Source #'\"$source\"'/,/^$/p' | grep \"Mute: yes\"); then\n        if [[ $force == \"--force\" ]]; then\n            pactl set-source-mute $source 1\n            notify-send \"Muting input $source\"\n        else\n            notify-send \"WARNING - input $source is not muted\"\n        fi\n    fi\n    sleep $wait  ## CLI option seconds to wait\ndone\n\nSave that script with any name (e.g. micmute) and give it executable permission. The script then may be called with\n./micmute <source> <wait> [--force]\n\n<source> is the index number of the microphone source to be scanned.\n<wait> will define the time in seconds after which we repeat our query for a muted source device.\n--force is an optional flag to force muting of our source.\n\nFor me the following example line will query the mute state of my microphone (index 2) every 5 minutes, and it will forcedly mute it if it was unmuted.\n./micmute 2 300 --force\n\n\n* I preferred muting over setting the volume to 0 because of the advantage to restore the previous volume settings on unmuting.\n", "Q: Can I install new version of python on ubuntu 14.04? Considering that the current version on my 14.04 LTS Ubuntu of python is 2.7.6, I need a more recent version for dealing with specific libraries (that need >2.7.7)...\nI don't really understand.

Just as a sanity check, I then tried setting all these things to ru_RU or ru_RU.UTF-8 since these would have a more obvious effect, but still no change.\nI found that there's a package called language-pack-ru and installed that, and also ran sudo update-locale and sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales, but still no change.

I want to keep both backups on the same external drive, but am not sure if this will work, considering there are boot partitions and swap partitions included in the clones. \nCan this be done?\n\nA: Yes.  Quite seamless.\nWhen you create a clone backup, the backup will store in a directory by a unique name.  The system will prompt you with the name to save it to of which you can modify the name.\nThe default name will have the date and time as part of the name.  You can append or prefix that default date and time name with specifics like full-backup-of-kids-computer.  For instance:\nkids-computer-20160111\n\nThe name you specify will be a directory where the actual backup would be stored.\nIf you decide to do another backup of the same computer you can specify something unique such as:\nkids-computer-20160111-B\n\nThe basic cloning options\nWith Clonezilla you will have two cloning options.  You can either clone device to image or device to device.  If you clone device to device (which is drive to drive) the target drive will become a clone of the source drive.\nIf you clone device to image you would have the options described above.  The source drive would be save to a folder on the destination drive.\n", "Q: Same commands execute when restart terminal So, some time ago, I copied csv data from a webpage into terminal to save it to a csv file, like echo \"field1,field2,field3,...,fieldn, with about 20 lines of text. I did this because I couldn't figure out how to save the csv from the webpage, as the \"csv\" was just in plain text on the page in comma-separated format. I was able to create a functional cvs file, but it seems each 'row' of the file somehow is stored as a command to run each time I open terminal. There is an ID for each row, so I will see twenty different commands in my history dated to when I opened terminal like so: 1,field2,field3,...,fieldn. \nI look thru my history often so this is quite annoying and I want to get rid of these seemingly latent, recurring commands. What causes this and how do I fix it?\n\nA: You can either remove the culprit lines from .bash_history, or just rename or delete .bash_history.\n", "Q: On selling something with Ubuntu on it I'm planning on making a thing that will be based off of Ubuntu as an OS.

Do I need to unlock the rest themes or am I mistaken somewhere? \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: A solution found in this thread. For those who're facing the same issue, you can install Unity Tweak Tool from Ubuntu Software Center.

I am about to buy a 4K laptop and I would like to run Ubuntu 15.10 on it. I believe that shouldn't be a big problem. I'm sure I can adjust the text and the Unity UI just right.\nThe thing is that I use VirtualBox quite often for running Ubuntu Server on it. I believe to run into problems here. When not yet set, the text within the guest operating system should be small and barely readable, right? Is there any way to do some scaling of the guest os view? Like for instance scale it by the factor of times 2? Is it possible to run applications that do not adapt to 4k with a kind of magnifying lens? Like for instance running VirtualBox with some double-size zoom?\n\nA: I have not tried this, but I just talked to a guy at System76 about why the Oryx Pro (which is a rebranded Clevo 650RE) doesn't have the 4k screen option that's offered on that frame.  He said that while Ubuntu 'works' it was not a 'nice out-of-box experience', so I'm guessing it doesn't look great.\n", "Q: Best architecture for me I've been using Linux for a couple of years now. My first Linux OS was Ubuntu, and since then I used Lubuntu, Xubuntu, Arch Linux, openSUSE and Debian. My computer specs are the following (really bad PC, by the way):\nIntel Celeron CPU @ 2.8 GHz (32- and 64-bit capable), 1512 MB (1.5 GB) of RAM memory and an NVidia GeForce 6200 GPU\nUbuntu and openSUSE were usable, but pretty sluggish. Debian, Lubuntu, Xubuntu and Arch were always pretty fast and smooth (at least to a 9 year old computer). All of them were always 32-bit (i386).\nMy question, is there any advantage for me to use a 64-bit version of, say, Lubuntu? What are the pros of a 64-bit system besides being able to access more than 2/3 GB of RAM? Will it improve my performance? I don't care having a bit less free RAM memory, since Lubuntu/Xubuntu always stay around 150~250 MB.\n\nA: If anything, I'd say 64-bit will be slower, since it uses more RAM in general. Unless you need some program that only runs on 64-bit systems, stay with 32-bit. If you had closer to 4GB RAM, I'd recommend 64-bit, but the combination of the slow processor and low RAM, it might not work out well.\nOf course, since Ubuntu is easy to install, you could try a 64-bit version out and see what happens. Who knows? Maybe it'll end up being faster. In general, though, unless you have 4GB+ RAM, stay on 32-bit.\n\nA: If your CPU is capable of 64-bit use it – it will split the tasks amongst/within the CPU-cores. Mainly to be recognized when U do e.g. Video-encoding - or when U get a new Linux-Kernel. Measure the time consumed to create the initramfs. Compare it. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#32-bit_vs_64-bit (see \"Summary\")\nThis has nothing to do with RAM unless it exeeds 4GB - all 32bit-Ubuntu Kernels are PAE. Even though it's not visible from the naming. It threw a big wave on users wt Pentium-M processors a good while ago with 12.04. The question for more RAM usage is inunderstandable. Since when U run out of sufficient RAM the SWAP-Partition will be used - Then things slow down recognizable.   \n", "Q: How to resize the icons of the desktop? I'm using ubuntu 14.04 & I need to decrease all the icons size in one move, can I do it or I must resize each icon?\n\nA: Right-click on your desktop, click on Desktop Settings. There you should have 3 tabs: Background, Menus, and Icons. CLick on Icons and you should see Icon size. Adjust Icon size accordingly.\n\nA: The comment above gives the correct answer:     \nFrom this answer: askubuntu.com/questions/129820/…. -- Open file explorer --  Edit > Preferences > Icon View Defaults Set as you wish. – md_essam\n\nA: For the file manager in Ubuntu 16.04 you use scroll wheel and crtl in the file manager, only it does not get any smaller than 32 pt.\n", "Q: Wiley 15.10: Some windows are not visible Right after installing Wiley 15.10 from iso image, I discovered that some windows are not showing up:\n\n\n*\n\n*The terminal, when you press CTRL+ALT+T\n\n*The Chrome Browser which has been the 1st I've installed right after\n\n\nBoth are open, but not showing up.

If you really want to hide it, run, in a terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\nPut a # in front of every line that begins with GRUB_HIDDEN (there should be two of them) and do the same with GRUB_DEFAULT.

How do I go back to my previous GRUB configuration? I have Lubuntu and Xubuntu installed on my hard drive (in different partitions). After installing Linux Mint (on a 3rd partition), I discovered that it installed a new GRUB bootloader which I don't like and would like to either edit or, preferably, abort altogether (and go back to my previous version).\nMy original menu.lst was on my (Lubuntu) sda1 partition, which was marked as 'boot'. I expected to go to gparted and see that the Mint installation had marked its own partition as boot (and so I expected I simply had to re-label sda1 as 'boot'. Alas, nothing of the sort showed up there. sda1 is still 'boot', the Mint partition is not, and I see my original menu.lst file on sda1.\n1) Why is this original menu.lst not selected/run during boot?\n2) How can I undo what Mint did (i.e. where is the new GRUB stored and how can I change it)?\n\nA: I'm answering my own question if anyone else needs some help with a similar issue.\n1) I booted into Puppy Linux using a liveCD - my favorite 'rescue' distro, probably.\n2) I copied the menu.lst file from the root of sda1 to another folder.\n3) I ran the GRUB installer again.\n4) I deleted the newly created menu.lst and copied back my previous version - adding the entry for Linux Mint manually\n5) Rebooted, and I had my old GRUB back\n", "Q: Redirect from https domain to another https domain How can i redirect apache from one \"https://domain1.com\" to \"https://www.domain2.com\"\nI tried it as following:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n        ServerName domain1.com\n        ServerAlias www.domain1.com\n\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/domain1\n\n        Redirect permanent /  https://www.domain2.com\n......\n</VirtualHost>\n<VirtualHost 2.2.2.2:443>\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n        ServerName domain1.com\n        ServerAlias www.domain1.com\n\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/domain1\n\n        Redirect permanent /  https://www.domain2.com\n.....\n</VirtualHost>\n\nBut it only redirects in \"http\" case like \"http://domain1.com\" goes to \"https://www.domain2.com\", doesn't work in case \"https://domain1.com\"?!\n\nA: You should add : Listen *:443 in your /etc/apache2/ports.conf and then restart apache.

Because i found Minimal CD, but it supports only command line installation and text-based. I am looking for native GUI Ubuntu Desktop installation, but without pre installed apps.\n\nA: It is not possible to do this from a graphical user interface, you have to do it from command line.\nYou can install the Ubuntu server edition and install a desktop environment on that afterwards.\nBut this is not recommended for users without some more advanced knowledge how to do it ...\nIt is much easier to install the Ubuntu desktop edition and remove the unwanted applications.\n", "Q: Driver for toshiba laptop Toshiba satellite c640-x4014.Is ubuntu compatible with my laptop?\nso please help me with this,or any other Linux OS available for the system\n\nA: As far as I know, Ubuntu is compatible with most computers, even old ones. According to this website the specs are good, apart from the RAM, only 2GB. Not sure if so little RAM will be an issue, just install Ubuntu on it, and see how it performs.

I accidentally erased ubuntu from BIOS boot menu TL;DR at the end if you don't want to read up on how the problems occurred.\nSo, it all started when I tried to install windows 10.\nMy computer ran out of battery, I tried to wipe the HDD, win 8 gave me errors after uninstall, I couldnt fix the problems because the wipe erased boot repair things. I wiped everything on the HDD, and installed ubuntu. \nThis installed an \"ubuntu\" option under the boot priority order that would usually boot my ubuntu. \nNow, I needed windows for autodesk things, so I tried installing windows 7. My bios wouldnt boot from USB, so I changed some UEFI settings and I could boot. It gave me problems because Windows 7 couldnt install on GBR partitions, and while trying to convert my partition from GBR to MBR, I accidentally erased \"ubuntu\" from boot priority order, and now I cant boot ubuntu. I can however install another ubuntu from a ubuntu USB, but cant boot windows 7 usb now.\nI have some files in the ubuntu partition that I need. I tried \"try ubuntu on disk\" (LiveUSB) option and I obviously didnt have the permissions to remove my files. If I could remove my files and install ubuntu again i'd be fine, but I don't know how to do that either.\nSo, TL;DR:\n1.) How do I add \"ubuntu\" to my boot priority order? It wont boot without it.\n2.) How can i get permissions to remove my old files on my old ubuntu when i'm on a LiveUSB?\nThank you!\n\nA: Your approach is misguided. If you have to install and use Windows 7 on a Windows 10 machine in legacy boot, then do it and live with its limitations. One of them is that you can't add \"BIOS menu entries\" for individual operating systems, you only get this functionality with UEFI booting.\nReinstalling GRUB in MBR already has a perfectly answered question: How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\nConverting existing installations from UEFI to legacy or vice versa halfheartedly without even basic knowledge of your bootloader setup is one of the most stupid moves you can make. Be sure to install the right GRUB package for the mode you finally choose to boot in, names of two related packages are grub-efi-amd64 and grub-pc.\n\nA: I am assuming here that with GBR you actually meant GPT.\nDid you created a UEFI compatible Windows USB stick? Like using tools e.g. Rufus which gives an option to make UEFI with GPT partition compatible USB drive. My guess is you created a simple MBR bootable PD which then complained that it can't install windows on GPT partitions.\nBoth Windows and Ubuntu have reached a point where they quite maturely support both UEFI and GPT partitions. So your GPT to MBR conversion was not required. What is required is that you prepare your USB drive to be UEFI compatible i.e. it should have an 'efi' folder with 'efi' files.(you can use Rufus to create it for both windows and ubuntu).\nNow most probably your conversion has left you with a clean slate. That means if you do not have 2 HDDs then you have no data on your hard drive as its not possible to have half HDD as GPT while the other as MBR. Thats why Ubuntu is not in the boot priority list as there is no EFI file left for the motherboard to show you. Now there are two ways to go from here.\n\n\n*\n\n*Forget about all this UEFI and things and just install Windows and ubuntu again in legacy BIOS mode.\n\n*If you still have not copied much data then convert it back to GPT and then remember to boot with UEFI compatible USB drive.\n\n\nFor simplicity you can choose option 1, option 2 is good if you want the latest and greatest or by any chance you want to create more primary partitions which MBR will not allow.\n\nA: Boot your newly installed Ubuntu.\nRun GParted.\nWrite down on paper or into a text file, the numbers of the partitions Windows 7 and Ubuntu, respectively, are residing on.\nThe directery /etc/grub.d/ contains the script files for the boot process. You have to make new script files for the Windows 7 and the old Ubuntu, respectively.\nMake new script files in the directory, with names like 12_custom and 15_custom. You can also edit the file 40_custom. If you want the Windows 7 and the old Ubuntu to appear before the new Ubuntu, the files need to have numbers less than 10_Linux, like 07_custom or 09_custom.\nLet's say you want to make Windows 7 the second menu entry, you would put this code into 12_custom:\n#!/bin/sh -e\necho \"Adding Windows 7 to GRUB 2 menu\"\ncat << EOF\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\nset root=(hd0,1)\nchainloader (hd0,1)+1\n}\nEOF\n\nAssuming your Windows is on partition SDA1, which corresponds to (hd0,1) that is, the first hard disk - number 0 is the first disk - and 1 corresponds to partition one, or SDA1.\nThe script file 15_custom, the next menu entry in the boot order list, should look like this:\n#!/bin/sh -e\necho \"Adding my custom Linux to GRUB 2\"\ncat << EOF\nmenuentry \"Ubuntu 15.10\" {\nset root=(hd0,4)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img\n}\nEOF\n\nIn your case, the Ubuntu may reside on another partition, then change (hd0,4) to reflect the right partition number. In the example above the Ubuntu is on partition SDA4.\nSave the two files into /etc/grub.d/ directory, as stated earlier, then make them executable:\nchmod +x 12_custom\nchmod +x 15_custom\n\nThen run\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter doing this, the three operating systems should appear, as boot choices, in the next boot up.\nI recently installed Kubuntu 15.10, on a computer with Windows 10 and Ubuntu Studio 15.10. After I could only boot to Kubuntu, the steps above worked for me, to get all the three systems into the boot list.\nThe process is based on these instructions - quite long, but worth reading through:\nhttp://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/grub-2.html\n\nA: Some of the other answers here are helpful, but I think you need to back up and read up on the differences between BIOS and EFI. These are two different types of firmware, BIOS being the old type (dominant before 2011) and EFI being the newer variety (shipping on most computers introduced since mid-2011, and some before then). EFI is not BIOS. You presumably do not have a BIOS, although many people, and even computer manufacturers, refer to EFIs as \"BIOSes.\" IMHO, this is the single most confusing aspect of the transition from BIOS to EFI, since it makes people think that EFI is just BIOS with some bits added, but it's not -- EFI is fundamentally different from BIOS. Dragging BIOS assumptions and tricks into the EFI world is like dragging a burning tree into a fireworks factory -- it's a spectacular mistake.\nHere's my go-to list of recommended reading on EFI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*A question and answers on the differences between BIOS and EFI booting on Superuser.com -- This provides the basics of the preceding, but is more concise.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than the preceding one.\n\n*My page on EFI boot loaders for Linux -- This page describes EFI boot loader choices for Linux systems.\n\n*My page on the CSM -- This page covers the CSM, including when it's useful and when it's not.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\nI understand that's a long list, and you may not want to read them all, but you should read at least a couple of them before you start poking around again. Which ones to read depends on your specific needs and current understanding.\n", "Q: Installing programs from the web When and if I need to download a linux program that is not in Software, I would like to safeguard against malicious programs by installing it in a virtual like setting.\nI have not used any VM's yet, as I don't want/need another OS. I just want to have a safe way of using net downloaded programs.\nThanks! \n\nA: Sandboxing applications will help you.\nIn computer security, a sandbox is a security mechanism for separating running programs. It is often used to execute untested code, or untrusted programs from unverified third parties, suppliers, untrusted users and untrusted websites. A sandbox typically provides a tightly controlled set of resources for guest programs to run in, such as scratch space on disk and memory. Network access, the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices are usually disallowed or heavily restricted.\nApparmor is a default sandboxing application.\nI recommend it to use.\nGuide: Apparmor Documentation\nSee also:\nRun an untrusted C program in a sandbox in Linux that prevents it from opening files, forking, etc.?\nHow to sandbox applications?\n", "Q: Disabling Sticky Edges on Ubuntu 14.04? As the title suggests, I'd like to completely disable Sticky Edges from my set up. \nI have disabled the Sticky Edges in the system settings and played around with CCSM and Tweak Tool to change the values of Sticky Edge Velocity, etc. All of this to no avail. \nI have three monitors, set up in a triangular fashion (two on top, one on the bottom in the middle). The mouse only seems to stick when moving horizontally between the top two monitors. Moving vertically from bottom to top and vice versa works correctly, requiring almost no velocity/speed/pressure to pass the monitor boundary. \nAs such, I've attempted to edit the Launcher sticky edge settings, but this is also to no avail. \nThanks for any suggestions!\n\nEdit:\nAfter having attempted to set the 'Duration of Sticky Edge Release after Break' to 1 hour, only for it to be capped at 5 seconds, I can confirm that this setting has had no affect either. After having broken through the sticky edge, I cannot return through the edge within the 5 seconds unless I do it with great speed.\nIt's almost as if Ubuntu is ignoring my settings. Which is not what I want.\n\nA: This is an odd behaviour that was unexpected and certainly not obvious.\nAfter double checking the Display Settings, it turns out that there was a small gap between my two monitors. This gap essentially meant that moving the mouse slowly did not manage to 'jump' the gap, whereas moving fast enough did.\nThis issue is separate and distinct from sticky edges. In addition, moving my monitors in the settings to be pushed up against each other results in the desired behaviour of being able to move between monitors at any speed.\n", "Q: How can I preserve the desktop's icon positions after reboot, on a dual monitor setup (Unity)? I have a dual monitor setup running Unity on Ubuntu 14.04\nWhenever I boot the machine, the system appears to forget the positions of my desktop icons on the right-side display (Connected via VGA). The icons are all set out nicely on the right side of the screen but when I boot all of the icons are bunched up close to the top left underneath the launcher with some overlapping each other like so:\n\nHow can I fix this so the desktop icons appear in the same place every time I boot? The icons on the left-side display (connected via HDMI) are always fine and always stay in their same positions.\n\nA: The cause\nMost likely, the issue is the result of a bug (related to the video driver). I assume the second screen is not remembered somehow, and \"virtually\" re- connected in a rather late stage in the start up (log in) process.\nWork around\nAs often, even if it is a bug, it doesn't mean we cannot find a work around. If we:\n\n\n*\n\n*can make some kind of a snapshot of the current icon positions on log out\n\n*restore the icon positions after the second screen appears correctly after restart (log in)\n\n\neffectively the bug is worked around.\nHow to read the icon position on the desktop\nYou can get the position on the desktop of an icon by the command:\ngvfs-info -a 'metadata::nautilus-icon-position' '<file>'\n\nThis will a.o. output the coordinates of the icon on your desktop, which we can save into a file. If we make a snapshot this way of your desktop before shutting down the computer, we can subsequently restore the icon's position afterwards, with the command:\ngvfs-set-attribute -t string '<file>' 'metadata::nautilus-icon-position' '500,500'\n\n(for example)\nA script to take such a snapshot, and restore the icon layout (depending on the argument) would be:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# --- set your localized desktop name below:\ndt_name = \"Bureaublad\"\n# ---\n\n\n# used strings & definitions\nval = \" 'metadata::nautilus-icon-position' \"\nsearch = \"gvfs-info -a\"+val\nset_val = \"gvfs-set-attribute -t string \"\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndt_dir = home+\"/\"+dt_name\ndatafile = home+\"/.desktop_items.txt\"\n\narg = sys.argv[1]\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef snapshot():\n    try:\n        os.remove(datafile)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        pass\n    dt_items = os.listdir(dt_dir)\n    dt_data = []\n    for f in [f for f in dt_items if all([not f.startswith(\".\"), not f.endswith(\"~\")])]:\n        f = '\"'+f+'\"' if f.count(\" \") > 0 else f\n        file = dt_dir+\"/\"+f\n        cmd = search+file\n        try:\n            loc = [int(n) for n in get(cmd).split()[-1].split(\",\")]\n            # loc[0] = loc[0] - screen_pos[0]; loc[1] = loc[1] - screen_pos[1]\n            loc = (\",\").join([str(n) for n in loc])\n            open(datafile, \"a+\").write(file+\"|||\"+loc+\"\\n\")\n        except:\n            pass\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"notify-send 'A snapshot was taken'\"])\n\ndef restore():\n    items = [l.strip().split(\"|||\") for l in open(datafile).readlines()]\n    for item in items:\n        try:\n            xy = [int(n) for n in item[1].split(\",\")]\n            move_to = (\",\").join(str(n) for n in [xy[0], xy[1]])\n            command = set_val+item[0]+val+move_to\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n        except:\n            pass\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"notify-send 'Click on the desktop and press F5'\"])\n\nif arg == \"snapshot\":\n    snapshot()\nelif arg == \"restore\":\n    restore()\n\nTo use it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as restore_desktop.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, in the line:\n# --- set your localized desktop name below:\ndt_name = \"Desktop\"\n# ---\n\nset the localized name of your desktop folder (\"Bureaublad\" in Dutch)\n\n*To take a snapshot of the current icon layout, run the command:\npython3 /path/to/restore_desktop.py snapshot\n\n\n*To restore a previously taken snapshot:\npython3 /path/to/restore_desktop.py restore\n\nthen click on the desktop and press F5 to refresh the desktop.\nTo use the script in our situation would however take a few additions\n\n\n*\n\n*The desktop still needs to be refreshed from the command line to actually apply the restore of the icons.

So far, I could not find a way to do that. \nHowever, as always, there is a workaround. If we include the command \ngnome-session-quit --poweroff\n\nin our script, we can simply call the script (with the right arguments) to include the shutdown procedure and take the snapshot.\n\n*Then to make sure the restored snapshot is applied we can include the restart of nautilus in the script.\n\n\nThe solution\nThe final script then becomes:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport time\n\n# --- set your localized desktop name below:\ndt_name = \"Desktop\"\n# ---\n\n\n# used strings & definitions\nval = \" 'metadata::nautilus-icon-position' \"\nsearch = \"gvfs-info -a\"+val\nset_val = \"gvfs-set-attribute -t string \"\nhome = os.environ[\"HOME\"]\ndt_dir = home+\"/\"+dt_name\ndatafile = home+\"/.desktop_items.txt\"\n\narg = sys.argv[1]\n\nget = lambda cmd: subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\")\n\ndef snapshot():\n    # remove the previous snapshot\n    try:\n        os.remove(datafile)\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        pass\n    # list the items on the desktop, look up their positions\n    dt_items = os.listdir(dt_dir)\n    dt_data = []\n    for f in [f for f in dt_items if all([not f.startswith(\".\"), not f.endswith(\"~\")])]:\n        f = '\"'+f+'\"' if f.count(\" \") > 0 else f\n        file = dt_dir+\"/\"+f\n        cmd = search+file\n        try:\n            loc = [int(n) for n in get(cmd).split()[-1].split(\",\")]\n            loc = (\",\").join([str(n) for n in loc])\n            open(datafile, \"a+\").write(file+\"|||\"+loc+\"\\n\")\n        except:\n            pass\n    # notify that a snapshot was taken\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"notify-send 'A snapshot was taken'\"])\n    # send the command to shutdown\n    subprocess.Popen([\"gnome-session-quit\", \"--power-off\"])\n\ndef restore():\n    # wait for 20 seconds for the desktop to be fully loaded and the screen to be found\n    time.sleep(20)\n    # read the snapshot file\n    items = [l.strip().split(\"|||\") for l in open(datafile).readlines()]\n    for item in items:\n        try:\n            # place the icon(s) acoording to the remembered position(s)\n            xy = [int(n) for n in item[1].split(\",\")]\n            move_to = (\",\").join(str(n) for n in [xy[0], xy[1]])\n            command = set_val+item[0]+val+move_to\n            subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n        except:\n            pass\n    # restart nautilus\n    subprocess.call([\"killall\", \"nautilus\"])\n    subprocess.Popen([\"nautilus\"])\n    # send notification\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", \"notify-send 'Icon positions were restored'\"])\n\nif arg == \"snapshot\":\n    snapshot()\nelif arg == \"restore\":\n    restore()\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as restore_icons.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the appropriate (localized) name of the Desktop folder:\n# --- set your localized desktop name below:\ndt_name = \"Desktop\"\n# ---\n\n\n*Test- run the script by running the command:\npython3 /path/to/restore_icons.py snapshot\n\nA snapshot of the current layout will be take.

Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/restore_icons.py snapshot\n\nThis will be the shortcut you need to use, to shut down your computer.\n\n*Add the restore command to Startup Applications: Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\npython3 /path/to/restore_icons.py restore\n\nNow 20 seconds after startup (log in), your icons will be exactly like you left them on shut down.\nNote\nThe 20 seconds break is to make sure the second monitor is found and reconnected before the restore command runs.\n\nA: The Script works on Linux Mint 18.3 Cinnamon too, when i did the following little changes:\nreplace:\nnautilus-icon-position -> nemo-icon-position\ngnome-session-quit     ->cinnamon-session-quit\n\"killall\",\"nautilus\"   ->\"killall\",\"nemo-desktop\"\nsubprocess.Popen([\"nautilus\"])  -> subprocess.POpen([\"nemo-desktop\"])\nthanks a lot for that great script\ncinnamon\n\nA: I wrote iconic to solve this problem by letting you save and load desktop icon settings.

Half of the problem seems to be that most people use lxcbrN devices with LXC but I needed the external IP. I'm not sure what I need. This isn't helped by the ebtables documentation seemingly defining the word \"port\" as something else.\nI'm out of my depth. I can't feel the floor any more and I'm starting to tread water.

It's listed right in the pastebin that windows 10 was in an unsafe state and could not be booted, and to disable quick-boot.\n\nA: Create a new script file in /etc/grub.d, called 12_custom, with this code:\n#!/bin/sh -e\necho \"Adding Windows 10 to GRUB 2 menu\"\ncat << EOF\nmenuentry \"Windows 10\" {\n     set root=(hd1,1)\n     chainloader (hd1,1)+1\n   }\nEOF\n\nThe hd1 corresponds to disk 2, and /dev/sdb, but hd0 is disk 1, or /dev/sda. You may need root access to create the file. Make it executable with chmod +x 12_custom. Update your GRUB with sudo update-grub. Reboot to see if you get to choose between Ubuntu and Windows.\n", "Q: apt-get autoremove dangerous? I was compiling a tool called Rejoystick so I installed a few packages and dependencies.

Perform a simulation of events that would occur but do not actually change the system.\nConfiguration Item: APT::Get::Simulate.\nSimulate prints out a series of lines, each one representing an rpm operation: Configure (Conf), Remove (Remv), Unpack (Inst).\n\nThis option seems to work with both the apt and apt-get commands.\nExample output:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --dry-run\n[...]\nReading package lists...

If its a necessary package that would \"break\" your system if removed  it shouldn't remove it.\n\nA: Usually it should be save to run autoremove. But in case of packaging bugs essential packages might get removed. I made my system unbootable by running an apt autoremove, so I highly recommend quickly looking through the packages which are to be removed.\nEdit: This answer describes how apt autoremove broke my system and how necessary steps to repair it.\n\nA: apt-get remove can ABSOLUTELY destroy your system. It's happened to me twice and I can repeat it (on a Debian-based distro); both times on a vbox, so no big whoop. I watched it remove my entire XFCE installation.\n\nA: From man apt-get:  \n autoremove\n       autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically\n       installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are now no\n       longer needed. \n\nHave you installed other packages (and their dependencies), and subsequently removed the packages?\n\nA: As others mentioned, autoremove should be safe, but then again, you said that you have bad experiences, and I also remember autoremove removing some stuff that should not be removed.\nIt seems like autoremove can have problems with some meta-packages. Say you installed the gnome meta-package for the entire gnome-desktop (or it was installed when setting up the system), which also includes programs like evolution and lots of games, which you might want to remove, because you are using thunderbird and do not want to have those games and the like. This requires you to also remove the gnome meta-package, since it depends on all those packages. But this will make all the other packages that were installed as dependencies of gnome \"auto-removeable\", including e.g. gnome-shell, which you most likely want to keep if you want to continue using that desktop.\nSo it's always a good idea to check the packages recommended for auto-removal. If you are using a graphical package manager like synaptic, you can easily do so and uncheck the \"automatically installed\" flag from packages you want to keep (like gnome-shell in the above example). This will also remove all the packages those depend on from the auto-removeable list, so you might only have to \"fix\" a few of those, and not all.\nStill, it should not remove anything that's really essential to your system, so even if you accidentally removed e.g. your desktop, you can still boot and log into your system and revert those changes using the command line.\n\nUpdate: Recently, after a dist upgrade (Debian), autoremove actually removed something related to hard disc encryption (still not sure what exactly, probably related to the issue described here), causing my system to be unable to decrypt the hard disc and to boot with the latest Kernel. Luckily, it still worked with an older Kernel that was still installed and I could re-install all that was previously autoremoved, otherwise my system would have been wrecked, including my data.\nI don't think there is a \"undo last changes\" option in apt and friends. In synaptic there is a menu option to see the last changes (File -> History; seems to just show some log files, although I could not find the logs themselves; also, I am not sure if this only lists changes made in Synaptic or also e.g. in apt etc.), so I copied the names of all the packages I autoremoved since the last successful reboot (luckily, I reboot daily) from those logs and re-installed them, then rebooted.\n\nA: Firstly, you can try finding out what these packages are there for. Using apt show <package> is a good way. Doing this may lead to understanding like '*-dev' packages are mostly development files that have no impact on normal operation. In many cases they have been installed for compile work.\nSecondly, looking into the list you may note there is one exception named gir-gtk-2.0. Apt tells it is for gnome-2.0 gui, which in your case could be useless.\nIn short, you'd better exlopre a little before making a decision. This question highly depends on the specific packages to deal with, rather than on some general principal as some suggest.\n", "Q: Ubuntu in Oracle Virtual Box running on Windows 7 I am trying to get Ubuntu version 14.04.1 running on a Windows 7 64 bit system.

Because a rare behavior on one of my PCs, I have to installed Ubuntu with the UEFI way (because into the normal BIOS way, I just got a broken Windows start, because it had already been removed).\nBTW: The thing was I don't have the original Windows installation disk to use the standard Windows uninstall process. So I had to created a new partition to Ubuntu and then to delete, manually, all the Windows folders and files from the Windows partition. I can not to format that Windows partition because I have a lot of very important data on that (music and videos) and I don't have any other device where to perform a backup, for the moment (it is more than 750 GB of data). So, when I installed Ubuntu, with the normal BIOS way, all the system was installed but.. when I reboot, the PC showed me an error message: Not system disk (I guess it still looked for the Windows installation). The only way I found to get the PC started with the new Ubuntu system was to install it into the UEFI way. That's my case.\nWell, everything is fine and working OK, now, but... I wonder, just wonder, if there is a way to change the UEFI installation into a normal BIOS installation, if it was necessary (just in case), without to lose any, and without the annoying Windows starting error.\nCan it be possible? How?\nGreetings & Blessings from Chile!\nJuan\n\nA: First, get proper backup hardware! This site -- and indeed the Internet as a whole -- is littered with tales of woe from people who haven't backed up their critical data and, as a result, have lost it all. Don't become another person posting such a story!\nSecond, but related to that first point, if you no longer have a Windows installation, it's important that you move your personal files off of the Windows NTFS volume. The reason is that there is no Linux NTFS repair utility. Thus, when (note: when) the filesystem needs repair, you won't be able to do it from Linux. You'll have to boot a Windows emergency system or move the disk to another computer to do this job. This is a big hassle, and can be a little risky. (Note that there is a Linux tool called ntfsfix, but its name is misleading. This tool does only the most basic checks and then flags the disk as requiring attention from Windows. It can't actually repair filesystem damage.)\nFinally, it is possible to convert a Linux installation made in EFI mode to boot in BIOS mode. Basically, you need to install a BIOS-mode boot loader to the disk. If you're booting via an EFI-mode GRUB 2 (as is the default), I do not recommend you use the BIOS-mode GRUB 2 for this, since the two GRUBs may try to use the same configuration file, but they've got somewhat different needs, so you can end up with a conflict and new problems. Instead, I recommend using GRUB Legacy, SYSLINUX, or LILO. There are numerous sites that describe how to install these tools, but I don't happen to have any bookmarks handy.\nThat said, unless you have a compelling need, I don't recommend you try setting this up. If you're booting correctly in EFI mode, attempting to install a BIOS-mode boot loader will take time and effort that might be better spent elsewhere. Worse, there's always a risk that you'll create problems for yourself, up to and including data loss -- which brings me back to my lead paragraph.\nIf you're concerned about your boot loader malfunctioning, you can download a USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a boot medium. You should be able to use rEFInd to boot your computer if GRUB malfunctions. (Of course, rEFInd's capabilities are limited. If there's a post-GRUB problem like bad filesystem damage, rEFInd won't help -- but then, neither would a BIOS-mode boot loader.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Installation Type screen shows no partition for Dual Boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04LTS I am having a problem doing this as the Ubuntu installer will not see any partitions except /dev/sda1 in the 3rd step when it asks for Installation Type:\n\nEDIT from comments: In Windows 10, I shrinked current C partition used by Windows and made 40GB free for Ubuntu.\nI followed number of articles and changed settings on Windows to disable Secure Boot and enable Legacy boot and that allowed me to boot from bootable USB with Ubuntu 14.04 on it.\nOnce I boot from USB, I get the menu to Test Ubuntu or Install it.

Install it like this:\nsudo apt install qjoypad\n\nThen, it should be available in your launcher. It starts as a system tray icon, and you can launch the configurator by right clicking on it.\nPersonally, I really like the quick bind option that lets you press a key on a gamepad and then a key on your keyboard to update the mapping for that layout automatically. Note that it does indeed natively support multiple gamepads.\nFor me, I had some trouble with getting the right click to launch the configurator to work on the Unity 7.5 desktop - and the left-click menu doesn't appear to have an option for launching it. Thankfully, there's a workaround for this too. Simply launch qjoypad like so:\nqjoypad --notray\n\n....this will disable the system tray icon and instead launch a window with the icon in it instead - which works as expected.\nThis can be made to happen automatically by editing /usr/share/applications/qjoypad.desktop. Find the line that starts with Exec=, and append --notray to  the end of it (make sure that there's a space after qjoypad at  the end of the line and --notray).\n\nA: You can use antimicro, it is a fork of joy2key and has a GUI, use this PPA for 12.04 to 15.10\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ryochan7/antimicro\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install antimicro\n\nFor 16.04 to 17.10 use this PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mdeguzis/libregeek\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install antimicro\n\nSource\n\n", "Q: snapcraft.yaml syntax for a pre-compiled binary I made a c++ web server that has dependencies.

On my Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS network-manager isn't installed yet. Without this program I can't connect to WiFi network. But I can't install this package from Ubuntu without network connection. Here is my question. How to install this offline? or How to install from another computer?\n\nA: You can connect to WiFi without network-manager (even though it should have been installed by default). Open a terminal and run:\nsudo iwconfig\nThere will be some output like lo, eth0, wlan0. The one we want is wlan. Take note of its name (probably wlan0).\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\nGo to the end of the file and create a new line. Write the following:\nauto wlan0\nReplacing wlan0 with what you found back there. In new lines:\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\nwpa-ssid SSID\nReplacing SSID with the name of your WiFi connection.\nwpa-psk password\nReplacing password with your WiFi network's password.\nHit Ctrl+O then Enter to save and Ctrl+X to exit. In the terminal, run:\nsudo ifup wlan0\nAnd you should be connected. You can now install network-manager and anything you want. Remember to remove everything you wrote from /etc/network/interfaces before using network-manager otherwise it won't work.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Galaxy Tab 2 I think that is an odd question but, here we go: Is there any way to install an up-to-date version of Ubuntu on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Here is the port of touch for Galaxy tab 2 P3110, it is no longer updated (since 2013).\nAs this is an old device, Samsung have released seven new revisions of the Galaxy tab since this one, there is no support for it, you would have to port it your self, using this post.\n", "Q: hp pavillon dual boot ubuntu I managed to install ubuntu and dual boot it on a hp pavillion notebook.\nTo do that I had to press esc and f10 immediately after pressing power, in order to access the bios.\nEnable legacy in the boot options of the bios.\nThen I installed and configured linux (debian ubuntu and arch linux) fine.\nAs long as I keep the enable legacy option i get grub after boot.\nWhat i would like to achieve is that if i disable legacy support at the bios, the notebook prompts me to grub2.\nRight now if i disable legacy, the notebook boots windows 10 and ignores grub2.\nI think it has to do with efi but my limited knowledge stops there.\n\nA: \nEnable legacy in the boot options of the bios. Then I installed and configured linux (debian ubuntu and arch linux)\n\nThis may not have been the worst thing you could possibly have done, but it was an action that virtually guaranteed you'd run into problems. To learn why, see my Web page on the subject. (Short version: Enabling the CSM, aka \"legacy support,\" turns the boot process into a coin-toss, with \"heads\" being no different than leaving it disabled and \"tails\" being a 100% guarantee of problems in dual-booting.)\nOne fix is to back up and start again -- disable the CSM and re-install all of your Linux distributions. This is overkill, but in many ways it's the easiest solution. Note that if you enabled the CSM because you had problems booting the installation media, chances are they were prepared incorrectly. See the page to which I linked in the previous paragraph for more on that subject.\nAnother solution is to install an EFI-mode boot loader, which should get your existing installations working. There are many ways to do this, but in all cases you should start by disabling the CSM. Two that are likely to be relatively easy are:\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's not already disabled, disable Secure Boot in your firmware. Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a medium with it. You should be able to boot that, and from it boot any of your Linux distributions. (Some may require some extra coaxing, depending on how you installed them.) In a Linux distribution, install rEFInd to your hard disk. (I provide a Debian package that should work in Debian or Ubuntu and a PPA that should work in Ubuntu. Arch has its own rEFInd package.) This should then get you booting -- but again, you may need to tweak things a bit.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair utility from a boot of an Ubuntu emergency disk, booted in EFI mode. This should install the EFI version of GRUB 2 to your computer, which should pick up your distributions and make them bootable. Unfortunately, GRUB 2 can be a bit iffy with multiple Linux distributions, especially exotic ones -- the OS-detection scripts sometimes aren't optimized or up-to-date for distributions other than the one for which the package was made. Thus, if you use Boot Repair (which is basically an Ubuntu tool), it's quite possible that Arch, and possibly even Debian, will not be correctly detected.\n\n\nEither method may work partially, but lead you into a new problem. If this happens, post back or start a new question; there are too many potential pitfalls in your quad-boot setup for me to begin to address even a tiny fraction of them pre-emptively.\n", "Q: Internet access lost after a minute I installed ubuntu 14.04 on my notebook.

But honestly, I would be happy with just using the integrated GPU when running Ubuntu. Could I get some suggestions as to what to try next?\n\nA: Normally you should use the NVIDIA drivers from the official Ubuntu repositories.\nBut because you are having quite new hardware - the 358 drivers might be better.  \nFirst remove installed NVIDIA drivers and bumblebee.  \nHighlight the Ubuntu menu entry and  press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line.\nPress F10 to boot the Ubuntu operating system.\nWhen the login screen appears press Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nEnter your user name and the password and execute :\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* bumblebee  \nsudo reboot  \n\nNow install the latest official stable NVIDIA drivers.  \nHighlight the Ubuntu menu entry and  press the E key.\nAdd nouveau.modeset=0 to the end of the linux line.\nPress F10 to boot the Ubuntu operating system.\nWhen the login screen appears press Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nEnter your user name and the password and execute :  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-358 nvidia-prime\nsudo reboot  \n\nOpen NVIDIA X Server Settings - select PRIME Profiles tab.\nSwitch to the graphics you want to use, logout and back in.\nDynamic switching is not supported under Linux as of now.\n", "Q: How to start Viber minimized on system startup?

I am trying to spin down my HDD after a certain amount of idle time to save power since I am running Ubuntu Server on a laptop. I know that it is possible to spin down additional drives, but according to this article, the system drive cannot be spun down. This kind of makes sense to me, being that the system is running off that drive, but I don't know. Is there a way to spin down the system drive? Would it be unwise to do so?\n\nA: I did a bit of research, from what I can tell, there are not really any benefits. My system seems to be drawing only ~10 W anyway, most of it from the network card. Cycling the drive can actually wear it out more quickly. I suppose if you are running actual server hardware with a vast number of drives, then it is actually worthwhile.\n", "Q: jetbrains editors The main menu of Intellij IDEA, where the file and other options are, does not appear in the Ubuntu black bar at the top of the screen.

I am having some large issues right now. I decided to go forward with a Windows 10 upgrade after it worked fine on my other dual boot. Of course, I knew that I would have to fix Grub in some way afterwards. \nI got to grub rescue. Okay so I got out a live USB and installed boot-repair and ran it. I rebooted after it said the problem was fixed and the problem was not fixed. \nI booted into my live USB again and checked partitions. I used to run Windows 8.1, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu MATE. From what I can tell, my Ubuntu partitions are gone and there is unallocated space where they were.\nDoes anyone know of a fix? \nEDIT: Boot info summary isn't looking good. It says there are no linux systems installed. You can find it here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/14481248.\nEDIT 2: I was able to get into Windows using SuperGRUB2Disk. Will a reinstall of Ubuntu fix Grub?\nEDIT 3: This is my latest boot info summary after using test-disk and boot-repair. http://paste.ubuntu.com/14491353\n\nA: Windows has LONG had problems with extended and logical partitions. I've seen reports as far back (at least) as Windows XP of it trashing logical partitions in various creative ways. It seems likely to me that the Windows upgrade process ran afoul of this amazingly-unfixed long-term bug.\nBefore you re-install, especially if you have important user data in your Ubuntu installation, you might try running TestDisk from the Ubuntu installer in \"try before installing\" mode. Your fdisk output makes it clear that there's a big gap in your partition table, so chances are the entry for your Ubuntu partition was simply deleted, and the filesystem itself is intact. There's a good chance that TestDisk will be able to recover the partition. After that, there's a small chance that GRUB will just start working. If not (which is more likely), Boot Repair should be able to re-install it and everything should start up again.\n\nEDIT:\nYour post-TestDisk Boot Info Script output shows that what had been two Windows primary partitions (1 and 3) are now your first two logical partitions (5 and 6), and your original partition 2 is now missing. Windows can't boot from a logical partition, which may be what's causing your Windows boot problems -- or it could be that /dev/sda2 was your Windows boot volume, in which case the fact that it's missing is obviously not optimal. You can correct the primary-to-logical problem with my FixParts program (see the just-linked-to documentation for detailed usage instructions). This is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu. Thereafter, I recommend you use fdisk in Ubuntu to re-create your original /dev/sda2 by creating a new partition from sector 718,848 to 541,059,589. Alternatively, you can try using TestDisk again, but you must be careful to tell it which partitions should be primary and which should be logical, so that it doesn't make the same mistake again.\n\nA: First thing you should know is what kind of disk are you dealing with: is a GPT disk or does it have a MBR?\nIn both case I would recommend you use testdisk in order to recovery your partition table.\n\nA: I gave up and wiped the disk. I've decided not to do a dual-boot as it's too complicated for me and I haven't found a good reason I need Windows on this laptop. (I have another one running 10.)\n", "Q: I cannot download software or use `sudo` \nThis is what happens when i use sudo.\nPlus I can't update Ubuntu and I can't open the Software Center.\n\nA: sudo is unuseable, but you still have pkexec.\nSo:\npkexec chmod 440 /etc/sudoers\n\n\nA: Okay, so your main problem is that /etc/sudoers is \"writable.\" as stated by that error message you were getting\nchmod 440 /etc/sudoers\n\nthat changes the file permission so that it isn't \"global writable\" and rather just readable to root. \nalso ensure that the file is owned by root \nls -l /etc/sudoers\n\nthat should give you something that looks like\n-r--r----- 1 root root     745 Feb 10  2014 sudoers\n\nthe -r--r----- root root is the important part. If it's different, then you'll have to change the files ownership, but I doubt that could get screwed up. \nI'm thinking that should fix your problem. Try that and let me know if it doesn't work. \n", "Q: ubuntu wireless on hp stream 11 I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on hp stream 11.

I've tried a couple times.\n\nA: From your output it appears that you only have Windows installed on your first Hard Drive (/dev/sda).  You have most likely selected that as your default boot drive.  Windows can't read a Linux partition, so its boot manager can't boot to a Linux install.\nOn the other hand, the default Ubuntu boot manager, Grub, can boot to either Linux or Windows.  If you installed Grub on your primary drive when you boot to your first drive you would have the option of all the OSes in your Boot menu.\nYou could alternatively select your second drive as your default boot drive.  Update your grub boot manager on that drive and it will scan all your attached drives and add all installed OSes to the boot menu.  The command to update the grub boot manager is:\n$ sudo update-grub\n\nNow when you have that drive selected via your bio drive boot order as the default boot drive you will have all your OS installs (all the Windows and all the Linux installs) listed as options in your boot menu.\nI see two Linux install in your output.  They are:\n/dev/sdb1 - a 146G partition\n/dev/sdb3 - a  73G partition\n\nYou could attach any number of drives (external or internal) and install other Linux OSes to it.  The install will install (update) the default grub boot manager and have all your OS installs including the new one in the boot menu.\nYou could use a disk partition editor such as gparted to rearange your partitions (resize, move, or create) so that you can have a partition of a new OS install on one of the current drives you have (/dev/sda or dev/sdb).  After you have a partition for your install, just run the live Ubuntu disk and install any additional Linux version you with to have included in your boot menu.\n", "Q: gconftool-2 not working when run from a script I'm trying to change the settings of gnome-terminal, using gconftool-2 via. a bash script.\nWhen I run gconftool-2 commands from the command line, they work.:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/background_color --type string \"#393939\"\n\nIn this case it changes the background colour of gnome-terminal - the change occurs immediately.\nHowever, when I run the commands from a script they don't work.\nThe overall script runs as sudo, i.e. sudo ./script.sh then I use the sudo -u option to de-elevate back to the regular user.

Been messing with it for hours. Found a few tidbits in my logs, suggesting that sendmail was somehow mixed up in the problem, and then finally found this post.\nI ended up doing a \"sudo apt-get purge sendmail*\" and that finally fixed it.\n\nA: If the solution is to cleanly purge sendmail, you might need to remove other sendmail packages as so:\n$ sudo apt-get purge sendmail sendmail-base sendmail-bin\n\nor \n$ sudo apt-get purge sendmail*\n\nThen you can try to switch on your interface again:\n$ sudo ifup interface-name\n\nsendmail related error messages should have disappeared.\nIf you still need sendmail you can reinstall by:\n$ sudo apt-get install sendmail sendmail-base sendmail-bin\n$ sudo sendmailconfig\n$ # you can say yes to all the questions and restart your http server\n$ sudo service apache2 restart\n\n", "Q: Sd card is readable but,not able to write or format the card I am using a Transcend class 4 8gb SD card.

How do I know which partitions (home and root) belong to which version, without depending on size of the partitions?\n\nA: The best way is to check all the partitions for a file called /etc/os-release. That file identifies the Linux distribution and version. If you're doing it \"by hand,\" you can use any number of lines. If you want a script to do something with the information, you should probably focus on one line. Here's the file from an Ubuntu 14.04.3 installation:\nNAME=\"Ubuntu\"\nVERSION=\"14.04.3 LTS, Trusty Tahr\"\nID=ubuntu\nID_LIKE=debian\nPRETTY_NAME=\"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\"\nVERSION_ID=\"14.04\"\nHOME_URL=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\"\nSUPPORT_URL=\"http://help.ubuntu.com/\"\nBUG_REPORT_URL=\"http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/\"\n\nOnce you've found that file, you can check /etc/fstab on the same partition for identification of additional partitions associated with the installation. In a default Ubuntu setup, these will identify other partitions by UUID values, which you can obtain from blkid, as in:\n$ sudo blkid /dev/sdc3\n/dev/sdc3: UUID=\"5028fa50-0079-4c40-b240-abfaf28693ea\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nIf you use LVM, the /etc/fstab file will most likely refer to logical volumes by device ID, as in /dev/mapper/ubuntu-home. There are other legal formats in /etc/fstab that might be used if you edited it manually, too.\nAgain, doing this by hand will require some digging about, but it can be scripted if you want to build a tool to piece it all together automatically.\n\nA: You can check the label of the kernel.  Here's an answer that includes a list of all the Ubuntu versions and which kernel they use: https://askubuntu.com/a/517140/366676.\nYou can easily mount the /boot/ partition on any modern device.\n", "Q: How do I install my printer to ubuntu?

But the widespread proposed way to achieve that does not work for me and others, so I think there is a need for another question asking why the widespread proposed solution of changing /etc/default/rcS does not work (at least in some cases), and my question addresses such need.\n\nA: As @muru explained on Clock time is off on dual boot and according to the Arch Wiki:\n\nYou can set the hardware clock time standard through the command line.\n  You can check what you have set to use by:\n$ timedatectl | grep local\n\nThe hardware clock can be queried and set with the timedatectl\n  command. To change the hardware clock time standard to localtime, use:\n# timedatectl set-local-rtc 1\n\nIf you want to revert to the hardware clock being in UTC, do:\n# timedatectl set-local-rtc 0\n\n\nWe can make Windows to use UTC but sometimes we have few Windows and only one Ubuntu for our multi boot setup. In this case preferable option is to force one Ubuntu to use 'Local' time rather than changing all Windows settings one by one.\nTested this method on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial and it's working without any issue.\n\nA: If you wish to update the time immediately use switch:\ntimedatectl --adjust-system-clock set-local-rtc 1\n\n\nA: I have a quite simple answer for all the users who don't want to mess up with command lines in Linux.\nIn Windows turn on the automatic time and time zone update as it will set BIOS/hardware clock to local time. Now\nIn Linux, turn off the time zone update and set time zone to UTC or GMT. So, it will assume BIOS time as UTC time (which is now local time set via Windows.) And display the same. And now turn on the automatic time update.\n", "Q: How to purge all contacts How can I purge all my contacts on my bq E5 Ubuntu Edition?\nI am am just trying to fill my new E5 with the thousands of contacts I have on my old Communicator.

Then one day it was slow to the point of unusable and so it remains until now. The problem is not the network itself as my desktop has perfectly fine wifi. I uninstalled Ubuntu and reinstalled  - this did not fix the problem. I've read a ton of very confusing answers proporting to solve this problem and I have spent a lot of time copying a hodgepodge of code from these answers to the terminal. Nothing has worked. I tried to install Fedora and it wouldn't install so I'm stuck with Ubuntu. help! :)\nedit: I also bought a panda wireless USB adapter to solve this problem but it doesn't fix it. the connection is still slow to the point of timing out.\nEdit: I just installed MINT and the same issue arises. Regardless I'm confident it isn't the network or the laptop I'm on. When I connect via a physical connection it works just fine and as i said, the wireless worked prior. It also worked when I was using windows on the same machine. \n\nA: Your wireless interface is softblocked\nTry sudo rfkill unblock wlan0\n\nA: There's a few things you can try, but honestly this is very network card dependent; it would be helpful to post the output of lspci and dmesg to check for sure. Looking online, it appears that this laptop has an Atheros 9k series card.\nI happen to have a card in the same series, and I've noticed it will get stuck sometimes in a low-performance mode after a suspend, which shows up readily in the dmesg output (I don't have the issue right now, so I cannot provide an example); rebooting a couple of times usually fixed it however, so I'm surprised that yours persisted across multiple reboots. I've had the problem survive a couple of reboots and suddenly start working, but I haven't tracked down the cause. I did notice that rebooting to Windows would always fix the issue, so it may related to some initialization. I know this is probably not the fix you wanted, but if you still have Windows on the machine it's worth a shot.\nRemoving and reinserting the module (sudo modprobe -r ath9k and sudo modprobe ath9k respectively) didn't seem to fix it, but if the card got stuck the output in dmesg would be different than normal.\nHowever, given that the Panda devices seem to be ralink or realtek, this doesn't explain why the external adapter was slow as well -- there is probably another configuration issue at play there.\n", "Q: Getting Issue with installing via. apt-get sudo apt-get install swi-prolog\nReading package lists...

A while ago I noticed this directory that I had not ever seen before, /sys. I researched a bit and read that \"modern Linux systems\" often have this directory, and that it manages devices. I thought that was what /dev was for.

Would someone please fill me in? What is the difference between /sys and /dev? When did Ubuntu start using this directory, and why? Thanks.\n\nA: /sys is old. It was introduced before the Linux kernel reached 2.6 (back when there was a 2.4/2.5 split). Since the first Ubuntu release used a 2.6 kernel, every version of Ubuntu has had a /sys.\n/dev contains the actual device files. It does not provide access to all devices that the kernel knows of (such as ethernet devices, for one - Why are network interfaces not in /dev like other devices?, Why do Ethernet devices not show up in \"/dev\"?). It is an interface to the device itself - you write to the device, read from it, etc.\n/sys is an interface to the kernel. Specifically, it provides a filesystem-like view of information and configuration settings that the kernel provides, much like /proc. Writing to these files may or may not write to the actual device, depending on the setting you're changing. It isn't only for managing devices, though that's a common use case.\nMore information can be found in the kernel documentation:\nTop Level Directory Layout\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe sysfs directory arrangement exposes the relationship of kernel\ndata structures. \n\nThe top level sysfs directory looks like:\n\nblock/\nbus/\nclass/\ndev/\ndevices/\nfirmware/\nnet/\nfs/\n\ndevices/ contains a filesystem representation of the device tree. It maps\ndirectly to the internal kernel device tree, which is a hierarchy of\nstruct device. \n\nbus/ contains flat directory layout of the various bus types in the\nkernel. Each bus's directory contains two subdirectories:\n\n    devices/\n    drivers/\n\ndevices/ contains symlinks for each device discovered in the system\nthat point to the device's directory under root/.\n\ndrivers/ contains a directory for each device driver that is loaded\nfor devices on that particular bus (this assumes that drivers do not\nspan multiple bus types).\n\nfs/ contains a directory for some filesystems.  Currently each\nfilesystem wanting to export attributes must create its own hierarchy\nbelow fs/ (see ./fuse.txt for an example).\n\ndev/ contains two directories char/ and block/. Inside these two\ndirectories there are symlinks named <major>:<minor>.  These symlinks\npoint to the sysfs directory for the given device.  /sys/dev provides a\nquick way to lookup the sysfs interface for a device from the result of\na stat(2) operation.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*One way of setting the brightness of a laptop monitor is:\necho N > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\n\n*To get the a network card's MAC address:\ncat /sys/class/net/enp1s0/address\n\n\n*To get the current CPU scaling governors:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n\nAnd so on...\n", "Q: Which is the default Python version supported in Ubuntu 15.04 and 15.10?

When I enter to this shortcut's folder I can't see any folders above it so I can't easily navigate to them.\nIs there a way to go one folder up in the GUI? Maybe a hotkey? (Can't do cd .. this time ^__^ ).\n\n\nIn Windows for example I am indeed able to navigate in the way I describe, here is a Win10 image that explains it:\n\n\nA: Or for Ubuntu 14.04, nautilus 3.10-1, with the xdotool package added, just use the following in your .local/share/nautilus/scripts/updirtree\nfile:\n# In nautilus, the pwd is the actual, not the link path\nxdotool key ctrl-l\nxdotool type \"$(dirname $(pwd))\" \"\n\"\n\nThe final quote should just contain a newline or return (0x0a).\nThe pwd from within nautilus produces a different result than when run from a bash/terminal -- it returns the actual path, not the path using the link.\n\nI agree it makes no sense, it's undocumented, and I can't even figure out what sort of execution environment is running the code (I can't find any shell which produces that result), but it works.  It's a hack, which is why I included the version of nautilus.  Who knows how long it will work?  Might break at the next nautilus upgrade (or the unknown interpreter), but for me, it works on links to mounted locations, links to places in the directory tree, or just plain locations in the directory tree.\n\nA: Why this is a challenging question\nThe question has a few challenges:\n\n\n*\n\n*nautilus does not communicate directly from the command line, to get the currently active directory for example, nor can you \"send\" the currently opened folder (-window) to another directory from the command line.\n\n*In the current path, as requested via \"NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\", Nautilus does not return the real path to the current folder, but \"sees\" the link as if it was an actual folder.\n\n\nThe solution therefore is as dirty as it gets; we need to find workarounds. Below four options to solve the issue.\n1. right- click to go one level up\nTo get the real path to the current directory, we have to retrieve information from the link. We can do that either by using ls -l on the link, which will output e.g.:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 jacob jacob 35 jan 15 08:23 /home/jacob/Bureaublad/Flyer_st/Verwijzing naar Site_current -> /home/jacob/Bureaublad/Site_current\n\nwhere the section after -> is the real path inside the symlink, or, using python:\nreal = os.path.realpath(\"/path\")\n\nUsing this in a nautilus script, we can indirectly get the real path to the current file or folder.\nThen if we have the path, how do we make nautilus move one level up?\nAgain, we cannot solve this and keep our hands clean. To move one level up, we first edit the found path a bit, from:\n/path/to/a/folder\n\ninto\n/path/to/a\n\nthen, using xdotool to simulate Ctrl+L (the GUI shortcut to insert a path into a nautilus window, since there is no cli option to move to another directory using the current window), and subsequently make xclip paste the edited path + Enter, we have a working solution!\nIn practice\n\n\n*\n\n*We are in a folder, opened from a link (\"Link to Telegram\") on my Desktop. The real folder is a sub folder of my Downloads folder:\n\n\n*Then if we right- click on any of the files inside the folder to run the script:\n\n\n*Automatically, the path to the superior directory is inserted:\n\n\n*And, also automatically, Return is pressed, and we move one directory level up:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\n\ndef run(cmd):\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n\ncurrent = os.getenv(\"NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\").replace(\"file://\", \"\").replace(\"%20\", \" \")\nreal = os.path.realpath(current)\nup = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(real, os.pardir))\nrun(\"xdotool key Control_L+l\")\nrun(\"printf '\"+up+\"' | xclip -selection clipboard\")\nrun(\"xdotool key Control_L+v\")\n# confirm by virtually press Return\ntime.sleep(0.1)\nrun(\"xdotool key Return\")\n\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*The script needs both xdotool and xclip:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool xclip\n\n\n*create, if it doesn't exist already, the directory\n~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts\n\n\n*Copy the script above into an empty file, save it as level_up (no extension) in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts, and make it executable\n\n*You might have to log out and back in.\n\n*Now you should be able to run the script by right- click on a file (any) > scripts > level_up:\n\n\n[EDIT] I changed the script above to paste the path into the nautilus window, instead of making xdotool type it. It needs xclip to be installed, but it is a major improvement, especially on very long paths.\n\n2. Alternatively, open a new nautilus window in the superior directory\nYou could avoid using xdotool, by making the script open a new nautilus window, in the parent's directory. The script would then be even shorter:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\ndef run(cmd):\n    subprocess.call(cmd)\n\ncurrent = os.getenv(\"NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\").replace(\"file://\", \"\").replace(\"%20\", \" \")\nreal = os.path.realpath(current)\nup = real[:real.rfind(\"/\")]\nsubprocess.Popen([\"nautilus\", up])\n\nIn this case, you wouldn't need to install xdotool. We could even extend the script by closing the original window and placing the new window exactly in the same position (& size). \nThe downside is that the history of the original window is lost this way.\n3. An additional solution: alternative way to (automatically) create links\nNot relevant to existing links, but when used from the GUI, a nautilus script to automatically create executable .desktop files on right-click might be helpful:\nright-click on the directory to create a shortcut (behaving as a link)\n\nUnlike symlinks, these links will take you to the actual folder, without behaving as a folder itself:\n\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\ncurrent = os.getenv(\n    \"NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS\"\n    ).replace(\"file://\", \"\").replace(\"%20\", \" \").strip()\n\nif os.path.isdir(current):\n    parent = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(current, os.pardir))\n    fldr_path = '\"'+current+'\"'\n    folder = current[current.rfind(\"/\")+1:]\n    linkfilename = parent+\"/\"+folder+\"link.desktop\"\n    linkdata = [\n        \"[Desktop Entry]\",\n        \"Type=Application\",\n        \"Name=Link to -> \"+folder,\n        \"Icon=folder\",\n        \"Exec=nautilus \"+fldr_path,\n        ]\n    with open(linkfilename, \"wt\") as wt:\n        for l in linkdata:\n            wt.write(l+\"\\n\")\n    command = \"chmod +x \"+\"'\"+linkfilename+\"'\" \n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as make_link (no extension) in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts, and make it executable\n\n*Use the script by choosing it as a right- click option as in the first image. An executable .desktop file will be created in the same directory, move it elsewhere if you need to; the linked path is absolute.\n\n\nGive the link an distinguishing icon\nYou could give the alternative link a distinguishing icon. If you search inside the directory /usr/share/icons for \"folder\", numerous valid options pop up.\nIf in the script the line \"Icon=folder\", is replaced by Icon=stock_folder-copy, (use the icon name without extension), the result on my system is:\n\nOf course you can use your own custom icon as well, but if you use full paths (don't use ~), you should include the icon's extension.\n4. Move to the superior directory with a short cut key\nProbably the most convenient option; with the nautilus window in front, press a short cut key to move one directory up. \nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport os\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef run(cmd):\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n\n# get information on the active window\nfront = get([\"xprop\", \"-id\", get([\"xdotool\", \"getactivewindow\"])])\n# (only) if it is a \"normal\" nautilus window, take action\nif 'WM_CLASS(STRING) = \"nautilus\", \"Nautilus\"' in front:\n    # \"virtually\" press Ctrl + l\n    run(\"xdotool key Control_L+l\"); time.sleep(0.05)\n    # copy the current path, calculate the \"real\" parent directory\n    real = os.path.realpath(get([\"xclip\", \"-o\"]))\n    up = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(real, os.pardir))\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n    # enter the superior directory\n    run(\"printf '\"+up+\"' | xclip -selection clipboard\")\n    run(\"xdotool key Control_L+v\")\n    # confirm by virtually press Return\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n    run(\"xdotool key Return\")\n\nTo use\n\n\n*\n\n*For this solution, both xclip and xdotool Need to be on your system.\nsudo apt-get install xdodool xclip\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as level_up.py (anywhere).\n\n*Add it to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/level_up.py\n\nNB The shortcut options are a bit limited in this case, since the script itself will simulate Ctrl+L, and Ctrl+Alt+L will make you log out... Ctrl+\\ worked fine on my system.\nExplanation\nThis script also simulates Ctrl+L, but instead of using nautilus' \"NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI\", it uses xclip to copy the automatically selected path in the nautilus window. Like option 1, the script then calculates the real path and derives the superior directory.\nThis option might be useful if you prefer the keyboard to using right- click.\n\nA: A clean fix but needs source rebuild by reverting this commit:\ndiff --git a/src/nautilus-mime-actions.c b/src/nautilus-mime-actions.c\nindex ca1f0ac..0b363b4 100644\n--- a/src/nautilus-mime-actions.c\n+++ b/src/nautilus-mime-actions.c\n@@ -2029,21 +2029,13 @@ activate_activation_uris_ready_callback (GList *files_ignore,\n\n    /* Convert the files to the actual activation uri files */\n    for (l = parameters->locations; l != NULL; l = l->next) {\n-       char *uri = NULL;\n-\n+       char *uri;\n        location = l->data;\n\n        /* We want the file for the activation URI since we care\n         * about the attributes for that, not for the original file.\n         */\n-       if (nautilus_file_is_symbolic_link (location->file)) {\n-           uri = nautilus_file_get_symbolic_link_target_uri (location->file);\n-       }\n-\n-       if (uri == NULL) {\n-           uri = nautilus_file_get_activation_uri (location->file);\n-       }\n-\n+       uri = nautilus_file_get_activation_uri (location->file);\n        if (uri != NULL) {\n            launch_location_update_from_uri (location, uri);\n        }\n\nBuild instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download source:\napt-get source nautilus\n\n\n*Download build dependencies\nsudo apt-get build-dep nautilus\n\n\n*Make the need modification from above patch\nEdit src/nautilus-mime-actions.c\n/* Convert the files to the actual activation uri files */\nfor (l = parameters->locations; l != NULL; l = l->next) {\n    char *uri = NULL;\n    location = l->data;\n\n    /* We want the file for the activation URI since we care\n     * about the attributes for that, not for the original file.\n     */\n    if (nautilus_file_is_symbolic_link (location->file)) {\n        uri = nautilus_file_get_symbolic_link_target_uri (location->file);\n    }\n\n    if (uri == NULL) {\n        uri = nautilus_file_get_activation_uri (location->file);\n    }\n\n    if (uri != NULL) {\n        launch_location_update_from_uri (location, uri);\n    }\n\n\n*Build & install it\nautoreconf\n./configure\nmake\n\nTo test without installation\nsudo killall -r \"[\\w]*nautilus\"\n./src/nautilus\n\nTo install it\nsudo make install\n\nThis will make nautilus resolve the links into their target path.

So, this page is what I'm using as a manual:\nDifferent locations for MySQL databases? \nI'm trying to store my database on USB (whether a good idea or not, please tell me how to do this if there is a way). mysql works fine with a soft link that is linked to another folder on the computer. Of course that folder's ownership changed with chown -R mysql:mysql /file.\nThe first problem I encountered when doing this with USB is that, I couldn't use chown when the current directory is in the usb. My usb's file system is vfat. What I learnt from my research is that \"vfat\" or \"fat32\" file system has no support for a security. And that the files in usb could have \"immutable\" attribute. I couldn't use lsattr nor chattr to check if they are immutable or to eliminate the immutable tag.\nI manually mounted the USB so that its \"uid\" and \"gid\" are \"mysql\". I run id -u mysql and id -g mysql, and those turned out to be 116 and 125. Then I used sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/external -o uid=116,gid=125,utf8,dmask=007,fmask=117 to mount my usb. When I lsblk, it is mounted. I was little uncomfortable with the fact that EVERYTHING in my USB will be mysql:mysql, but I wasn't able to find how to set different owner for folders in the same USB.\nUsed https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB this as a manual.\nSo, after I've done this, when I ls -l in USB, it gives mysql:mysql.\nBefore doing this, when performing show databases, I think the soft link I made under /var/lib/mysql/ would not appear, but it appears now.\nNow, the problem is that when I perform show tables or create tables after choosing the database (soft link) it gives:\nERROR 1018 (HY000): Can't read dir of './Muniverse/' (errno: 13)\nI don't know what to do from here.\nWhen I search for \"mysql errno: 13\", the solutions all suggest chown -R mysql:mysql (or mysql.mysql), which I think it is already done since when I ls -l in USB, it APPEARS that the the owner and group IS \"mysql\".\nMaybe it only APPEARS as it is? Or is this not working because the files are \"immutable\"?\nHowever, referring to man manual, there exists \"sys_immutable\" option that is not set by default.\nWhat am I doing or what have I done wrong?\nNOTE: So, basically, I can make the soft link for folders on the computer to work in mysql but not on USB.\n===========================\nFYI, for those who are as noob as I am in Linux, I was able to format USB to ext4 on LINUX. My windows 10 computer didn't have option for \"ext4\". And the proof that I think is useful is that when I do lsattr, it now prints attributes and stuff.\nlink: formatting USB Flash memory for ubuntu ext4\n\nA: Use EXT on the USB. You are not going to be using the MySQL database outside of Linux anyways so use a native filesystem. That will fix all problems you have with permissions. The errno 13 is a permissions error and more than likely related to your filesystem. \n\"ln -s\" will also work when using EXT. It is a Linux command so it does not work with Microsoft filesystems.\nUsing an USB for a database is a very bad idea though. Wear leveling is going to be a serious issue. You would be far better off putting the database on a separate partition on your system and copying that partition to a USB and restore the data on another machine where you can use the new database.\n", "Q: opencv compiling error ippicv When I write this to terminal:\ng++ LATCH_match.cpp -std=c++11 $(pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs)\n\nI've got an error like this:\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lippicv\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nI've tried a lot of things but I couldn't find a solution.\n\nA: If you have verified that installation was made after compilation, then you can update pkgconfig for opencv (/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc) to include 3rd party.

I did recompile with -DWITH_IPP=ON, and there are no build error, or install errors. It looks like the installer put libippicv at the following path:\n/usr/local/share/OpenCV/3rdparty/lib/libippicv.a\n\nBut then the installed file /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc just references -lippicv, WITHOUT giving the correct path. So I think something is broken.\n\nA: You can simply add a symbolic link in /lib directory to work around it:\ncd /lib\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/share/OpenCV/3rdparty/lib/libippicv.a libippicv.a\n\n(assuming your library is in /usr/local/share/OpenCV/3rdparty/lib) \n", "Q: 14.04 - Remote Desktop/Control to Headless Ubuntu Desktop Apologies if this has been asked many times, but there seems to be a variety of options for remote desktop onto a headless machine running 14.04 LTS (Desktop)\nI don't have much experience with Ubuntu, having used Windows 95% of the time.\nWhat is the best solution for Remote Desktop access to a machine with no Mouse/Keyboard/Monitor, in 1920x1080? I'd like to use the Windows native RDP application, if possible. This is not on the LAN, if that makes a difference.\nI've read about VNC, XRDP, FreeNX, Teamviewer etc.\nThis question contains useful info: Desktop sharing options for Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity but it doesn't seem to cover the headless side.\nEDIT: I'd like to use the Unity interface remotely, preferably.\n\nA: Assuming that ¨headless¨ means that you do not have the X.Org Display Server installed, you are not able to login with Remote Desktop, VNC, or another ¨Remote Desktop Program¨. \nYou have two options. \n\n\n*\n\n*You could install a graphical environment on the server (when you are at it´s physical location), then install VNC or XRDP, and use your home computer to connect to that VNC/RDP Server. For VNC, I would recommend the TightVNC Viewer (quick Google search will do), and with XRDP installed, you can connect using Windows´ built-in ¨Remote Desktop¨. \n\n*In case that you do not want to install a desktop environment, you need to install a SSH Server. You can then download a program like PuTTY (Google search), and connect to the IP Address, with your username and password. As SSH Server I would highly recommend the openssh-server package, which can be installed by executing the following command: sudo apt-get install openssh-server. In case that you are root, you do not have to use sudo. I hope that this will help you getting a little further. \n\n\nIf you have any questions, you can ask them here (if you want), I will try to answer them as soon as possible.\n", "Q: HP 2140 screen resolution stuck at 1024x576 I installed Lubuntu on a HP2140 mini PC.

For this, I decided to use pbuilder using the .pbuilderrc script from https://jodal.no/2015/03/08/building-arm-debs-with-pbuilder/. Then, I use dpkg-buildpackage -S or dpkg-source -b for creating the .dsc file. Using this file, I call\nsudo OS=ubuntu DIST=trusty ARCH=amd64 pbuilder --build $dscfile\nsudo OS=ubuntu DIST=trusty ARCH=armhf pbuilder --build $dscfile\n\nThe problem is that pbuilder seems to repack the .debian.tar.gz file (and change to .xz) and recreate the .dsc file. The contents of the two tar files are similar, only the permissions and timestamps changed and in the .dsc file I see minor changes plus the different checksums:\n- libpj2 deb comm optional\n+ libpj2 deb comm optional arch=any\n\n- b42ddedc2d8b210ec10b4db4271997569aab448d 29942 pjproject_2.1.0.0.ast20130823-1.test20.debian.tar.gz\n+ 11646618842914086b78ce0e191f6e2cfbe0965d 25548 pjproject_2.1.0.0.ast20130823-1.test20.debian.tar.xz\n\nNow, the problem is that I cannot put the result of these two builds to a reprepro repository:\n#reprepro -Vb . includedsc trusty $dscfile\nreprepro -Vb . include trusty /var/cache/pbuilder/ubuntu-trusty-amd64/result/*.changes\nreprepro -Vb . include trusty /var/cache/pbuilder/ubuntu-trusty-armhf/result/*.changes\n\nBecause it doesn't accept the different checksums of the .dsc file:\nFile \"pool/test/p/pjproject/pjproject_2.1.0.0.ast20130823-1.test20.debian.tar.xz\" is already registered with different checksums!\nmd5 expected: 2f5bcb162dedd309a9d9ecba733d1036, got: bc30e1f502f7b36c10e9709dfe75e60b\nsha1 expected: 11646618842914086b78ce0e191f6e2cfbe0965d, got: 94c6ecebe07a93c7505058019b6f64a73a9625a5\nsha256 expected: 0642aa4d78b1cc91d06cc6fe406380b76aa7de5fb26105ea052d447f36f65d19, got: cfa085ac5904eadc21a849958118ce597fe03d78fd8cc82f225c33cbcb663462\n\nMy questions are now:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I avoid rebuilding the source package?\n\n*Is this a plausible workflow for building such multi-arch packages?\n\n*Is there a better way, for example a better cross-build tool?\n\n*For arch-independent binary packages, I assume similar problems as with the source package.

My workflow is now as following:\nUpdate version information:\ndch -i\n\nBuild source package:\ncd ulxmlrpcpp/\ndpkg-buildpackage -S -sa\ncd ../\n\nBuild. Note that the first call is different because it also generates the arch-indep binaries.

This is a commercial product from Microsoft that was never released for desktop Linux (and probably never will).\nThere is a Linux clone called Wync that is able to connect to the same telephony network, but this is just another commercial solution.\nThere is a plug-in for Pidgin called SIPE that is supposed to integrate with the Skype for Business network, but it seems nonoperational on Ubuntu 14.04. Once the plug-in is activated Pidgin keeps regurgitating error messages that render it useless.\nWhat other free options are there to connect to this telephony network from Ubuntu?\n\nA: There is some information here from Chris Rob about using Skype for Business on Ubuntu 14.04 with Pidgin.\nSeems you need to compile/install the latest SIPE plug in for Pidgin and then configure to connect to the Skype for Business server.\n\nA: I have made some, but not complete progress with the following.\nFor me, the standard pidgin sipe plugin, through Office Communicator, let me connect to Skype for Business and see my employer's user directory, but crucially, did not succeed in a test call or a call to another user, with a variety of error messages.  Even text messages to others did not arrive, despite pidgin giving no error message.  However, there is a newer version of the plugin, as indicated in this Reddit post:\n\nHello, as already mentioned Pidgin is the way to go.\nUnfortunately the default version in more or less all the distributions comes with a combination of pidgin-sipe / libnice / gstreamer / farstream which doesn't work at all in the worst case (= only chat works), and doesn't allow calling Skype for Business clients in the best case (= you can only call Pidgin and Lync clients). The patches to make everything work are available upstream but some of the packages have not included them in official releases.\nThe solution for Ubuntu is to use this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~sipe-collab\nwhich has been ported also to Fedora: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dwmw2/sipecollab/\nStarting from those two add-ons it can be made working on more or less all the other Linux distributions (we managed to get it working on CentOS 7).\nHTH\n\nTo make it work, I did:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sipe-collab/ppa\n\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\n$ sudo apt-get install pidgin-sipe\n\nNow, the test call works.

I've got a folder that has 0600 chmod permission and this folder has a sh script. \nI'm trying to limit some permissions but I've realized that if the folder has not a execute permission, unless for the user, I can't access using cd command, so that I can't execute my script.\nThe script has the proper permission (0700)\nIs this right? I don't understand why. Could anybody explain me the function of execute permission in folders?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: That's basically how it works - a directory has to have execution bit set to allow user/group member/others to enter it.\nMore interestingly - you don't really need read permissions on the directory to access file inside it - as long, as you know the file name, since you can't list contents of directories if you have no read permissions.\nI think the key to understand it is to realize that in Linux/Unix there really is no such thing like directory. It's also a file - containing information about the other files - its contents.\nAnyway - some reading about those basics will be a good idea, I'd say.\nThis may be a good start: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\n", "Q: How to restore \"DASH\" button functionality Don't know what I did to make this happen.

I am very new to Linux and I put the following command at the end of the file .profile under my home folder:\nexport PATH=\"~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH\"\n\nI know the issues of environment variables and their values a bit from Windows, but in this case I want to understand what this command does, and what are the parts that it comprises:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is this \"export\" phrase at the start? Is it exporting the data to be available for Bash?\n\n*What is the first PATH and what is the second $PATH, and why do we need two?\n\nA: \nWhat is this \"export\" phrase at the start?\n\nexport is a command (more precisely it's a Bash builtin, i.e. it's not an executable present in PATH, it's a command that Bash has built-in in itself).\n\nIs it exporting the data to be available for Bash?\n\nexport sets the environment variable on the left side of the assignment to the value on the right side of the assignment; such environment variable is visible to the process that sets it and to all the subprocesses spawned in the same environment, i.e. in this case to the Bash instance that sources ~/.profile and to all the subprocesses spawned in the same environment (which may include e.g. also other shells, which will in turn be able to access it).\n\nWhat is the first PATH and what is the second $PATH, and why do we need two?\n\nThe first PATH as explained above is the environment variable to be set using export.\nSince PATH normally contains something when ~/.profile is sourced (by default it contains /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games), simply setting PATH to ~/.composer/vendor/bin would make PATH contain only ~/.composer/vendor/bin.\nSo since references to a variable in a command are replaced with (or \"expanded\" to) the variable's value by Bash at the time of the command's evaluation, :$PATH is put at the end of the value to be assigned to PATH so that PATH ends up containing ~/.composer/vendor/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games (i.e. what PATH contains already plus ~/.composer/vendor/bin: at the start).\n\nA: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables will probably help you. Also man bash may be very helpful with understanding how that works (at least in Bash)\nAnyway - as for PATH= you're basically setting the PATH variable, adding some new paths to search through, adding at the end already / previously set paths, with $PATH (which is basically a reference to the PATH variable).\nSo, say your PATH was so far set to something like:\nPATH=\"x:y:z\"\n\nand then you set\nPATH=\"a:b:c:$PATH\"\n\nyour PATH after that will be like:\na:b:c:x:y:z\n\nI hope that makes sense.\nAnd on top of that you export the new variable so it's known in your environment including also child processes / subshells.\nJust be aware also that the order of the directories as set in PATH can be important. And something like PATH=\"$PATH:a:b:c\" will give you the result:\nx:y:z:a:b:c\n\nwhich will affect the order of directories / paths while searching for a command (if you have your command in more than one of directories, the first found will be used - which may give you some unexpected results sometimes).\n\nA: Here's the command so that everybody can follow along as they go through the bullet points.\nexport PATH=\"~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH\" \n\n\n*\n\n*export shell built-in (meaning there is no /bin/export ,it's a shell thing) command basically makes environment variables available to other programs called from bash ( see the linked question in Extra Reading ) and the subshells. \n\n*Assignment in shell will take expansion first , then assignment will take place second. So what  is inside double quotes gets expanded first, saved to PATH variable later.\n\n*$PATH is the default PATH assignment ( or at least what the variable looks like up till this command appears in your .bashrc or .profile), and expand it.\n\n*~/.composer/vendor/bin is going to expand to /home/username/.composer/vendor/bin , where .composer is hidden folder due to the leading dot.\n\n*That short ~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH have now transformed into long list of folders, separated by :. Everything is enclosed into double quotes so that we include folders with spaces in their path.\n\n*Finally everything is stored into PATH variable and external commands allowed to use it\n\n\nSimple Example\nMy interactive shell is actually mksh , which happens to also have export builtin.  By using export to set VAR, my variable can be passed to and used by subsequent chain of commands/subprocesses, where I exported that same variable\n$ echo $SHELL            \n/bin/mksh\n$ VAR=\"HelloAskUbuntu\"\n$ bash -c 'echo $VAR' \n$ export VAR=\"HelloAskUbuntu\"                                                  \n$ bash -c 'echo $VAR'                                                          \nHelloAskUbuntu\n$ \n\nExtra Reading\n\n\n*\n\n*What does “export” do in shell programming?\n\nA: I have read here and in other places in the web, spoke with a friend about this and decided that as a freshman (maybe more of an Ubuntu freshman then some here might think), I should map this command - I should make a map and thus learn it's whatabouts and whereabouts:\nPreliminary data\nIf for now you didn't understand something in this chapter - don't worry, it will get clearer as you will keep reading, but to understand this matter you do need to read on Environment variables (EVs), their values, and purpose. I will now try to explain the command in simple words and in a method of mapping, for newcomers like me, and only for newcomers. Tried to do my best here...\nMapping\nexport PATH=\"~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH\"\n\nThe original value of the EV \"PATH\" as it comes with Ubuntu 15.10, is:\n/usr/bin:/usr/sbin\n\nIn the command itself note we have two PATH phrases. The last one is $PATH - The $ says \"print the original value or values of the EV next to you\"; The EV next to it is the PATH EV.\nWe exported the path variable itself (made it available for sub processes as well, I.E processes that run in the CLI which are not actually the Bash shell, but run inside it (such as Drush, which is the Drupal CLI).\nBesides the export we also expanded it: The first PATH phrase (PATH=) used us to add an extra value (~/.composer/vendor/bin:) to the original value (represented by $PATH). \n\n\n*\n\n*The colon (:) in the end of the new value I mentioned in the above paragraph, uses to distinct the new value from the original one.\n\n*The \"\" are the area in which the value/s reside.\n\n*The ~ is the home folder.\n\nI hope that after this mapping I did, the command will be clearer to freshmen like myself. \n\nA: The export command makes variables available in subshells. That is, without it, the variable PATH would not be visible in subshells.\nPATH is mentioned twice:\n\n\n*\n\n*As variable the value is being assigned to, left of the = sign.\n\n*As variable name being replaced by its value right of the = sign. This makes the old value be part of the new value.\n\n\nA: export PATH=\"~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*the export is a buildin command of bash, means export variables to be envirement variable. (you could type help export to lean more\n(the charactors follow the command are parammeters, splited by space, so in this case, there only one parameter)\n\n*the PATH is the variable name, usually, predefined varibale by bash, be named in Uppercase.\n\n*the = means assign value to this variable.\n\n*all the string is the value of the varibale\n\n*the $PATH is a kind of funciton of bash, named variable expantion, bash will replace the value of the exist PATH in the parameter string, BEFORE send the string to export command\n\n*the : in a spcial char in PATH variable and understooded by all application that want to use this variable. it means seperator. so they will have a lot of directories in the PATH variable. \n", "Q: Where is src/make? I'm Confused. I need to run a program (see This previous question for details) and the instructions says \"you can typically use the Makefile.mpi or Makefile.serial files in src/MAKE by typing one of these lines (from the src dir):\"\nmake mpi\nmake serial\n\nBut I don't know where is src/MAKE.\n\nA: First download the source tarball, untar it and you'll find a bunch of directories including src. make should be inside this directory. You can cd into src and then execute make commands.\nSee the section 2.1 of the instructions for more details on unzipping tarballs, source directory structure etc.\n", "Q: Access phone data Yesterday my phone dropped, and it's still alive, well... sortoff.\nThe glass is shattered quite badly in one of the corners, making me unable to unlock my device.\nnow here is the question: how do I access the data on the phone?\nplease note that I CANNOT enter my device PIN to unlock it.\nthe data that is on there is quite important to me so I really want it back.\n\nA: If the device is in developer mode you can copy all your data over USB with 'adb pull'.\n\nA: You simply can´t,\nto use your phone, you need to have to unlock your phone to give access.\nHowever if you have your phone on dev. mode like eDeviser said, it is indeed possible.\nIt is also possible to use Jailbreak/Root.\nDont you have a SD card inside of it?\nYou can try to repair your phone, or else. if you have a computer with windows on it. you should look at this topic.\nHacking is also a way. but thats far more difficult than it has to be.\n", "Q: Unable to resolve DNS queries I have an Ubuntu 14.04 host and have a 15.10 server running in virtualbox.  This is all a fresh install that I completed 3 days ago.\nWhen I logged in last night to run \"apt-get update\", nothing resolved.\nI'm attempting to use my router as the DNS server server.  That's how I have the rest of my LAN setup.  I can resolve successfully from the host, but I cannot resolve anything from the guest.\n source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*\n\n # The loopback network interface\n auto lo\n iface lo inet loopback\n\n # The primary network interface\n auto enp0s3\n iface enp0s3 inet static\n    address 192.168.1.4\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    network 192.168.1.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.1\n    dns-namesevers 192.168.1.1\n\nI can ping my router.  If I change the dns-nameservers to 8.8.8.8 and restart networking, I still can't resolve google.com.  There's something on the box that's preventing DNS queries from resolving and I'm not sure what could cause it.  Thanks for the help.\n\nA: the same thing going on here I think it is something related to DNSMASQ  some times dns resolution never works ,some times it works slowly taking for each name about 3 seconds to resolv ,and sometimes it runs really fast as it should be . I'm running ubuntu 15.10 and yes I tried to change dns servers to my ISP,Goolge,and opendns nothing seems to be stable \nUPDATE: I think I found the solution \nSOLUTION\nThe problem seems to be related to the conflicting dnsmasq and resolvconf packages. Until 12.10, dnsmasq was used. From 13.04 onwards, Ubuntu seemed to switch to a dnsmasq/resolvconf hybrid, where you have installed the packages dnsmasq-base and resolvconf, but not dnsmasq itself.\nI can't say if it's a bug in the upgrade scripts for 13.04 or something else, because when upgrading (as in fresh installs) resolvconf is installed, dnsmasq-base is upgraded and dnsmasq is (correctly) uninstalled.\nThe catch is, the upgrade script fails to comment out the dns=dnsmasq line in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. So, even though the dnsmasq daemon is not present anymore on the system, /etc/resolv.conf still expects it to be.\nSO to fix the problem edit this file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf  and  comment this line : #dns=dnsmasq  \nhope this helps some one\n", "Q: Virtualbox windows guest taskbar always visible At work, I use Ubuntu Linux 14.04, and most of the software I use has a compatible/alternative on Linux, but some corporative software run only on Windows.

That is, any time it starts it must directly call sudo apt-get...\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: The actual command that launches Terminal is . . .gnome-terminal. There are actually many different Terminal Emulators. For instance, I am using sakura right now, a lot of people like Terminator , the classic one is xterm (which by the way also comes with Ubuntu and pretty much any Linux distro that has graphical environment). \nWhat you call \"shortcut\" in Windows world is an .lnk file. In Ubuntu world there is something similar, .desktop files. They are used for a lot more than just running some app - you can also use them to launch stuff on GUI login if you put those files into .config/autostart folder (notice the leading dot). The structure of those files is as follows :\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=**actual command goes here**\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nTerminal=false\n\nSo knowing that you could create  a file like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MY-CUSTOM-APP\nType=Application\nExec=gnome-terminal\nHidden=false\nNoDisplay=false\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/gnome/48x48/apps/terminal.png\n\nThe Icon field can be ignored sometimes, but if you want the shortcut to look pretty, give it a full path to the image.\nAlso, there exists a folder with all the .desktop files, the /usr/share/applications, and there is /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop. One could copy over such file to /home/user/Desktop/. Problem is, those files are owned by root user, so you have to do something along these lines:\ncp /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop /home/$USER/Desktop/Terminal.desktop\n\nchown $USER:USER /home/$USER/Desktop/Terminal.desktop\n\nchmod +x /home/$USER/Desktop/Terminal.desktop\n\n", "Q: Unable to access remotely (LAMP issue) I'm unable to access my home server remotely although it works fine in LAN.

I thought about giving new life to this machine with Linux.\nAt first I tried Elementary OS and directly installed it thinking it couldn't be performing worst than Windows, but I was wrong. The problem was clear: graphics card not being used properly. System speed was not unbareable, but the machine was generally unusable. A lot of sceen tearing, big problems in scrolling menus and browser pages, impossibility to watch video, sloppiness in moving and resizing windows.\nNow I'm trying Xubuntu and Lubuntu live from USB, and they are even better in general system speed, but graphics problems are still there. The system is always able to properly recognize and name my card, so I don't think it's using generic drivers, software rendering or something. And if I go into Additional Drivers it gives me no third party drivers to install, so I really don't know what to possibly do to get an enjoyable desktop experience on this machine.\nI find it really strange performance is THAT bad, I've always had excellent experiences with Linux on older hardware.\nUPDATE: I found out that old 12.6 fglrx drivers works on my card on 12.04.1 or previous versions. So I installed Xubuntu 12.04.1 and got fglrx to work, but I still have bad performance. According to fglrxinfo command proprietary drivers seem to be working, so I can't really see what's the problem. Maybe this is the least linux-friendly graphics card in graphics card history and there's nothing that I can do other than binning this machine. :|\n\nA: I would try actually installing the most recent Xubuntu or Lubuntu.  There have been some updates to the kernel for radeon graphics cards. Running from a USB on an older machine can cause it to run slow but once installed it might work better.  According the the wiki and this page your card is (mostly) fully supported on the open source driver.  As long as you aren't doing intensive 3D graphics you shouldn't have a problem.\n", "Q: Can one modify ubuntu and publish it as their own linux distro? Ubuntu is coming under open source  licence. Whether if one wish to make some change in kernel or any other change (let it be the gui appearence) and publish it as their  own linux distro is legal? \n\nA: There are plenty examples out there so yes (here is a list of 3rd party operating systems based on Ubuntu). But you are not allowed to use ...\n\n\n*\n\n*the name Ubuntu or use any name that looks like Ubuntu.\n\n*the Ubuntu and Canonical pictures/images/logos.\n\n*you also may not give the impression your release is in any way related to Ubuntu or Canonical. \"This release is based on Ubuntu 14.04\" is the closest you probably can get to using a reference to Ubuntu.\n\n\nSo creating your own release is more than just a change in a setting in a kernel you will need to do. \n\nA: Ubuntu may be open source, but it also takes into account a lot of different projects and contributors.  Making a change to it for your own personal use is typically not a problem at all; for example, I have mine set with a GDM visual manager instead of the default LightDM, and I have tweaked the startup code to make sure certain firewall scripts run every time I boot my computer.  (There's other little tweaks I've made, too.)\nThat said, changing things and then redistributing it as your own Linux distro is a different thing altogether.  Or even changing things and then redistributing it as Ubuntu.  Rinzwind's response is true for redistributing as your own Linux distro.  If you go to http://www.ubuntu.com/legal they have a whole bunch of the legal terms and policies stuff, including a section about contributing to the project.  If what you are doing falls more in line with contributing to the Ubuntu project than making a whole new distro, then I would look into what it takes to be an official contributor.\n", "Q: How to fix broken executable?

If you are running a 32 bit Ubuntu, download epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.6.2-1lsb3.2_i386.deb\nAnd if you are running 64 bit Ubuntu, download epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.6.2-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb\nThese files can be opened using the Ubuntu Software Center by double-clicking on them, or installed from the command line by the command\nsudo dpkg -i epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.6.2-1lsb3.2_amd64.deb\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 freezes a lot usually while playing any media through web I am using Ubuntu 15.10 and am facing system freeze quite frequently while playing any form of media through web (youtube/dailymotion/hotstar etc.).\nEach time this happens , I need to restart my machine using the Power ON/OFF Button.\nI have tried the solution provided in the link:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes?\nThis doesn't help either.\nI have thought about downgrading to ubuntu 15.04 but I have a few applications installed and am lazy enough to install all dependencies again.\nWas just hoping if someone might be able to help me out , i won't have to go through all that pain.\nThanks \nAnkur\n\nA: First thing to do, is check if Adobe Flash, is the latest version. Read through this question (and answers) for instructions on how to do that.\nHow to update Flash? (version numbers don't match)\n\nA: I had the same problem some days ago. Brand new desktop-pc running 15.10.\nIt freezes while playing media from YouTube and other web-sources, so first I blamed flash too. Strange to me was that on an old sub-notebook running exactly the same software, the errors do not occur. Further checks revealed that it crashes as well if the videos are HTML5. I suggest you to check this too.\nIn my case the problem was more a driver issue, similar to the stuff described here Bug-Report \nSince I found no correct Release I added another graphic card and now all is running fine.\nI hope this gives you a clue. The nasty part with the error in this area is that different problems seem to have similar symptoms. Good luck.\n", "Q: Ubuntu from torrent links Is the Ubuntu which will be downloaded from the torrent link (given on this website) the full version that comes pre-installed on some laptops or will I have to pay some money to get it activated or for its key?\n\nA: NEVER let someone trick you into paying to get an activation key or \"full version\" of Ubuntu.  I don't know for sure which link you are referring to, and as this is a community site, anyone could potentially give you any link.  You can get the official Ubuntu releases for your computer at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\nAs far as which version you want...  most computers that do come with it pre-installed come with either the 14.04.3 LTS or the 15.10 (in most cases).  Mine came with it pre-installed and had an option between 14.04 LTS or 14.10 (it was before 15.10).  15.10 is the newest, but the LTS stands for \"Long Term Support\" and offers a longer term of official security and maintenance updates.\nI hope that helped you figure out what you want!\n\nA: Ubuntu is completely free. There is no \"demo\" version or \"product key\". It's just free. The torrent links are the real deal, just make sure to use the download link from Ubuntu's own website.\n", "Q: nvidia on schenker laptop (again) sorry for bringing up this seemingly well known issue again.

After some running around to fix the audio, the last thing (that I can tell) doesn't work is the shortcut keys (volume and brightness are the only ones I really care about.)  I can however, change the volume and brightness in settings using a mouse. \nI believe (but am not certain,) that the shortcut keys are being recognized as f1-f12, but they don't seem to be in the correct order (off by one) and are not doing what you would expect.  \nFor instance, if I press the 'brighten' button, which by counting the buttons starting from the far left as f1, the brightness key would be associated with f8--when pressed I get a pop-up box that says, \"Pressing f7 turns caret browsing on or off...\" as apposed to actually making the screen brighter.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: On a laptop keyboard the very top left key is often esc. Followed by f1, f2, etc. \nAlso the labeled shorcuts on the keys may not be the same in Ubuntu vs ChromeOS. Unless they are hardware shortcuts ubuntu likely only sees them as f-keys.\nIt may be possible with the help of other software to remap those keys to the shortcuts you want.

I purchased a 2TB hard drive that was initially formated as ntfs and have been using it on my NAS for a while. I did a scan on it and found out it was a bit fragmented. I didn't want to waste time defragmenting it so I just formated the whole thing to EXT4 on my nas since all the other drives are EXT4 on it. I was wondering if it also fixes the need to defrag it.\n\nA: Yes. There is no need to defragment files on a drive without files. Simple questions don't require long answers.\n\nA: Fragmentation is when a file is divided into several pieces among the disk. It's not an issue with the drive itself, but in the data that lies there. Because the problem isn't in the disk but in the files, the fragmentation goes away when the files go away (which happens as you format to ext4). Fragmentation is also not an issue in ext4 until you run out of space on the drive as ext4 is capable of filling up the drive smarter than just starting at one end filling it up from there. It is a known issue with Windows that its file system is lagging behind the times.\n", "Q: Where do I submit a bug report for video scope on ubuntu phone?

However, since the company has a disk encryption policy I needed to reinstall Ubuntu with encryption enabled. However when trying to reinstall with encryption on the SSD (which contained the preinstalled OS) using the created Dell recovery image, the installation failed. I also tried with Ubuntu 14.04.3 Live-CD (on USB-stick) and ubiquity crashed. I have now reached the conclusion that it is due to my extra HDD (unformatted) located on /dev/sda.\nAfter a lot of headache and trial-and-error I happened to see that ubiquity crashed when trying to run \"grub-install /dev/sda\" (despite the fact that I had told it to install FDE on /dev/sdb). I know that I can choose /boot to be wherever I want (such as on the EFI partition on /dev/sdb) if I choose the advanced install. But, can I also in ubiquity's advanced install create the encrypted partitions (/, swap) so that it gets the same structure as if I would only have had one disk plugged in (i.e. the default for ubuntu installs with FDE)? If prepping the partitions manually in advance to installing is the only option then of course such answers are also more than welcome!\nThanks!\n\nAs per @oldfreds suggestion before focusing on the ubiquity bug I also have a pastebin of my boot info of the failed encrypted install from the Dell recovery iso.\n\nA: If installing Ubuntu in UEFI boot mode to a second drive, either internal or external as full install, you need to have drive seen as sda gpt partitioned with an ESP - efi system partition, FAT32 formatted with boot flag, 100 to 500MB. You also want an ESP on the drive you install Ubuntu, but it may not be used, during install. Best to copy ESP boot files back to install drive if sda drive ever fails/is removed or other issues. \nGrub seems to only want to install its UEFI boot files to an ESP on drive seen as sda. It may even say during install, installing to sdb, but will error out if no ESP on sda. Can be a bigger issue on a few systems where install flash drive is seen as sda.\nOnce you start using UEFI, best that all drives be gpt and every drive with an install has an ESP partition near beginning of drive. Since I also suggest an install on every drive, then every drive should have an ESP, even if just for future use.\nUpdate for removeable drives:\nTwo drive or any second, external or other drive than sda.\nNote that full install to any drive other than sda in UEFI mode has some issues. Grub only installs to the ESP - efi system partition on sda. And you then have to copy files to your install.\nAnd Ubuntu's UEFI grub only installs to the ESP on sda, or not the external drive and not to /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi. For my PC UEFI full install to a flash drive I manually copied /EFI/ubuntu on sda's ESP to flash drive's ESP. Then copied it again to /EFI/Boot and renamed shimx64.efi to bootx64.efi. I then updated fstab to have correct UUID for ESP on external drive.\nThe version of grub in a full install is hard coded to find the rest of grub in /EFI/ubuntu so both copies are required. There are ways to directly install grub as bootx64.efi, but then you have to manually maintain grub.cfg. \nAnd if you do not want UEFI entries on internal drive, after copying entries to external:\nHow do I remove \"Ubuntu\" in the bios boot menu?

Also,  reformat the hard drive, a quuck format will do,  this will help problems from occurring later. \nBUT FIRST,  BEFORE DOING ANYTHING at all, get a good USP and connect both the monitor and the server  itself to it.

It runs in XP and up.  I have installed it under Wine 1.7 but components of the application do not run.  Research shows it relies on .NET 2.0.

I think that it should show an empty root directory instead of a Forbidden message.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: \nWhy I have to remove FollowSymLinks when I use -Indexes? If I do not do that an error appears when I try to restart Apache.\n\nTake a look at the error I get when I do this:\n* The apache2 configtest failed.\nOutput of config test was:\nAH00526: Syntax error on line 165 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:\nEither all Options must start with + or -, or no Option may.\nAction 'configtest' failed.\nThe Apache error log may have more information.\n\nApache is simply complaining that each Options line may only have + options or - options, not both.\nIf you want to use both, you have to split them across two lines, like this:\nOptions FollowSymLinks\nOptions -Indexes\n\nAs to why this is, it's just probably easier to parse each line by itself. It's just how it's designed.\n\n\nIs it normal that a Forbidden message appear? I think that it should show an empty root directory instead of a Forbidden message.\n\nIt's important to note that +Indexes only takes effect if there's no DirectoryIndex declaration. During this time, it'll display a list of files (sorta like this) as opposed to your index.html or whatever. By using -Indexes, you're telling Apache to display a Forbidden error if no DirectoryIndex is found (or, it's not set and no index.html is found).\n", "Q: Created a Bootable USB Drive to Install Ubuntu.. What next? I created a bootable Ubuntu USB drive (no CD drive on ultrabook) on Windows so I can install the OS.

Google has yielded no results and I really want to get this up and running as soon as possible. \nHow do I install the OS from grub?\n\nA: This definitely shouldn't happen. You should get a beautiful menu to select if you either want to install Ubuntu or test it. But anyway, we can do it through the grub menu.

These all have some version of a a particular extension that was installed under their user account during  account setup (various versions depending on when the account was created for the user). Poor way to manage I know, but it's an old system that I was handed as is.\nI am in the process of trying to update the extension globally. I have a version installed under my profile, I copied out the extension's correctly named folder (friendly name not the ID string) and moved it to the location described below. There is also an XML config file that goes along with the extension that I separately figured out how to copy to all users Firefox profiles. \nGlobal addon install - \"If you want to install an extension automatically to all users in your system you need to extract it, rename the folder that contains the addon to the addon's id string and copy it to the firefox global extensions folder /usr/share/mozilla/extensions/{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}/, anything that you use there will be called up automatic when a user opens firefox.\"\nOutcome for new users - Created a new test user, logged in, and the extension is there / functioning. XML is there so all the configs are present. All good!\nOutcome for existing users - No errors or anything but the older version of the app is still present. I see no mention of the new version of the app that was placed in the global extensions folder. The XML is there and the old version of the addon does see it - so I am good there. Is there a way I can only make firefox recognize addons installed from the global location? I think because the same extension is installed under their user profile, it is taking precedence. I could be wrong though. I am new to Ubuntu administration. \n\nA: Depending on how many users you have you could potentially do this with\nsudo rm -rf /home/*/.mozilla/firefox/profiles/*.default/extensi‌​ons/{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}*\n\nIf you have lots of matches for the first glob this won't work; this will also fail if your user's home directories are not in a typical place.  In that case you could iterate over each user. If you go through the trouble of iterating over each user you can also make the command safer by executing your cleanup by the user using sudo.  Something like \ncat list_of_users| xargs -I% sudo -Hu % sh -c 'rm -rf ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles/*.default/extensi‌​ons/{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}*'\n\nAlternatively you could integrate some logic into your global profile I suggest testing the manifest in the home directory to see if it is older than the global and removing the extension.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu with windows 10?

Or does it strictly work with steam?\n\nA: The steam controller works as a generic mouse until you start Steam and open big picture. I have had trouble with the mouse function over wireless when Steam isn't launched, but most of that really doesn't matter. Steam allows you to set shortcuts from inside the program. If your emulators have desktop launchers, or you are willing to create a desktop launcher for them, then you can also open them as non-steam games, which will allow you to set custom controller bindings on a per-game basis from the steam overlay.\nSo the answer is yes and no.\nMy recommendation is that you try setting your games as steam shortcuts, and then try and set controller bindings to either gamepad outputs, or keyboard and mouse outputs.\nThe steam controller, in my opinion, is great because of this- while you need the steam overlay, it really can emulate a keyboard and mouse, and do so much more than a traditional gamepad.\n", "Q: Kernel problems on Asus E403S I have ubuntu 15.10 on Asus E403S with this xinput,\n    (20:19:49)──> xinput                                     1 ↵ ──(ke,tammi13)─┘\n    ⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n    ⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n    ⎜   ↳ ELAN1000:00 04F3:0401                     id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n    ⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n        ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n        ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n        ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n        ↳ Sleep Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n        ↳ USB2.0 VGA UVC WebCam                     id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n        ↳ Asus WMI hotkeys                          id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n        ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard   \n\nAnd linux-image (uname -r)\n    4.2.0-23-generic\n\nProblem is two finger scrolling is not working and the hibernate option is dimmed out thus i cannot choose that option.\nAfter upgrading to kernel 4.3* and even 4.4*, two finger scrolling is working but new problems,\n\n\n*\n\n*the mouse freeze at any moment and i have to hard boot the computer\n\n*Reboot is not completing, that is it plays the playmouth and then gets stuck in a blank screen and never reboots\n\n\nAny solution to this?\nThanks.\n\nA: Like mentioned on comments, disabling Bluetooth and adding this\nblacklist dw_dmac\nblacklist dw_dmac_core\n\nto\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nsolved all the issues for me.

I have a Lenovo laptop with Windows 10 on it. Is it possible to install any version of Ubuntu alongside Windows 10?\n\nA: Answering this question can be a bit longer. Based on what you are trying to achieve. You can Install Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine using built in *Hyper-V* (If you have a PRO Edition of Win) Windows Feature, VMWare Player (Free) or Oracle Virtual Box hypervisors. Again it depends on your goal.\nAlso you can install the Ubuntu as a native OS as well, if you are looking for a Dual Boot System. Downside will be ,since Ubuntu install its own bootloader in the system partition, if in case you want to get rid of it in future the you will have to Re-install the Entire OS (windows) after formatting the Drive. \nPersonally, I will recommend to have Ubuntu installed on the different HDD than the same windows have.

How do I use efuse? I have never dual booted Ubuntu\nThis is a new laptop with only one program installed. \n\nA: I'm not familiar with efuse.  However, you can typically install Windows after Ubuntu by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your current Ubuntu installation.  Unless there isn't anything on there you would be sad to lose, you should do a backup.\n\n*Get an Ubuntu Installation CD or Live Boot USB. (You'll need this because Windows will erase grub, the Ubuntu boot-loader). \n\n*Use a partition editing utility to make a partition for Windows to use.  I like gparted, it is an easy to use partition editing utility with a graphical user interface.  \n\n*Shutdown Ubuntu, reboot using your Windows Installation Media, and then install it onto your newly created partition.\n\n*Shutdown Windows, reboot again, this time using your Ubuntu installation media, but don't install Ubuntu; instead select the option to try Ubuntu before installing.

This as a backup that I would later try to resize and shrink down.\n\nBelow is a photo of a working clone of the operating system, which is now about 41 gigs in size total after being resized with Gparted.\n\nI have tried to clone these partitions to my 64GB USB disk as a working portable backup, but have ran into some issues.\nI have tried using:\nsudo -s\ndd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc & pid=$!\nwhile kill -USR1 $pid; do sleep 1; done\n\nThis bit for bit cloning method tried to copy the unallocated space on the input drive, which obviously won't work because the output disk is much smaller.\nIn a second attempt I was able create a partition table on the destination disk that matched the source's sizes. I then tried to use boot repair and got this output\nMoving onto to Clonezilla options; normally a disk to disk would be my choice, but since the destination drive is smaller than the source, Clonezilla will not allow this.\nI do see an option to copy ONE partition at a time using the disk to disk option, but do not see how I might clone all three at once. I know there is an option to do this with saving as image but I want the USB to be bootable.\nOne way I can think of making this work would be to make an image of the partitions I want to clone using disk to image, then restoring the image to the 64GB USB disk later, but after trying this I ran into more errors.\nAfter making an image of /dev/sdb/ I attempted to restore the file but got this error about /dev/sdb2/ missing:\n\n(/dev/sdb is the target for this session)\nSo perhaps my image was OK, but it didn't properly read /dev/sdb2/ so I checked it with Gparted again and saw this following here:\n\nI checked with Synaptic Package Manager to see, and I already have e2fsprogs v1.42.9-3 installed.

I am assuming now that during the device to image process in Clonezilla that my /dev/sd2/ was not read properly, as I can not even access this partition in Nautilus or Gparted.

(essentially you make the same size partitions on the destination drive before cloning). I used Gparted for this. \nThe method of cloning was to plug in an external drive that had working clone of my original install and copy that using:\nsudo -s \ndd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1 & pid=$! \nwhile kill -USR1 $pid; do sleep 1; done\ndd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sdb2 & pid=$! \nwhile kill -USR1 $pid; do sleep 1; done\n(this will give you the output as the data is copied)\nNext was to reinstall GRUB which would also need to be configured, so I booted up in BOOT-Repair LIVE to fix GRUB. I selected ADVANCED mode to reinstall GRUB and purge the old one. \nSee also my thread HERE\nSo with the help of many wise Ubuntu gurus I was able to acomplish cloning onto a smaller drive.

Now go to settings:\nNow select Displays:[\nYou should see a screen like this:\nOne of the problems that I faced when I first set this up was that resolution becomes much bigger on the original monitor.

Especially if you're a noob - since trying to use other distributions packages may not be an easy way to go.\nOther than that - the unknown host would point at dns issues I guess, probably related to your virtual guest configuration.\nFailed dependencies - well, that's where your troubles start. It's not redhat, so it complains about unsatisfied dependency.\nI doubt you'll be able to do anything that way with your repo. You can force installing the package, but I'd say there will be not much advantage from doing that.\nIf you really need epel for some reason, maybe you should rather start using Fedora or CentOS?\n\nA: The command\nsudo rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm\n\nadds a RPM repository on RPM based distributions.

It\n     assembles a list of one or more fingerprints (as described below) and\n     tries to log in with each key, to see if any of them are already\n     installed (of course, if you are not using ssh-agent(1) this may result\n     in you being repeatedly prompted for pass-phrases).  It then assembles a\n     list of those that failed to log in, and using ssh, enables logins with\n     those keys on the remote server.  By default it adds the keys by\n     appending them to the remote user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (creating the\n     file, and directory, if necessary).  \n\nYour unwillingness to set up passwordless SSH logins could be addressed by using an alternate SSH key (on the originating system) and only ssh-adding that key when  you want to login to the remote system.\n", "Q: how to detect the usb stick in Ubuntu installed in virtual box I have installed Ubuntu 14.04.3 on VirtualBox in Windows 7. How can I detect the USB flash disk in Ubuntu.\n\nA: You need to set a filter for it, and then unplug it and plug it in again.

The computer is a ThinkCentre M55e (type 9637) that i received from a school as they where going to throw them out. I don't know the version of Ubuntu or much about the program itself, so some help would be much appreciated. I assume the lack of ability was to stop children from playing around on the desktop.  \n\nA: As you said, this is a Linux machine which has been set up to allow users to surf the Internet and nothing else.  Trying to find a way to disable this settings would take much, much more time than reinstalling the whole system, so I recommend the latter.  Plus, you'll be free to have any Linux distro on your computer (not just that Ubuntu which is probably outdated).  \n\nA: There are probably several ways to get rid of the kiosk mode (fullscreen browser and nothing else), depending on how it was set-up. But none of those are easy to explain here and easy to do for an absolute beginner (e.g., trying ctrl+alt+f1 to go to TTY and fix via terminal).\nReinstalling will be the easiest way and you'll also get a clean system.\nThere are plenty of good tutorials on how to install Ubuntu, which is really rather simple. Here is a good one with pictures: http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-Linux\nAnd here at \"How to install Ubuntu 14.04\"\nYou seem to be stuck at Step 3 of the wikihow article. If your PC doesn't boot from the Live CD/USB Stick, you have to tell the BIOS/UEFI a different boot order. It's probably set-up to just pick the harddisk first. What key to press depends on your system, but there is often a message like \"To interrupt normal boot press F1\". Some systems have button for the Config menu and another one just for a quick boot order selection. F1, F2, Del etc. are often the keys. Just look closely at the first few screens after power-up and reset your PC if you miss it. Good luck ;)\n(NB: if you google for the exact model you have, you'll probably find a guide how-to change boot sequence as well)\n", "Q: How do you install the Android SDK in Eclipse Mars? I have installed Eclipse Mars on Ubuntu (14.04 LTS 64-bit), and now want to use the Android SDK on it. How can I achieve this?\nAdditional information: I have also installed Android Studio, and therefore the SDK. \n\nA: Using Eclipse IDE as a DEV platform for Android used to be \"mainstream\" in Android development. To do that - you had to install the sdk and add-on.\nAndroid Studio has replaced the Eclipse+SDK configuration as the standard development platform, and it is the development kit itself.\nSo - no need to use both. If you're new to android, I'd say go with the Android Studio - it's prone to be supported officially from now on.\nIf you have worked with Eclipse before - you can find more information here:\nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/migrate.html\nIf you want to work with Eclipse still - you need to download the ADT from the Eclipse store: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/android-development-tools-eclipse, and the usage is similar to previous versions (set the SDK in settins, etc.)\n", "Q: What happens when I use \"nmap google.com\" command? Hi I have used ping command to check a host, I came to know that nmap can also be used. what this command is actually used for? what it does in background? Can anyone please explain.\n\nA: This tool should be accessible only to trusted users and should be used only by competent staff, for maintenance and security testing.\nThe nMap security scanner sends a combination of packets (not only ICMP pings) to discover, identify, fingerprint and deeply analyze any remote host. It discovers open/firewalled/redirected ports, identifies the type of system and (eventual) IDS, gives a unique fingerprint to track the host and shows the type of remote services, all with fallback automation.\nThe scanner can also do script scanning to create reports of possible vulnerabilities and can also exploit remote vulnerabilities, specially if executed with root privileges (raw socket support).\nScanning a remote host without permission is illegal, because an uncontrolled scan can trigger remote server daemons (like knockd), IDS events and even cause a Denial of Service.\nBefore starting nmap read the man page and the online reference; use only your hosts as a target if you are learning and remember that it can rapidly saturate the bandwidth, so execute it only on private networks.\n\nIf my answer is useful, please mark it as accepted and click on the left up arrow. If you have more related questions, feel free to comment under here.\nHave a nice day!\n\nA: NMAP is a security scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network which features host discovery, port scanning, version, OS identification and detection.\nWhy is it used?\nEspecially for auditing the security of a specific device or the entire network, by scanning ports, finding possible vulnerabilities, network mapping.\nThe reports created by the program can be stored in valid XML format, so it can be processed conveniently later. \nWhat does it do?\n\"Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.\"\nReference\nHow exactly?\nPlease refer to the NMAP source code for understanding.\nThanks\n", "Q: Dual boot and mounting windows partition problems i am new to ubuntu, i am installing LXLE 14.04.03 (64bit) on a Lenovo G50-30 preinstalled windows 8.1 updated to Win10 Home.\nI carried out the install with Secure boot disabled and Bios/uefi optimised for other OS.\nThe multiboot options will only allow ubuntu to run, it declares windows to have boot problems. The ubuntu file system has mounted the wrong partition as windows, so i cannot see windows files. I believe some of this problem is because it is installed as Legacy OS.\nQuestion: To boot installation media (DVD but same for USB?)i have no option but to set BIOS to load legacy first, only way it doesn't load windows, so how could i install in UEFI mode as is reccommended in posts i have read?\nI have read scores of posts here and think i could unmount the empty hda5 partition and mount windows as hda4 in etc/fstab\nBut i think i need to edit grub to get windows to load from multiboot screen?\nIs this correct?\nEasier to reinstall? but only if i can correctly identify the partitions.\nI went with alongside windows but perhaps now that partitions have been made i could try to go with \"something else\" but scared of losing Windows.\nI can run Windows by loading UEFI first in BIOS.\nDisk manager shows partition order but i have a 1mb partition (created as its legacy/BIOS installation i understand) it is marked as Primary, not sure if i should count that when calculating hda? number.\nIf i understand correctly i just need to allocate partitions for the OS & Swap drive if i try \"something else\" option? Is the swap drive likely to be the 3.89 gb partition just before Ubuntu partition or there is a 13.19 GB \"recovery partition\" which has been created at the end (last) of the drive.\nThanks for any help sorry for long post  Tony.?\n\nA: I'm left guessing at some critical details you haven't provided. As I understand it, your Windows is installed in EFI mode, and presumably you've installed Ubuntu in BIOS mode. If so, this was a mistake; it's almost always best to install all your OSes in the same boot mode. In the case of an EFI-based computer with the first OS installed in EFI mode, it's almost always best to leave the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy boot support\") disabled. See this page of mine for more on why this is the case.\nGiven your situation, re-installing Ubuntu is one reasonable course of action. Re-installing is overkill, but since you presumably haven't yet customized it much or created many files in Ubuntu, it's a fairly simple way to do it. Be sure to disable the CSM first, which should get the installer to boot in EFI mode. (If you have problems booting the installer with the CSM disabled, chances are you prepared the boot medium incorrectly. The page I just referenced covers this in more detail.)\nAnother option is to install an EFI-mode boot loader for Linux. There are many ways to do this, but the two that are likely to be easiest are:\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB/Boot Repair -- The Boot Repair program can automatically install and updated version of GRUB 2. In your case, you'd need to boot from an Ubuntu emergency disk (like your installer), but it must be booted in EFI mode to install the EFI version of the program. Also, although this tool usually works, there are occasions when it doesn't, so it's a bit of a \"leap of faith\" to use this approach.\n\n*rEFInd -- My rEFInd boot manager can be installed in Windows; or you can try it by using the USB flash drive or CD-R image to be sure it works, then boot to Ubuntu and install the PPA or Debian package. You may need to disable Secure Boot, though, at least at first. (You can re-enable it later.) If you install rEFInd in Windows, be sure to also install the EFI driver for the filesystem on which your kernel resides (probably ext4fs).\n\n", "Q: Can I add members of a group to another group automatically? Is there a way to ensure that when a user is added to a permissions group on a system, that user is automatically added to one or more other defined groups?\nFor example adding a user to a group created as netadmin would add the user to the groups www-data, tomcat, sambashare and ftp. (This is only a hypothetical situation)\nAnother example group of vmadmin could add a user to the groups, kvm, libvirt and vboxusers.\nI know that a group cannot be added to a group, but would like to avoid having to set up and maintain ACLs for different directories and files.\n\nA: I don't think there's a built-in way to do that.\nHowever there's a pretty easy solution: you could add a function to ~/.bashrc to wrap the whole task into a single command.\nListing the sets of groups in a case statement (ok for a few sets of groups)\nfunction add_user {\n    [ ! -z \"$1\" -a ! -z \"$2\" ] || return\n    case \"$1\" in\n    netadmin)\n        groups=(netadmin www-data tomcat sambashare ftp)\n        ;;\n    vmadmin)\n        groups=(kvm libvirt vboxusers)\n        ;;\n    *)\n        printf \"Group '%s' is not listed.\\n\" \"$1\"\n        return\n    esac\n    printf \"Adding '%s' to group '%s'...\\n\" \"$2\" \"$1\"\n    usermod -aG ${groups[@]} \"$1\"\n}\n\nAfter that running e.g. add_user netadmin user will add user to netadmin, www-data, tomcat, sambashare and ftp, and running e.g. add_user vmadmin user will add user to kvm, libvirt and vboxusers.\nAdding other sets of groups would be as easy as adding other entries to the case statement after the vmadmin entry and before the * entry:\nfoo)\n    groups=(bar foobar raboof)\n    ;;\n\nListing the sets of groups in an external configuration file\nCreate a file named config in ~/ whith the following content:\nnetadmin,netadmin,www-data,tomcat,sambashare,ftp\nvmadmin,kvm,libvirt,vboxusers\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The first field identifies the name of the set of groups\n\n*The fields after the first identify the groups to which the user is to add\n\n\nfunction add_user {\n    [ ! -z \"$1\" -a ! -z \"$2\" ] || exit\n    groups=( $(awk -F , -v group=\"$1\" '$1==group {$1=\"\"; print; exit}' config) )\n    if [ ${#groups} -eq 0 ]; then\n        printf \"Group '%s' is not listed.\\n\" \"$1\"\n        return\n    fi\n    printf \"Adding '%s' to group '%s'...\\n\" \"$2\" \"$1\"\n    usermod -aG ${groups[@]} \"$1\"\n}\n\nAfter that running e.g. add_user netadmin user will add user to netadmin, www-data, tomcat, sambashare and ftp, and running e.g. add_user vmadmin user will add user to kvm, libvirt and vboxusers.\nAdding other sets of groups would be as easy as adding another entry to ~/config:\nfoo,bar,foobar,raboof\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu : Disable access to file-manager, keyboard,mouse(Touch screen available) for guest account I am looking to configure Ubuntu(Any version, new installation) for presentation in which I would like to do the following things :\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic guest-login at startup.\n\n*Completely disable keyboard,mouse, USB ports, there is a touch-screen available which the user can use.\n\n*Disable TTY access i.e ctrl+alt+F2,F3, and so on.\n\n*No access to file-system via nautilus. \n\n\nI can just purge nautilus simply to complete the 4th point, if there is any other decent approach, kindly let me know.\nSuggestions for any points or more security are always welcome.

But keep in mind, that if you disable that, it could lead to problems if the X-Server is not starting.\n\n*I think that is not needed because the guest has no right to see other files than its. But even if you disable nautilus or something else for the guest user, s/he can always use the terminal to navigate through the files.

The command is:\n$ hamster start <activity name>\nso I want to press the hotkey ( Super+H ) and then want to be prompted for activity name. Then the text I will enter will be used in the command\n$ hamster start <my entered text>\nThanks a lot.\n\nA: Would something like \nhamster start \"$(zenity --entry)\"\n\nwork for you?\n\nA: If you are trying to get a script that will prompt you for the activity name you can use the following code\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Please enter the activity name\"\nread activity\n\nhamster start $activity\n\nwhen you run the script, you will be prompted with the message \"Please enter the activity name\". once you type your activity name and press enter, it will run hamster start activity. you can place this script in /usr/local/bin for easy access. Basically if you name it \"myscript\" and place it in that folder, you can run the script just by running myscript. remember to make it an executable first.\n\nA: In case someone is using hamster and will find this feature handy this is my current working code:\n#!/bin/bash\nfile=/usr/local/bin/hamster-log\nlast=$(<$file)\nactivity=$(zenity --entry --title \"Enter new activity name\" --text \"New activity name:\" --entry-text \"$last\")\nhamster start \"$activity\"\nif [ ! -z \"$activity\" ]; then\n    if [ -f \"$file\" ]; then\n        echo \"$activity\" > \"$file\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nIt is placed in /usr/local/bin/ folder. And in the same folder is file hamster-log with permissions 777. I am using Shortcut Super+H and to run this script and Super+Shift+H to stop the activity (command hamster stop). When I will have more time I will keep working on this and updating the code.

And let the default setting intact.\nI noticed that I still be able to access internet using web browser, so I tested the firewall with transmission.\nTransmission reported the port was closed. Then I allowed the port, and transmission reported it was opened.\nThis make me confused.\nWhy I still can surf the web when the default setting of firewall denies all incoming traffic of every port?\nAre there other places for setting?\nThanks.\n\nA: Your web browser initiate outgoing connection. Ufw by default is blocking incoming connection. If you want block all web browser traffic you could add this rule:  \nsudo ufw deny out http  \nsudo ufw deny out https\n\nOr you can change default policy to deny outgoing :\nsudo ufw default deny outgoing  \n\nNow all your outgoing traffic will be blocked, until you allow something by the rule\n", "Q: Using 2 ethernet adapters on a local network, ping reply not showing I have a laptop running with Ubuntu 15.10. Here there is one integrated Network adapter to which I added another one via USB. I now have two network interfaces which both show when I type ifconfig.\nNext I configured them both with a static IP:\neno0 -> 192.168.0.21 (onboard nic)\neno1 -> 192.168.0.22 (USB-nic)\nBoth adapters are directly to a different destination pc with an Ethernet cable:\n192.168.0.21 -> 192.168.0.1 (destination PC 1)\n192.168.0.22 -> 192.168.0.2 (destination PC 2)\nNext I have a Python script to send UDP packets from the laptop to the destination PC:\nimport socket\nimport time\n#create socket\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\nsock.bind(\"192.168.0.21\", 2000)\nsock.sendto(\"test\", (\"192.168.0.1\", 2000))\n\nThis works if only one adapter is connected. When both adapters are connected this will only work for the interface that connected first.\nI then tried to send a ping via the interface not working. Lets say interface eno0 is working and can succesfully send UDP packets via the Python script, then this will not work:\nping -I eno1 192.168.0.2\n\nIt show that the packets leave the pc, and via Wireshark I can see them leaving the nic, I can even see the destination PC sending a reply but in the termnial it does not show and when aborting with ctrl+c I see that 5 packets have been send and all of them got lost.\nPinging via eno0 works perfectly fine to the destination pc.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: I think it works as it is supposed to. I believe you have problems with the routing table.\nWhen you connect the first adapter the default routing is set up through this adapter. When you connect another one, the default routing is already setup for the first adapter. The second adapter does not work because there is no routing that would use it. Try to type /sbin/route of /sbin/route -n. You will see how the packets are routed.\nI would add routes for your two connections, because if I understand correctly you only want to send your UDP packets via these connections. What about other traffic? Try it this way:\n/sbin/route add -net 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.255 dev eno0\n/sbin/route add -net 192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.255 dev eno1\n\nIn that way you specify that traffic for 192.168.0.1 should go via eno0 and traffic for 192.168.0.2 via eno2. If you only need these to connections it should work. However, if you have other connection and want them to work too. You would need to make sure other routes are correct too.\nI would recommend to use different address ranges for two connections. In that way you don't need to change routing tables manually:\neno0: 192.168.0.21, PC1: 192.168.0.1\neno1: 192.168.1.22, PC2: 192.168.1.2\nnetmask: 255.255.255.0 for all connections\ndefault gateway is not important in this case, because pairs are on the same network range\n\n", "Q: .htaccess is not working on ubuntu I want to give \nForbidden\nYou don't have permission to access /draft/ on this server.\n\nso added .htaccess to folder with \nOptions -Indexes\nBut it's not working on ubuntu server and displaying folder files.

directories to destination directory I have directory structure:\n~/MYDIR/\n  /DESTINATIONDIR/\n  /DIR1/\n  /DIR2/\n  /file1\n  /file2\n\nI need to move DIR1, DIR2,file1,file2 to DESTINATIONDIR \nWhat is most elegant and optimal way to do this from terminal?\nUPD: asume that we have much more files and dirs with different names\n\nA: There are three ways I'd consider doing this.\nHacky and error-fuelled, \"MOVE ALL THE THINGS\"\nmv ~/MYDIR/* ~/MYDIR/DESTINATIONDIR\n\nThis will try to move the destination into itself and will explode:\nmv: cannot move ‘~/MYDIR/DESTINATIONDIR’ to a subdirectory of itself, ‘~/MYDIR/DESTINATIONDIR/DESTINATIONDIR’\n\nBut it will move [almost] everything else. So it works but it's a bit of a mess. If you need to match hidden files, run shopt -s dotglob beforehand and it'll work.\nMoving a list of files manually\nGiven the short list of things, we can quite easily just list them out with a little bash expansion:\n mv ~/MYDIR/{DIR{1,2},file{1,2}} ~/MYDIR/DESTINATIONDIR\n\nIf you  need hidden files with this method, just include them in the list.\nIf this list is coming from something else (eg find) it can be tough to ensure the destination is the last argument. You can move the destination to the front with the -t argument. This is a horrible example but highlights when you need it:\nfind ~/MYDIR/ -maxdepth 1 ! -name DESTINATIONDIR -exec mv -t ~/MYDIR/DESTINATIONDIR {} +\n\nInverse globbing with shopt, elegance defined.\nSo let's strike the balance between manually listing and wildcards. By turning on the extended globbing features in Bash, we can select [almost] everything but the destination directory.\nshopt -s extglob\nmv ~/MYDIR/!(DESTINATIONDIR) ~/MYDIR/DESTINATIONDIR\n\nIf you need to match hidden files, run shopt -s dotglob beforehand and it'll work.\n\nA: what about:\ncd ~/MYDIR\nmv DIR* file* DESTINATIONDIR\n\n", "Q: Physical disk for virtual machine Is it possible to have a Virtual Machine AND a Dual Boot Windows OS alongside Ubuntu? \nCurrently, I'm in Ubuntu. I prefer it over Windows, but unfortunately, I need to use Windows from time to time. Is it possible to install Windows on a physical disk, and then have the option to either boot into it during startup or just connect in Ubuntu, either via remote control or virtualization?\n\nA: You can have a dualboot system, and run the Windows partition in a VM, consult this thread.\nYou may not use remote control (RDP/VNC) without somehow booting the Windows partition in a VM, so the remote control is kind of superflous.\n", "Q: Are the field names localized in the file /var/lib/dpkg/status?

I set up a Private directory following this doc, and then i saw a ~/Private dir with some readme files into it. I changed the permissions in order to be able to create files there, and i moved some files to the directory.\nUpon restart, the directory is mounted, but empty. What is going on?\nI am using Ubuntu 15.04\n\nA: This was all a collection of oddities, anyway, i have got my files back, and here is how i did.\nGetting hold of mounting/unmounting\nFor a bug that i think was fixed in newer versions, ecryptfs-umount-private did not work while i was sitting in my home folder. It was spitting the following:\nSessions still open, not unmounting\n\nAnd doing nothing. Changing directory away from home, to / for instance, allowed me to unmount successfully.\nPlaying a bit\nI created a test file in the now empty private folder, and i restarted the system. I could see the file after restart. Then i unmounted the partition, and at this point i was able to see the original README file from Ubuntu along with my files which seemed initially disappeared\nExplanation\nSo, what happened? I put the files in the Private folder too early! Maybe i had to restart the system before. I was thinking to be putting my files in the encrypted folder, while on the other hand i was putting them in the placeholder folder which was going to be masked by the encrypted one, once mounted. The fact that the command for unmounting was failing brought more confusion, but all is well what ends well!\n", "Q: How to Change DNS of network from Terminal?

I know there are tons of UI based tools for this, but my server is headless.\n\nA: I was able to find beets, which is pretty much exactly what I could have hoped for. It's a command line tool , written in Python, that will tag, sort, and clean up music libraries for you. the plugin possibilities are also pretty good.\n\nA: You could use the exiftool to read the ID3 tags from your music files.

At least as long as the free() call isn't blocked.\nAny thoughts? \n\nA: When a process calls free() it does not return the memory immediately back to system, instead it returns it back to the heap owned by that process.  The heap either uses anonymous memory mapping for large chunks or sbrk() to shrink or grow the heap.   Memory from the heap is returned back to the system when it is unmap'd or the heap shrinks with sbrk().  At this point pages can be re-used by other processes and when they are re-used they are always zero'd before the process can access it. [1]\nmemory allocations such as malloc don't zero memory when it is free'd back to the heap because of performance issues. Normally, the best practice for sensitive data is to be zero'd before it free'ing it.  However, I guess you want to enforce this police for all memory being free'd during a processes' life time.  glibc 2.4 and upwards has a MALLOC_PERTURB_ environment option that when set to non-zero value will initialize the memory to the compliment of the value when the memory is allocated and when it is released with free().  The downside to this is that it may trigger bugs in code that erroneously rely on the memory to be normally initialized to zero on allocation.\nTo use MALLOC_PERTURB_, e.g. to set it to a random value..\nexport MALLOC_PERTURB_=$(($RANDOM % 255 + 1))\n\nand run your code.\n[1] Well almost. mmap() using MAP_UNINITIALIZED and a kernel configured with CONFIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED allows non-zeroing of memory, but this is never allowed on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Default environment for screen is /bin/sh when it should be /bin/bash? I'm trying to invoke a program to run on startup in /etc/rc.local which runs two commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a detatched screen using screen -dmS name \n\n*Send a command to that screen using screen -S name -X stuff command\nHowever the command relies on environmental variablesbeing set. I've set these EXPORT commands in both the root .profile and the root .pam_environment file. For reference they are:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/usr/local/cuda-7.0/lib64\nHowever the started screen cannot see these variables and errors out with error while loading shared libraries: libcudart.so.7.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory - which is what I'd expect if these variables weren't set. \nThe trouble is I can't figure out why they're not set. My best guess is that, for some reason, the screen is using /bin/sh (which is what it reports if I echo $0, whereas the root's default shell is /bin/bash\nThe weirder thing is that this only happens for a screen instantiated like this at boot. If I use the same command to start a detached screen it all works correctly (and uses /bin/bash) with no problems with environmental variables. \nAny idea what is causing this and how to fix? I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. \n\nA: Maybe your $SHELL is not set or set to /bin/sh? Or you have a shell set to /bin/sh in your .screenrc file?\nSee screen's documentation:\n\n-s program\n\n\nsets the default shell to the program specified, instead  of  the  value  in  the\n                environment  variable  $SHELL  (or  /bin/sh  if not defined).  This can also be\n                defined through the shell .screenrc command.  See also there.\n\n\nAnd there:\n\nshell command\n\nSet the command to be used to create a new shell.  This overrides  the  value  of  the\n           environment variable $SHELL.  This is useful if you'd like to run a tty-enhancer which\n           is expecting to execute the program specified in $SHELL.  If the command begins with a\n           - character, the shell will be started as a login-shell. Typical shells do only minimal initialization when not started as a login-shell.  E.g. Bash will not  read  your\n           ~/.bashrc unless it is a login-shell.\n\n\n\ni.e. adding the following line to .screenrc in your home folder should set the default shell of screen to bash\nshell /bin/bash\n\n", "Q: How to make group owner of /var/www/html/* I am stuck at trying to change the owner of directory /var/www/html/* from user to group.\nI want to make the group developers to be the owner of that directory and all sub-directories.

Canon advertise the (latest) driver as for 12.04 on their website.  It works fine in 12.04 but as described above in 16.04 (as well as colours being far too dark).\nNote: This is after installing the third party driver referenced at Canon Printer Driver & ScanGear MP For Ubuntu 14.04 which presumably is expected to work for 14.04.\nWorkaround?  Install 12.04 on a separate partition and print from that rather than from Windows.  The 12.04 can see the other partition so you can get at your files without duplication.  Inconvenient but it works.\nThere may be other ways forward.\n\nA: We had the exact same problem on Linux Mint 18.3 recently (two-sided printing not aligned properly on one side).

You will have to install Ubuntu on its own partition. Instructions here:\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\nA: Probably, you use Windows in UEFI mode. If your Windows is installed in UEFI mode (=default mode for Windows 10), Microsoft has blocked the loading of non-UEFI or non-Windows bootloader from Windows boot menu. Same issue with tools like EasyBCD. See here. This means the bootloader of all official Wubi versions does not work.\nYou can use either a standard installation without Wubi (recommended - see here ) or community developed Wubi versions which support UEFI. See here.\nI use Windows in UEFI mode, a recommended standard Ubuntu installation and a Wubi installed Ubuntu on the same machine. All works without problems.

I've tried boot-repair and I see there are some Ubuntu entries on my Windows boot drive sda1, which I think shouldn't be there. I'll guess they should be on the external drive sdb1, or am I wrong?\nIf that is the problem, how can I move them?\nI'm fairly new to all this installation stuff. I only want to try a Linux system for web development.\nHere is my boot-repair info\nThanks for your help!\n\nA: You've run into a design flaw of the way Ubuntu configures GRUB 2. Basically, on an EFI-based system, the main GRUB binary goes in the EFI System Partition (ESP), but that binary relies on a grub.cfg file that resides in the Ubuntu /boot/grub directory, which in your case is on the external disk. Because Ubuntu configured GRUB as your default boot loader, the result is that the boot process fails whenever you unplug that external disk. There are several ways to correct this problem, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move /boot -- You can repartition your disks so that you have a ~500MB /boot partition on your internal disk, then re-install GRUB. This way, GRUB will be able to read its configuration file from the internal disk even though the bulk of Ubuntu will be installed to the external disk. The drawback is that you'll see an Ubuntu entry whenever the system boots, even when it's non-functional because the external disk is unplugged.\n\n*Re-prioritize your boot loaders -- You can use efibootmgr in Linux, EasyUEFI in Windows, or other tools to re-order your boot loader priorities. Typically, you'd want to put Windows at the top. You'd then use your firmware's built-in boot manager (typically accessed by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key, usually F8 or above) to select Ubuntu only when you want to boot it. This may be a workable solution if you boot Ubuntu infrequently, but the awkwardness of accessing the boot manager makes this solution a poor one if you want to boot Ubuntu frequently.\n\n*Use rEFind (or another boot manager) -- You can install my rEFInd boot manager to the ESP. It will then take over as the default boot manager. Because rEFInd builds its boot list on a boot-by-boot basis, the result will be a boot menu that shows only Windows when the Ubuntu disk is unplugged, and a boot menu that shows Windows and Ubuntu when the Ubuntu disk is plugged in. If you set rEFInd's default to boot Ubuntu, the result would even boot Ubuntu when the disk is plugged in and Windows when it's not plugged in. There are other boot managers, like gummiboot/systemd-boot and rEFIt (rEFInd's predecessor) that would work in this role, too.\n\n\nA: You have to boot the Windows USB/DVD, then after selecting your language etc, do not click \"Install Now\", but instead of that, click \"Repair your computer\".\nFrom there you are able to open up a Command Prompt. Make sure that your external drive is NOT connected, then use the following command: bootrec.exe /FixMbr.

I have a script that starts a new activity for hamster (activity tracker). This is my current script:\nACTIVITY=`zenity --entry --title \"Enter new activity name\" --text \"New activity name:\"`\nhamster start $ACTIVITY\n\nThe problem is I would like the script to remember the last task so I can just run it with ENTER instead of typing the name again. I want it to store the name of it in file. Currently I have made the file manually: /usr/local/bin/hamster-log.\nMy script so far is the following:\nfile=/usr/local/bin/hamster-log\nlast=$(<$file)\nactivity=$(zenity --entry --title \"Enter new activity name\" --text \"New activity name:\" --entry-text \"$last\")\nhamster start \"$activity\"\nif [ ! -z \"$activity\" ]; then\n    destdir=/some/directory/path/filename\n    if [ -f \"$file\" ]; then\n        echo \"$activity\" > \"$file\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nThe weird thing is when I run the script from terminal, it reads the file's content properly, but when I run it using a shortcut it doesn't read the file. \nI have set the file's permissions to 777.\n\nA: I'm not sure how you're calling the script in the custom shortcut but there are two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're calling an interpreter (e.g. sh /path/to/script): then you're calling sh or an incompatible shell: command substitutions such as $(<file) are replaced with the content of file only in Bash or compatible shells, so you may be calling an incompatible shell;\n\n*You're calling the script (e.g. /path/to/script): then the script doesn't have a shebang at the top.\n\n\nSo either:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the first one, call the right interpreter (bash /path/to/script);\n\n*If the second one, add a shebang at the top of the script (#!/bin/bash).\n\n\nAlternatively do something ugly (but POSIX and portable) such as:\nlast=$(cat \"$file\")\n\n", "Q: Dell Latititude 3350 Network Driver I have a Dell Latitude 3350 (Branded as Latitude Education 13\") however I can not find the driver for ubuntu anywhere.

Before was it about not loosing warranty, or being easier to update to a newer version of Windows. I am going forward to version 12.04, since this is the one Dell is mentioning on their support webpage (I don't know why).\nI am a smart user only (not a technitian or computer expert). Consider also that I have no sistem installed nowadays. The original hd drive has broken and I have bought a Kingston SSD 120gb as substititute.\nQuestions:\n1) Can or is it better to install a newer version considering the hardware I have?\n2) Where can I find the drivers for it?\n3) I had download a 12.04.5 version called Desktop CD for 64-bit PC (AMD64) computers (standard download). Even though it says desktop, is it for laptops too? And the 64-bit configuration is it correct too?\n4) For instalation, where is the best guide you have? http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop?\nLooking forward to hearing from you, tks and kind regards,\nJohn.\n\nA: Great to have you onboard John.\nI'll try to answer in your given order:\n1.\nIt can indeed sometimes be favorable to try and run some older Linux distribution on old hardware, because those tend to be based on older kernels, which is the layer that communicates between hard- and software in your computer. However, when trying to find your laptop online, I can only find fairly new ones. (e.g. here) Therefore it is hard to tell without really knowing your hardware.\nOne thing to keep in mind with older Ubuntu versions is the support with security updates. 12.04 will only be supported for about one more year, you can learn more about these support schedules on by checking online for \"Ubuntu Wiki LTS\". There you can also see that 14.04 will be supported until 2019, which would give you peace for a lot longer.\nI would therefore advise you to download the 14.04 LTS version of Ubuntu here and simply boot that version up on your laptop and instead of installing it right away there will be an option to live test the system. If that works out well and your hardware functions as it should then you can confidently install 14.04 on your laptop.\n2.\nThe drivers will come with your Linux Distribution (in this case Ubuntu) in form of the kernel. No need to search for any drivers on the web.\n3.\nThe desktop image of Ubuntu is correct for use on a laptop. \"Desktop\" rather means that it is not the server version, which comes without a graphical user interface. If Dell recommends the 64bit image for your Laptop then that should be correct, and it's not like you can destroy anything.\n4.\nThe guide you link there seems to incorporate all the things you need to know.\n", "Q: Cant get HD resolution working on second monitor, nvidia GT640 card, Ubuntu 14.04 Got a working screen via HDMI, but the DVI won't go past 1360x768 (a PackardBell Maestro monitor).

(e.g. libraries suggested here or here)\nI quite frankly don't know what to try anymore and it doesn't seem like any overly frequent issue, judging by the little amount of similar problems I could find on the web.\nOne other peculiar issue that might point towards something is that this is a laptop running on Swedish language packages.

The issue is described in this kernel bugzilla thread. \nThe required changes were included in the 4.5 version of the Linux Kernel which I am running now. The moment I changed from the custom kernel to the mainline kernel, wine started to work without a problem. I then also tested with an official 4.4 mainline kernel and wine worked with that one as well. So I am pretty certain that the custom kernel was the cause of the issue, although I can't really explain how.\nHope this might help someone with similar issues.\n\nA: You have to install the i386 version of Wine, you can do so using these commands:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\nAfter that run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine-bin\n\nAnd lastly run:\nwinecfg\n\nTo test the Wine i386 version.\n", "Q: Can not access Windows 10 after Ubuntu dual boot I recently installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 but am no longer able to access Windows when rebooting.

I should have the right setting for virtualbox to copy and paiste, because i can copy and paiste a url from iceweasle browse to libre office and that works. The book says drag and drop but he is using VMware, and I tried to drag and drop but I cant open the windows screen as I'm draging the file.\n\nA: You have to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions in both of the virtual machines, than drag the file from one VM to the host, then drag it into the other VM. If you need help with the installation of the Additions under Kali, you can ask here, if you want. It can be a bit tricky, it's easier under Windows.\n", "Q: How do redirect microphone audio output to headphone output? I'm trying to to redirect the sound that's being inputted into my microphone jack out into my headphone jack, is there any easy way to do this?\nI've tried doing the following command: \npactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1 \n\nBut I'm trying to hear the sound in real time, and it has a latency even if I set it as \"latency_msec=0\"\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Tested in Ubuntu 16.04 64bit\nIn a Terminal, type:\nalsamixer\n\nThen hit F6 to choose your onboard sound card.\nThen F4 and set \"capture\" on 50%, for example.\nHit F3, go to the track \"loopback\" and set it on \"enable\".\nGo to track \"Mic\" and set it on 100%, or any value so you can hear something.\nIf you still hear nothing from your microphone, stay on the track \"Mic\" and hit the key \"m\" to unmute the track.\nThat's it!\nWorks perfectly with my HDA Intel PCH.\n\nA: Unless your hardware has a direct monitoring feature and can completely avoid processing the sound through software, there is going to be latency.\nIt sounds like you are trying to do this on standard built-in audio hardware, which requires software processing to redirect audio, therefore no, there is no way to get rid of the latency.\n\nA: You can install the lowlatency kernel to achieve this type of performance.\nI use this kernel and the latency is so low I get realtime microphone feedback noise when the microphone is too loud without any echo, just straight-up high pitched noise like it is supposed to be.\nRun the following commands to install:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency\n\nReboot for the changes to take effect and don't forget to select the lowlatency kernel from the grub menu.\nAlso, as mentioned by bodhi.zazen, you should really consider checking out Ubuntustudio as it comes pre-configured with the lowlatency kernel and all that stuff. You can always install the ubuntu-desktop after installation if you prefer the unity desktop environment.\n\nAdditionally, installing ubuntustudio through apt-get usually doesn't result in a system that has the full configuration that normally comes with ubuntustudio.\nYou can, however, get the full configuration that comes along with Ubuntustudio by running tasksel and choosing the \"pro audio\" and \"audio recording\" tools.\nsudo tasksel\n\nNOTE: because of a bug in tasksel, DO NOT use tasksel to uninstall packages. ONLY use tasksel to install.\n", "Q: I can install windows but not ubuntu My brother ask me to format and reinstall windows and ubuntu in his Toshiba Satellite L745D. With windows all was good, but when I tried to install ubuntu I can not. In the installation of ubuntu, the systems seems to create partitions correctly, but then it throws me the errors \"Errno 30 read only file system\" or \"errno 5 input/output error\".\nI know that there are anothers post about that errors but anyone have solved my problem. This is the things that I have proved:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have check the md5sum of ubuntu 14.04 and it's good.\n\n*Proved with ubuntu, mint and zorin.\n\n*Used Unebootin (windows and ubuntu), Lili (windows), and the command dd to create the boot usb.\n\n*I have prove 3 different usb.\n\n*I have run badblocks and 0 errores, testmemo and the same. \n\n*I have change the memory ram and still not work.\n\n*With the same usb I can install ubuntu in another laptops. \n\n*I have format de hard drive and install ubuntu but still the same error.\n\n*I change the partition ext4 for ext2 and it seems install but  ubuntu don't install grub.\n\n\nI ran the following commands based on suggestions in the comments:\n$ grep -Fe ntfs -e fuse /proc/mounts\nnone /sys/fs/fuse/connections fusectl rw,relatime 0 0\ngvfsd-fuse /run/user/999/gvfs fuse.gvfsd-fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=999,group_id=999 0 0\n\n$ ls -ld /media/live/c1d96d80-5d12-43ad-9700-98293ada982b\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jan 18 14:01 /media/live/c1d96d80-5d12-43ad-9700-98293ada982b`\n\n$ sudo touch /media/live/c1d96d80-5d12-43ad-9700-98293ada982b/foobar.txt\n\nThe last command resulted in an empty file /media/live/c1d96d80-5d12-43ad-9700-98293ada982b/foobar.txt.\n\nA: This problem is caused by Windows. I assume that you are running Windows 8/8.1/10. Those Windows versions use a technology to put the partition in a hibernation mode. With other words, Windows protects itself from getting shrinked, as Microsoft rather wants you to use Windows than Linux. (The bastards!) Anyway, you are able to disable the hibernation by using a Command Prompt as Administrator under Windows and executing the following command: powercfg.exe -h off. That should do the trick. If it's still not working, post your question here, and I'll see if I can help you out.\n", "Q: Computer stuck after quitting installation I was installing ubuntu 15.04 when I realized I needed to partition disks first. So I quit the installer, and my screen turns off. My computer will not turn off though, even if I hit the power button or hold it down. I don't want to break it by unplugging it. What should I do? My normal OS is Windows 10 64bit.\n\nA: You could try to hold the button longer, it sounds weird to me that it won't turn of using the power button. If it still does not want to turn off, the best thing you can is unplug the computer, as one time doing that won't mess up the system. (Or you have bad luck.) And why did you stopped the installation in the first place? Ubuntu can do the partitioning for you!\n", "Q: Lenovo Yoga 3 Wifi Not Working on Ubuntu 15.10 I've seen a bunch of posts all around the internet about the Yoga line of laptops having wifi issues on older versions of ubuntu, but it seems this issue was patched in version 15.10. Well I just installed version 15.10 on my Lenovo Yoga 3 11' and I have no wifi connectivity. I'm a complete Linux noob, this is really my first foray into the Linux world outside of some basic Terminal stuff on the server end (I mean basic, like opening text files and navigating directories)\nI downloaded Ubuntu 15.10 and created a bootable USB, from there I did a clean install onto my laptop and that's about as far as I have gotten.

It showed me that the device ( the laptop ) could use, but wasn't using, some proprietary ( in my case Broadcom ) drivers. I clicked the radio button to use those, clicked a button to make the changes.\n\n*Clicked the Network Manager icon, saw all the nearby available wireless networks, signed on to mine, done.\n\nA: For any potential, future googlers. I ended up tethering my phone to my laptop to get it online, from there I was able to run the software update program which acquired the drivers automatically and, upon a reboot, enabled my wifi.

Recently I'm having a weird problem. I had my windows 10 and Ubuntu set up in dual boot for nearly one month. Two days ago for some reason, I clean installed windows and as expected, I couldn't boot into Ubuntu. So, I followed the official boot-repair documentation and everything worked just fine. But yesterday, I clean installed windows again and performed the boot repair, restarted my pc and GRUB opened. Then I chose windows 10 and I was greeted with just a purple screen and nothing else. I chose 'repair your computer ' from the Windows installation disk. and ran ' bootrec.exe /fixmbr'. Then I was able to boot into windows but no GRUB as expected. I repeated the process again and again but no luck. Please help me.

It takes forever to load a page (more than a minute) and most of the times doesn't even complete.\nI am sure the connection works (it's a fast 1Gbit/s point-to-point fiber with the ISP) because when I use Chrome or Opera, they're flashy fast.\nI also believe it can't be the profile/user, since I've also tried creating a new user in Ubuntu. Same effect: Chrome super-fast, Firefox doesn't practically work.\nThen, on the same laptop (Lenovo S540) I have Win10 in dual boot, and Firefox 43.0.4 as well in it. So, the thing is that in Win it works perfectly fine, so I guess the problem comes only for the Firefox in Ubuntu.\nTo further rule out a connection issue (a part from trying both with wifi and eth connection), I've brought the laptop all the way to my office and tried with the connection at work. Well, exactly same thing: Chrome snappy. Firefox unusable.\nAm I the only one having this issue?? It's a few days I'm looking online, but I haven't found anybody else's post anywhere about this...\nI'm an almost-expert (not professional, but 10+ years of exp) user in Linux and Firefox both, but I really can't understand what's going on here... Is anybody having a hint for me about where to look at next?\n\nA: I had a similar problem.  Disabling Ubuntu Modifications add-on solved it.  According to these answers, it is the interaction of adblock plus and the Ubuntu Modifications add-on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox very slow [closed]\n\n*Mozilla Firefox terribly slow on Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: In the end, after an update to Firefox 44 everything works again, more or less... I don't know if it's really solved, since it's still notably slower than Chrome, but at least is usable.\nA few days ago I tried the nightly (ver 46) and it had the same problem, so I already started despairing that an update wouldn't solve... But actually it did, so I'm happy. But still curious about what happened...\n\nA: I've tried several things now to fix this on my system but I think I may finally have a solution as I made the change last night and so far have gone all day & several reboots without any slow browser lookups etc.\nI'd heard some time ago about possible problems with IPv6 DNS lookups and that while not specifically an IPv6 problem it had more to do with the routers (like your home router/wifi) not handing IPv6 DNS properly.\nSome in those earlier searches had just recommended turning OFF IPv6 DNS altogether but to me that didn't sound like a good solution.\nThen I read this link:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4\nAnd ... specifically the Section labeled Blackhole IPv6 route\nIn it the author also says turning OFF IPv6 DNS is not a good idea but he shows what he recommends to do instead which is basically to edit :\n/etc/sysctl.conf\n\nand add the line:\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 0\n\nI did this and rebooted just to make sure everything restarted properly (maybe just restarting networking service would have been enough).\nAnyway since then I'm not seeing this problem any more (at least in the last 12 hours of use).\nYou might give it a shot as again you can always back-out if it doesn't solve your problem?\nBrian\n\nA: Try to deactivate certain pre-cognition features. Here is a list (in German).\n\nA: My firefox takes almost a minute to load a page on every install (since Ubuntu 13.10 if I remember correctly). The only way to fix it is go to about:config (you write it where you write the pages url) and search for ipv6. Then change network.dns.disableIPv6 to true (maybe my router doesn't support IPv6 and causes firefox to search for it but it isn't needed yet so you won't have any problem). After this, pages load within 1 sec.\n\nA: Thanks to bmullan. I voted for his answer too(I have not enough points here to be counted though). So I used his link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4\nAt first I checked IPv6 routes. There were no default route for IPv6 on my computer, then problem must be with Firefox itself. Okey, I tried disabling IPv6 in Firefox using this manual:\n**To disable IPv6 in Firefox:**\nIn the address bar, type about:config and press Enter. The about:config \"This might void your warranty!\" warning page may appear. ...\nIn the Search field, type network.dns.disableIPv6.\nIn the list of preferences, double-click network.dns.disableIPv6 to set its value to true.\n\nAnd it WORKS! My Firefox is alive again after long struggle.\nI filed BUG report to Mozilla https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325781 I hope they can solve this problem sooner rather than later.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 15.10 (Minimum Virtual Machine) Keyboard Layout I'm using Ubuntu Server 15.10 (x86) in Virtualbox.

disabled all PPAs and removed a couple of packages. Of course, the number of broken packages decrease but I do not want to remove all packages in the list.\nDoes anyone have a suggestion on how to proceed?\n\nA: \nAssumptions:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Started on 14.04\n  \n*Ran sudo do-release-upgrade which attempted to upgrade to 15.04.\n  \n*Upgrade failure happened, because of some issue with some software not being updated fully first (ALWAYS run sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade BEFORE running do-release-upgrade)\n  \n\nAssuming both of my assumptions above here are correct, then you've broken your system.  The 14.04 to 15.04 direct upgrade path which was a fairly newly introduced upgrade path solution is not a guaranteed-to-work solution - it has broken severly in the past and left people with broken-beyond-easy-fix repairs.\nGiven that the broken software list you have is insanely large, contains core software in the list, and fixes tried have failed, the only option really left to you is to cleanly install 14.04 or your target release, after backing up the data you wish to keep.\nThis is, unfortunately, the only true way to fix a horribly broken system; in this case, fixing each package will be extraordinarily difficult and you may be better off just cleanly installing, which is the fastest fix.  Back up your data first, though, so you don't lose it, and can restore it after fresh installing.\n\nA: Uninstalling the package mentioned last in the list of broken packages in /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log (which in my case was the tex-live package) void that error. I was a bit surprised that one package could generate such a long list of broken packages. \nAs the upgrade to 15.04 was complete, broken packages appeared once again. This time it seemed to originate from libstc++. Naturally, I did not want to remove that library because of the large number of packages depending on it. So i messed around with apt-get with various arguments (dist-upgrade, update, upgrade etc.) to no success. Finally I removed ubuntu-desktop and unity to see if I could re-install them. Ubuntu desktop since it was listed first and unity since Ubuntu desktop was depending on that package, which were reported as being held when I tried to re-install Ubuntu desktop. As I were unable to re-install Ubuntu desktop I decided to try to upgrade to 15.10 hoping that any issues would be resolved during that process. As the upgrade was complete, I reinstalled Ubuntu desktop and Unity and then, to my big surprise, the system worked.\nTo summarize, I were not aware the it was necessary to run apt-get dist-upgrade before an upgrade of the system and perhaps that would have resolved the situation. Unfortunately I can not give a direct answer to what caused the system to suddenly work again, but apparently libstdc++ were updated thus allowing all other packages to be updated.\n", "Q: Skype and MS Office on a Ubuntu laptop I recently purchased a Dell Latitude 3550 with Ubuntu as default OS. I had always planned to install Windows 10. However I found that the Ubuntu OS was supportive of net access using WIFI, had its own version of MS office tools though not as refined as MS Office.I am now getting second thoughts on installing Win 10.\nI am a heavy Skype user. Is Skype compatible with Ubuntu?\nCan I install MS Office on Ubuntu without resorting to Win 10?\nWould appreciate your advice.\n\nA: for sure, there is a skype-client for linux-based systems!\nit is even available in the repositories, so it integrates in your package system and will be updated like all the other software in one place! - please have a look at this question: How do I install Skype?\n\nMS Office is not available for Linux-based systems but you can try to install the windows-version via Wine.\nit might get a bit tricky, so please read this questions first:\nCan I install Microsoft Office? If so, how?\nInstalling MS Office 2013 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nalthough i suggest you to try LibreOffice (it is installed by default and nearly equal featured as MS Office) and maybe also the free standardized odf-format!\nIMHO most people don't need MS Office anyway... they just want a familiar GUI: so if you like the WinXP/2003-look you will love LibreOffice, if you want the Win7/2007-look maybe give WPS Office a try for a native office suite: Can Kingsoft Office be installed?\n\nA: Yes there is a version for skype in ubuntu. here This will help you to install skype. \nAnd for MS office representative, there is Libreoffice which is pre-installed in ubuntu. It's quite decent. If you really want to use MS office you can use it's online version MS office\n", "Q: How to remove a specific package from dependency list of another package? Since I'm using Qt5 I want to uninstall all the qt4 libs. I tried it with the following command\nsudo apt-get remove libqt4-*\n\nwhich attempts to remove all the qt4 libs but in addition it wants to remove texlive and vlc which I don't want to be uninstalled.\nIs there a way to keep those two packages? I found apt-mark hold but then they wouldn't be updated, too, so that doesn't suit for me.\n\nA: Those packages still use qt4 that is why they want to be removed, they depend on it.\nThere are many packages that still use qt4 for there interface, just because qt5 is  available, it does not make qt4 obsolete, you can have both without issue.\nI would recommend you keep qt4 as you may face issues with other applications that use qt4 and not qt5down the line.\nWhy do some packages still use qt4?\nIt is a lot of work to update your interface to a new language, as Ubuntu can support both versions at the same time and the difference to the end user is minimal, it is simply not a priority to update it with such a superficial update.\n", "Q: xrandr transform not working properly I am trying to keystone the display using the xrandr utility and transform option.

I am getting an output containing only lines. What seems to be the problem?\n\nA: I have just tried that on my laptop. I got some warnings:\n$ xrandr --output LVDS1 --fb 1366x768 --transform 1.171527,0.152543,-117.152659,0.000000,1.171527,0.000000,0.000000,0.000223,1.000000\nxrandr: specified screen 1366x768 not large enough for output LVDS1 (1602x773+-118+0)\nxrandr: specified screen 1366x768 not large enough for output VGA1 (1440x900+1366+0)\n\nWell, It seems that the frame buffer should be larger enough to hold the size mentioned in the warning.

The past few days I have been trying, without success, to create a deb package for a programme with a Qt interface. The previous steps I have done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a gpg key and registered it at Launchpad;\n\n*Identified myself with the DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME variables in ~/.bashrc;\n\n*Checked out the source code from GitHub;\n\n*Successfully built the programme (it uses qmake to generate a Makefile), identifying all its dependencies;\n\n*Created a source folder including the Makefile, plus a .desktop file and an .xpm icon.\n\n*Created a tarball from this folder named packagename-version.tar.gz. \n\n\nWith this preparatory work I have tried to follow two different guides:\n\n\n*\n\n*The official Ubuntu packaging guide - it concludes successfully, but the final .deb file only includes the doc folder.\n\n*A more detailed guide from xpressrazor - which fails when running debuild, with the following cryptic messages:\nmake: *** [build] Error 2\ndpkg-buildpackage: error: debian/rules build gave error exit status 2\ndebuild: fatal error at line 1364:\ndpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -D -us -uc failed\nThese and other guides out there invariably present simple examples where the programme to package is composed by a single source file (sometimes it is only a bash script). I suspect they are too simplistic for a proper programme with an elaborate GUI. In this case, what are the precise steps from dh_make onwards?\nUpdate I: I posted to PasteBin an anonymised version of the full debuild output.\nUpdate II: The debuild output, now with DH_VERBOSE=1.\n\nA: As it happens, dh can not possibly be used to package a Qt programme in the traditional way presented in most guides and tutorials out there. More specifically, the rules file must be informed of which snippets it must use to include in the final Makefile.\nOne way of achieving this is using the cdbs package:\nsudo apt-get install cdbs\nThen the rules file must be edited to include the snippets from this package:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\ninclude /usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/debhelper.mk\ninclude /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/qmake.mk\n\nThese should be the only contents in the rules file, any direct references to dh must be removed or commented out.\nAt this time, debuild should be operational, it can be run like:\ndebuild -S\n", "Q: Preview ascii files in file explorer (eg nautilus) like in windows 8 under Ubuntu?

There you can preview ascii files, images, pdfs, etc.\nHere is an example from Win 8 file explorer:\n\n\nA: Dolphin has this exact feature, and with a lot of options. The size of the preview can be adjusted quickly simply by adjusting the width of the side panel, showing as much as the entire first page. Depending on the configuration, it can also preview music/video files.\n\nA: Both Nemo and Nautilus have preview functionality. In both cases follow the menu Edit > Preferences and then select the Preview tab. In Nemo the dialogue looks like this:\n\nTweak these settings to your liking. Previews are portrayed for text files, .pdf documents, images and videos (and possibly more).\nThe previews are shown as the file icons, therefore you must make sure the Icon View is set as default in the Views tab:\n\n", "Q: Is it safe to install old libraries?

I have found other people too who say that they can use Empathy with Facebook. But yesterday I had to reinstall Ubuntu and now Empathy has stopped working.\nHow can I make it to work again?\nI'm a Linux noob, I've used Ubuntu for 2 months and am still not sure what I'm doing.\n\nA: this currently is not available (to my knowledge) since FB has disabled their XMPP support, for a new chat protocol (which empathy does not support).\nPidgin, another chat client, can connect with FB messages through the use of purple-facebook, an external plugin. In order to support FB on Empathy, someone would have to likely port this functionality to Empathy.

I downloaded JabRef-3.2.jar. I can execute it from the command line:\njava -jar JabRef-3.2.jar\n\nwhich works fine. But I would like to have a Launcher in my start menu, if possible with an appropriate icon. How can I do this?\nNote: I am running Xubuntu 15.04.\n\nA: Desktop, File Browser & Command Line\nPersonally, I have created a /home/bin directory to keep scripts for occasions like this.\n$ sudo mkdir /home/bin\n\nJust make sure that for every user the directory /home/bin is accessible:\n$ sudo chmod +rx /home/bin\n\nFurthermore the new directory should be listed as PATH=\"/home/bin:$PATH\" in the ~/.profile file of every user or wherever PATH happens to be defined on your system.\nSave below bash script as jabref in the newly created /home/bin/ directory.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nINSTALLDIR='/home/opt/jabref'\n\n# Run the latest version.\njava -jar $(ls -1v $INSTALLDIR/JabRef*.jar |tail -n 1) $@ &\n\nThe bash script should be made executable with:\n$ sudo chmod +x jabref\n\nThe script will open the latest version of JabRef*.jav previously saved in /home/opt/jabref/ with any yet existing desktop launcher or any file browser integration.

And the same things happens if I change UI locale from System Tools --> Preferences --> Language Settings.\nAnyone can help me?\nAnd another question (that bypasses the previous, if I can find a solution): Is there a way to select UI interface before logging in? I mean: in Linux Mint, suppressing autologin file, I can obligate the user to write his/her username and password (that's empty, anyway) and in login mask user can choose his/her UI locale; is there such a solution in Trusty?\nThanks,\nSilvia\n\nA: One possibility may be to keep the English folder names for all users, and prevent the prompt about renaming them from showing up. I think that can be done by removing the file ~/.config/user-dirs.locale.\nThe login manager lightdm-gtk-greeter allows you to select the display language at login. However, if we are talking about a Kubuntu system, I'm not sure whether lightdm-gtk-greeter is appropriate.\n", "Q: How to remove a directory which is not empty? I've been trying to erase (remove) a directory from one of my internal HDD and the system tells me that \"The directory can not be removed because it is not an empty directory.\"\nThe issue is that the directory IS empty!\nAt least, I can not to see any inside it with Thunar file manager or from the Terminal with root privileges.\nThe directory where the directory I want to delete is, has this output to ls-la:\ntotal 28\n\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 ene 15 10:01 .\n\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20480 ene 15 10:01 ..\n\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4096 ene 15 10:01 matrimonio de fiesta sara y luis hernan\n\nAnd, the directory I want to delete, has this output:\ntotal 8\n\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 ene 15 10:01 .\n\ndrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4096 ene 15 10:01 ..\n\nA similar case with another directory which has 3 files and, each time I was trying to remove them, the system tells me: \"Files not found.\"\nI was trying with sudo rm -r -f and... Nothing!\nThe same history each time I used it.\nWhat's wrong here?\nIs there another, more powerful, command to remove directories and/or files?\n\nA: You can remove empty directories with rmdir <directory> and non-empty directories with rm -r <directory>. \n\nWhat causes you trouble, may be the following:\nConsider this directory content:\n$ tree -a\n.\n├── empty\n├── non-empty\n│   └── file.txt\n└── non-empty-with-hidden-file\n    └── .file.txt\n\nWe have an epty directory, on containing a file and one containing a hidden file. Now run rmdir *:\n$ rmdir *\nrmdir: failed to remove `non-empty': Directory not empty\nrmdir: failed to remove `non-empty-with-hidden-file': Directory not empty\n$ tree -a\n.\n├── non-empty\n│   └── file.txt\n└── non-empty-with-hidden-file\n    └── .file.txt\n\nAs you can see, empty was removed and the other two caused error messages. Now you can run rm -r:\n$ rm -r non-empty\n$ tree -a\n.\n└── non-empty-with-hidden-file\n    └── .file.txt\n\nYour file not found error is probably not caused by rm, but by a typo in your filename or your directory path. You can avoid this by using the autocomplete function (Tab) instead of typing by hand.\n\nA: Wayne's answer is correct, but if an error occurs you can add the '-f' switch to rm, \"forcing\" the removal:\nsudo rm -rf \"/path/to/the/directory\"\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu compatible with Dell n4050 laptop? I have dell n4050 laptop. Do i have to install drivers after ubuntu installation? which version of ubuntu will support my laptop? \n\nA: Judging by this official Ubuntu Hardware certification for your laptop (if that really is your laptop, check the hardware specifics) chances are pretty high for it to work out of the box with the advised Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit.\nYou can also always try any Ubuntu installation before you actually install it on your computer by booting it and choosing \"Try Ubuntu\" instead of installing right away. More about live testing Ubuntu can be found here.\n\nA: You can install both available and supported versions Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and Ubuntu 15.10.\nUbuntu comes with all suitable drivers already preinstalled - there is not much for you to do.  \nAfter the installation open Software & Updates (Additional Drivers) and find what is offered.  \nIn case your notebook came with dedicated AMD graphics card, proprietary fglrx is an option.\nGenerally the already installed open source radeon drivers work great - so you can take them.  \nFor the Broadcom Wireless Card you have to install the additional drivers to get WiFi to work.\n", "Q: How to link, and compile, a C++ code using GNU Octave functions?

Environment: Ubuntu 15.10 on a Dell L502X\nI used to be able to use USB tethering between Ubuntu and an Android device without problems. Late last year, I applied a fresh install of Ubuntu (15.10) on the notebook. Now, with this combination, I cannot get USB tethering to work. I have tried a Nexus 4 (running Android 5.1, which used to work with the Ubuntu 15.04 that I used previously), a Nexus 5 (running Android 6.0.1), and a Nexus 5X (running Android 6.0.1).\nWhen I enable USB tethering, I get a new entry in ifconfig output:\nenx92c991095e89 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 92:c9:91:09:5e:89  \n      UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      RX packets:7 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n      RX bytes:520 (520.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nNote that the hardware address changes with each tether, so turning USB tethering off, then back on, or switching to a different Nexus device, gives me a replacement entry:\nenx82fb7388a85c Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 82:fb:73:88:a8:5c  \n      UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      RX packets:4 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n      RX bytes:332 (332.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nI also get a corresponding Wired entry in the Network screen in System Settings, showing the hardware address matching the ifconfig stanza, and described as either \"Disconnected\" (for the current enabled USB tethering session) or \"Unmanaged\" (for a prior USB tethering session).\nHaving GUFW enabled or disabled has no impact on the problem.

surf nor do things like ping google.com, annoying.\nBUT, everything looked ok (route, ifconfig, /etc/resolv.conf pointing to 127.0.1.1...). Just to be sure, I tried to ping a known ip from google (206.169.145.232), and it worked !\nDamn it, I do not know why the DNS are b0rked too, but you can use the temporary workaround by editing /etc/resolv.conf, and replacing 127.0.1.1 by 8.8.8.8 (and even add a second line nameserver 8.8.4.4).\nYou are set and can surf the web again !\nNow, it would be great if somebody could figure out why kubuntu 15.10 (which is also affected by this bug) cannot do that automatically, like before.\nEnjoy.\n\nA: What has happened is that your USB0 interfaces have been renamed to enx4e8a8f3fb7cb by the rndis_host driver. Simply edit your /etc/network/interfaces file and replace the USB0 interface with the renamed interface that rdis_host driver renamed.\nTo find this out after you plug your phone in and activate the tethering feature, run \"ifconfig -a\" in a terminal and you will see the new randomly generated interface, again you will not see USB0 anymore as it has been renamed by the rndis_host driver.\n\nA: The problem not on Ubuntu, I faced same issue on Windows 7\nBy somehow PC can't recognize Android network with DNS, to resolve this issue, are you using any blocking connection app on your android?\nIf yes disable it then try use USB tethering, if same problem do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install (Set DNS or DNS Changer) from Google play\n\n*Set Google DNS\nDNS1: 8.8.8.8\nDNS2: 8.8.4.4\nThen press connect, after that try enable USB tethering. \nIt should work\n", "Q: Unable to update ubuntu 14.04 LTS by using 'sudo apt-get update' When I'm trying to update ubuntu 14.04 LTS, I got this error message:\nE: Malformed line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list (dist)  \nE: The list of sources could not be read.\n\n\nContents of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list:\ndeb download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian trusty contrib non-free\n\n\nA: just add \n\nhttp://\n\nedit it like this deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian trusty contrib non-free\nthen sudo apt-get update and if that doesn't fix which it should then just delete the file from the sources.list.d directory dont worry it wont effect anything.\n", "Q: 'apt-get update' Error I'm constantly getting a error and a warning on the output of apt-get update from yesterday night on my Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit PC.\nThe significant part of the output of command apt-get update is following:\nGet:1 http://security.ubuntu.com trusty-security InRelease [64.4 kB]\n  ...\nW: Failed to fetch http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/Release  \nUnable to find expected entry 'restricted/source/Sources' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)\n\nE: Some index files failed to download.

I currently have Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18 installed, however even though I like mostly everything about GNOME 3, I would like to remove the Activities Overview button, and get the Application Menu pull-down menu there instead of it.\nHow can this be achieved?\n\nA: In order to achieve this the easiest way you will need to install two extensions by following these instructions.\nThese are the extensions: Applications Menu (which will add back the Applications Menu - this extension is pre-installed so you will only need to activate it, not install it), and Activities Configurator (you will need this to easily remove the Activities Overview button).\nOnce you have both installed, have opened the gnome-tweak-tool, and are in the settings panel for the Activities Configurator (instructions for all these steps are provided in the first link), click the slider which is labelled Remove Activities Button in order to set it to On rather than its current state Off:\n\nThis will remove the Activities Overview button and all which will be left in its place will be the Applications Menu labelled Applications which will have been created when you installed the Applications Menu extension.\nAnd here is the final result!\n\n\nYou will still be able to view the Activities Overview if you wish by click on the Applications Menu and then on Activities Overview at the bottom or by pressing SUPER. And you can of course always reverse these settings as well as disable or completely remove these extensions in the gnome-tweak-tool's Extensions section.\n\nA: Alternatively, you can use Gnome Classic instead of Gnome. The developers have removed the Activities from it (to my dismay).\nFor Ubuntu you can look here:\nhttps://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/06/enable-gnome-classic-mode-ubuntu\n", "Q: Stop some processes from autorunning As the title, I'm trying to figure out a way to avoid the following processes from autorunning when the system starts: Virtualbox, Tomcat7, ntopng, tor.\nSo, until now, I tried to simply create a .override file inside the /etc/init/ with the manual stanza.

How do I login to Ubuntu 15.10 directly using root account?\n\nA: Root account is disabled in Ubuntu for login by default. You would have to change root password to login directly.  \nPersonally i suggest you login to root through your sudo account with sudo -i\n\nA: Yes you can login as a root user however this is in no way suggested.\n I would also recommend sudo -i to emulate root. However this being Linux you can do as you wish and enable root. This can cause major security holes and is not recommend! sudo passwd root create a password and now you can login as root. To disable root sudo passwd -dl root\nYou can read more about root access here.\n\nA: Single user mode will work, assuming your root account has a password.\nAt grub, choose Advanced. Cursor to kernel you want. Then \"e\" to edit grub stanza and change linux line to end \"ro single\". This is about 8 lines down usually longest line. Cut out silent and splash if they are on end. Then \"x\" launch system boot to prompt that asks for root password. There will be a reminder on how to launch at bottom of screen. I'm not sure if Alt-x might be needed (for sure, there is an x )\nIf you really mean to ask this question, this is the right answer. I don't know why somebody gave you the -1 on this. It is a reasonable question. You should not have to give anybody \"context\" for this one. \nOther answers seem to assume you are a moron. This part is not for novices. If you are, step back from it.\nAlso, ignore Ubuntu chorus 'there is no root user'. That's just silly. His home folder is /root.  Giving that account  a password is easy and it does nothing harmful AT ALL. @Rinzwind is not correct on that point. sudo will still work from user account .\n\nA: First: There are legitimate reasons to log in as root, like when you are moving or archiving the location of your /home directory, and you don't want any artefacts or broken pipes from being logged in as a user.\nComing from OpenSUSE, not being able to log in as root definitely is not an improvement but a rather a nuisance.\nSecond: While Ubuntu succeeds in making logging in to the GUI difficult, at least under X11 you can use a command line console session rather easily after making sure, root has a password.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo passwd root.\n\n*Log out.\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F3 for a console session.\n\n*Log in as root in the console session. \n\n\nYou can now use a genuine root command-shell with /root being your $HOME and no users logged into your system. Also, the security holes speculated about by other posters do not exist in this setup, because the X-Server doesn't run.\nAfter having finished your console session, log out with exit or Ctrl-D, use Ctrl+Alt+F2 to go to the login prompt, log in again and continue your normal GUI life.\n\nA: If you need login as root :\nOpen terminal then type\nsudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf\n\nFind line [security]\nand replace to\n[security]\nAllowRoot=true\n\nSave and exit.\nAnd run \nsudo nano /etc/pam.d/gdm-password\n\nThen replace this auth required pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success\n\nTo #auth required pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success\n\nSave and exit\nAnd restart computer.\n", "Q: Partition restoration Good afternoon. \nDownloaded Partition Scanner & Disk Recovery Tool via Terminal.

How can I make it use all 4GB memory?  Thank you.\n\nA: Part of the memory is allocated to the on-board Video card. You may be able to adjust the amount of memory the card can use, in the system BIOS, but you will never see the full 4GB, as the video card must be allocated some amount. You could theoretically disable on-board video if your BIOS allows it, but then your system would have no video, as it's a laptop.\nYou do not need to force PAE to on. Ubuntu now only supports PAE for 32-bit Intel systems. So forcepae doesn't actually do anything, but give you some extra messages in the log about it being forced.\nInstalling the linux-image-server packages was also not necessary. You only seeing 3.2GB vs 4GB, is unrelated.\nOn my system, with Intel video, I have 32GB of RAM installed, which is  33554432 kilobytes, while free shows I have 31860640 kB total, which is 30.39 GB. Some of that difference is the allocated video memory, and some of that difference is the kernel memory.\n\nA: To address more than 3GB of RAM using PAE on Intel-based systems, you must have support from the chipset. The Intel 945 and older chipsets for example don't support this.\n\nA: Unfortunately, a 32 bit operating system can only address 4GB of memory. Your swap space and graphic memory space will be included in this address block, so you might only be able to see 3.2GB memory; if this is insufficient, I'd recommend using the x64 version of 14.04. I've had no problems with compatibility.\n", "Q: Ubuntu init.d configuration not starting Gerrit 2.11.4 at boot I followed Gerrit's installation instructions.\nMy gerrit.sh update was, as per instructions, to uncomment these 3 lines:\n# ========================\nchkconfig: 3 99 99\ndescription: Gerrit Code Review\nprocessname: gerrit\n# ========================\n\nQuestion 1: Does anyone understand what these three lines do syntactically?

I recently installed Ubuntu Server 14.04 an HP ProLiant ML350 Generation 6 (G6) server, that used run windows, which appears to have RAID controller:\n\nThe Ubuntu Community Help Wiki says:\n\nHardware-RAID: A special controller used to build RAID. Hardware RAID\n  is generally faster, and does not place load on the CPU, and hardware\n  RAID can be used with any OS\n\nBut I'm not certain if this means the hardware will do things automatically, or if there's something I have to configure. \nWhen I check:\nroot@webserver:~# cat /proc/mdstat\nPersonalities : \nunused devices: <none>\n\nIt doesn't appear as though anything is there.\nThis is the first server I've ever configured a server, and I'll confess I was ignorant to what RAID was when I installed the OS, so my question is do I have to configure RAID now or is the hardware doing everything automatically? If I still need to configure it, how do I do that without re-installing the OS?\n\nA: If it is hardware raid, then it is already taking care of it and you can see the configuration in the bios raid utility ( changing the hardware raid configuration is usually destructive, so you will need to reinstall ).  Look for something in the bios POST screens that mention pressing some key for the raid utility.  If this is the case you will only see a single drive ( /dev/sda ).  /proc/mdstat normally only lists software raid arrays, which you can configure if, and only if you desire ( and the simplest way to do so is to reinstall ).  If you see multiple drives in the system ( /dev/sdb, etc ), then you don't have hardware raid.\n", "Q: Nano not highlighting syntax anymore So I along with a few others are planning to start a company, and we are using an ubuntu server to host our website.

This is really anoying.\nThe output of efibootmgr in linux is this:\nBootCurrent: 0004\nTimeout: 5 seconds\nBootOrder: 0002,3002,0004,2001,2002,2003\nBoot0000* Disco duro del portátil\nBoot0002* Windows Boot Manager\nBoot0004* ubuntu\nBoot2001* USB Drive (UEFI)\nBoot2002* Internal CD/DVD ROM Drive (UEFI)\nBoot3001* Internal Hard Disk or Solid State Disk\nBoot3002* Internal Hard Disk or Solid State Disk\nBoot3003* Internal Hard Disk or Solid State Disk\n\nAs expected. If I do a sudo efibootmgr -o ... then I can change the boot order to put 0004 in front. If I do so and run efibootmgr again then the order appears correctly changed. If I reboot the computer, however, the order is not respected, it just boots window again, and if I go back to linux and run efiboomgr, then the order changed back to the one shown  above.\nWhy could this happen and how do I make the change persistent?\n\nA: It's possible that this is a Secure Boot problem. Try disabling it from the BIOS UI.\n\nA: This looks like bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1286388 .  For me it was a temporary situation, until the next kernel update.  Add yourself to the bug with the \"does this bug affect me\" button near the title.\n\nThe assumption is that you do not have to boot to Windows to lose the order.  Of course, Windows can and sometimes does mess with the order, but I cannot blame Windows if I don't boot it, and the order still changes.  I cannot recall how many times I booted and this happened, but until I ran an Ubuntu update, it persisted.  Perhaps Windows was setting the \"next boot\" and I kept getting snagged, but then why did an update fix things?\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't connect to WPA2 but dual-booted Windows can I recently changed my router from WEP to WPA2 and also changed my password.

Oh and perhaps one last useful fact: I can connect to another wifinetwork that I can reach from my house with ubuntu. But not with mine :(\n\nA: Yes,I think it's a Ubuntu driver problem in managing the WEP/WPA2. Try to do a test disabling your WiFi protection to check if this is the problem.

While I personally like it much more than Unity, I can see why you might hate something if it forces its way onto your computer. To get back to Unity (what you had before), you need to switch back to it.\nFirst, however, you need to make sure that lightdm (the login screen to go along with Unity) is selected as the default to use. To do this, open a terminal (ctrl + alt + T) and run the command, sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm. Put in your password (you won't see it being typed), and wait for a popup asking you to choose between two or more options. Use your arrow keys to go to lightdm and hit Enter to select it.\nNow that you're done with that, reboot (a logout may be enough, but I'd rather play it safe). Now you should be at the login screen. Before you login, however, hit the gear icon near the password field (I believe it's to the right of your username) and choose the Ubuntu Desktop or Unity option. I'm not sure which one you'll see, but it should be one of those.\nAfter you've selected Unity/Ubuntu Desktop, login and you should be back to normal.\n\nA: It looks like you're running gnome.

These are my specs:\n6th Generation Intel Core i7-6820HK (2.7 GHz) \n32 GB Memory \n1 TB HDD \n256 GB M.2 SSD \nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M 8 GB \nGDDR5 17.3\" IPS \nWindows 10 Home\nI've done some reading and have attempted a few things but nothing works. I've tried running Ubuntu 14.04 which I could at least get into live mode by using Legacy in the BIOS but I can only see my 1TB HDD and not the m.2 SSD which is where I want to put Ubuntu. When trying to install 15.10, I put the boot mode into UEFI with CSM which is what others have said to do, and I get the grub screen. No matter which selection I try (Live or Install) I get an error that says \"Ignoring BGRT: Invalid status 0 (expected 1)\" and it freezes. I'm not very experience with Ubuntu at all so I don't know what I'm doing other than what I see online. I'm trying to get Ubuntu 15.10 put alongside my Windows 10 on my m.2 SSD. I was told that the 6th generation processor is what's doing it, and then I was told the NVIDIA card is what's doing it. \nThis is the actual link to my laptop in case the specs I've provided are not enough: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834152934\nI'm really thinking about downgrading to another laptop because I can't get Ubuntu or Windows 7 on this thing and I hate Windows 10. Anyway, has anyone had any success with the issue that I'm having?\n\nA: \nI've tried running Ubuntu 14.04 which I could at least get into live mode by using Legacy in the BIOS\n\nIf the computer already boots another OS in EFI/UEFI mode, as do the vast majority of computers that shipped with Windows 8 or later, then this is the wrong thing to do. I know a lot of Web sites say to do it, but THEY'RE WRONG! Setting this boot mode can work around some problems with booting the installation medium when that medium is prepared incorrectly, but the cost is even worse problems down the line. The result is either a repair or going back to square one to re-create the boot medium and re-install. It's better to do it right from the start by getting the installation medium to boot in EFI/UEFI mode. This can usually be done by using a different tool to prepare the boot medium (Rufus, Unetbootin, and dd can all usually do the job) or by adjusting options in the tool you used to create the boot medium. For more on this subject, see my page on the CSM.\nThe BGRT message you're seeing has been popping up a lot lately. See, for instance, this question and its answers. I have no personal experience with it, but my impression is that it's not a critical problem, and that the subsequent hang is unrelated.\nIf the computer is new and you can't get Ubuntu to boot on it, my recommendation is to return it for a refund and get something else. That said, there may be a solution; I'm not familiar with your particular computer or its quirks. You can find a list of laptop and desktop computers certified for use with Ubuntu here. Be aware, though, that many of these systems are sold pre-loaded with Ubuntu, and many of these include drivers or other software that's not a standard part of the distribution, so you may need to track those down if you buy a model that doesn't come with Ubuntu pre-installed.\n\nA: put these options in the GRUB boot menu  \nnomodeset  \nintel_idle.max_cstate=0\n\nI was having the same issue and resolved by that. \n\nA: Since this is a top result on Google for several keyword combinations, I wanted to share this (I ended up resigning to solve it on my own because none of the answers for the issues I faced were working/helping):\nAs of Ubuntu 17.04, most everything with this laptop appears to work out of the box. The only thing I have not tested is Bluetooth, the GPU toggle button, and the Thunderbolt/DisplayPort port.\nI had to disable Secure Boot in BIOS. IIRC, the installer went through fine, but the system wouldn't boot afterward, with BIOS throwing a big red error message about signatures or something.\nWifi, LAN, HDMI, USB, audio, and both SSDs (withOUT intel raid - could not get that going so I did something clever with mdadm instead, outlined below) -- all tested/working. The GTX 980m works with the non-free Nvidia driver with zero fuss. System seems stable, though I'm only a couple days in. I can't think of any issues at all that I've had to overcome to get any hardware going.\nI installed Ubuntu Server 17.04 because Lubuntu hadn't caught up with the new release at the time of my install (hours after release). In doing so, I was able to get Lubuntu via tasksel. I mention this because it means I have not tested the regular Ubuntu desktop installer. The server installer had some weird quirks during partitioning. Kept freezing up and required several hard power-cycles before I finally got it going. It was probably due to the unusually complex layouts I was experimenting with.\nFor the SSDs, the end result is that I split both SSDs into two md RAID 0 arrays (~128gb each, naturally). The first holds / and swap. The second is a bcache for the 1tb mechanical disk and where /home is mounted. This gives me absurd disk performance, at least for a laptop! Don't forget to leave ~600MB somewhere bootable for the EFI partition (I forgot to do this and had to install the OS twice).\nUPDATE:\nIt is well worth noting that having a 2nd monitor attached to the HDMI port will probably lead to tears when installing the OS or installing a new desktop environment. Simply disconnect the HDMI attachment if you run into any issues where you can't see the mouse or can't CTRL+ALT+FN to a terminal after lightdm starts (maybe reboot after disconnecting the HDMI attachment).\n\nA: Been there.\nIn my case it was all about some extra kernel params.\nWhile in grub, press [e] to edit selected line's boot options.\nDuring Ubuntu installation, [Tab] button allows to do the same (not sure about the button though).\nOn edit screen, there is a line lookin' like\nlinux /../.. quiet splash\n\nTry removing the 'quiet' option for detailed boot log, and adding these in the end:\nlibata.force=noncq acpi=off nomodeset\n\nThese should get your Ubuntu installed and booting okay.\nYou may want to add these options to Grub permanently, instead typing them on each boot. \nFor this, please read this one: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters.\n\nA: I have had Manjaro linux 15.12 XFCE (kernel 4.1) running on my gt72s for 2 months now nearly perfectly.  I get freezing if I try to boot with linux kernel 4.3 or 4.4 (killer wifi network driver support added from 4.3~) But I don't need wifi currently so I can wait it out.  I suggest you try Manjaro, super fast and beautiful distro and this machine is a beast and more with it.\n", "Q: How to create launch or desktop icon for Matlab 2015a I have installed Matlab 2015a on my Ubuntu 14.04.

Only then, the matlab runs. Can anyone please help and guide me how to create an icon on launch pad or create a desktop shortcut icon? I really need help.\n\nA: Alright, since I was new to ubuntu it took me a while to figure out how to solve the above stated problem. I did the following steps as I have arranged it here, below. This should be mentioned here that the directory in which I installed was /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Production_Server/R2015a.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a *.png image of the matlab logo using the browser. By default it should be saved in the folder /home/<username>/Downloads.\n\n*Now copy this *.png image to the matlab installation directory. I faced trouble using only the cp command. Then I used the sudo cp command. It was like this sudo cp /home/<username>/Downloads /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Production_Server/R2015a. Then it worked. \n\n*Open an editor like Gedit.

After this, you should see a normal file on your desktop. right click on the file and go to Properties. click on Permission then click on Allow executing file as program. This time the file you created on your desktop should have the Matlab logo.\n\n*Double click on the Matlab 2015a logo that you created and enjoy your hard work.\n\nA: This answer is to create shortcuts for any Applications.  \nwhat you have to do is just download a .png file that you want to set as \"icon\"  \nand find the path from where you are executing(opening) it from terminal\nIn my case my my png file is in /usr/share/icons/matlab.png\nand executable \"matlab\" file is at /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Production_Server/R2015a/bin/ \nnow open any text editor \"gedit\" and paste below commands and replace  respective paths and save the file with name.desktop where name is anything you want. \n[Note: To create launcher on DOC I will recommend you to save name.desktop on Desktop folder.]\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Matlab R2015a\nComment=MATLAB shortcut!\nExec=/usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Production_Server/R2015a/bin/matlab\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/matlab.png\nTerminal=true\nType=Application\nCategories=Utility;Application;\n\nnow right click on file goto--->properties-->permissions and at bottom select Allow executing file as program\nHurray you did it.\nNow just double click and enjoy the shortcut.\n", "Q: Accidentally Wiped Root Partition - System Still Running Alright, this is one of those times when I am are saying... Breathe deep, don't panic.\nWhat happened?\nAs a usual part of leisurely tinkering with my system, I was trying write a 24.5 MB img file to my USB drive for a BIOS update. The normal command would be:\ndd if=bios.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M\nDone that a hundred times. No problem.\nNow you know the problem when you're mentally tired and your command turns out like this:\ndd if=bios.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M\nSo it replied: dd: failed to open ‘/dev/sda’: Permission denied\nAnd without thinking twice, you did:\nsudo dd if=bios.img of=/dev/sda bs=1M\nOne should look happy when terminal replied this:\n23+0 records in\n23+0 records out\n24117248 bytes (24 MB) copied, 0.0138706 s, 1.7 GB/s\n\nBut what a horror two seconds later when realizing it's your sda.\nWhat's the current status?\nThe system is still up.

Their official website says: \"It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.\"\n\n\nThere you go, automated.\n\n\n*gpart from the official repos. The Wikipedia article says, \"It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and sizes of inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical. It gives you the information you need to manually re-create them (using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk, etc.). The guessed partition table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly believe the guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk device.\"\n\n\nWell, learning is a great thing. ;-)\n\nPS\nTo install: sudo apt install testdisk gpart\n", "Q: How to install Cassandra I have downloaded dsc-cassandra-2.2.4-bin.tar.gz from http://www.planetcassandra.org/cassandra/ .

Is there any way to recover? Even the backup deja-dup is deleted.\n\nA: That rm command does not delete your /home/.  You probably typed \nsudo rm -rf ~/ .local/share/Trash/*` \n\nSee the space? Now that would delete your /home/$USER and the trash inside that directory too. And also a \"deja-dup\" back-up if it is stored in /home/$USER.\nI would start of with a comment: there is never ever a reason for you to use that method to delete a trash. If you want to use \"rm\" that way you do \ncd ~/.local/share/Trash\npwd\nsudo rm -rf *\n\nExamine the path that is shown after \"pwd\" and make sure it is correct and then you remove the files. You would have used a far more safer method.\n\nEven the backup deja-dup is deleted.\n\nThat file was not a backup if it was inside your /home. That file was a collection of files of your /home. You can only call it a backup if you move the file to an external medium away from your actual system.\n\nIs there any way to recover? \n\nYou restore a backup. \nIf you do not have a backup ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Your /home/ will be recreated after a reboot. If your personal files are of no interest you can then start using your system. Before you do read on ...\n\n*Your personal files will not be recovered. If you want to attempt to recover the files that where once there: do NOTHING to the partition or the disk, create a backup of the partition or the whole disk with dd. \nYou need to have the space to create a backup of the complete partition your /home is on or for the whole disk if you have no separate /home so use a very large USB disk for the \"output\" in that command (Examples on this:dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb creates a dump of disk /dev/sda and puts that on /dev/sdb. Before using that command make sure you use the correct device names).\nAfter that you can use testdisk on the image you made or another recovery tool to examine the dump and try to recreate your /home/.

I know, that if user is experienced, he doesn't need any of this extension. But i am going to use Ubuntu daily as my primary OS, so it is very big chance that i visit sometimes malicious website, and i am looking for the best extensions which notice me when i visit malicious website, and blocks its content.\n\nA: You do not need any of them even if you are not experienced. The bigger problem is exploits (bugs that are used to gain access) in the browser. There have been a few (not that many), \"flash\" has had far more bugs that could be exploited. \n\n\n*\n\n*The 2nd one does nothing related to security. \n\n*\"scriptblock\" I can see this help you be more secure. \n\n*But \"web of thrust\" ... well ... nice idea but their method is seriously flawed: you will only be warned about a site they evaluated. That is too late since the harm has already been done before they evaluate a site. \nPlus you can be tricked: Let's assume I want to attack you personally due to you not upvoting my answer ( :) ). What about if I make a website I believe you will be interested in. I open a topic on their forums for people to evaluate it, I get a good evaluation, and then send you an invite to visit. I change a little bit of code to hack your system and then remove the code before anyone using WOT gets alarmed? I could keep that going for a long time while WOT claims my site is a wonderful piece of software.\nNah, WOT makes you -feel- you are more secure but it is not actually making your surfing secure. \nNow for some real pointers. What you need to avoid at any cost:\n\n\n*\n\n*never ever start a browser as \"root\" or with \"sudo\".\n\n*use a good \"sudo\" password and never ever insert your password if asked and you do not understand why it is asked. \n\n*backup your personal files. I myself do not store personal files in /home/ but use a different partition that is only mounted when I want it mounted.

Otherwise your driver just doesn't support the GLSL version which wine is using for DX10 implementation.\n\nI was also getting the same error, so I decided to investigate it. First we have to find out the code. Grepping over the Wine source shows that the error resides in dlls/dxgi/utils.c:448. Here's relevant part:\n    hr = wined3d_get_device_caps(factory->wined3d, adapter->ordinal, WINED3D_DEVICE_TYPE_HAL, &caps);\n    if (FAILED(hr) || caps.VertexShaderVersion < 4 || caps.PixelShaderVersion < 4)\n    {\n        FIXME_(winediag)(\"Direct3D 10 is not supported on this GPU with the current shader backend.\\n\");\n\nSo, the error is caused either by wined3d_get_device_caps fail, or by too low shader versions. Taking a look at the implementation in dlls/wined3d/directx.c:4884 for the possible fail reason shows that the wined3d_get_device_caps is pretty big function of ≈700 lines, and it have only two returns in its body — the fail one is ≈12 lines below the start, and the successful in the end. The fail code looks like\n    if (adapter_idx >= wined3d->adapter_count)\n        return WINED3DERR_INVALIDCALL;\n\nLooking at the name of return value WINED3DERR_INVALIDCALL, I'd guess that the line here is for the case of a bug — either in Wine or in app. I've a feeling that this is unlikely our case, so let's assume that the function succeeds, return to the utils.c, and take a look at the other fail cases, i.e. caps.VertexShaderVersion < 4 || caps.PixelShaderVersion < 4.\nI haven't work with graphics, so didn't know what're Vertex/Pixel Shader Versions. Searching about it gives an answer, that it is also referred as «shader model». Isn't reliable source btw, but the Wikipedia article didn't mention versioning at all, so better than nothing.\nNext, searching about shader model gives us HLSL article, which fortunately have tables for both Pixel and Vertex shader versions; both tables have 4.0 version, which wine is looking for. One last thing: how could we find whether our GPU driver supports the 4.0 version if it rather implements OpenGL?\nWell, it turns out there's an article about detecting the shader model for OpenGL, and… there's a comparison of versions for OpenGL and Direct3D! Quoting: Direct3D Shader Model 4.0 is equivalent to GLSL version 3.30.\nLet's find out whether we got that version:\n$ glxinfo | grep GLSL\nOpenGL ES profile shading language version string: OpenGL ES GLSL ES 3.00\n\nWell, as you see, it turns out that the driver didn't support the needed version 3.30 ☹ I wish you're lucky, though, if you're reading that, guess you're not.\n\nA: If your GPU drivers don't support compatibility contexts, you might try to add an registry key to tell Wine to create a core context.\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Wine\\Direct3D]\n\"MaxVersionGL\"=dword:00030002\n\nAs per documentation:\n\n  |  +->MaxVersionGL\n  |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Choose the maximum GL version to request. Currently defaults to version 1.0.\n  |  |    Set it to 30002 (hexadecimal) or greater to request a core profile context.]\n\n\nIf running $ glxinfo | grep GLSL only reports the OpenGL ES shading language version string, you might have been misled. Try $ glxinfo | grep -e \"shading language\" which reports the following for me:\nOpenGL core profile shading language version string: 4.20\nOpenGL shading language version string: 1.30\nOpenGL ES profile shading language version string: OpenGL ES GLSL ES 3.00\n\n", "Q: Upgrading from 14.04 to 15.10 fails - can not calculate the upgrade This is not a duplicate because this has not been answered.\nBecause 14.10 no longer exists, I am unable to upgrade to 15.10.

That is the more difficult but also more appropriate method.

Steeldriver already gave you the classic awk approach. Here are some other choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use sed to capture two groups of non-whitespace (\\S) characters and then switch them around:\n... | sed -E 's/\\s*(\\S+)\\s+(\\S+)/\\2 \\1/'\n\n\n*Use perl. Its -a switch makes it work like awk. It will automatically split each input line on whitespace and save each field as an element of the array @F. Therefore, the 1st field will be $F[0], the second $F[1] etc.:\n... | perl -lane 'print \"$F[1] $F[0]\"'\n\n\n*Use Perl for the whole thing:\nperl -lane '$k{$_}++ for @F; }{ print \"$_ $k{$_}\" for keys(%k)' \"$1\"\n\nHere, perl reads the input file line by line and applies the script to each line. $k{$_}++ for @F saves each word (each field from @F) as a key in the hash %k and increments the associated value by one each time the word is seen. Then, after the file has been processed (that's what the }{ means), it will print the word ($_) and the number of times it was seen ($k{$_}) for each key stored in the hash. \n\n*Use awk for the whole thing:\nawk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++){a[$i]++}}END{for(i in a){print i,a[i]}}' \"$1\"\n\nThe first for loop iretares over each field and adds one to the value associated with that field in the array a. Then, at the end of the file, it loops over each element in a and prints the element (the word) and the associated value (the number of times the word was seen).\n\n*Use the shell with your original pipeline:\n... | while read a b; do echo \"$b $a\"; done\n\n", "Q: How to delete files with the same extension in one go using rm? I had compiled many C programs together, and each of the file had a .gch created. Now I did not want the .gch files so I decided to delete them.

I want the solution to be in shell or terminal. The question is not a duplicate as I want to use rm only.\n\nA: easily use the expansion\"*\":\nrm /path-to-directory/*.gch\n\nThis what is called filename expansion which use some special characters called wildcards.\nsuppose you have a directory containing the files (file, file0, file1, file01)\nSome know wildcards:\nThe question mark (?) is a special character that causes the shell to generate filenames. It matches any single character in the name of an existing file.\nexample:\nls file?\n\nThe shell expands the \"file?\" argument and generates a list of files in the working directory that have names composed of \"file\" followed by any single character. \nThen the output would be file0 and file1\nThe asterisk (*) performs a function similar to that of the question mark but matches any number of characters, including zero characters, in a filename.\nnow the output of the command:\nls file*\n\nwould be file, file0, file1 and also file01\nThe [ ] Special Characters  causes the shell to match filenames containing the individual characters within the brackets.\nfor example the output of the command:\nls file[01]*\n\nwould be:\nfile0 file1 file01\nThis is just a simple introduction for shell expansion, you can read more : \n\n\n*\n\n*http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0080.php\n\n*http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_04.html\n\nA: To remove files with the same extension in one-go, just use find command. \nfind /path/to/directory -type f -iname '*.gch' -delete\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-type tells find if you are searching for files or directories, here:\nf = file\nd = directory\n\n*iname tells find about the name of the file you are looking for.\nNote: name does the same thing but iname is recommended because it ignores cases whereas name doesn't.\n\n*-delete deletes those files\n\nA: Simply type the following command in terminal (shell)\nrm -rf  /path/to/files/*.<extension>\n\nBe careful with the -f parameter. It will not warn before deleting.\n\nA: If you are using C and Makefiles, you can also make a .PHONY recipe target and rm by default and add the byproduct \"cruft\" files that one deletes from a clean source directory. You still use the wildcard * token.\nmake clean\n\nfor example\n   .PHONY clean\n\n\n    clean:  \n         rm -f *.gch  *.o *.temp *.log\n\nthen you have multiplied your productivity in cruft elimination.\n", "Q: Splitting front/rear audio ports I have a headset connected to the front panel and speakers connected to my rear panel (stationary computer).

However, to mute the speakers I need to mute the \"Front\" channel which I can't mute without muting everything else as well.\nThe best I can do, is turning down the \"Front\" channel's volume to 0, the problem is that the speakers still play sound (although low it is still there, and not low enough to be negligible).\nJust to be clear:\nI want to be able to mute the headphones and the speakers independently of each other and not listen to both at the same time, how can I do that?\n\nA: This usually works out of the box without any modifications. Ideally, if your front panel supports jack detection it should work automatically like on a laptop, where audio gets routed to headphones when connected and to speakers when headphones are disconnected. You can control the setting manually in pavucontrol.\n\nThe method described in the link through the playback tab (also described here) is intended to move streams from one soundcard to another. Setting up a virtual soundcard with remapped channels looks like over complicating things a bit.\n\nEdit: I just checked on my desktop machine — where I don't use onboard sound very often — with a Haswell board and a ALC892 chip, jack detection works and switches automatically to the front panel when a headphone is connected in 14.04. Check that your front panel has an HD audio connector (1, 2).\n", "Q: Installing Python3.4 + Pygame on Ubuntu 15.04 The issue has been discussed before, but I have failed to find an answer for the problem. \nI have tried both to compile Pygame from the official website and install from PPA but nothing works for me. \nI still get: ImportError: No module named 'pygame'\nWould appreciate any hint. \n\nA: It appears that the released version of Pygame does not support Python 3.

I have an old Mac Pro from 2007 running Lion. It's software is no longer supported and the hardware isn't compatible with later versions of OS X so I am planning to format the HD and install Ubuntu. \nSo here's the question. The old Mac was not manufactured with a wifi card installed. I have wifi on it using an airport express that extends the wifi from our home. I have the airport plugged into the computer using Ethernet. \nIf I erase the OS X and install Ubuntu, will the airport still work through Ethernet? I assume it will, but am not sure since I won't have airport utility.\n\nA: Without Airport Utility you will no longer be able to change the configuration on the Airport Express, but it will keep working with its current configuration.

I have an External HDD that I use to connect to a Windows OS (protected by Antivirus & similar tools).\nIf I connect it to my Ubuntu machine (which is not protected by any Antivirus tools) would it be a threat to my 900Gbs of files stored on my External Drive, after years of hardwork?\nThough I've done a bit of research regarding this, I've not yet got a clear answer.\nPlease reassure a newbie to Ubuntu it is safe.\n\nA: Viruses in the Linux world are, for all practical matters, non-existent. Unless you have valid reasons to believe that the Ubuntu machine you're going to use has been tampered with to destroy data in devices inserted in USB ports, you haven't nothing to worry about.\nHowever, from your question it looks like (I might be wrong) you haven't any backup of the data files.  If this is the case, you should do that ASAP: files can be damaged not only by viruses but also by disk crashes or human errors, such as deleting the wrong directory.\n\nA: Linux users have much less concern with such things as viruses because Windows saturates the marketplace. There is little concern of your external HDD would pick up a virus when connecting to a linux OS. Also, data loss is not a concern as the Linux OS will show what is there just as in Windows explorer, but files will only be changed if you do the changing. \n  I have a dual boot laptop (find myself using Ubuntu almost exclusively) and can see my Windows partitions at any time I wish from the Linux side within file manager. I have never had to be concerned with data loss in these partitions.\n  If you are working with an external HDD, you would need to mount this drive before seeing, and each partition would have to be mounted (see man mount in a terminal).\n  If this answer does not allay your concerns, my best advice is to not leave the external HDD on the system any longer than is necessary. Do what you wish to do with the external HDD and then umount and remove. Make the most of your copies (pics?) to minimize the time this external HDD is available.     \n\nA: I think that you are concerned to the point that no one or no information is going to allay your fears. \nUbuntu does not need antivirus tools. Not necessary. Your Windows experience, which I understand being an extensive Windows user myself, has you convinced that accessing your Windows HDD from an Ubuntu system still would need antivirus protection. That being the case, your best bet is to not access this\nexternal HDD from Ubuntu to avoid your concerns, best solution to your problem.\n\nA: Contrary to popular thought, malware in the Linux world does exist, but it's very very rare, and has to take advantages of elaborate vulnerabilities. In the Linux world, bigger threat is to servers, rather than desktop users: just as example, my server on Digital Ocean is being constantly attacked from variety IP addresses, but in all the time that I've had Ubuntu on my personal laptop - not a single threat.\nWindows malware cannot take advantage of a Linux system, however, if you have wine, the Windows compatibility layer, there is a chance of Windows malware attempting at attacking your system. \nThe point is that you are 99.99% safe and sound on Ubuntu. If you do feel safer with antivirus , there are clam-av  , tiger , all of which are installable through apt-get or Software Center. In all the time I've used Ubuntu thus far, I haven't heard of anyone using them , at least on a personal machine, and for myself there was no need thus far. \n", "Q: How to completely reset Gnome and desktop tweaks on Ubuntu 15.04?

I have a hard drive with bad sectors that I've found using badblocks and whatever Windows uses. I have Lubuntu installed on btrfs, and it's running smoothly for now (where Windows would freeze up), but is there a way to feed badblocks output to btrfs? Or does btrfs do all of this automatically already?\nI'm not storing any data that isn't important, this is really just to play around with btrfs and see how good it is at dealing with an actual bad hard drive.\n\nA: brtrfs doen't support badblocks. It currently assumes that all writes to the device succeed. Don't use it for a drive which is returning uncorrectable SMART sector errors.\nMore info and a work-around is available here.\nThe btrfs Project Ideas wiki says:\n\nNot claimed — no patches yet — Not in kernel yet\nCurrently btrfs doesn't keep track of bad blocks, disk blocks that are very likely to lose data written to them. Btrfs should accept a list in badblocks' output format, store it in a new btree (or maybe in the current extent tree, with a new flag), relocate whatever data the blocks contain, and reserve these blocks so they can't be used for future allocations. Additionally, scrub could be taught to test for bad blocks when a checksum error is found. This would make scrub much more useful; checksum errors are generally caused by the disk, but while scrub detects afflicted files, which in a backup scenario gives the opportunity to recreate them, the next file to reuse the bad blocks will just start getting errors instead. These two items would match an ext4 feature (used through e2fsck).\n\nPlease comment if the status changes and I will update this answer.\n", "Q: Dual boot Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS with Win 10 on separate hard drives I installed 14.04.3x64 LTS on hd1 with Win10 existing on hd0, using a live USB. No secure boot, no BIOS only UEFI options were selected from boot options firmware on HP desktop.\nMy intentions were to install Ubuntu make sure both OS would load then go back and set up rEFInd in the /boot/efi/EFI/refind directory of the new Ubuntu install, as I have on my laptop.\nUbuntu worked great, I updated played around with it then rebooted into Windows. Windoze worked and then ... Opps! When rebooting the Win boot menu gave me the option of Win and Ubuntu. On selecting Ubuntu it could not find Grub2 or the windows boot. \nWent back to the live USB stick and installed the Boot Repair utility and posted the boot-info results at pastebin URL: \nhttp://Paste.Ubuntu.com/14524321/\nThe boot utility indicated that there was no MBR on sda or sdb. My understanding was the I would only require an efi partition and Ubuntu boot would have an EFI section. \nI am confused on how to proceed. The utility says use diskpart and create MBR partition 150 - 250 MB and the utility tool would place Grub2 here then Ubuntu would boot. \nI think if I can get Ubuntu to boot back up from sdb2 from the efi boot order I have set in my firmware menu I could set up rEFInd in Ubuntu boot as documented on the refind web documents. After doing this I would be\nable to choose the efi boot system it detected which should include Win 10.\nThe only access I have now to the drives are through the Try Ubuntu drive on /dev/sdc.\nThanks for any suggestions.\n\nA: It looks like you've got an HP. Many HPs have known EFI bugs that prevent them from booting anything but Windows via the normal EFI boot order mechanism. This might be your problem; however....\nThere's no evidence of GRUB on your EFI System Partition (ESP; /dev/sda2 in your case). This might be an oversight of Boot Repair/Boot Info Script; it sometimes omits valid boot loader files. It could also be that the files have \"disappeared\" because of a filesystem error. This can happen because you haven't disabled the \"Fast Startup\" feature in Windows 8 and later. In Windows 8, you can do so as described here, among other places. In Windows 10, the instructions are here, among other places. (You may also need to disable hibernation, as described here.) Note that disabling Fast Startup won't fix any filesystem damage that already exists, so you may need to use Boot Repair or some other tool to re-install GRUB. Alternatively, since you want to use rEFInd in the long run, you can skip GRUB -- use rEFInd on a USB flash drive or CD-R (you can get images from its downloads page), boot Ubuntu using it, and install rEFInd.\n\nA: I solved this problem by using rEFInd and the documents provided by\nwww.rodsbooks.com. After installing Ubuntu 14.04.3 from the live USB and running the program some I booted back to Windows 10. This worked untill booting back to\nUbuntu, which gave me no boot menu to Windows or Ubuntu. \nI was able to get both hard drives back with the respective OS by using the bootable CD of rEFInd. This gave me the boot menu of Windows and ubuntu. \nAfter going in to the new install of Ubuntu on my second drive I ran the install\nprocedure described for Ubuntu by www.rodsbook.com and the rEFInd documentation.\nNow dual booting using the rEFInd menu with no issues.\n", "Q: Create desktop entry for executable I'm sure the solution for this is trivial, but I haven't found the way to create a desktop file for an executable!\nMy desktop file is:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=MOHAA LINUX\nExec=mohaa_lnx\nType=Application\nCategories=Game;\nStartupNotify=true\nPath=\"/home/lucho/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/EA GAMES/MOHAA/\"\nIcon=BE1A_MOHAA.0\nTerminal=false\n\nHow I currently run this application is on a terminal window, cd-ing into the Path above, and then running ./mohaa_lnx.

I've watched a few videos on Youtube and read a little bit on the internet about partitioning. But it is still unclear to me how to partition my 4 drives. Besides a Raspberry Pi and VM I have no Linux experience, so please explain it easy. I will be installing Ubuntu MATE over an existing Windows 10 installation which gives me problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*2x 2TB Seagate HDD in Raid0\n\n*1x 500GB Seagate HDD\n\n*1x 120GB Samsung 840 SSD\n\n\nFrom what I understand I need a / partition of about 20GB on the SSD, and /home is recommended to be on a big HDD. Would this mean all software I install in /home starts \"slow\" and doesn't benefit from my SSD at all? As /swap (16GB?) shouldn't be put on a SSD, what do I fill the other 100GB up with?\nIdeally I would like my boot times and program start times atleast as fast as Windows 10, which I installed completely on the SSD. All my important data is backed up and all my drives can be formatted. I've came across a program that caches applications in RAM (8GB enough?) would that be useful?\nTL;DR \nHow do I partition these drives to give me the best speed? \n\nA: Partitioning a disk does not increase speed. You benefit the most from a SSD if you put your \"/\" and /boot (if you want a separate partition for it onto the SSD. Booting my system from SSD takes about 7 to 10 seconds. \nIf I was you I would use the SSD for \"/\" and /home as a separate partition. But I would also not use /home for your personal data and change the ./config/users-dirs.dirs to change your directories to your 500Gb (so mount it as a partition). That way all the personal files and all your downloads etc do not wear your SSD. Swap on the 500Gb too. And the 2Tb can be another data partition.\nRegarding swap: feel free to take 8Gb, 16Gb pr even 32Gb. Old rule was to use 2x the amount of RAM but nowadays you might not even need it. It really depends on usages: if you hibernate/suspend you need it. If you turn of your machine (since it boots in a few seconds) you probably will not need it with normal usage.\nMind though: if you use the machine for the more heavy usage. Run a large database, run websites, run a gameserver or things like that it might be better to store some of those onto the SSD and not bother about the wear of the SSD. In that case I would go all out on the SSD and prepare for the disk to fail: backup frequently and have a spare SSD, or more than one, on the side.\n", "Q: Tweaking inside a chroot environment It's me again. I am creating an Ubuntu-based distribution by remastering 14.04's ISO (not with remastersys or any similar tool). I have all of my programs set up, including my default desktop enviroment (xfce4). But now I need to know which files I need to modify to change xfce's appearance from command line, in a chroot environment. I need to:\na) Set a default desktop background image;\nb) Change the desktop enviroment/icon theme to Numix;\nc) Tweak the window manager (xfwm4) settings.\nI already went to the ground up from a command line to a full-blown desktop with the programs I need, but I don't know how to change those settings in the chroot environment. If possible, I would want to edit configuration files so I can put them in /etc/skel. Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: You can use xfconf-query to edit Appearance settings from command line.\nSet Window Manager:\nxfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -s Numix\n\nSet theme:\nxfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s Numix\n\nSet icon theme: \nxfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/IconThemeName -s Numix\n\n(I believe you need to install the Numix icon theme package in Xubuntu 14.04. It was not listed in mine.)\nSet background image:\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p /backdrop/screen0/monitorHDMI-0/workspace0/last-image -s /path/to/your/image.jpg\n\nIn the man page for xfconf-query:\n-c, --channel\n              The channel to query/modify\n-p, --property\n              The property to query/modify\n-s, --set\n              The new value to set for the property\n\nIf you remove the -s and everything after it will tell you the current setting for what you are querying.\nTo make your own particular changes, you can open Settings Editor. Find the left hand menu item that contains the category that you want to change. This is the channel -c. Then for the property -p you can click on the property (for example, theme) to highlight it then click Edit to get the path. Finally type the name for what you want to change it to. It is caps sensitive. If there are two words, you'll want to put quotes around it. If there is an error in the name it goes to default. You'll need to add in the specifics of your display and background image.\nThe commands above change the following configuration files:\n~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xsettings.xml\n~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfwm4.xml\n~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-desktop.xml\n\nEnjoy!

My specific ps3 has a model number of CECH-2101A. Where do I need to go to get the modded firmware and do I need to take the hard drive out to install Linux onto it?\n\nA: Here is an extensive guide based on Ubuntu 6.10 from 2007 but you probably will fail to install it on your PS3. \nThe \"other OS\" option was disabled by firmware 3.21 in April 2010 and you will at least need an unpatched PS3 with a lower version.\nAnd then you got another problem: all the how to's will be about Ubuntu released older than 2010 and would require very good knowledge about the inner working of a PS3, the differences of old Ubuntu and new Ubuntu and how that impacts the old how-to's to use on a newer release. \n\nWhere do I need to go to get the modded firmware \n\nThere is no firmware for it and you also can not downgrade the firmware on the PS3 slim below the firmware it originally came with. That in itself makes me believe you will not be able to. A PS3 slim probably had firmware 3.40 and also will not even have a \"other OS\" option in the firmware. \n\nand do I need to take the hard drive out to install Linux onto it?\n\nNo, the hard disc is there to install games and does not contain the PS3 software itself.

If it's not, bang your head in a wall and say 25 prayers to our lord Torvalds (just kidding by the way). And format it as ext4. And clone Ubuntu again. When you're done, let's continue.\nThere may be more things to do, but the first, essential step is modifying your /etc/fstab file. This file is responsible for automounting some partitions (including the root partition) and it uses these partitions' UUIDs by default (UUIDs are exclusive identities given to some devices). Since UUIDs are unique, you'll have to change fstab. Plug in your external drive. Boot your computer into Ubuntu\nOpen a terminal and run sudo blkid /dev/sdXY. Replace sdXY with the name of your external drive (you should know it to this point, and assuming it only has one partition the Y number will be 1). The output will tell you its UUID, take note of it. Don't miss a single number/letter! Run:\nsudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt\nNow run sudo nano /mnt/etc/fstab. Find the line that has something like UUID=xxxxxx       /        ext4     defaults and replace xxxxxx with the UUID you got just before. Hit Ctrl+O then Enter to save the file and Ctrl+X to exit. You should now be able to boot your external drive! Congrats!\n", "Q: Games freezing on Steam I've heard of AMD drivers.

I would like to know if the Ubuntu OS can run Windows applications.\nSuch as .exe, .dll files.\nOr games like Call of Duty.\nWithout needing to download any application such as wine.\nMy guess is it doesn't but just to be sure I'll ask.\n\nA: Well, it's always tough to explain Linux to Windows newcomers. First tip ever: forget Windows. Linux is not and will never be Windows, just as Windows is not and will never be Linux. They are different. Period. Now the whole thing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux is an Unix-like system. What? Unix-like? Unix is an ancient operating system born in the 60's, when computers were huge and men were men, writing their own hardware drivers. Unix had a singular file system scheme and an amazing set of utilities. Unix-like systems are the ones that follow these characteristics. Nowadays Unix is extinct, but its soul is held in lots of Unix-like systems, such as the BSD's, Apple's Mac OSX, Minix and Linux. We can say most of the existing OSs today are either Windows NT based or Unix-like.\n\n*Windows systems need file extensions to handle their files. They simply do not know what to do with a file without an extension. Those include .exe (binaries/executables), .txt (text), .bat (batch scripts), among lots of others. \n\n*Most Unix-like systems do not need any file extensions. Instead of relying on the filename, there is a thing called \"MIME\" (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension). It's basically a bit of code written directly in the beginning of every file. It tells the system how to handle it. However we do use extensions sometimes just to tell the user if a file is, e.g., either a shell script (.sh) or a text file (.txt), even though it's not necessary.\n\n*There is a thing called kernel. A kernel is a piece of software which makes the \"translation\" from software language to hardware language and vice-versa. It's essential to any Operating System: no kernel, no OS. Windows uses the NT kernel, while Ubuntu uses the Linux kernel (that's why it's a Linux distribution). When a developer makes a program he uses a programming language, and this language must be translated to binary (computer language) before this program can run. This process is called \"compiling\". But each kernel has its own way of translating a program to computer language, so programs compiled for NT can't run natively on Linux, and vice \n-versa.\n\n*There is a very popular program for Unix-like Operating Systems called \"Wine\". Wine creates a compatibility layer so these OSs can run Windows programs. What Wine does is translating the program's requests to Linux language. You can install it in Ubuntu through the Software Center or through command line with the command sudo apt-get install wine. Right-click the .exe file you want to run and click \"open with Wine\". Note that some applications may not work.\n\n*And last, but not less important (actually the most important one), there are ALWAYS free, open-source, native alternatives and solutions for Windows programs in Linux. Don't forget that!!!\nP.S.: sorry for so much \"language\" and \"translation\" examples, it's the best way I found to explain.\n\nA: It is not as simple as that. While software written for Linux generally does not use the .exe extension, and dynamically loaded libraries typically have .so, more often with a version after that for stable libraries, there are some pieces of software which do use the .exe or .dll extensions, though they are not necessarily programs for Windows. For example, things written in the C# programming language, will have these file extensions.\nYou cannot directly run Windows programs on Ubuntu (or other versions of Linux). Some may be usable through the Wine translation layer that can be installed and used. However, more and more applications are becoming available for Ubuntu, and Linux in general, every day.\n", "Q: Problem installing Dolphin-emu, Unmet dependencies When attempting to install Dolphin-Emu, I have come across a un-met dependences that are preventing the installation.

According to Rod Smith's UEFI docs at http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/grub2.html, grub.cfg can either be installed alongside grubx64.efi on the EFI partition, or left in /boot/ on a linux partition. Apparently, Ubuntu uses the latter method.\nMy question is: how does GRUB find the Linux partition if there are more of them? Is grubx64.efi a custom build for every install, containing a partition UUID? Is there a search order for Linux partitions?\nWhat I'm looking for specifically: is it possible to set up multiple GRUB installs on the UEFI level, with e.g. two grubx64.efi files, each using a different GRUB config file?\n(My specific use case is installing Ubuntu alongside SteamOS which already has GRUB installed, with the least amount of changes possible.)\n\nA: The location of GRUB's configuration file is hard-coded in the grubx64.efi binary. The last I checked, Ubuntu worked in one of two ways, depending on which package you installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you install the Secure Boot-capable version of GRUB, it looks in EFI/ubuntu on the same volume as the GRUB binary for grub.cfg. This file is then customized to point back to /boot/grub/grub.cfg, referring to the partition by UUID number.\n\n*If you install the non-Secure-Boot version of GRUB, the package modifies the grubx64.efi binary at install time so that it refers directly to /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\n\n\nNote that it's been a while since I checked these details, and I never delved into them all that deeply, so I may be mistaken about some of this.\nThe upshot of this is that, if you want to use two GRUBs that point to two different configuration files, you must modify the grubx64.efi binary yourself. There's an old Ubuntu wiki page that describes how to build GRUB for EFI. This page is mostly outdated, and in fact points to another page as a replacement; but the new page doesn't describe the \"nuts and bolts\" of building a GRUB binary. It's been a while since I reviewed the old page in any depth, so I can't promise it will tell you what you need to know, but it may.\nIMHO, this is all too much effort. ELILO, SYSLINUX, and rEFInd all use configuration files in their home directories, so you can install a dozen of each (in separate directories) and each of them will have its own configuration file. These programs' configuration files are all also much easier to maintain than is GRUB 2's -- although if you're doing it by hand, GRUB 2 needn't be all that much worse than others.\nFor your specific case, you might find a single rEFInd installation to be the best option. It auto-detects kernels on each boot, so one rEFInd installation will handle both your distributions with no need for extra configuration when you update a kernel. (You may need to set up a /boot/refind_linux.conf file in each distribution to handle distribution-specific kernel options, though.) Caveat: I'm rEFInd's maintainer, so I'm not exactly unbiased.\n", "Q: eth0 changed to eno1 and 70-persistent-net.rules is missing I booted up Ubuntu, noticed I had no internet.

It's alright if I'm using a dark theme but I'm using a light theme and it's almost the same color as my panel.\n\nA: Every application installed with dpkg or apt-get has a *.list file in /var/lib/dpkg/info folder. Those files list everything associated with that application, including images. According to /var/lib/dpkg/info/steam.list, there is /usr/share/pixmaps/steam_tray_mono.png file, which is the icon you wish to change. You could take that image and replace it with another ( of the same size preferably, which on my system is reported as 48x48 pixels ).  Example of that would be a two-step process, like so:\nBackup original image first,\nsudo mv /usr/share/pixmaps/steam_tray_mono.png  /usr/share/pixmaps/steam_tray_mono.png.bak \n\nMove in the new one\n sudo mv /path/to/new/image.png /usr/share/pixmaps/steam_tray_mono.png\n\n\nA: Basically, you cannot change Steam's menu icon. You can temporarily replace it with another icon, but it will eventually get replaced with whatever Steam wants it to be, during an update.\nYou should probably contact Steam support to complain that the Steam tray icon does not work well with light themes, and hopefully they will fix it in an update, so it works well on both.\n", "Q: Why does second terminal tab prompt bundle install If I run rails s in the terminal, it works.

But that is not mandatory and keeping more than one kernel to use those as a fallback is a sane decision. \nThe only problem you can run into is a too small boot partition. But even then it does not change the current active kernel so you can always stop, reboot, pick the kernel that did work before you started and continue to use Ubuntu. \n\nWould you suggest me to do so?\n\nIf I was still on 14.04 I would install the new kernel. Not even for it to be the active kernel. But to get the experience of installing kernels. So to see what happens, how it works, where a problem might occur. How to fix something. \n\nA: \nWhy I want this?\n\nLike you said yourself, newer kernel gives advantage of using newer drivers ( in the Linux terminology - modules ). In addition , newer kernels have security improvements and fixes. \n\nWould you suggest me to do so?\n\nThe decision is yours. If you don't care about using newest drivers and pretty sure you won't be a target of malicious hackers , then stick with the kernel you have right now. \n\nIs it safe to do so?\n\nFor the most part - yes. In the experience of 99% of the users , there should be no issues. Once you upgrade to newer kernel , older kernels are still there. So if you ever wanted to go back to old kernel , there is a way to do so. See How can I boot with an older kernel version?\n\nWhat additional changes/risks I would have to handle?\n\nLike I said before , for 99% of users there should be no risks. Make sure you have important files backed up - that's the best thing you can do to prepare for possible issues. \n", "Q: Whats the best distribution Linux to use in a USB Persistent? i would like to know wich is the best distribution to use in USB 3.0, i would like to use Linux in computers to show some one how is it working and how easy is to use Linux, i try to use Ubuntu but cant install for example Wine, i try to install XUbuntu but not boot from USB.\nSome one now which one is the best? i got USB 3.0 Sandisk 32gb SDCZ43\nThank you for your time. \n\nA: Based on the information you supply there is no \"best\". \n\n\n*\n\n*\"wine\" is the same on any Ubuntu version so not usable for comparison.\n\n*\"booting from usb\" is a generic BIOS option, depends on a correctly burned installer but that is about it.\n\n\n\"wine\" is a hassle on a normal installation. It will perform even worse on a live session. I would avoid it at any cost anyways and opt for \"steam\" if you want to show a gaming experience. Or even stick with the gaming section. Mind that gaming requires a well working system. A live session is not the best setup for it. \nIf you want people to experience the power of Ubuntu I would argue you should use Ubuntu (Unity), kUbuntu (KDE), Ubuntu Mate. The other versions are intended for lower end systems so do not give a full experience. In general they drop graphics, animations and use applications that have a lower power consumption. \nIt would be better to use a notebook and not a live session.\n", "Q: Permission error in virtual machine manager I am trying to install win8.1 as a guest on my Ubuntu 14.04 using KVM and virt manager. When I choose the path of the ISO file in virt manager, it throws this error:\n\nThe emulator may not have search permissions for the path '/media/owerfoll/B/windows8.1 Enterprise.iso'\n\nHow I can fix this?!\n\nA: Just encountered this setting up a VM. Pressing the Yes button to automatically fix the problem sets extended ACLs on the file. You can see this by running an ls -l on your directory, and checking the permissions for other. \nInstead of opening up permissions for all users in other, you can explicitly set them using setfacl\nFrom the man page:\nEXAMPLES\n   Granting an additional user read access\n          setfacl -m u:lisa:r file\n\nSince I wanted to grant the libvirt-qemu user execute rights to install my vm, I ran:\n    setfacl -m u:libvirt-qemu:x \n\nThis sets permissions for specific users, without changing the execute bit for an entire group of the directory. I'm a fan of the tighter control. The permissions on the file should read something like -rw-rw-r-+, with the + meaning there are extended permissions set. \nYou could just press the Yes button and not worry about what it's doing, but I chose to check it out. I was then able to continue setup in virt-manager without running with sudo and without further error. \n\nA: Just wanted to toss in my problem/solution in case it helps anyone.  I was letting the OS (GalliumOS in my case) decide how and where to mount my external USB SSD where my virtual machine is stored.  \nIt was mounting to /media/<me>/MySSD by default.\nI installed gnome-disk-utility, and went in and reconfigured the mount options for that USB drive.  I unchecked \"use system defaults\" and let gnome disks fill in the rest of the settings by itself, which change my mount point to /dev/\nThen virt-manager no longer had any issues accessing my gcow file\nYou can do it manually in /etc/fstab, this was just faster for me. \n\nA: I had the same issue as well. I fixed it by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run virt-manager with sudo:\n\n\n        sudo virt-manager\n\n\n\n*Attempt to create your VM. When the error dialog appears, click Yes to correct the error.\nWhat this does is change the user and group of your image file (to libvirt-qemu:libvirt-qemu if that's your virt-manager user). You could also sudo chown libvirt-qemu:libvirt-qemu <image-file> if you want to do it manually.\n\n*When you get to the next step, cancel the creation process and close virt-manager.\n\n*Now relaunch virt-manager without sudo and attempt to create your VM again.\n", "Q: Partitioning for Windows 10 + Ubuntu + any distro I'm reading a lot these days in order to make a clean a safe partitioning of my single drive. I have Windows 10 installed already on a 60Gb partition. Now I'd like to use the rest of the space for Ubuntu and one more distro (let's say Debian). Here is my plan so far.\nPartitioning\nWindows has already created an extra 500Mb partition for the system (don't ask me more about it, I have no clue), so, currently my drive looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*500 Mb ntfs for \"the system\"\n\n*60 Gb ntfs for Windows 10\n\n*240 Gb of free space for whatever I want\n\n\nAs far as I know, I can't add more than 2 partitions. Here is what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 primary ext4 partition dedicated to Grub\n\n*1 extended ext4 partition for swap, distros and storage\n\n\nThen, the extended partition would be divided into 4 parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 ext4 partition for swap\n\n*1 ntfs partition for storage shared by all OSs (including Windows)\n\n*1 ext4 partition for Ubuntu (20 Gb)\n\n*1 ext4 partition for Debian (20 Gb)\n\n\nStorage\nI will have to bind the OSs to the storage partition. I've found something close to what I would do here https://askubuntu.com/a/223670/392225. Though, I'd like to divide the storage folder into multiple users like so.\nstorage/\n  userA/\n  userB/\n\nThus, the global map would look like this:\nWindows : C:/[user]    -> storage/[user]\nUbuntu  : /home/[user] -> storage/[user]\nDebian  : /home/[user] -> storage/[user]\n\nGiven a couple of symlinks like /home/[user]/Downloads -> /media/storage/[user]/Downloads, I assume that Linux is able to allow access to /home/[user] (that is to say to linked folders located at /media/storage/[user]), and deny access to the root of the partition mounted at /media/storage.\nQuestions :-)\n\n\n*\n\n*What do you think of this partitioning? As a beginner, I guess there are some details I'm not aware of. It would be great if you could show me the potential pitfalls and improvements.\n\n*Is it safe? I'd like to prevent user A from accessing the folder of user B. I have a little idea of how to deal with permissions on Linux (chmod I guess), but no experience at all on Windows.\n\n*Have you got a better solution? If your own PC currently uses such a structure, would you mind to share some details about your own choices?\n\n*Regarding Linux permissions on mounted drives, is my assumption correct?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing seems to say that installing Grub on a dedicated partition is a bad idea. I'm not sure to get it right, but if so, is it to say that Grub can't be installed without installing Linux first?\n\nA: 1) This partitioning should work just fine, though be sure to read up on how and where to install GRUB to ensure it can be found during booting. More information about that here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n2) With the storage partition being an NTFS partition any access control will not work in both Linux and Windows.\n3) I use a structure with 2 SSDs (1 for Ubuntu and 1 for Windows) and some shared HDDs. The shared HDDs are formated as NTFS and do not use any sort of access control. Most of my data is on there and as this machine is just used by me, I do not need any way to limit access to those from either OS.\n", "Q: How to prevent additional distros from installing their own GRUB boot loader I recently installed Kubuntu 15.10 on top of a dual-boot with Ubuntu Studio 15.10 and Windows 10. Yesterday I removed the Kubuntu, as I felt it wasn't stable enough.\nAs I had suspected, the Kubuntu, when installed at the time, replaced the GRUB in Ubuntu with it's own, although it found the other OSes after sudo update-grub.\nWhen I deleted the partition containing the Kubuntu 15.10, it's GRUB went with it, and I had to boot into grub rescue mode, which was actually fairly straightforward, using these instructions.\nIs there a way to prevent a new Ubuntu, or any new Linux for that matter, from replacing the existing GRUB with it's own, and appointing itself as the first OS?\nI'd prefer to keep the existing GRUB, and run sudo update-grub in the Ubuntu Studio - which I want to be my number one distro - to find any recently installed distros, and add them to the boot order.\nI searched other answers, but didn't find any clear instructions on how to do this. If I missed something, I'd be glad to know, and would happily remove this question, if it turns out to be a duplicate.\n\nA: Not being a multi-distro user for a number of years and,  if I remember correctly. \nWhat happens is that the 2nd distro (and later ones) only ADDS information to the existing GRUB file and does not replace the file itself. \nAgain,  IF,  I repeat IF,  I remember correctly,  GRUB assums that the last distro knstalled is the primary version and places it in the first position for booting unattended. \nWhile GRUB can be edited,  I found it simpler to press the boot menu key while startingvand selectingvthe OS that I wanted from the boot menu when it appeared. \n", "Q: How to list all the hostname in my network?

I'm trying to add Windows entry to GRUB2 on my Ubuntu 14.0.4 LTS. \nAlthough \"Windows 10\" selection is there, but it fails to boot and warns \nEFI invalid ...\nBelow are a few screenshots I've captured:\n\n\nPlease tell me how to use grub-customiser to make the entry boot rightly to Windows 10. \nMany thanks!\n\nA: First, you say you see the following message when you try to boot Windows:\nEFI invalid ...\n\nIs that exactly what you see, or are you omitting something and replacing it with the elipsis (...)? If the latter, please report the complete error message you see, since it may contain important information. Also, are you getting this message when you launch your customized entry or another one that was created automatically?\nSecond, it's possible that you're running into this bug. If so, the easiest workaround is to disable Secure Boot on your computer. Other alternatives include using another distribution's GRUB (OpenSUSE's is said to work) or using my rEFInd instead of GRUB.\nThird, your GRUB Customizer screen shot shows what looks like an entry for launching Windows in BIOS mode; but your GParted screen shot indicates a GPT disk, which in turn means that Windows must be booting in EFI mode. Thus, your BIOS-mode entry simply will not work. The GRUB configuration scripts should detect the EFI-mode Windows boot loader, so there should be no need to create a custom entry. Typing sudo update-grub should re-run the setup script. That might pick up your Windows boot loader.\nFinally, if GRUB's setup scripts are not detecting Windows, it could be that your EFI System Partition (ESP; your /dev/sda2, which should be mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu) is damaged.

I often take screenshots with shutter and do screen recordings with other applications, and sometimes I have my desktop picture set to something private that I don't want people looking at my screencasts or screenshots to see... So I end up having to temporarily change my desktop picture, and this is getting rather annoying... So I was wondering if there is a way to make it so that the screen capturing applications see a different desktop picture to the actual one I have set? So that I don't have to change the desktop picture, but the capturing applications just see it as another which I have specified? I would at least like it for shutter if not all screen capturing applications.\nI am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: Toggle your wallpaper\nNot literally what you asked for, yet the best option, as far as I can see: a key short cut to toggle between your usual wallpaper (the script will find out), and a pre- chosen wallpaper, to be set in the head of the script.\nMy secret wallpaper: (which I don't want people to see) :)\n\nPress the shortcut, My \"public\" wallpaper is set. Take the screenshot:\n\nPress the shortcut again:\n\nWhy this seems the best option\n\n\n*\n\n*In your question you mention automatically \"replacing\" the wallpaper in the screen shot (or recording), by another wallpaper. However, all applications you mention make a recording in one layer of pixels. Separating wallpaper and foreground is quite impossible, unless you do it manually (which is a demanding job).\n\n*In comments, we spoke about automatically set another wallpaper once the screen shot is (going to be) taken, but since you run Shutter in the background continuously, and you run the command from its panel menu, it seems impossible to find a trigger. The pid of Shutter obviously isn't, and the menu does not appear as a window in the output of wmctrl -l\n\n*Even if we could find a child process of Shutter once the screen shot is being taken, the action would have taken place before we can change the wallpaper.\n\n\nSo...\nBelow a script to use under a short cut key, to toggle your wallpaper:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\n# --- set your replacement- wallpaper below\nimage = \"/path/to/your/image\"\n# ---\n\ncurrwall = os.environ[\"HOME\"] + \"/.set_wall\"\nkey = [\n    \"gsettings \",\n    \"get \", \"set \",\n    \"org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri\",\n    ]\n\ndef get(command):\n    return subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef run(command):\n    subprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\nif not os.path.exists(currwall):\n    # save the (path to the) currently used wallpaper to an invisible file\n    cmd = key[0]+key[1]+key[-1]\n    open(currwall, \"wt\").write(get(cmd))\n    # set the temporary wallaper\n    cmd = key[0]+key[2]+key[-1]+\" 'file://\"+image+\"'\"\nelse:\n    # read the file, restore the original wallpaper\n    cmd = key[0]+key[2]+key[-1]+\" \"+open(currwall).read()\n    # remove the temporary file\n    os.remove(currwall)\nrun(cmd)\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as toggle_wallpaper.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set the secondary wallpaper, that should replace the usual one.\n# --- set your replacement- wallpaper below\nimage = \"/path/to/your/image\"\n# ---\n\n\n*Test- run the script with the command:\npython_3 /path/to/toggle_wallpaper.py\n\n(two times to set the secondary- and restore the original wallpaper)\n\n*Add the command to a shortcut key: choose: System Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts.

I am currently running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, though I used to (a long while back) run Windows 7, and though Ubuntu is better in most ways, there is still a feature lacking or at least a feature which I haven't found yet...\nIs there any way of making it so that on the locked/login screen after a certain number (defined by me) of incorrect password attempts it doesn't allow the user to enter their password for a certain amount of time (defined by me) and also logs this to a log?\nSo for instance if a user enters an incorrect password 3 times they are not allowed to try again for another 5 minutes and this is also logged to a log defined by me. \nIt would also be useful if I could also optionally make it so that say the user tries to enter their password and gets it wrong 2 times, if they within the next 5 minutes try again it locks them out for 5 minutes, however if they try again after 5 minutes have gone the counter of incorrect password attempts is reset back to 0.\nIs there already such a feature? Or perhaps a way of manually implementing it with a script or something?\n\nA: Some background info:\nUser log-ins are handled by the PAM system (Pluggable Authentication Module) and in this particular case by the pam_tally subsystem (to tally the user accounts).\nAs pam_tally itself will be deprecated, you should use pam_tally2, which comes in two parts:\n\n*\n\n*pam_tally2.so being the module that does the authentication itself and which you need to add to the PAM system\n\n*pam_tally2 being a stand-alone program that you'll need to display, change and clear individual counts\n\nThe parameters of pam_tally2 you're interested in are:\ndeny=n\n    Deny access if tally for this user exceeds n.\nlock_time=n\n    Always deny for n seconds after failed attempt.\nunlock_time=n\n    Allow access after n seconds after failed attempt. If this\n    option is used the user will be locked out for the specified\n    amount of time after he exceeded his maximum allowed attempts.\n    Otherwise the account is locked until the lock is removed by a\n    manual intervention of the system administrator.\nmagic_root\n    If the module is invoked by a user with uid=0 the counter is\n    not incremented. \neven_deny_root\n    Root account can become unavailable.\n\nThe configuration:\nAdd the following lines to /etc/pam.d/login to lock the account after 3 failed logins (also for the root account) and have it unlocked automatically after 50 minutes.\nauth     required       pam_securetty.so\nauth     required       pam_tally2.so deny=3 even_deny_root lock_time=60 unlock_time=3000\nauth     required       pam_env.so\nauth     required       pam_unix.so\nauth     required       pam_nologin.so\naccount  required       pam_unix.so\npassword required       pam_unix.so\nsession  required       pam_limits.so\nsession  required       pam_unix.so\nsession  required       pam_lastlog.so nowtmp\nsession  optional       pam_mail.so standard\n\nAfter adding the above congiguration, test it and log out and do try to log in 3 times with a bogus password: 60 seconds to wait after first and second attempt and 50 minutes after the third try.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 and Epson Artian 837 I just installed Ubuntu 15.10 and would like to install drivers for my Artisan 837 printer.

Note that I do not mean to crop the video.\nHow could this be done from the command line for individual videos (i.e. not as a general setting for all videos played)?\n\nA: Shortcuts\nYou can cycle through the different aspect ratios with A.\nWhile you didn't want to crop the video this can be done with C, cycling through audio tracks is B and subtitles is… V.\nYou can find the complete list of shortcuts in the VLC settings menu.\n\nA: VLC Aspect Ratio\nBy selecting the correct aspect ratio, a video that would normally have black bars either at the sides or top&bottom may appear to be a video that can fit your screen.\nMost modern wide screen laptop computers have a 16:9 aspect ratio, this might not be the case for you.\nOriginal Aspect Ratio\n\nInstructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Video\n\n*Pause Video\n\n*Double Click video to go into full screen\n\n*Righ Click video to open menu\n\n\n*Go into Video -> Aspect Ratio\n\n*Select your aspect ratio. 16:9 for me.\n\n*Play and enjoy :\n\nRemember your aspect ratio may be different from mine. If your computer screen is not 16:9 try some other values until you get the right one.\nUn-stretch Video\nTo watch videos on their original aspect ratio (without stretching) but covering the entire screen follow the steps above but select the correct aspect ratio under Video -> Crop.\nDefault must be kept under Aspect Ratio for this to work or nothing will need to be cropped.\nReturn to defaults\nReturn all values you changed to default.\nCommand Line VLC\nUse command vlc --aspect-ratio 16:9 -L -f /directory/to/file/filename.\nChange the aspect ratio value to your screen's aspect ratio and it should play full screen without borders.

I live in Chile and here we speak spanish.\nAll my system is set to spanish (even the fact that I don't have any problem with english, Thanks God!).\nBut... I wonder... Why some apps (games and others) I installed with the Ubuntu Software Center appear in english in this PC, but are in spanish in my laptop PC?\nCan I fix it? How?\n\nA: Not all applications have been internationalized, or not translated in Spanish yet.  As many (most) applications are built in English, this becomes the default language.  \nIf the application has been built following the internationalizing you application guidelines, you can build a Spanish message bundle for the application.  The Ubuntu Internationalization Guide provides more details.  Providing your translations will help the general community.\nSome applications provide message bundles as a separate package.  These applications are likely to using English unless you install the appropriate internationalization package.\n", "Q: Partition sizes different in df and fdisk I'm seeing different sizes using df vs fdisk commands.

If you have multiple Physical Volumes you can add the names of one or more of them to the end of the command to limit which ones should be used to satisfy the request.\nAfter extending the Logical Volume you need to expand the filesystem to use the new space.

What do letters b and c mean at the beginning of the 10-symbol code describing the items' privileges?\nFrom what I understand, when typing ls -l, the terminal provides a list of all items in a directory. Each item description is preceded by a 10-symbol code. This code says what the item type is (first symbol) and what the item privileges for the user, the user group and all other users are.\n\n*\n\n*If the first symbol is a dash -, the item is a file.\n\n\n*If the first symbol is the letter d, the item is a directory.\n\n\n*If the first symbol is letter l, the item is a link / shortcut.\nFor example:\n$ ls -l /home/phodor\ntotal 68\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 phodor phodor 4096 Dec 20 12:02 Documents\ndrwxr-xr-x 9 phodor phodor 4096 Jan 17 12:02 Desktop\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 phodor phodor 4096 Jan 13 22:42 Downloads\n-rw-r--r-- 1 phodor phodor 8980 Jun 27  2015 hello.txt\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 phodor phodor   29 Jan 17 12:02 MyEBook -> /home/phodor/Documents/EBook.pdf\n\nHowever some the 10-symbol code can also start with b or c for some items:\n$ ls -l /dev\ncrw--w---- 1 root tty  4, 0 Jan 17 09:19 tty0\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 1, 0 Jan 17 09:19 ram0\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 Jan 17 09:19 sda\n\nWhat do b and c mean?

Therefore ~ is not expanded.\nThis is a commonly made mistake :)\nExceptions concerning icons are a.o. described here:\n\nIcon to display in file manager, menus, etc. If the name is an\n  absolute path, the given file will be used. If the name is not an\n  absolute path, the algorithm described in the Icon Theme\n  Specification will be used to locate the icon.\n\nand here:\n\nIcon field is the icon that should be used by the launcher and\n  represents the application.

In all other cases, you need to quote the path steps with a space:\nExec=/home/jacob/Bureaublad/some folder/application\n\nwill fail, while\nExec=\"/home/jacob/Bureaublad/some folder/application\"\n\nor \nExec=/home/jacob/Bureaublad/\"some folder\"/application\n\nwill work fine\n", "Q: View two text files at the same time side by side I have two text files.

If my share is connected via ethernet i cant connect to it via wifi (eventhough I can ssh with no problem). Then i make easiest share possible with no fancy masks end forcing options, only to test if it works. If not then I'm checking logs to see if it's stopped by any security mechanism (it could be firewall, iptables, selinux). For home usage I'm switching all security off and test it again. Then, if it works I form my share policy in smb.conf and reset smb and nmb. And them I'm checking if my share still works. And then I switch my security back on, one by one to find which one is blocking my smb. This is how you can learn using selinux. I forgot to mention most improtant thing. Alwayas check premissions, and host part of samba configuration. You must be shure that you have unix premissions on your share. \n\nA: You might want to make sure you have a user configured for Samba. Try smbpasswd -a [user] (needs to map to a unix user). Also try setting your log level higher and look in /var/log/samba/log.smbd for clues, it should also create a log.[clientname] as well, once a user can connect anyway.

Is it a requirement for a drive to use GPT partition table if wanted use UEFI boot? Or is it still possible to use MBR partition table as format for drive's partitions and have bootloader saved in a separated EFI partition?\nAs I understand for now, MBR contains both, information about drive's partitions and boot loader. But UEFI firmware requires boot loader to be placed in separated EFI (FAT32) partition. So if UEFI firmware supports MBR format as a format for drive's partitions, everything should be ok, am I correct?\nUPDATE:\nBackground: I have single Xubuntu 14.04 installation on SSD drive, currently it's using BIOS boot with MBR partition table type. I'd like to convert to UEFI boot, I'm wondering if it's possible to continue to safely use MBR as partition table type with separated EFI partition created for boot loader.\nI'm familiar with BIOS-UEFI conversation process.\nThank you for your answers!\n\nA: It's theoretically possible to use an MBR partition table in an EFI-mode boot; however, almost nobody does this, so it's poorly tested. Also, in my own (brief) tests with this method, it seems to produce more problems related to boot loader naming and NVRAM entries (as managed by efibootmgr in Ubuntu). Thus, it's not something I recommend. The saying \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" probably applies to your case -- you say you'd \"like\" to convert to EFI-mode booting, but you've provided no reason for this. In the absence of such a reason, I'd say it's inadvisable to do the conversion, since nothing's \"broke.\"\nAlso, if you set up an EFI-mode boot from an MBR disk, I can't promise that future Ubuntu updates will like it. It's conceivable that the Ubuntu installer or update process would choke, possibly creating serious problems down the line. OTOH, it all might go just fine. That's part of why \"untested\" in this context translates to \"you probably don't want to try this\" -- there are just too many unknowns, both now and in the future.\nThat said, if you must do such a conversion, you can certainly try it with an MBR partition table. If you run into problems with NVRAM entries not \"taking,\" you should then do an MBR-to-GPT conversion. Alternatively, you can just plan to do the conversion from the start. See my Web page on the subject for details. Note that partition table data structures are actually quite simple, and the conversion requires no changes to filesystems. Thus, the odds of a catastrophic failure are quite low. If you use gdisk, a problem is most likely to turn up when the program loads the MBR data structures and converts in memory to GPT. At this point, you'll be warned, or at least be told of the problem if you do a disk verification (v in the main menu), so you can abort the operation before writing anything back to disk. OTOH, no partitioning operation is entirely risk-free, and if a problem does occur, it can be catastrophic, so having backups is wise.\n", "Q: Scanned pdf to doc Does anybody know if there is a free online OCR converter that can convert large scanned pdf documents(for instance i want to convert a scanned pdf document of 28MB size)?\nI have tried many ocr converters ,but all of them failed.\n\nA: You can install ocrfeeder\n\nYou can install it by opening the software center and searching \"OCRFeeder\" then click install.

I had previously searched how to fix broken packages, but none of the solutions fixed the whole problem. I searched instead for the Hash Sum mismatch error I was getting at the end of apt-get update, and found this solution, that solved the problem.\nAnswer copied here for completeness:\nRemove the content of /var/lib/apt/lists directory:\nsudo rm -fR /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nthen run:\nsudo apt-get update \nApparently, and you gurus can correct or elaborate, the clean and autoclean flags for apt-get didn't completely purge the problem children from apt/lists directory.\n\nA: Instead of add-apt-repository which you need python-software-properties package for, try the built in apt-add-repository.  Works in Precise, Trusy and Xenial right out of the box.  See manpage for details.\nNote both commands look the same, but look at the order of the apt.  The built in one starts with apt, where as the other one starts with add.\n\nA: I found this, which worked for me\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\nUsing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server\n", "Q: Quit LightDM & launch a new x-session with an alternative xorg.conf I'm using Ubuntu 15.10 with the following configuration:\nLightDM, XFCE, set to one screen across two physical monitors running from two outputs on a single NVIDIA card.\nThis is my normal environment where I can drag windows/apps/etc between the monitors, play Steam games (most let me choose which monitor to play on) and do general office stuff like have email on one screen and a word processor doc on the other\nI also have X-Plane flight simulator, where the ideal way to run across two screens is to have two instances of X-Plane running with each one accessing its own physical monitor.\nFor X-Plane, I like to open a new terminal with CTRL-ALT-F1 and then run the following. This runs X-Plane with no desktop environment:\nxplane.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nxinit /home/ashley/Launch_Scripts/XP64.sh\n\necho  \"Restart desktop ?

However its a little unrealistic - the centre of the two screens is centred on the view from the L or R sitting position in the aircraft and not as you would see when flying for real.\nHence the recommendation that two individual screens should have two individual instances of X-Plane, one for the student pilot or first officer and another where (usually) the instructor pilot or captain would sit.\nI've created another xorg.conf this time with two individual screens, and confirmed this works by putting in place of my usual xorg.conf - two completely separate screens, I can move the cursor between them but can't drag a window.\nWhat I can't figure out is, in the X-Plane bash scripts above, if & how I could call upon a separate xorg.conf when launching via xinit.\nI've tried:\nxinit /home/ashley/Launch_Scripts/XP64.sh -config /path/to/modified.xorg.conf\n\nBut it just ignores me - wherever I put the modified xorg.conf, whatever permissions I give it.\nMy first question is am I going about this the right way?\nUltimately I want to be able to run two instances of X-Plane, each on one an individual screen/monitor, but also revert to my single screen (across two monitors) for my normal day-to-day stuff.\nMy second question is, if so, what I am doing wrong? (I think its loading the default xorg.conf from /etc/X11/ whatever I specify in the script)\nShould I post my xorg.conf files here too? \nI'm not closed to the idea of creating another session (i.e.: like choosing from XFCE or Unity from the login screen) with its own settings if that would be easier to manage.\n\nA: Error was in syntax:\nxinit /home/ashley/Launch_Scripts/XP64.sh -config /path/to/modified.xorg.conf\n\nShould be:\nxinit /home/ashley/Launch_Scripts/XP64.sh -- -config modified.xorg.conf\n\nBoth xorg.conf and modified.xorg.conf are located in /etc/X11/\n", "Q: close/minimize/maximize controls of windows absent , ctrl+alt+T not working, dash and launcher absent post resizing system partition I am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\nMy Terminal & Unity are not working.\nWhen login i see my Ctr+Alt+T is not working, login screen bland, no dash, no launcher.

I'm trying to install simplified Chinese input and I think I've installed it correctly- I can change the keyboard input to Chinese, and when I do that, Chinese characters pop out.\nHowever, either there is something buggy about this input method, or I'm not using it right, because for example when I try to type \"lao\" (as in \"laoshi\"), I get:\n拉o\nAny advice?\n\nA: You have exactly the same problem as I had when I used iBus Pinyin. In my opinion it must be a bug of the program. (This version of iBus does not work any more.) The program (IME) erroneously only accepts 2 keystrokes per character, and when pinyin (commonly) requires more than 2 keystrokes per character, the remaining keystrokes, in your case the \"o\" will go into forming other characters.\nI switched to sunpinyin, which also comes with iBus.

This askubuntu question identifies/locates the \" ` \" key on the keyboard, and discusses its use in window switching.  \nThis question addresses the use of backticks for the shell.\nHowever, why is the backtick used in combination with a single quote in man pages (e.g. in the 2nd or 3rd paragraph down in the fstab man page, `like such.'). Is it related to HTML formatting, similar to how backticks are used on this forum to format code examples?\n\nA: The use of different symbols for opening and closing quote is just a common typographic style. See Wikipedia: Quotation mark - Electronic documents - Typewriters and early computers:\n\nTypographically, there are two types of quotation marks:\n'…' and \"…\", are known as neutral, vertical, straight, typewriter, or \"dumb\" quotation marks. The left and right marks are identical.\n‘…’ and “…”, are known as typographic, curly, curved, or book quotes. The left (start) and right (end) forms are different, resemble small figures six and nine raised above the baseline (like 6…9 and 66…99), but then solid, i.e., with the counters filled. In many typefaces, the shapes are the same as those of an inverted (upside down) and normal comma.\n\nThe second ‘…’ typographic style is the one used in man pages.\nA similar style is used for double quotes in Latex, except the ` and ' characters are repeated twice to signify the double quote:\n\n``You were a little grave,'' said Alice.\n\n", "Q: Can't install needed python3-scope-harness for Ubuntu Scopes dev in Go At https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/scopes/tutorials/developing-scopes-go/ it tells me to run\n\nsudo apt-get install unity-scope-tool golang git bzr python3-scope-harness mercurial\n\nBut I receive the error:\n\nE: Package 'python3-scope-harness' has no installation candidate\n\n(Pastie: http://pastebin.com/f5fYSUfr)\nAccording to http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=trusty-backports&keywords=python3-scope-harness , python3-scope-harness has not been backported to Trusty (14.04).

I'm just a simple user frustrated with Windows 10 and I want to leave Windows altogether.\nHowever, I don't want to spend three weeks learning how to install the new system and then get all my current programs to work.\nI am not setting up a server, I am not a developer and I do not want all my stuff on a cloud.\n\nA: I played around with a bootable USB stick running 14.04 for a few weeks before I made the leap, and I highly recommend doing that first.  If you're not willing to commit 100% to learning the environment, you might consider partitioning your drive and running Ubuntu alongside Windows 10.\nI also suggest you make a list of all your \"must-have\" applications and search for versions compatible with Linux or alternatives.  That way you can plan what you need to install as soon as you install Ubuntu.\nHave fun!\n\nA: Okay. First, the version. There are two main Ubuntu versions current nowadays (I won't include 12.04 because it's not worth it anymore):\n\n\n*\n\n*14.04 LTS - the Trusty Tahr: This is a Long Term Support release. LTS versions are released each two years, and have security updates/support for a longer time (5 years). These kind of releases focus on stability and trust. You won't find bleeding edge packages/applications, but the system is very reliable.\n\n*15.10 - the Wily Werewolf: this is the current regular release, with a 9-month lifespan. It comes with more up-to-date software but is usually less stable.\nIf you have very new hardware, stick with the newest (or you could wait 3 months until 16.04 is released if you want an LTS). The newest release comes with a newer kernel, which will probably give you more hardware support.\nIn the other cases, get the LTS release. You won't see bugs and crashes very often and you have a long lifespan.\nSecond factor: the desktop environment.\nUbuntu has lots of flavors with different purposes and work environments. Unlike Windows, Linux systems can have different userland interfaces (and even more than one at the same time).  you can choose from a wide variety of environments to suit your needs, from full-blown desktop environments with lots of features and eye-candy to a minimal command-line. Here are the main Ubuntu flavors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu: the mainstream. Comes with the Unity desktop environment and a set of applications to give you an out-of-the-box experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu: the KDE variation. Comes with a lot of applications from the KDE project.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Xubuntu: the Xfce variation. It's great for older computers for its stuning performance. It's also beautiful and highly customizable.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Lubuntu: the LXDE variation. Extremely lightweight and the lowest resource-consuming among all the flavors. Recommended for netbooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu GNOME: the GNOME variation. Comes with the good ol' Gnome desktop and its set of applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu MATE: the MATE variation. Lightweight, simple, beautiful.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Studio: comes with Xfce and lots of programs for multimedia work (video editor, image editor, sound manipulator, vectorial drawing). Also ships with a low-latency kernel, developed for multimedia.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Server: just out of curiosity (because you probably won't want this version), there is a Server version. It comes with several applications to deal with a web server and is headless (doesn't have a GUI, command-line only).\n\n\nNow it's up to you. Choose your flavor and welcome to the Ubuntu family.\n\nA: Simple answer for simple question:  Go for the newest LTS (Long Term Support) version. \nCurrently:  14.04 LTS \n\nA: I'd recommend the latest stable release (currently 15.10.  Releases are numbered for the year.month they were released in, and there's a release every 6 months).  Choose the 64bit version, not the obsolete 32bit version.  You can still run 32bit software on 64bit Ubuntu, since it includes the necessary libraries (or at least makes them easy to install).\nThe \"long term support\" releases still have their share of bugs, and the desktop experience generally keeps improving with every release.  The main advantage is that you won't have to do a major system upgrade for a long time, not so much that software is less buggy.\nNew versions of software usually has fewer bugs and better documentation.  This is more of an issue for desktops, instead of servers, because servers often don't run many different programs, and open source server software is usually much better tested / stable than open source desktop software.\nEven non-LTS releases are pretty carefully tested for new-user desktop experience, so don't be afraid of using them.  It's really easy to keep an Ubuntu system up to date, esp. if you don't customize a lot of system-config stuff.\nThese days, the even the LTS releases keep up with current versions of browsers, instead of trying to keep up with security fixes for an old version of firefox.  Previously, this was a big reason for NOT using LTS releases on your desktop.\n\nAlso, 14.04 is from before the switch to systemd, so you're more and more likely to run into trouble mixing and matching software from 14.04 with 3rd party packages, and with instructions on how to do things.\n\nAs for which flavour of Ubuntu: Installing Ubuntu vs. Kubuntu just changes which set of packages are installed to start with.  They all use the same package repositories after they're installed, so choosing one flavour of installer doesn't commit you to anything permanently.  You could start with Kubuntu, and then decide to install the ubuntu-desktop package.  After maybe 300MB of package downloads and 1GB of disk space used by installing them, you'd be able to choose either desktop environment.  (And choose which greeter / graphical password prompter you wanted the system to start).\nOn my Kubuntu-installed system, it's only 177MB of downloads using 688MB of space, but I'm guessing I already have some big packages installed that ubuntu-desktop would pull in via dependencies, but that a bare Kubuntu install wouldn't include.\n", "Q: Partitioning Tools I have just cloned a new hard drive for my Ubuntu machine using clonzilla.

So does anyone no of a partitioning software to help do what I want. I also want to do this because i would like to dual boot.\n\nA: You can use gparted to resize your partitions.  It is in the Ubuntu repos.\nThe trick is, that you cannot resize a partition that is mounted. This is indicated by a key icon on the gparted screen.

I'm seeking help with an issue I'm having with my Ubuntu install. \nI have a new HP Zbook with an SSD. Windows 7 was installed on it without a problem. \nFirst I tried the \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" option. After going through all of various steps, the install fails with this message:\n\"Attempt to mount a filesystem with type ext4 in SCSI7 (0,0,0). partition #1 at / failed.\"\nEach time that this happens, I am forced to reboot because GParted and the installer are unable to detect any partition details from the drive.\nI know that I'm not the first to post about this error message. I've been googling and reading about this for a couple of days now. I've tried all of the solutions that seemed to work for those other posts.\nHere are some of the approaches that I've taken that have failed.\n1) Be sure that the boot more is AHCI. \nIt is.\n2) Install the partitions before doing the install. \nThe live ISO that I'm booting to is shipped with GParted 0.18.0. I tried making an ext4 partition.

With this version I was able to partition the ext4 partition and a swap partition to use for the install. Once I booted back into the install I chose the \"Something Else\" option and selected those partitions. I told the ext4 to mount to /.

I added  GRUB to my Ubuntu installation's disk by bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi. \nThen, I removed Ubuntu from my disk and deleted the \"ubuntu\" file in the EFI. \nEvery time I boot my computer, I get a message: fail to open EFI.... and then my computer boots into Windows 8.\n\nA: There are several ways to do what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the same bcdedit command in Windows, but instead of \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi, you can specify \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi.\n\n*You can use the EasyUEFI program in Windows to manage the EFI boot entries in a GUI way. This is likely to be less error-prone that bcdedit. Move the Windows entry to the top of the list and/or delete the Ubuntu entry.\n\n*You can boot an Ubuntu live disk and use efibootmgr to delete the Ubuntu entry and/or move the Windows entry to the top of the list. Type sudo efibootmgr (or sudo efibootmgr -v to see more details) to see the list of options; then use the -b #### -B option to delete one, or -o ####[,####[,...]] to change the boot order. (#### is a four-digit hexadecimal number associated with a boot entry.) Type man efibootmgr for more documentation on this command.\n\n*Many EFIs provide a way to manage boot entries in their own user interfaces. Details vary greatly from one system to another, though.\n\n\nA: Another simple way to fix this from  Windows 8/10 is using admin command prompt:\nbcdboot c:\\windows\n\nTo remove remnants of grub completely you have to clean up EFI system partition(ESP).

Got into issue with the unity desktop and then fixed that also.\nPlease make sure that if you went to the nividia website and installed the driver from there(N*.run) - you must un-install this by going to /usr/bin/nvidia-installer. There should be something like nvidia-install(link to uninstall). Run that one and follow all the instructions. You should install the nvidia drivers from the ppa repository after cleaning up(purging the previous nvidia install). There is a bug in ubuntu and any time there is any issue in terms of installing the nvidia driver - you will end up with login loop.\n", "Q: Comma sign is not typeable anymore I can't type comma sign today though I could do it yesterday.\nIt just doesn't appear in any gui app or terminal.\nI can catch it with xev - it appears not to be hardware problem: \n\nNot sure if it's related but I started to use a new external usb keyboard about a week ago.

I'd like also a remote GUI access. My bet is that VNC is the answer. But it's not as easy as windows to allow remote access (a single checkbox!). So my question are:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed tightvncserver, but there are plenty of vnc server software. Which one is suited?\n\n*now I've setup tightvncserver, I also created an /etc/init.d/vncserver script to always run tightvncserver. This is working, I can remotely access the computer. However, I can no more login to the computer locally :(. Each time I try to log, the screen blink, some text scroll and the login prompt reappears.\n\n*when accessing remotely, I only have the vnc password to type. I don't have the user's prompt.\n\n\nBasically, I'd like to mimic the behavior of teamviewer. I'd like to replicate the screen, whether or not a user is loggued in. And it's where I'm stuck.\nThx for any help\n\nA: Regarding item #2 (cannot log in locally after installing tightvncserver), the steps I used to fix this issue were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore previous user's login state by putting the user back into the \"nopasswdlogin\" group via  usermod -a -G nopasswdlogin   (this was a test box, don't worry). This isn't necessary if you weren't bypassing password prompt initially. You can check this issue in /var/log/auth.log. \n\n*Move  .Xauthority  file in user's home directory out of the way and chmod the user's home directory perms to 777 (not sure if that is needed). Not sure how you verify if this one is the problem, but this worked. Note that this step probably undoes whatever security the installer tried to put in, so you have to be careful here.\n\n\nNote: I got the .Xauthority tip from \nhttps://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=27905 \n", "Q: GNOME terminal colors won't change I want to change color of text in the white rectangle \n\nI'm using Ubuntu 15.10, GNOME terminal version 3.16.2.\nI can't find a way to change that, can anyone help?\n\nA: These are the colors of the command prompt.

My hard disk size is 300 G.B, I have two questions :\nfirst : What is the best or ideal size partitioning for the hard disk? \nSecond: How I can do that, please use pictures if you can?\n\nA: *\n\n*/      --> 100GB\n\n*/boot  --> 1GB \n\n*/tmp   --> Double the ram size  \n\n*swap --> Double the ram size \n\n*/home  --> 100GB\nFor the reaming size create any folder like\n        /ed1 --> whatever size reaming have\n \n\nA: Well it depends. if your hard disk is partitioned before and you have data on it you have to make an additional space for your Ubuntu. The size of this particular partition is based on what you're going to do with your OS & how much free space you have, but I suggest at least 30 GB.\nIf your disk if fresh and not partitioned you can have all of it as the root partition of the OS. (you need a few gigabytes for swap.)\nFor the the second question you can use a bootable DVD or flash of Ubuntu or Linux Mint! after booting from USB flash open GParted and you can use it to creat, delete and move any partition you wish!\n\nA: See Sadegh Ghasemi answer.\nFind your amount of RAM (I have 8GB), You need to create a Swap Partition of at least this size.\nThen Create an ext4 partition for root (Linux-Ubuntu) of 20 or more GB - if you want to have your Home on a separate partition, I have chosen to have my Home on the shared with the root, remember to set mountpoint to root!\n\nRemember to press the Apply Button (Checkmark) to write your settings to the disk!\nHappy Ubunting :-)\n\nA: My dear, the best partitioning in my view is: 25GB ext4 / dev/sda1, mount point/, 275 GB ext4/ dev/sda5 mount point /home and 4GB Swap /dev/sda6.\nThis 25 GB partition, should be the --boot system (single primary partition on the disk).\nThis 275 will be mounted on / home (logical partition) if you want to update the kernel or change the linux OS, user data will not be affected.\nAnd the logical partition with 4GB Swap will be essential for this to work\nYou must use the bootable CD or USB drive, choose manual partitioning - assisted instead of using the whole disk.\n", "Q: Not able to install VLC program from .tar.xz file I successfully uncompressed the .tar.xz file and then I also ran the ./configure command and I think it also worked.

However the problem remain the same, since it seems I have no network working.\nThis if the ifconfig command:\n    giulio@giulio-VirtualBox:~$ ifconfig\n    eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:f5:87:2f  \n              inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fef5:872f/64 Scope:Link\n              UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n              RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n              TX packets:88 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n              collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n              RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:24737 (24.7 KB)\n\n    lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n              inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n              inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n              UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\n              RX packets:161 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n              TX packets:161 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n              collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n              RX bytes:11409 (11.4 KB)  TX bytes:11409 (11.4 KB)\n\nWhile /etc/network/interface looks like this:\n      # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\n      auto lo\n      iface lo inet loopback\n\nHere it is a screenshot of the  overall network settings. For the IPv4 settings I'm using AUtomatic (DHCP), while for IPv6 I've set \"ignore\".\nI hope somebody could have a look and help me out, thank you!\nGiulio\n\nA: I have tried to make it work with bridged and after a lot of troubleshooting, it worked.\nThe primary issue was that my guest OS was sending packets with different MAC address compared to my host OS.\nThus the traffic was getting dropped at wifi gateway.\nThe solution was to change the MAC address in guest OS and have same MAC for guest as well as host OS.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the VM\n\n*Go to Settings->Network->Advanced and remove the mac address.\n\n*Check the mac address of host machine (ifconfig -a or ipconfig /all) and update the same in the option in step 2.\n\n*Save the settings and start the VM, it should work and internet should be reachable :)\n\nA: I just had this problem on Pop!_OS 19.10 (running a Debian 10 guest).\nTl;dr: Running sudo modprobe vboxnetflt on the host fixed it.\n\nThe problem seems to be that the kernel module vboxnetflt wasn't loaded.\nWhen I first started the VM, it prompted me to load vboxdrv which I did and it worked. I didn't (and still haven't) restarted the host to see if that changed anything.\nRunning \"NAT\" networking worked and I tried changing it to \"Bridged Adapter\" I got a \"network activation failed\". I restarted multiple times without getting errors from VirtualBox. It was only when I fully shut down the VM (to attempt @IamSushil's solution) that I got a startup error which led me to this solution.\n\nA: You need to add a route to the default gateway:\nsudo bash\nroute add default gw 192.168.0.X\n\nCheck and change nano /etc/reslov.conf to set it to Google DNS. It's not persistent so might want to run a script at startup. \nFinally, change the IP to any other IP that is not used on the network, including the host machine:\nifconfig [interface] down\nifconfig [interface] 192.168.0.X netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255\nifconfig [interface] up\n\n\nA: First of all: Bridged config does not work with wi-fi.\nSo you can't bridge the Qualcomm Atheros AR946x to your VMs, but you can use the Realtek adapter, I can see that you're only showing the Ubuntu config and the VM config, but the matter may be with Windows.\nI suggest you find how your Windows network is configured to make it work.\nMaybe this can help you find the problem:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/31922055/bridged-networking-not-working-in-virtualbox-under-windows-10\n", "Q: Want to test kernel 4.4 - How to backup whole system? Sup,\nIm running 15.10 and my touchpad isnt working; I was advised to test kernel 4.4 to fix it.\nIn case something fails (which happened under 14.04.3), I want to recover the whole system as it is now.\nthx\n\nA: This is a XY Problem.  You don't actually need to back up the whole system, as if you're not happy with the new kernel you can always boot your machine to the older one via GRUB. You won't even need to uninstall the new kernel!\nBut if you really want to backup your system there are programs like DéjàDup to do so. You can find it in Ubuntu through the Dash, searching for \"backup\".\n", "Q: How to replace ppa provided packages by ubuntu provided ones? Recently I did a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04.  Then I wanted to install latest vlc (2.2.1), and googled for it.  Then I came across this ppa: ppa:mc3man/trusty-media and added it to my repositories by following command.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\n\nThen I issued following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nBut there was an error regarding mesa packages and I again googled for a solution and found that adding ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa would solve the issue.  So I used following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nNow vlc installed successfully.  Then I upgraded my system:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAfter that I removed above two ppas from the system\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nNow when I can not install some softwares or upgrades.

So executed following commands to install vlc successfully.\napt-get purge vlc-data\napt-get install vlc\n\n\nA: Follow below steps to solve the problem.\n1) Install ppa-purge.\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ppa-purge\n\n2) Add again the ppas, to revert ppa provided packages to official ones\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\n\n3) Purge the ppas and revert ppa provided packages to official ones by ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:mc3man/trusty-media\n\n4) Use aptitude install package_name to check if there is any dependency conflict.  If there is then go through the aptitude provided dependency resolution options one by one and apply suitable changes.\n5) Some dependency arises because the installing package depends on old libraries.  In this case symlinking updates libraries to old ones or downgrading solves the problem.\n", "Q: xfce4-notes: Toggle notes visibility via keyboard shortcut I use xfce4-notes in Xubuntu 14.04, und I have the possibility to show/hide the notes via the panel plugin in the notification tray.

It just had Windows 10.\nI tried uninstalling the previous distro of Linux I was using before the catastrophe, ElementaryOS, but when I installed it in a dedicated partition the boot menu was missing. After trying many times to fix it, and asking around stackexchange with no success, I gave up and decided to try installing Ubuntu, maybe the way it installed grub worked. Nope, it didn't. \nI remember choosing /dev/sda as the installation location for grub when installing Ubuntu from the Live USB, if this information helps.\nSo once again I tried multiple times to fix this issue to no success.\nFirst I followed this guide but when executing this command grub-install /dev/sda I got an error message saying cannot find EFI directory.\nLooking for solutions for this problem led me to this other guide but I got stuck at this point: grub-install --efi-directory=/boot/efi --target=x86_64-efi /dev/sdX because there was an error that said that such directory didn't exist and something else.\nWhich led me again to this question here in askubuntu. I did as instructed in the answer and everything could be executed with no errors. However, when restarting the laptop the grub menu still wouldn't show up.\nHonestly I don't know what else to do. I have been looking everywhere for weeks and asking for help as well, but my problem persists.\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: If Ubuntu is installed on the computer but you can't boot it because it lacks a boot loader, you must first ascertain whether it's installed to a GPT disk or an MBR disk. The former are generally used in EFI-mode boots and the latter are generally used with BIOS-mode boots, although that linkage is not nearly as strong as it is with Windows. If you've got an MBR disk but want to boot in EFI mode, or a GPT disk and want to boot in BIOS mode, you should re-assess your situation to decide what to do -- proceed with an unusual configuration, change the partition table type, or change the boot loader type.\nAssuming you've got (or convert to) a GPT disk and want to install an EFI-mode boot loader, there are many options. The two easiest are:\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB/Boot Repair -- Boot the Ubuntu installer in EFI mode, install the Boot Repair program, and run it. This should set up GRUB correctly on your disk. The biggest caveat is that, although Boot Repair usually works, sometimes it doesn't, and on rare occasion it can actually make matters worse. Of course, since you're unable to boot now, the risk of it getting worse seems pretty remote.\n\n*rEFInd -- You can disable Secure Boot (if it's active), download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, and boot from it. rEFInd should enable you to boot Ubuntu. If this works, install the PPA or Debian package version. rEFInd will then become your default boot manager, enabling you to boot without GRUB. This approach is a little more incremental -- the risk at each step is quite low, since you're either not changing the disk or you know that the program is almost certain to work when you make on-disk changes.\n\n\nIf you continue to have problems, or if you don't have a GPT/EFI setup, you should post back with details. The URL provided by Boot Repair will show us details about your system, which may be necessary to give a better answer. Alternatively, you can run Boot Info Script, post the RESULTS.txt file that it generates to a pastebin site, and post the URL to your document here.\n\nEDIT:\nYour symptoms are consistent with a buggy firmware; some manufacturers are known to release computers with buggy EFIs that \"forget\" or ignore their boot entries. Your question, though, implies that this all worked fine with your Elementary OS installation. That, in turn, suggests that the firmware's NVRAM entries are damaged in some way, thus preventing new entries from being recorded. This is also a bug, but it might be overcome.\nOne thing to try is entering your firmware's setup utility and selecting the option to reset all the settings to their default values. Unfortunately, I can't tell you exactly where that option is, since it varies from one firmware to another. (It's even possible that yours won't have such an option.) When this is done, you can try running Boot Repair again or install rEFInd as described above, and with any luck the repair will succeed.\nAnother thing you might try is the EasyUEFI program in Windows. You can use this to re-order existing entries, delete existing entries, and create new entries. You should be able to create an entry for Ubuntu (\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi -- note the use of Windows-and-EFI-style backslashes as directory separators) and test it. You could also use EasyUEFI to clear out any extra or redundant entries -- but the efibootmgr output in your Boot Repair run makes it look like there's nothing suspicious or redundant to be cleared out. Still, checking with another tool (that is, EasyUEFI) may be worthwhile.\n", "Q: Control a script that runs at start-up through SSH So I have a server running that runs a few scripts automatically at start-up.

How do I get to the instance running it from my command-line? \nI connect via SSH and the server is running a server OS.\nThanks,\n\nA: You can see the list of running programs after you ssh by running top or ps. \nThe set of programs run at startup is usually found in .profile or /etc/profile. \nIf the ssh shell runs bash .bash_profile or .bash_rc or /etc/bashrc may also contain instructions to run the programs. \nMore detailed information about services is found in sudo service --status-all\n", "Q: booting 64 bit ubuntu 15.10 into 32 bit x86 architecture windows 10 how can I install Ubuntu 15.10 of 64 bit into 32 bit processor of x86 architecture?

To check look up yr /var/log/messages after plugging in your devices, one by one to be able to differentiate them in the better case where some difference in id will crop up between them.\nA) If, in addition to product's id and vendor's id, serial numbers are  also identical across devices, read up here (as pointed out by @ChrisObrian in a previous answer). His answer is identical in principle to that provided by @Grumbel in this thread. This would also probably make yr post a duplicate. In any case, searching the devpath upwards for a matching device name, yr udev rule can be:\nSUBSYSTEMS==\"input\", ATTRS{name}==\"USB Gamepad \", KERNELS==\"input[0-9]*\", SYMLINK+=\"gamepad_Z\"\n\nB) In case serial numbers are not identical, you'd have the following simple udev rule (one per device):\nSUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0079\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"XXXX\", ATTRS{serial}==\"YYYYYY\", SYMLINK+=\"gamepad_Z\"\n\nwhere you will have to fill in XXXX and YYYYYY with proper values from output from udevadmin info ... or from /var/log/messages when devices are plugged in. \nNOTE: In both cases above, you choose Z arbitrarily. Yr devices will show up as /dev/gamepad_Z  pointing always to the same physical devices.\n\nA: If you can't tell the devices apart by other means you can always use the USB path via ID_PATH, as that is the name of the actual USB port the device is connected to. You then just have to plug the device always into the same USB port.\n", "Q: Cannot boot into live session from USB on Windows 10 I'm having a bit of an issue trying to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 on ASUS G51Jx. \nWhenever I change the boot order to USB first, I get a strange occurrence.

My script does work, but the script only searches its current directory. I would like my script to search for a file in the subdirectories. This is what I have so far.\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"file name:\" fname\nif find . -name \"$fname\"\n        then\n        cat -n $fname\nelse\n        echo \"file not found, try again. But, this time focus please!\"\nfi\n\n\nA: By default, find does search subdirectories so you're headed in the right direction.\nYour if uses the return code from find to decide if it found anything or not but that's not what find's return code means. find returns true if there were no errors encountered while searching for files.\nIf you want to check whether find actually found files, check that it printed something to stdout:\nfind_stdout=`find . -name \"$fname\"`\nif [ \"$find_stdout\" != \"\" ]; then\n    # Found file(s) case\nelse\n    # Found nothing case\nfi\n\n\nA: Your script can be simplified. find command itself has -exec  flag, which allows executing commands to operate on the files found. \nAlso, if you want to find a specific file , you don't need a script. Here's an example:\n$ cat testdir/file2.txt                                                        \nHelloAskubuntu\n$ find  -name \"file2.txt\" -exec cat {} \\; 2> /dev/null                         \nHelloAskubuntu\n\nAs  you can see, this finds specific file file2.txt in subdirectory of my current working directory, and cats it.\nIf you want to find a set of files with something in filename, you could either use -regex flag or simply wildcard.\n$ find  -name \"file*.txt\" -printf \"%P:\\n\"  -exec cat {} \\; 2> /dev/null        \nfile1.txt:\nHelloAskubuntu\ntestdir/file2.txt:\nHelloAskubuntu\n\nNote the usage of -printf flag to print path to file found first, and then catinate it.\nRefer to find's manual page for more info on it's flags and options\nAlso, in and of itself, your script is incorrect: you're basically doing the test if command find successfully exits, catinate \"$fname\" . You are not telling find to do anything about the files found and you're not passing its output to any further commands to operate on. \nIf you insist on using read+find, I'd still advise you to use -exec flag, or at least pass the output on to a while loop\n$ cat testscript.sh                                                            \n#!/bin/bash\n\nread -p\"Enter filename:\" FILE\nfind -name \"$FILE\" -exec cat {} \\; 2> /dev/null\n$ ./testscript.sh\nEnter filename:file2.txt\nHelloAskubuntu\n$ \n\nHere's another way:\n$ ./testscript.sh                                                              \nEnter filename:file2.txt\n./testdir/file2.txt\nHelloAskubuntu\n$ cat testscript.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nread -p\"Enter filename:\" USERINPUT\n\nfind -name \"$USERINPUT\" -print0  2>/dev/null  | while IFS=\"\" read -r -d \"\" FILE;\ndo\n  echo \"$FILE\"\n  cat \"$FILE\"\ndone\n$ \n\nThe method above is more general way of dealing with filenames, aimed especially to avoid issues with files that contain special characters in their name However, for the 90% of what you're doing here, the -exec flag approach I showed is sufficient\n", "Q: Where do these emojis come from?

This line changes the default linebreak charachter (\\n) to a \"newline+>\" (\\n>). In the while-loop, each block beginning with \">\" is used at once. I used two counting variables ($linecount and $filecount). The lines (or blocks in this case) are counted and when this count hits 100, a new file is used for the output.\n\nA: Python approach\nThe script below splits filename given on command-line into files once specific number of > characters has been seen at the beginning of a line. The number of seen characters is also specified on command-line. Thus the syntax is as follows:\n$ ./split_file.py input.txt 3\n\nScript source\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys\n\ndef write_split_file(count,orig_name,lines):\n    split_name = orig_name + '.split.' + str(count)\n    with open(split_name,'w') as fd:\n       fd.write(\"\\n\".join(lines))\n\ndef main():\n    counter = 0\n    limit = int(sys.argv[2])\n    line_list = []\n    with open(sys.argv[1]) as fd1:\n        for line in fd1:\n            line_list.append(line.strip())\n            if line.startswith('>'):\n               counter+=1\n               if counter % limit == 0:\n                  write_split_file(counter,sys.argv[1],line_list)\n                  line_list = []\n\n    if line_list:          \n       write_split_file(counter,sys.argv[1],line_list)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__': main()\n\nNote: the script is written for Python 2, but is compatible with Python 3.

I am a web developer coming from a Windows environment. \nI recently decided to switch to Linux to enjoy better shell scripting and to be able to use certain Linux only tools.\nI chose Lubuntu thinking I would trade shiny graphics for more resources and battery life, it turns out there is quite a difference regarding how to configure, what is preinstalled etc.\nSo here is a small list of issues that I would like to know if I could solve simply by switching to a standard Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and drop from one monitor to another (either fails or crashes depending on the situation) \n\n*Dynamic monitor plugging in handling (like if I plug a monitor, my PC should automatically switch to dual monitor, no need to reconfigure every time)\n\n*Multiple monitor windows key + arrow handling (it send my windows only to the main screen) \n\n*Better handling of laptop features (keyboard lightning, touch screen, FN keys, most of it does not work or works poorly)\n\n*Better keyboard shortcuts (there is not even a maximize shortcut, I need to re-script everything)\n\n\nI am loosing a lot of time and productivity solving this and I am aiming for efficiency. \nSo will using Ubuntu (or just installing Unity) solve this?\n\nA: Most of the problems you've listed would be solved by using Unity, especially the shortcuts thing. I've been using both Unity and LXDE for quite some time.\nUnity has great built-in shortcuts and a very good way to handle custom shortcuts. I really can't live without them. For example you can move through workspaces using Ctrl+Alt + an arrow. To move a specific window with you to another workspace just add a Shift to the previous combination.\nLXDE (which is the Lubuntu desktop environment) would only be good if your computer is too old and very low on resources. Of course there are solutions for your problems under LXDE but it would be a tedious process. LXDE can get quite time-consuming. You'd fine more people using unity, and therefore you'd find more answers to your troubles and with a better quality.\n...you can install Unity on your current ubuntu, but I advise you to do a clean Ubuntu installation (and then install LXDE with it if you want).\nby the way; I'm assuming that you mean \"workspaces\" by \"multiple monitors\".\n\nA: For easy customisation I would personally recommend Kubuntu (KDE), or perhaps Ubuntu Gnome, but not Unity.\nUnity is quite inflexible (though with addons this can be worked around) about how you position your launcher/task manager, and how it displays. This gets more frustrating when you have multiple monitors and want to fine tune how things display. You can easily add a task manager to your second screen, choose if it shows all windows or just windows from that screen. You also have the option of a traditional task manager or an icon only task manager.\nAll multi monitor features work well. Hotkey customisation is also exceptional in KDE.\nYou can even customise the buttons on your window decoration. Choosing which corner your close/minimise/maximise button goes, and even adding extra buttons to pin a window to all work spaces, or to leave it always on top.\n", "Q: What packages sections are available for Trusty?

The Section field should be of the form:\nsection if the package is in the main archive area,\narea/section if the package is in the contrib or non-free archive areas.\nThe Debian archive maintainers provide the authoritative list of sections. At present, they are: admin, cli-mono, comm, database, debug, devel, doc, editors, education, electronics, embedded, fonts, games, gnome, gnu-r, gnustep, graphics, hamradio, haskell, httpd, interpreters, introspection, java, kde, kernel, libdevel, libs, lisp, localization, mail, math, metapackages, misc, net, news, ocaml, oldlibs, otherosfs, perl, php, python, ruby, science, shells, sound, tasks, tex, text, utils, vcs, video, web, x11, xfce, zope, The additional section debian-installer contains special packages used by the installer and is not used for normal Debian packages.\n\n\nSo \"misc\".\n", "Q: Update settings - ignoring some updates?

After finding this out I immediately went to the permissions tab and made sure that I could read and write it but even when I had set it to \"Read and write\" I still could not change the parameter. I have been around on quite a few topics but I couldn’t seem to get a straight answer out of any of them. I'm starting to get a bit frustrated so any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. \n\nA: All you need is to run the hl.exe with \"-game hlspbunny\" parameter, so you can do this in the command line (Ctrl + Alt + t): LINK_OF_THE_HL_DIR/hl.exe -game hlspbunny\nAnd it can be converted into a script, save the following content into a file, e.g. HL-mod.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\nLINK_OF_THE_HL_DIR/hl.exe -game hlspbunny\n\nRemember to change the \"LINK_OF_THE_HL_DIR\" correspondingly.\nAnd change the permission to make it executable chmod u+x HL-mod.sh\nNow you can simply run the script to start it.\n", "Q: Redirect port 3389 with iptables, to an IP network I have on my network a linux server and it iptables firewall.\nOn the same network, you have a Windows Server 2008 server.\nWhen I'm out of my network, I access the Server 2008 for RDP and this service applies to port 3389.\nWhen I enter my endereçoexterno: 3389 it will point in my server with iptables.\nSo iptabes should redirect the request to the ip Windows Server2008.\n\nA: I resolved my issue.\nIptables script follows:\n/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -j DNAT --to --dport 3389 192.168.100.21:3389\n/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --dport 3389 192.168.100.21 d j ACCEPT\n\n\nEth0 -> Board receiving the internret\n192.168.100.21 -> Terminal Server ip in ETH1\n3389 -> default port remote access rdp\n\n", "Q: How do you install drivers for the AMD Radeon R7 m360 graphics card?

First of all, I'm not 100% positive that the main question I've written here is actually the problem, but I have a hunch that it is. I've wrote a simple Gtk# application in Mono awhile ago, and gave it a custom ICO as its icon file. Worked great.\nRecently I went to change out this icon to a different one, but when I build and run the program it still shows the icon. I've made sure that I've updated every reference to the icon file to the new one, and have completely deleted the old icon off the hard drive altogether. But it still shows up in the Launcher when I run the program.\nI am assuming this means that Gtk caches the icons somewhere in Ubuntu and I probably need to force that to refresh.

I was partitioning my hard disk based on what I understood from this question.\nThis is the final result:\n\nBut I faced some problems here, I don't know which partitions should be primary and which should be logical, so I made /, /boot, /tmp and /home primary partitions and /swap a logical drive, is this right or wrong? I don't know because I'm new to Linux. Second problem, I want /dev/sda7 and /dev/sda8 to be NTFS and play role as D and E drives in Windows to put all my files on them (movies, games, music, etc.). But I don't know what I should choose in mount point for them. \nThis is the final result after partitioning the hard disk and the computer seems to be slow:\n\nPlease help me making the ideal or perfect partitioning to my hard disk.\n\nA: NTFS Partitions to share file with Windows\nA couple of notes on what you seem to be doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are formatting sda7 and sda8 as Ext4 not NTFS. Windows will not be able to access this partition format. Why not leave this space Unallocated, unasigned to any partition and later create the NTFS partitions as you need them using a partition tool like GParted(can be installed from repositories).\n\n*If you really want to create this Ext4 partitions you don't need to set a mount point for them. This will only mean they will not be automatically mounted when you boot up. They will be visible in the Files(Nautilus / Ubuntu's File Manager) as another hard drive you can access just with a click.\n\n*You should be able to format these drives as NTFS from the get go. I am not certain how the menu on the installer works but you should format them as NTFS and not Ext4.\nI would need to access an installation media to help you with more details. If you need more help with the steps let me know on a comment.\nPartitioning in Ubuntu\nIn Ubuntu partitions are not assigned letters. Any partition that you create will be place inside the directory tree like another folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*/ is called the root. This is the lowest level in the directory tree.\n\n*/home/ is a folder directly under root that is generally used to store user specific data. You will have many subfolders: /home/username1, /home/username2/, /home/username3... These folders are created only for user that are real people; some users are used to run services(transmission-daemon) or are system specific(root). For these other user there won't be a home folder.\n\n*When you mount a disk in Ubuntu from the file explorer(nautilus) it will create a new folder under /media/. The folder name is not important, it will be generated automatically. When you unmount the disk the folder will be empty and if automatically generated also deleted (will not appear anymore).\n\n*I would suggest you turn sda7 & sda8 into NTFS formatted partitions and mount them at /media/somefoldernameyoulike. So that you can easily access them on every boot. These however is not requiered.\n\n\nYour Case\nI would suggest you do not create the /boot/ & /tmp/ partitions as you don't seem too familiar with the system. Create the /home/ partitions and make it bigger!. Your everyday files will generally be stored under /home/ partition.\nYour swap partition should be as big as your ram memory in order to be able to activate hibernate at some point.\nGood day.\n\nA: Torrien's answer covers a lot of important points. Here are a few more I'd like to add:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux doesn't really care about primary vs. logical partitions; you can set up a system with nothing but primaries, nothing but logicals, or any mix of the two you like (within the constraint that you can have no more than four primary partitions or three primaries plus an arbitrary number of logicals on a single MBR disk).\n\n*Modern computers (those introduced in mid-2011 or later) usually provide EFI firmware rather than the older BIOS firmware. Most EFI-based computers can boot using the older BIOS-mode boot loaders, but this is problematic for many reasons, as described on this page of mine. This is especially true when dual-booting. When booting in EFI mode, you're likely to use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which supports up to 128 partitions, with no conception of extended or logical partitions. Thus, if you boot in EFI mode, the question of primary vs. logical partitions becomes meaningless. You may want to look into this issue before you head further down what may become a dead-end path.\n\n*Windows does care about primary vs. logical status on MBR disks. Specifically, the Windows boot partition (normally C:) must be primary. Sometimes Windows needs at least two primary partitions (the second is for a recovery partition). Of course, when booting in EFI mode from a GPT disk, this distinction becomes meaningless under Windows, as well as under Linux.\n\n*Your question implies that you'll be dual-booting with Windows; but your earlier question states that you will not be dual-booting with Windows. This detail is critical, because....\n\n*If Ubuntu will be the only OS on the disk, you should NOT use NTFS on the disk. There is no Linux utility for repairing NTFS partitions (the poorly-named ntfsfix utility only does very basic checks and then marks the disk as needing attention in Windows). NTFS is also slow (in Linux) compared to Linux-native filesystems, and it lacks important Linux/Unix filesystem features. For all these reasons, any filesystem that's to be used only from Linux should be Linux-native (ext2/3/4fs, XFS, JFS, ReiserFS, or btrfs, to name the most popular current ones).\n\n*If you'll be dual-booting with Windows, it's conventional to install Windows first, leaving free space for Ubuntu. This guarantees that Windows will get whatever primary partitions it needs, and that Windows won't be able to damage your partition layout, as it has a habit of doing when logical partitions are involved. Installing Windows first also means that GRUB (Ubuntu's boot loader) will be able to detect Windows and add it to its menu. If you install Windows second, the Windows boot loader will end up taking over from GRUB and boot straight to Windows, which means post-installation fixes that won't be required if you install Windows first.\n\n", "Q: How do I configure ssh to ask me for my password in the terminal instead of in a dialog box? On Ubuntu Mate, whenever I try to push to github, I get a dialog asking me to \"Enter password to unlock the private key\", instead of it it prompting me in the terminal.  How do I configure ssh to ask me for my password in the terminal instead of the dialog?\n\nA: I recently started seeing the same behaviour (for years it asked in the terminal).\nI think it turns out that having a id_rsa.pub in your ~/.ssh directory is what triggers the behaviour.\nI recently put it in there so that i could ssh-copy-id to one of my other servers.\nYou could work around the issue by storing your public key elsewhere.\n\nA: SSH Key Passphrase\nYou generally want to keep an ssh-key locked with a passphrase. But you can remove the passphrase security and you will stop receiving the prompt.\nUbuntu - GUI\nUbuntu comes with a program called Passwords and Keys. This software will let you manage many security credentials in Ubuntu.\n\n\nSteps to disable private key passphrase:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to OpenSSH Keys and find the private key you use to access GitHub.\n\n*Right Click the key you want to modify.\n\n*Select Properties.\n\n*Press Change Passphrase.\n\n*Enter current passphrase.\n\n*Leave the prompt empty for the next two prompts about the new passphrase. (This will leave the key unlocked permanently or until you set a new passphrase.)\n\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND\nAlthough this will stop the prompt I do not recommend keeping an ssh-key unlocked for security. If however you know this file will be secure on your private computer and you don't have access to high risk information go ahead.\nJust remember:\n\n\"You don't necessarily know what you want to keep a secret, until it is not a secret anymore.\"\n\n                                      -I forget the reference.\n\n\n\nHope this helped.\n\nA: man ssh-agent and ssh-add. You run ssh-add to pass the pass phrase for your private key to ssh-agent (assuming that ssh-agent is running). Whenever ssh needs a pass phrase and ssh-agent is available, ssh will ask ssh-agent for the pass phrase instead of asking you.\nNote:You need to run ssh-add for all your private keys once per session.\n", "Q: Space used to preserve files across reboots? Unetbootin I am installing Ubuntu on another computer in my house.  I have downloaded the iso file and am going to put in on a usb using Unetbootin.   \nWhat is the rule of thumb for deciding how much space I should use to preserve files across reboots?\n\nA: You can either leave space to preserve files or simply set it to 0, so everything you do is erased upon reboot. Let's consider some factors:\n1. Will you use your USB drive to store things other than the Live system?\n2. Will you use the Live system just to test/install Ubuntu or will you use it to work?\nIf you're going to use the USB drive to work AND store files you could make two partitions out of it, one for the Live system/work files and another for storage.\nIf you're going to use it only to test/install Ubuntu and will store files, set the persistency size to 0 and make two partitions. If you eventually need to save a file inside the Live system simply save it in the other partition.\nIf you'll use it to work, you can max out the persistency.\n", "Q: Minecraft Won't Boot I installed Java 8 from the java.com, and I got Minecraft from minecraft.net.

This question is probably better off in Super User. Maybe somthing like... How to fix boot manager without harming Linux?\n\n\nA: Windows boot loader manager is deleted - at least this is how it looks like.\nBetter to use the same recovery manager recovery disk(Windows 8) and then recover the Windows O/S. Once that is done - then install any flavor or Linux(i prefer and recommend Ubuntu). \nI see you are talking about Windows 10. Right now Windows 10 free upgrade is going on also - so you may be do that and then start installing linux. Make sure that you create a recover USB/disk for Windows 10 in case you are going to install Linux(ubuntu or any other favor).\nI suggest Windows disk management utilities to do the partition from Windows for Linux. When installing Linux - go thru each step carefully(use automatic partition in case of ubuntu desktop 14.0.4 or 15.10) which creates a ext4 partition mounted at '/' and a swap partition. Live USB also had a feature to try ubuntu rather than installing so that you can play with until you are comfortable and would like to install it.

I can no longer boot into my Ubuntu 15.10 sytem.\nI'd like to know what I did wrong, and how best to fix it.\nI can fix it by restarting from scratch, but it would be better to know why it's gone pear shaped!\nMy background is all windows up to a week or so ago.  Since then it's been Ubuntu 15.10, and it was all going very well up to this evening.  \nMy system has two SSDs, and the primary Ubuntu 15.10 was installed on one.  A second Ubuntu 15.10 system was then installed on half of the second SSD, with the remaining half available to either system.  All seemed to work fine, and I could boot into either system.  \nThe next step was to use fsarchiver to back up the primary system, and again went well, in that it created the ssd1archive.fsa file.  I only backed up the Ubuntu partition, not the boot or swap areas.\nAll fine at this point, I had a primary system, and a way to back it up using a second system.\nTo check it could restore, the primary system was used to run fsarchiver, and the ssd1archive.fsa was restored to the second SSD, which I expected to replace it's existing Ubuntu 15.10 with a copy of the primary system.  \nAgain, all seemed to work fine, but I've just rebooted and found no menu, and instead a grub> prompt.

Looks like google speech api works (not tried it though)  and that one is used on a lot of places. Might be a good 1st attempt.\n", "Q: How to start nautilus maximized from command line? I can easily start Nautilus on a particular directory from command line:\nnautilus /home/nico/Documents\n\nBut I want that Nautilus window to be maximized.\nHow to write the command line?\nnautilus does not seem to recognize --maximized nor --fullscreen. I reluctantly tried --geometry 1500x1500 and it does seem to have any effect.\n\nA: 1. Start up nautilus with a maximized window\nTo start nautilus with a maximized window, you can use the script below:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndef w_list():\n    try:\n        pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"nautilus\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n        w_list = subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\n        return [l.split()[0] for l in w_list if pid in l]\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\nrelevant1 = w_list()\nsubprocess.Popen([\"nautilus\", \"--new-window\"])\n\nt = 0\nwhile t < 30:\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    relevant2 = w_list()\n    if all([relevant2 != None, relevant1 != None]):\n        new = [w for w in relevant2 if not w in relevant1]\n        if new:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"windowsize\", new[0], \"100%\", \"100%\"])\n            break\n    relevant1 = relevant2\n    t += 1\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses both xdotool and wmctrl, the first one to list new windows of the targeted application, the last one because I prefer the way xdotoolresizes windows.\nsudo apt-get install xdotool wmctrl\n\n\n*Then copy the script above into an empty file, save it as start_maximized.py\n\n*Test- run the script by the command:\npython3 /path/to/start_maximized.py\n\nNow nautilus will start up with a new maximized window.\n\n*Add, if you like, the command as a quicklist (right- click) item to the Files (nautilus) launcher in the Unity Launcher.\n2. Generalized version; start up any application maximized\nYou can startup any GUI application (+ their arguments) in the generalized script below:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\nimport sys\n\nappcommand = sys.argv[1:]\napp = appcommand[0]\nstartup = (\" \").join(appcommand)\n\ndef w_list():\n    try:\n        pid = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", app]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n        w_list = subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\n        return [l.split()[0] for l in w_list if pid in l]\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\nrelevant1 = w_list()\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", startup])\n\nt = 0\nwhile t < 30:\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    relevant2 = w_list()\n    if all([relevant2 != None, relevant1 != None]):\n        new = [w for w in relevant2 if not w in relevant1]\n        if new:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"windowsize\", new[0], \"100%\", \"100%\"])\n            break\n    relevant1 = relevant2\n    t += 1\n\nTo use it\n\n\n*\n\n*Do the setup exactly as above (including installing wmctrl and xdotool,\nbut additionally use the targeted application (+ possible arguments) as an argument to run the script.\nFor example:\npython3 /path/to/start_maximized.py nautilus --new-window\n\nor:\npython3 /path/to/start_maximized.py gedit\n\n\nAdditionaly, add the option to a quicklist\n\nYou can easily add the option to the nautilus quicklist. Assuming you use the second (generalized) version:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the global nautilus.desktop file locally:\nwhich is on 14.04 and 14.10 : nautilus.desktop:\ncp /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\nand on 15.04 and 15.10 : org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop\ncp /usr/share/applications/org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*Open the file with (e.g.) gedit, look for the line:\nActions=Window;\n\nChange it into:\nActions=Window;Open a maximized window;\n\nAdd to the very end of the file:\n[Desktop Action Open a maximized window]\nName=Open a maximized window\nExec=python3 '/path/to/start_maximized.py' nautilus --new-window\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\n\n*Save and close the file.\n\n*Log out and back in.\n\n\nNow you have a quicklist option like in the image.\nConceptual explanation\nTo maximize an existing window is not very difficult. Both wmctrl and xdotool offer options to do so.\nThe issue is that if you want to maximize a newly created window, you don't know the window id yet when you give the command. Therefore the script practices the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a list of the currently existing windows of the targeted application (if any)\n\n*give the command to open the application (or a new window of a running application)\n\n*keep an eye on new windows of the application to appear\n\n*if the new window appears, it is apparently our candidate to maximize -> maximize it.\n\n\nThis way, we can \"smartly\" maximize the application's new window, that will work no matter the computer is slow (occupied with a heavy job for example) or fast. \nFinally, the script has a built in safety time-limit, to prevent waiting for ever in case the application fails to start up for some reason. After appr. 15 seconds, the script gives up and exits an way.\n\nA: Nautilus remembers the windows size.\nStart it normally and maximize it, then close it.\nNow when you type nautilus in terminal, it will open up maximised.\nTested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n", "Q: Wubi Error For Uuntu I wanted to install Ubuntu through Wubi but I get and error.\nHere's my log: Wubi Log\n\nA: Hello and welcome on Ask Ubuntu!\nFrom the log file you posted it seems you are using Windows 10 Home Single Language version (build 10586 - better known as Threshold 2 update):\n01-19 14:34 DEBUG  WindowsBackend: windows_version2=Windows 10 Home Single Language\n01-19 14:34 DEBUG  WindowsBackend: windows_sp=None\n01-19 14:34 DEBUG  WindowsBackend: windows_build=10586\n\nUnfortunately Wubi is no longer supported and not over Windows 7.\nFrom Windows 8 mostly because of the release of Secure Boot and a completely different boot system it is no longer possible to install this way - by default, and other way are not supported as well.\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Ubuntu in a virtual machine (for example in VMWare Player - it is free for home use and also Ubuntu is well supported in this environment)\n\n*Resize your Windows partition, create a new independent one from the free space (or install it to a separate disk) and create dual boot.\n\n\nI hope I could answer your question. :)\n", "Q: Reinstalling bumblebee on Kernel 4.4 I updated my kernel from 3.19 to 4.4, but afterwards the initialization of bumblebee failed. Therefore I removed it completely (purge) and reinstalled it, this time with the current nvidia driver (352) instead of the older one (331). But I still have the NVidia GPU running, and if I start optirun, I get \n[ 1255.207756] [ERROR]The Bumblebee daemon has not been started yet or the socket path /var/run/bumblebee.socket was incorrect.\n[ 1255.207776] [ERROR]Could not connect to bumblebee daemon - is it running?\n\nIf I check if the nvidia driver is loaded (with lsmod | grep -E 'nvidia|nouveau'), I get nothing in return. How can I fix that?\n\nA: Loadable kernel modules in Linux are loaded (and unloaded) by the modprobe command. They are located in /lib/modules and have had the extension .ko (\"kernel object\") since version 2.6 (previous versions used the .o extension). Often when you update your kernel and have compiled your own drivers in previous kernels you must compile them again. If binaries were obtained through pre-compiled such as deb Debian packages which are handled via dpkg through package managers such as apt/aptitude or  if your distribution is another flavor of Linux such as RHEL then BRPM's or RPM Package Manager sometimes known as RedHat Package Manager.\nDepending on your distribution an attempt to load either drivers with \"modprobe [options] [-i] [-b] modulename\" or in your case \"modprobe nouveau\" | \"modprobe nvidia\" | \"modprobe nv\" if they exists and if they are located in the corresponding location for your distribution. Ubuntu is based off of Debian and it may be assumed packages are most likley handled through dpkg managers on your system if its what these forums are designated for.\nIf your problem still exists, perhaps shed more light on the issue by including these outputs:\n/usr/bin/dmesg\n/usr/bin/uname -a\n\nIf possible please include information on your kernel objects by attempting: \n/usr/sbin/modinfo nvidia\n/usr/sbin/modinfo bbswitch\n\nDid you compile bumblebee & your NVIDIA driver from source or did you use a pre-compiled package? If they were compiled by you what versions did you use? If you installed the pre-compiled packages please provide the exact versions.\n", "Q: Text scaling / clipboard issue I am having some difficulty understanding some issues with dia, perhaps better posted as two questions, however I do get the impression that they are related in gnome somehow; they are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I copy text to the system clipboard from vim, it is not readable by the paste function in dia.\n\n*When I output a .png file from dia, the characters of each line appear piled up on top of each other.

I have an Intel server. The CPUs are power managed between 800MHz and 3GHz, using the p_state driver. Obviously it's drawing less power and making less noise when it's down at 800Mhz.\nMost of the things that are running on the server are on-demand and should execute as fast as possible (and they do) but I have one daemon that is thoroughly unimportant. It takes about 20% CPU at peak but this can last for a few hours while it processes files.\nMy problem is whenever this process does anything, the power state in the CPU ramps up. It uses more power and makes more noise. I want this one daemon to run at 800MHz all the time (unless anything else needs the CPU).\nI could stick the whole server in powersave but I need other applications to be able to scale the CPU. Is there a sensible way I can tell whatever manages the CPU to disregard load from a particular application?\n\nA: I found cpulimit.\n$ sudo apt-get install cpulimit  # for installing cpulimit\n$ pgrep process_to_limit         # getting the pid\n1234\n\n$ cpulimit -p 1234 -l 30         # -p pid -l percentage_of_cpu_to_use\n\nBut it looks like cpulimit only uses the pid of a running process or executes a program. That means you need to find a way (bash script) to execute cpulimit when the daemon is running. \nHere's a short shell script that reads the pid, executes cpulimit and sleeps for 60min.\n#!/bin/sh\n# This example uses firefox, replace the variable PROG\n\nPROG=firefox\nPID=`pgrep $PROG`\n\nif [ $PID ]                # if $PID not equals 0 (zero)\nthen\n   cpulimit -p $PID -l 30  # limit the cpu time to 30%\n   sleep 60m               # wait 60 minutes\nelse\n   sleep 60m\nfi\n\nSave it as e.g. run_cpulimit.sh, grant permission chmod u+x run_cpulimit.sh and start it.\n", "Q: Prevent external devices being locked to launcher If I connect an external device (such as a USB stick or android smartphone) it will automatically open in nautilus and get a corresponding icon locked to unity launcher. Is there any way to prevent this?\nI'm using Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: If you unlock a device from the Unity Launcher, it as actually blacklisted from the launcher. You can see which devices are currently blacklisted by the command:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist\n\nThe script below is an alternative way to set your own blacklisted devices. The difference is that the script does it in a permanent way, untill you remove the file ~/.blacklist_data. (see explanation: How it works)\nbackground script\nEven for a background script, this one is extremely light weight, as a result of the fact that, if nothing changes to the blacklist, only the current blacklist is read by the gsettings command. It reads the dconf database, which is in binary format, and thus very light weight.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\nimport time\n\nblacklist_data = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.blacklist_data\"\n\ndef get_setlist():\n    cmd = \"gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist\"\n    blacklist = subprocess.check_output([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n    return \"[]\" if blacklist == \"@as []\" else blacklist\n\ntry:\n    blacklist1 = str(open(blacklist_data).read()).strip()\n    cmd = 'gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"'+blacklist1+'\"'\n    subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    blacklist1 = \"[]\"\n    open(blacklist_data, \"wt\").write(blacklist1)\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(1)\n    blacklist2 = get_setlist()\n    if blacklist2 != blacklist1:\n        oldlist = open(blacklist_data).read().strip()\n        n_old = len(eval(oldlist))\n        try:\n            n_new = len(eval(blacklist2))\n        except SyntaxError:\n            n_new = 0\n        if n_old < n_new:\n            open(blacklist_data, \"wt\").write(blacklist2)\n        else:\n            cmd = 'gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"'+oldlist+'\"'\n            subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", cmd])\n    blacklist1 = blacklist2\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as myown_blacklist.py\n\n*Test- run it by the command:\npython3 /pat/to/myown_blacklist.py`\n\nNow unlock your (any, it works not only usb devices) unwanted devices. Unlocking is only needed once.\n\n*If all works fine, add it to Startup Applications:  choose Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\npython3 /pat/to/myown_blacklist.py`\n\nHow it works\nThe issue is that Unity \"forgets\" devices once they are unmounted. The script then keeps track of what happens to the output of:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist\n\nIf an item is added to the list, the script writes the list into a hidden file in your home directory. If an item is removed, it reads the hidden file and restores the blacklist (this is only needed once on unmounting of the device)\n", "Q: Microphone static noise I installed Ubuntu 14.04 with dualboot.

None of the applications I installed starts on startup. Which system processes can I safely kill or allocate less memory to in order to save around 7 GB of my 8 GB for R?\n\nA: After restart immediately launch the terminal and issue the command\nfree -m\n\nThen look at values in the second row(-/+ buffers/cache:). Under second column(used) you'll see the actual RAM consumption of your system.\n\nA: You will probably find most of the memory in use is in the buffer cache. The default configuration for Linux is to cache file data in memory when memory is available.  When memory pressure increases (that is, more applications demand memory) then the data in the cache is discarded in an orderly manner if it is not dirty or flushed (written) to disk if it is dirty.  \nAccounting for the rest of memory that is in use by applications is a little bit tricky as applications share memory when using shared libraries and shared memory mappings.  You can use tools like \"smemstat\" to see how much memory is being used by processes:\nsudo apt-get install smemstat\nsmemstat\n\nThe USS column reports the Unique Set Size (unshared memory), the PSS column reports the Proportional Set Size (proportion of shared memory) and the RSS column reports the Resident Set Size (non-swapped physical memory) used by each process.\nThe /proc/meminfo file also can be used to see how memory is being utilized, use:\ncat /proc/meminfo\n\nFor information on all the fields, please refer to the Linux Kernel Documentation on the /proc interfaces.\nIf you application needs a lot of memory, the kernel will page out or drop unused pages from other processes, so you may not need to kill processes to give you the memory your require for your application.  As long as you have enough physical memory free for your application + kernel + active pages of other running processes your should see the system run without too much swap activity.

Every time I read the tips for installing an SDK, IDE, some extension and so on, it says, that I should unpack them in /opt folder. Why do I need to do that? \nWhen I was installing Ubuntu, I read that I should set only 10-20 GiB for the / file system and remaining space set for /home. So should I extend the space for root folder, or leave all stuff at /home? Is there any difference?\n\nA: /opt is used for (sometimes proprietary) external applications that aren't considered part of the Linux distribution. These applications might have hard-coded paths and so will only run correctly when installed to /opt - but if there are no hard-coded paths then you could install them to any path. A program that is installed in /opt is supposed to be self-contained.\nThe main reason for using /opt is to provide a common standard path where external software can be installed without interfering with the rest of the installed system. /opt does not appear in standard compiler or linker paths (gcc -print-search-dirs or /etc/ld.so.conf etc.), so headers and libraries installed there are somewhat isolated from the main system and shouldn't interfere with already-installed programs.\nThe use of /opt is specified by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard : /opt, which notes that /opt originally came from Unix. \n\n/opt : Add-on application software packages\nPurpose\n/opt is reserved for the installation of add-on application software\n  packages.\nA package to be installed in /opt must locate its static files in a\n  separate /opt/<package> or /opt/<provider> directory tree, where\n  <package> is a name that describes the software package and <provider>\n  is the provider's LANANA registered name.\nRequirements\nThe directories /opt/bin, /opt/doc, /opt/include, /opt/info, /opt/lib,\n  and /opt/man are reserved for local system administrator use. Packages\n  may provide \"front-end\" files intended to be placed in (by linking or\n  copying) these reserved directories by the local system administrator,\n  but must function normally in the absence of these reserved\n  directories.\nPrograms to be invoked by users must be located in the directory\n  /opt/<package>/bin or under the /opt/<provider> hierarchy. If the\n  package includes UNIX manual pages, they must be located in\n  /opt/<package>/share/man or under the /opt/<provider> hierarchy, and\n  the same substructure as /usr/share/man must be used.\nPackage files that are variable (change in normal operation) must be\n  installed in /var/opt. See the section on /var/opt for more\n  information.\nHost-specific configuration files must be installed in /etc/opt. See\n  the section on /etc for more information.\nNo other package files may exist outside the /opt, /var/opt, and\n  /etc/opt hierarchies except for those package files that must reside\n  in specific locations within the filesystem tree in order to function\n  properly. For example, device lock files must be placed in /var/lock\n  and devices must be located in /dev.\nDistributions may install software in /opt, but must not modify or\n  delete software installed by the local system administrator without\n  the assent of the local system administrator.\nRationale \nThe use of /opt for add-on software is a well-established practice in\n  the UNIX community. The System V Application Binary Interface [AT&T\n  1990], based on the System V Interface Definition (Third Edition),\n  provides for an /opt structure very similar to the one defined here.\nThe Intel Binary Compatibility Standard v. 2 (iBCS2) also provides a\n  similar structure for /opt.\nGenerally, all data required to support a package on a system must be\n  present within /opt/<package>, including files intended to be copied\n  into /etc/opt/<package> and /var/opt/<package> as well as reserved\n  directories in /opt.\nThe minor restrictions on distributions using /opt are necessary\n  because conflicts are possible between distribution-installed and\n  locally-installed software, especially in the case of fixed pathnames\n  found in some binary software.\nThe structure of the directories below /opt/<provider> is left up to\n  the packager of the software, though it is recommended that packages\n  are installed in /opt/<provider>/<package> and follow a similar\n  structure to the guidelines for /opt/package. A valid reason for\n  diverging from this structure is for support packages which may have\n  files installed in /opt/<provider>/lib or /opt/<provider>/bin.\n\n\nA: There is nothing sacred about /opt, it is just common practice to put precompiled software which should be accessible to all users of a system in this directory. If you are the sole user of the system, there is nothing wrong at all with extracting it in your home directory. And even if there are several users on the system which need access to this software but you want to use the space on your /home partition, there is nothing wrong with creating a publicly accessible /home/softwarename directory and extracting your software there (the only caveat is if you happen to have a user named softwarename, you won't be able to use it at the user's home directory).\n\nA: The detailed answers are very good, but (aside from software that may have hard coded absolute paths in it - not the best programming practice), the main point is that non-system/non-distribution software should not be stored mixed in with the regular system files.\nPutting things in /opt or /usr/local keeps things clean and safer.\nIn particular, your software search path ($PATH) determines the order in which locations are searched when looking for a program of a particular name to execute. Usually, places like /opt and /usr/local are toward the end of the list.\nIf you install a package that has a program named cp in it, the default search order that comes with your distro will find the normal one because the directory it is stored in is searched before places like /opt.\nIf it didn't work that way, who knows what might break or open a security hole if a program named cp that does something else gets run when you think you're just trying to copy some files.\nIf something like this does happen, it may take awhile before somebody thinks to run a command like type cp (which might not even be enough to show that something is wrong) to find out that what is being run isn't what you think it is. Until that point, you're stuck at \"Everything is exactly the way it should be aside from the small detail that it doesn't work!\" \nIt basically helps keep unexpected things from happening and also avoids situations where system updates might remove or replace some or all of your \"custom\" installed packages. Or, the reverse, some \"custom\" programs might overwrite system supplied programs that many other programs or scripts may rely on.\nFrom an administrative point of view, mixing \"system\" and \"optional\" programs/files in the same locations places your system in an \"undefined\" or at least \"ambiguous\" state.\nIf you have a problem with your system or a program and need help, one of the first questions that gets asked is \"What did you change?\" and \"Can we temporarily disable some of all of those changes so we know we're looking at the real problem and not just a symptom of something else.\"\nWith separate locations, these changes can be quickly identified and all you have to do (at least for the programs themselves) is temporarily remove their directories from the path.\n\nA: First, understand that any directory that's not explicitly a mount point for a separate partition (or a subdirectory of such a mount point) is stored on the root (/) partition. Thus, if you've got root (/) and /home, and no other partitions, your /opt directory is simply a directory on root (/). Likewise for /tmp, /sbin, and anything else. Thus, the initial question is based on the false premise that you need separate partitions for every directory that leads off of root (/), and so can't be answered directly.\nSecond, /opt is used for third-party software, which in the context of Ubuntu, means precompiled software that is not distributed via Debian packages. Occasionally you'll see official program documentation that refers to /opt, but Debian packages are available that drop these files elsewhere. In such cases, you should ignore the official documentation, or at least ignore its file-location references, when you use the Debian package. Also, if you have a choice of using a precompiled package via a tarball or a Debian package, it's generally best to use the Debian package. All in all, use of /opt is pretty rare these days. If you still think you need to put files in /opt, you might do well to name the software, since people here may know whether a Debian package is available for that software.\nFinally, combining the two previous points, it's very rare for Ubuntu installations to split /opt off into a separate partition because it's rare for significant amounts of data to be stored there. Most Ubuntu software goes in /usr and other locations. It was once common to split /usr into a separate partition, but that practice is pretty rare today. If you do happen to need to install lots of software in /opt, then creating a separate partition for it might make sense -- but in many cases this won't really be helpful. Separate partitions make sense if you need to handle security differently, if different filesystem features will be helpful, to share data across multiple OS installations in a multi-boot configuration, and for other reasons. Routine software installation is not likely to benefit from a separate partition; in fact, creating a separate partition for /opt could cause problems if the size consumed by software stored there changes, or if you get the size estimate wrong initially.\n\nA: Do you?\nThe fact is that you don't need to do it. Using /opt is a convention. I would recommend using it but it is not strictly necessary.\nFrom Linux Filesystem Hierarchy: Chapter 1. Linux Filesystem Hierarchy:\n\n1.13. /opt\nThis directory is reserved for all the software and add-on packages that are not part of the default installation. For example, StarOffice, Kylix, Netscape Communicator and WordPerfect packages are normally found here. To comply with the FSSTND, all third party applications should be installed in this directory. Any package to be installed here must locate its static files (ie. extra fonts, clipart, database files) must locate its static files in a separate /opt/'package' or /opt/'provider' directory tree (similar to the way in which Windows will install new software to its own directory tree C:\\Windows\\Progam Files\\\"Program Name\"), where 'package' is a name that describes the software package and 'provider' is the provider's LANANA registered name.\nAlthough most distributions neglect to create the directories /opt/bin, /opt/doc, /opt/include, /opt/info, /opt/lib, and /opt/man they are reserved for local system administrator use. Packages may provide \"front-end\" files intended to be placed in (by linking or copying) these reserved directories by the system administrator, but must function normally in the absence of these reserved directories. Programs to be invoked by users are located in the directory /opt/'package'/bin. If the package includes UNIX manual pages, they are located in /opt/'package'/man and the same substructure as /usr/share/man must be used. Package files that are variable must be installed in /var/opt. Host-specific configuration files are installed in /etc/opt.\nUnder no circumstances are other package files to exist outside the /opt, /var/opt, and /etc/opt hierarchies except for those package files that must reside in specific locations within the filesystem tree in order to function properly. For example, device lock files in /var/lock and devices in /dev. Distributions may install software in /opt, but must not modify or delete software installed by the local system administrator without the assent of the local system administrator.\nThe use of /opt for add-on software is a well-established practice in the UNIX community. The System V Application Binary Interface [AT&T 1990], based on the System V Interface Definition (Third Edition) and the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard v. 2 (iBCS2) provides for an /opt structure very similar to the one defined here.\nGenerally, all data required to support a package on a system must be present within /opt/'package', including files intended to be copied into /etc/opt/'package' and /var/opt/'package' as well as reserved directories in /opt. The minor restrictions on distributions using /opt are necessary because conflicts are possible between distribution installed and locally installed software, especially in the case of fixed pathnames found in some binary software.\nThe structure of the directories below /opt/'provider' is left up to the packager of the software, though it is recommended that packages are installed in /opt/'provider'/'package' and follow a similar structure to the guidelines for /opt/package. A valid reason for diverging from this structure is for support packages which may have files installed in /opt/ 'provider'/lib or /opt/'provider'/bin.\n\n", "Q: Dual boot partition accessibility problem I recently installed Ubuntu 15.10 alongside Win 10.

In my case it only sets up an OSD on a single server.  \nHave I understood the main Ceph charm correctly? Should it set up the 3 Ceph Mons and also 3 Ceph-OSDs (configured for /dev/sdb)?  \nMy Ceph knowledge is minimal so I'm still piecing together the terminology and concepts. Am I correct in thinking that a single Ceph-OSD can manage block AND object storage or does Ceph allocate some OSDs solely for block and others solely for object storage?\n\nA: Would you mind posting the config file that you used for your deployment?  That would be helpful.\nGiven your details about the hardware I would think that the charm would setup 3 OSD's (1 per server on /dev/sdb).\nYou're correct about Ceph managing a single block and storage pool.  \n\nA: This can appear slightly confusing at first, the 'ceph' charm sets up both a mon as well as an OSD.  The ceph-osd charm only sets up an OSD (no mon), but otherwise works the same and with the same options.  You will mix them depending on your deployment, and you can relate the ceph and ceph-osd charms to each other.\nFor a minimal cluster of 3 servers (such as you have), you need 3 mons and thus you would simply create 3 units of the 'ceph' charm which will configure both the required mons & an OSD on each unit.  If you had more servers (e.g. 6) you might setup 3 units of ceph and 3 units of ceph-osd.\nThe storage used by ceph can be configured with the osd-devices option on the charm, it can accept either device path(s) in /dev or a filesystem location to place the files which defaults to /dev/vdb - you'll likely need to change it.  Refer to the documentation here: https://jujucharms.com/ceph/ \nLastly with regards to block and object storage, ceph at a lower level provides a \"rados\" service which stores objects and is accessed using a low level rados API.  Within the Ceph cluster (which has multiple OSDs) you can create multiple 'pools' to hold those objects.  Each pool has a name, and the names of objects are unique within a pool (but you can use the same object name in different pools, they are isolated from each other) -- you can also set various options on each pool, such as the number of copies to store each piece of data.  Be mindful though, there is an overhead to each pool (largely in terms of placement groups) and you can't create them wildly, but you are likely to have a few pools in your installation.\nOn top of that Ceph cluster, you can build a number of services including block storage (using RBD - Rados Block Device) and object storage with a REST API (using radosgw).  Both of these services use the rados API at the low level for storing and manipulating the objects, but provide a higher level service such as a block device or HTTP REST interface to the objects.\nWith the object storage gateway (radosgw) your objects are generally named and created in the same way they are within the gateway, which may be obvious, however the RBD rados block device splits the storage volume up into chunks (e.g. 4MB chunks) and creates an object for each chunk and some additional objects which store metadata about the entire block device.  \nYou can run both services (or more) on the same ceph cluster and OSDs, but will generally put each service into it's own pool (radosgw actually uses several pools). \nI hope that helps get you started with the charm itself, some basics about ceph and how both block and file storage can co-exist on a ceph cluster.  It may still be slightly confusing in terms of the terminology still, so I'd suggest having a browse through the manual and search youtube for one of the various talks introducing ceph which will really help you get a handle on the terminology.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu Touch on Nexus 4 with broken touchscreen My friend has Nexus 4 with a broken touchscreen.

I entered everything like so.  I have seen this issue a couple of times on this forum, but I have  a slightly different question.  We connect to this WIFI for dozens of devices. Android, MacOS and iPhone.  Why would the Linux setup be different and require configuration.\nTypically, we would hit the WIFI and the on the first time, a page(with my browser) will come up for me to confirm the certificate.  But that isn't working on Linux.   I also travel to various hotels and there is a prompt after initial connection, will I have the same issue?\nSecurity : WPA & WPA2 Enterprise\nAuthentication : Protected EAP (PEAP)\nCA certificate I downloaded from the MAC machine and copied the cer file to Ubuntu\nPEAP version : Automatic\nInner authentication : MSCHAPv2\nDevice: HP Stream 11\n\nI am using Ubuntu 15.10\nAlso, other documentation recommends, setting 'system-ca-certs=false' but this entry is not defined in the file.

I hate mucking with my wifi network configuration settings.  When I on other devices (mac) I never had to.\n\nA: So I had the same problem and just got it working on Ubuntu 15.10.  The solution requires the following steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Network-Manager to add the SSID (Screen shot of setup).  Make sure authenticated is set to PEAP and inner authentication is MSCHAPv2.  Make sure to select  with your login and password and watch it fail.\n\n*Hit cancel\n\n*Next, navigate to /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections\n\n*Now edit the file matching your network SSID.  \n\n*Delete the line that says \"phase2-altsubject-matches=\" in the [801-1x] section.\n\n*Save and select the SSID in Network-Manager again.  Connects perfectly.\n\n\nI'm not sure what this line is for, but removing it works.  One think to watch out for though, any time you use the gui to edit the connection, the line returns and again has to be removed.\nNote the cert shouldn't be necessary, unless IT gave you the cert to use.\nJust upgraded to 16.04 and the same bug remains.

It's known for dealing very well with all the Microsoft Office formats. Unfortunately it can't handle ODF (LibreOffice) formats, so if you use LibreOffice you'll have to keep it.\nYou can download WPS Office from this link.\nSelect wps-office_10.1.0.5460~a20p1_i386.deb for Ubuntu 32-bit or wps-office_10.1.0.5460~a20p1_amd64.deb for 64-bit.

I finally found out how to uninstall grub so I reformated my usb and tryed it again and the same thing happened! What do I do? I really need this usb!\n\nA: I haven't tried to use the installer on a USB stick, but it is probably not a good idea.\nWhat you want is to use a specific application to make the live USB. If you want to keep your settings etc on the USB, you want to set up persistence.\nThere are several applications that can do this for you, both for Windows and Ubuntu.\nIf you have a Ubuntu Live USB stick, it might have \"Startup Disk Creator\" on it. Use that, and specify some room for \"reserved extra space\".\nIf you have trouble with that, you might look at unetbootin, or find something for Windows/OSX.\n\nA: I'm using a small tool which is Linux Live USB, within 3 steps and you got your live USB, you also can specify persistent space (currently supports some Ubuntu based distros). However, this tool is only available on Windows.\nThe GRUB problem you're fighting with is because using default installer will fire install grub procedure on whole disks (so you can get multi-os selection while booting up). Of course it's possible to customize those grub to install only on USB, but it's sophisticated.\nLive USB + persistent space maybe the simplest solution to your need.\n", "Q: No Sound after Upgrade to Xubuntu 14.04 After the upgrade to 14.04 I can't hear anything anymore.

Exactly what the title asks. Is the terminal window a text editor, can it be used as one, and if not then which are some good ones to install?\n\nA: No, the terminal is not a text editor (even though it can be used as one). The terminal is a program where you can issue commands to your system.\nCommands are nothing but binaries (executables in the form of binary language) and scripts located in specific paths of your system. Each command executes one specific task.\nThere are a few text editors for the command line interface, such as nano (a.k.a. Pico) and vim. For example, if you run nano in your terminal it will open a blank text file that you can edit/save. \n", "Q: Skype installation? Failure!

I have a node.js software agent running on 14.04 not able to run many of his bash scripts on a new server. The problem I seem to have is the limited user returns nothing from the locate or mlocate command.\nI need to figure out why this command works under my admin user but not under the agent's username.\nadmin@host ~ $ locate 6831-7\n/home/example/6831-7.txt\n/home/example/6831-7.pdf\n/home/example/6831-7.psd\n\nadmin@host ~ $ sudo login limited\nPassword:\nlimited@host ~ $ locate 6831-7\n\n#it returns nothing\n\nNothing is returned to stdout, which is the problem I have with my scripts. What would cause this program to not return under this limited user?\n\nA: Even though I added the user to the group, only this seemed to do the trick. I edited the permissions for the database with the following command:\nsudo chmod o+r /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db\n\nProvided that the database is located in /var/lib, this adds world read permissions to the database. The limited user was instantly able to return locate to stdout like normal.\nEdit: The problem with this solution is that updatedb returns the world permissions to 0. So this is only a temporary solution.\n\nA: In my testing, when a non-root user runs locate, contents of directories the non-root user does not have read access to are not displayed.\nIn your case, what are the permissions on /home/example? If user limited does not have read access on /home/example, locate will not show matching files in that directory when run by limited. Assuming there aren't any other files on your system with 6831-7 in the name, your empty results would be expected.\nYou can test this by seeing if limited can use locate to find other files on your system that are world readable, for example /etc/timezone:\nlimited@host$ locate timezone\n/etc/timezone\n/usr/share/help/C/gnome-help/clock-timezone.page\n...\n\nIf you get results, you know locate is able to read the database successfully.\n\nA: There is a bug report on this problem:\n\n*\n\n*Unable to use 'locate' to locate files mlocate.db permission denied\nI didn't follow any of the suggestions there because I know how I had broken my system by using chown to $USER on / instead of /tmp/$USER/ recursively. It took a day to rebuild my system to boot. locate command is one of the left over things to fix.\nBecause my system is over-powered and under-utilized, I already have sudo updatedb running every 15 minutes via cron.

So I downloaded deb package from Amd website and install it. Unfortunetly package was allegedly corrupted so I was force to run apt-get -f and remove it . After reboot I get popout informing me that system is running in \"low graphic mode\" . But when i choose option to agree to one session in low graphic mode , everything is getting stuck in some kind of loop. So basically i only Have access to console login. I've tried to using xinit command but it throws error too. What should I do ?\n\nA: How about trying this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/AMD#Manually_installing_Catalyst_13.4\nDo it step by step so you know you are doing it correctly.\nI have never had Linux + AMD, so this was all I could come up with. I know Nvidia blacklists the open source drivers, maybe AMD does the same?\n\nA: It may be a good idea to do a clean reinstall of your OS. AMD video drivers are finnicky and require a strict procedure to install and update. If you decide to reinstall your OS entirely, you can install/update the video drivers for your AMD GPU following this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are using the open source divers (you can check on the aditional drivers tab, under your system configurations)\n\n*Uninstall the fglrx drivers (the proprietary AMD drivers). To do this, run this command on the terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge \"fglrx.*\"\n\n*Delete your xorg.conf:\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\n*Redownload and install xorg completely:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-core libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:amd64 libgl1-mesa-dri:amd64\n\n*Configure xorg (if this command gives you an error, don't worry about it. This one is more just to be safe than for anything else):\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n*Reboot your computer.\nI do this everytime I need to install a new AMD driver version. It helps to avoid errors. When you boot again, you should be using the open source drivers by default. After this, you can proceed to download and install the AMD drivers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to AMD's website (www.amd.com) and on the tab \"Drivers and Support\" click on the option \"Drivers + Download Center\".\n\n*Once the page loads, look for the \"Latest AMD Drivers and Software\" section and choose the apropriate sub-section for your GPU. For example, I have an R9 270X, so I would choose \"Radeon™ R9 200, R7 200, HD 8500 - HD 8900, and HD 7700 – HD 7900 Series\". On the apropriate sub-section, click on the link that says \"RHEL / Ubuntu / Linux\".\n\n*Another page will load and here again you will have to look for the apropriate section for you. On my example, I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 64bit and an R9 270X, so I would choose the \"Ubuntu 14.04.2 64bit\" link, under \"Radeon™ R9 200, R7 200, HD 7000, HD 6000, and HD 5000 Series\".\n\n*On the next page, download all the packages compatible with your system. On my case, I would download all the packages marked with \"14.04\". On the Crimson 15.12, there are 4 .deb packages to download (Video Driver for Graphics Accelerators; Minimal Video Driver for Graphics Accelerators (Non-X Support); Video Driver for Graphics Accelerators Devel Files (OGL, OCL); Radeon Setting)\n\n*After you download all the packages you need, put them in a folder exclusive for them. Open this folder in the terminal and issue the comand:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nThis command will install all the .deb files located in that folder atuomatically for you. If the install fails, read the output on the terminal. It probably needs some dependent packages to be installed. To install these packages, simply read from the terminal which ones they are and use apt-get to install them. For example, in my system I had to do:\nsudo apt-get install lib32gccl libc6-i386 dkms\n\nAfter you installed any dependecies, run \nsudo dpkg -i *.deb \n\nagain and the instalation should complete.\n\n\n*After the instalation completes, issue on the terminal:\nsudo aticonfig --initial\nand reboot your computer. When it comes back, you should be using the proprietary AMD driver :)\n", "Q: How can I view Ubuntu Files once in Windows 8?

But I don't succeed to install it.\nIt would be great if somebody could help me or struggles with the same problem.\nGreetings,\nalbflo  \n\nA: There is an issue with Skylake processors and Intel pstate drivers in the Linux kernel that hangs the boot process, usually on the message \"Intel_pstate: HWP enabled\".\nIf you add \"intel_pstate=no_hwp\" to the GRUB boot parameters it should work. (Instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters)\nHowever, this disables the more efficient frequency scaling capability (= longer battery times) in Skylake, so hopefully it will be solved soon.\nThe issue is being worked on here:\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110941 \n\nA: To help other people, which are struggling with an equivalent issue, I will post here my solution.\nThanks to @bain I got to this thread New laptop (Skylake) cannot boot Xubuntu even with boot parameters where an equivalent problem was posted. \nThere solution was to add some kernel flags to the boot options, therefore I tried it and got into Ubuntu Live USB with a display resolution of 640x480. To get full resolution and the final opportunity to install Ubuntu I deleted nomodeset from my flags and got full resolution. My final kernel flags for the boot option replaced quiet splash --- :\ni915.preliminary_hw_support=1 nouveau.blacklist=1 edd=on nolapic pcie_aspm=force tpm_tis.interrupts=0 ---\nNow I have installed Ubuntu 15.10 and upgraded to kernel 4.3, but I'm still struggling to get a GRUB menu and to boot finally into Ubuntu. \nEDIT:\nAfter various tries I edit a Ubuntu live USB key to start the grub from my Ubuntu and was able to enter my Ubuntu installation. But to set up the UEFI boot menu is still a problem and I will try later to solve it. Now I try to set up my Wifi: I installed the new firmware from Intel and the driver, also I tried to add intel_pstate=no_hwp to the kernel parameters, because it was suggested in a similar thread. But it doesn't solve the problem for me.\nI will add later more details of my progress. \nEDIT: I tried different kernel parameters for the boot options and now I only need nolapic to be able to boot Ubuntu and i915.preliminary_hw_support=1 to enable the touchscreen and the active pen. \nEDIT: I tried to install kernel 4.4, but afterwards Ubuntu showed a fatal error. Therefore I thought it could be worth to try out a daily of 16.04. To install it I needed intel_pstate=no_hwp in the kernel parameters and on 16.04 I had no issues with my wifi. The only remaining problem was that I wasn't able to enable my touchscreen and active pen, but after some days and some updates of Ubuntu it worked perfect. \nNow I have no system problems left and can work with my new notebook, my last thing to solve is only to enable grub on the startup.\nThanks everyone for the help!!\n\nA: You could try the kernel command-line addition:\ni915.preliminary_hw_support=1\n\nIt is my understanding that all is good with kernel 4.4, so once installed upgrade and you should be sweet.\nPlease let me know if this works, I just ordered a yoga 260 to replace my x201T.\nsource: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=intel-skl-prelim-support\n", "Q: What tool can i use to scan a network and test wake on lan I am looking for a method or tool that would allow me to scan my network and send out packets to see which machines will turn on either ether-wake or wake-on-lan.\n\nA: You need to gather MAC addresses then power off all the computers and then send out the wol packets.

If the partitions are automatically mounted, they may be set to the uid/gid of the automounter's process (I don't have lubuntu but I suspect it is not your primary user).\nFor NTFS in particular, take a look at man ntfs-3g (online here) for the \"uid=\" and \"gid=\" options.\nIf you can open a terminal and cd to the problem partition, you can check ls -la and compare to the working ones (1st column shows permissions, 3rd and 4th columns of output are the user and group id respectively -- it may give you a hint about what is different between the partitions).\n", "Q: c++ boost library problem: cannot find -lboost_system ld returned 1 exit status I have a problem with boost.

The C++ preprocessor reads that file and adds a bunch of declarations to your program.\nA library is a compiled collection of various functions, static data and other stuff. When you use parameter -lboost_system you tell the compiler \"Compile my program and link it with library libboost_system\". \nYour linker complains that it can't find that library (/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_system). The likely reason is that script ./bootstrap.sh did not install boost in the proper directories.\nFrom here on you have a couple of options.\nIf you want to stick to Boost-2014.10.tar.gz you are on your own.\nI would recommend installing package libboost-dev. It will install whatever is the current version of boost for your system and will put all files in the proper places.\nAnd finally: when you removed the #include line from your file it worked but only because your program does not use any functionality from boost::system. If you were to use any boost classes/functions you would get compile errors if you don't have proper headers included.\n\nA: Order of arguments seems to be important, provided that boost package was previously correctly installed with\napt-get install -y libboost-dev\n\nFor example, when compiled like this (cpp files first, then list of libs), no issue\ng++ app.cpp -std=c++11 -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem\n\nBut the command below causes errors\ng++ -std=c++11 -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem  app.cpp\n\ng++ -std=c++11 -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem  app.cpp\n/tmp/cc3kjjNn.o: In function `__static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)':\napp.cpp:(.text+0x9b): undefined reference to `boost::system::generic_category()'\napp.cpp:(.text+0xa7): undefined reference to `boost::system::generic_category()'\napp.cpp:(.text+0xb3): undefined reference to `boost::system::system_category()'\n/tmp/cc3kjjNn.o: In function `boost::filesystem::exists(boost::filesystem::path const&)':\napp.cpp:(.text._ZN5boost10filesystem6existsERKNS0_4pathE[_ZN5boost10filesystem6existsERKNS0_4pathE]+0x19): undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::detail::status(boost::filesystem::path const&, boost::system::error_code*)'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nSlightly different order of arguments causes different error\ng++  -std=c++11  -lboost_system app.cpp -lboost_filesystem\n\n/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cc5p9PJh.o: undefined reference to symbol '_ZN5boost6system15system_categoryEv'\n/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_system.so: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nAlso -lboost_xyz should not include the .so suffix, otherwise\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_filesystem.so\n\nI hope this helps someone.\n", "Q: How do I know whether hardware acceleration is working on VLC?

Usually, apache uses the user www-data and you should ensure that this user has the required permissions.\nThere is a very nice post about this topic here:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/357108/what-permissions-should-my-website-files-folders-have-on-a-linux-webserver\nAssuming you are the only one managing the server, this should be a good starting point.\n\nMaintained by a single user \n  If only one user is responsible for\n  maintaining the site, set them as the user owner on the website\n  directory and give the user full rwx permissions. Apache still needs\n  access so that it can serve the files, so set www-data as the group\n  owner and give the group r-x permissions.\n\nchown -R eve contoso.com\nchgrp -R www-data contoso.com\nchmod -R 750 contoso.com\nchmod g+s contoso.com\nls -l\ndrwxr-s--- 2 eve      www-data   4096 Feb  5 22:52 contoso.com\n\n\nif you have folders that need to be writable by Apache, you can just\n  modify the permission values for the group owner so that www-data has\n  write access.\n\nchmod g+w uploads\nls -l\ndrwxrws--- 2 eve      www-data   4096 Feb  5 22:52 uploads\n\n\nThe benefit of this configuration is that it becomes\n  harder (but not impossible*) for other users on the system to snoop\n  around, since only the user and group owners can browse your website\n  directory. This is useful if you have secret data in your\n  configuration files. Be careful about your umask! If you create a new\n  file here, the permission values will probably default to 755.

Now Ubuntu says me that the space to install softwares is exhausting (\\usr has only 800 MB of free space).\nHow can I exploit the \\home partition by means of its 180 GB?\n\nA: Keep in mind that the forward slash \"/\" and not the back slash \"\\\" is the character for specifying a directory in Linux.  The backslash is a special character that will give special attributes to the next character that following it.\nAs far as using the 180G area, you can find a directory that has content that you might want to consider adding a symbolic link to space on the /home partition.\nYou can check what is using a lot of your space in your /usr partition with this command (or a variation there off):\n$ cd /usr\n$ du -sh $(ls)\n\nSome of the directories will require elevated access to scan.  You can add sudo to check the size of those folders.\n$ sudo du -sh $(ls)\n\nIf you have folders that have spaces you can check those folders by temporarily modifying the field separator with this variation of the command.\n$ STOREIFS=$IFS && IFS=$(echo -en \"\\n\\b\") && sudo du -sh $(ls);IFS=$STOREIFS\n\nNow once you see the folder that is taking up all your space you can move the files to a directory on your /home folder and make a symbolic link to it as such (for instance if /games is the oversize folder).\n$ sudo mkdir /home/games\n$ sudo cp -pvau /usr/games /home/\n$ sudo mv /usr/games /usr/games.old\n$ sudo ln -s /home/games /usr/games\n\nNow after you have verified that the new physical location of your /usr/games folder works you can delete the /usr/games.old folder.\nI used /usr/games as an example.

Gstreamer is the library that actually reads/writes audio tracks - not rhythmbox itself.\nGstreamer is  dependent on reading the ID3 info - if its not in the expected location then it will only pick out the information it can find.\n", "Q: How to upgrade intel-microcode used by iucode-tool? I am running 15.10 and installed the intel-microcode package.\nThe actual microcode being installed is labelled \"20150121\", while the Intel website offers \"20151106\".\nWhat's the command (or procedure) needed in order to install newest update by Intel?\n\nA: Usually you can download the latest intel-microcode package .deb from the latest Ubuntu distro, and just install it.  This will work as long as the first digit of the Debian/Ubuntu version number of the intel-microcode package is the same.\nAlso, sometimes it just doesn't make sense to keep updating older versions of Ubuntu with new microcode packages, because the kernel and other drivers on old Ubuntu don't really support your (newer) processor properly, anyway.  In that case, the recommended is to switch to a newer version of Ubuntu itself (which will also come with a newer intel-microcode package).\nThat said, every so often the Intel group in Canonical will request that older versions of the distro should also get the newest intel-microcode package.\n", "Q: My computer freezes at startup *ERROR* rv770_set_sw_state failed My computer often totally freezes at startup.

The Kernel isn't updated to just annoy people, it gets some really important security updates that could otherwise leave your system open to attack.\nInstead I would either look at filing a bug against the kernel. If you have any development experience, knowing the exact break point allows you to see where the issue is, much more easily than anything else.\nAlternatively, you're on the first rung of a series of LTS hardware enablement stacks (you're on the Utopic Kernel). You could hop to Vivid or Wily. You will need to change to Xenial's stack August 2016 because that'll be the only supported HWE stack.\nThe other alternative is uninstalling all the HWE packages, dropping back to Ubuntu 14.04.1's 3.13 kernel. This is supported for the full five years (into 2019). This is a perfectly sane option unless you have modern graphics requirements.\n\nYour other issues may be related (especially if this is a graphics driver issue) so another stack version can\n\nA: Answered by OP\nIt seems the root cause for my \"maybe related\" problem was a full /boot partition (size 236M), which also blocked my progress in solving my kernel panic.\n\n\n*\n\n*Cleaned out kernels from /boot except the one you booted from,\n\n*Fixed broken package manager with apt-get -f install\n\n*Clean up with apt-get -f autoremove && apt-get update && apt-get upgrade\nTo fix my kernel panic:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install an older kernel which has long term support (3.13 as of writing): apt install linux-generic libgl1-mesa-glx linux-libc-dev linux-tools-generic xserver-xorg libegl1-mesa-drivers\n\n*Reboot, enter GRUB, select this kernel\n\n*Remove other kernel from /boot\n\n*Remove other kernels from GRUB: update-grub\n", "Q: WINE Keyboard Bug.

So the Ubuntu releases using kernel versions 3.8 or later are vulnerable. As @kos already mentioned, on a supported release you can just upgrade the kernel to install the patch:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nHow to Check the Vulenerability (taken from here):\nInstall libkeyutils-dev:\nsudo apt-get install libkeyutils-dev\n\nCopy this C program from github, written by the Perception Point team to test the exploit.\nSave the codes in a file e.g. test_2016_0728.c and compile:\ngcc test_2016_0728.c -o test_2016_0728 -lkeyutils -Wall\n\nRun the compiled program as normal user:\n./test_2016_0728 -PP1\n\nIt would take some time, if your kernel is vulnerable after the completion of the program you will see that your privilege has been escalated i.e. you have become root.\n", "Q: How do I run an executable in a directory I added to PATH?

This may help you (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows).

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.*\nI'd like to know what point release of 12.04 I'm running (the star). I read the information about LTSEnablementStack and it seems 12.04 has point releases 12.04.0, 12.04.1, 12.04.2, 12.04.3, 12.04.4, 12.04.5\nwhich might differ as much as running a different kernel and xorg server.\nI wanted to find out my exact version and the problem is that I get contradictory information.\nusing lsb_release -a yields 12.04.5\nroot@box:~# lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\nRelease:    12.04\nCodename:   precise\n\nlooking at cat /etc/apt/sources.list says 12.04.1\nroot@box:~# cat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep cdrom\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release i386 (20120817.3)]/ precise main restricted\n\nchecking the creation date of my root filesystem (to confirm my memmory that I installed that box somewhere in September 2012 (long before 12.04.5) indicates 12.04.1\nroot@box:~# dumpe2fs /dev/mapper/root    -h  | grep created\nFilesystem created:       Fri Sep 21 12:56:19 2012\n\nthe GUI is of no help at all and says 12.04 only:\n\nSo what point release am I running and why do I see this contradictory information? My kernel is a 3.2 version, which is yet not helping my understanding of the Hardware Enablement Stack Policies and Procedures. Can it be that I had 12.04.1 and accidently changed to 12.04.5? (is this even possible?, yet why do I still run a 3.2 kernel even after apt-get dist-upgrade?)\nOr is only lsb_release -a broken and I should file a bug?\n\nA: You are using Ubuntu 12.04.5. It is updated 12.04 release.\nBut HWE Stack including kernels and X.org is not updated automatically.\nI see no problems or bugs that can be reported.\n\nA: I had the same query when I had updated some systems installed with the 14.04.1 installation medium, that had been updated to 14.04.3 without pushing the kernel onto one of the HWE releases.\nThe thing that made sense of it in my mind is that the installation medium (CD release) for 12.04.5 will use the Trusty HWE kernel (3.13.xx) by default. 12.04.5 as a release, just refers to having all of your packages upgraded to a certain point. \nThe kernel version is not explicitly tied to the point release. \nSo it's fine to have a 12.04.5 release of Ubuntu, which uses the original kernel for 12.04. Having a look at the Kernel Support Schedule is also informative, and helped my comprehension greatly.\n\nA: Short answer: lsb_release -a , /etc/os-release, and /etc/lsb-release will tell you exact info. \nDon't look at # deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release i386 (20120817.3)]/ precise main restricted because that refers to the media that you originally used to install the OS, which cointains packages for 12.04.1. \nIn fact , don't look at /etc/apt/sources.list at all. It can be butchered as you please , and contain sources from releases that are not even supported anymore, or versions newer than that. Example, my /etc/apt/sources.list has deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main universe line even though I run trusty. \n\nA: Ubuntu systems, and GNU/Linux systems in general, are more modular than monolithic.  As a rule, you may pick-and-choose package versions as long as they are all built for the same distribution (in your case, \"precise\", or 12.04).\nThe point release is basically determined by the version of the base-files package that is installed.  The point release number serves as a general indicator of how up-to-date your packages are, but it's impossible to summarize the entire state of your system in one number.\nFrom time to time, as software updates get applied, your base-files package will get upgraded too, and hence the point release number that describes your system will get bumped up too.  These version number bumps are not a big deal, and there isn't much you should do to prevent them.  They merely indicate that a larger-than-usual batch of package updates has been pushed out by Canonical, and that they decided to publish revised DVD images for those checkpoints.\n\nThe line that you found in sources.list:\n\n# deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS _Precise Pangolin_ - Release i386 (20120817.3)]/ precise main restricted\n\n\n… is irrelevant.  First of all, the # character means that that line is commented out, and has no effect.  Second, I assume that you also have some entries in your sources.list pointing to an HTTP repository.  Those repositories on the network would carry packages that are more up-to-date than whatever was on your installation CD, so the package updater would prefer the newer packages.\nSo, you initially installed your system using the 12.04.1 CD/DVD.  But all that is in the past.  Regular package updates have brought you up to 12.04.5 now, as if you had installed your system using the 12.04.5 media.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are running some version of 12.04.  That won't change unless you make a deliberate effort to upgrade to the next release (e.g. 14.04).\n\n*More specifically, you can claim that your OS has been updated to 12.04.5, as indicated by lsb_release.\n\n*The differences between 12.04.1, 12.04.2, 12.04.3, etc. are pretty insignificant, and not something worth fussing over.\n\n*You can elect not to upgrade some of your packages to the latest available, and that's OK.\n\n\nA: Let's break-down your issue into two parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your current Ubuntu version from the output of /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n*Your current Ubuntu version from the output of everything else.\nNow, to the explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Ubuntu.\nThe only lines that gets upgraded in that file are the lines that starts with deb, deb-src, #deb or #deb-src because \n\nUbuntu uses apt for package management. Apt stores a list of repositories or software channels in the file.\n\nIf there are any other lines in the file that are uncommented and doesn't start with deb, etc. then the command sudo apt-get update will produce errors.\nBut the main part relevant to you is that the file doesn't get updated as a whole but the lines in them that are stated above.

I am having a problem with my Samsung Micro SD card (in particular, a Samsung 32GB Evo mircoSDHC UHS-1 Grade I Class 10 Card).\nI use the card in my 8GB Motorola Moto G 4G which is running Android 5.1. Unfortunately the card recently stopped working, and I am not sure why. I bought both in June.\nOne day I simply noticed that the card was no longer mounted to the phone. I am now unable to mount the card onto the phone. There is data stored on the card that I would very much like to recover before I format the card.\nMy computer is running Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, and I figure that it will be easier to recover the data on my computer than on the phone itself.\nMy monitor (Dell, I don't know the model) has a card reader, in particular a Standard Microsystems Corp. 9-in-2 Card Reader (and the Micro SD card came with an SD adapter). The card reader is found by my machine when I run lsusb.\nWhen I insert the card (in it's adaptor) into the Card Reader it is not detected by my machine. \n(I have a laptop which runs Windows, and when I insert the card into the card reader on that, it is found by Windows, but I cannot open the device to see what files are on the card). \nI have tried searching for answers to my problem already, but I have not found exactly what I am looking for. \nI found these similar questions, but the former was too technical for me (I tried to read the documentation attached, but I am not an expert, and my machine is owned by the university, so I did not want to run anything without being sure of what it is doing and that it is safe), while the later assumed that the files have already been deleted. \nI also found this info on GUN ddrescue, which may help me to recover the files, once I can detect the card.\nIdeally what I am asking for is a way to force ubuntu to read the card, and to copy any files on the card that it can to my machine as a back-up. \nI would then be able to format the card, and start over, and hopefully it would be read by my phone again.\nFor the record, I am trying to recover image files (personal photos which I would like back) and audio files (recordings of work meetings which I need back). \nAnd before Captain Hindsight mentions it, I did back up (some of) my data once in the past 6 months, on the 18th November, but obviously I don't do it frequently enough (and I didn't back up the photos)!\nThank you very much!\n\nA: I am sometime facing the same issue after building android for odroid card and badly modify things.\nWhen trying to recover the card, it is sometime quite difficult, but i have discover that using disks app in ubuntu may help : select your SD card and click the gear in right vue of app. Select \"format...\" and choose 'don't overwrite...' and 'mbr'.\nFor me, when the card is partitioned, it recovers partition table, and the SD card can be read again.\nI think you should run a linux image (ubuntu for example) and run it as a live USB key / CD from your laptop, which will be better for card reader.\nYou may want to save your data before : \nsudo dd if=/dev/<SD_path> of=/home/<user>/sdcard.bin\n\n", "Q: Why does Xorg crash all of a sudden in Ubuntu 15.10 and does a forced log-out?

I am using 14.04 LTS 64-bit. I immediately installed a bunch of apps. Everything was working well. I tried out a couple of other desktops (GNOME 3 and LXDE) and they both worked fine. I tried to install Pantheon with this tutorial:\nhttp://tuxdiary.com/2015/06/27/install-pantheon-desktop-ubuntu/\nbut on logging out I did not see Pantheon in the list of desktops. I logged into Unity, and found my desktop empty, with no icons (the launcher had the same icons, but the Files, System Settings and Software Center icons have all changed).

I was able to find all my applications in the Dash, and they were all working. I checked home/user/Desktop and they were all there. I tried dragging them from the Dash to the desktop, but to no avail. I tried to change the desktop background in Settings, but it was   already linked to my downloaded image. I logged into GNOME, and my desktop icons weren't there either. However my downloaded image was in the background. Shortcuts like the super button and Ctrl+Alt+T weren't working in either desktop. . I logged into LXDE and everything was working fine. The desktop icons were there and my image was in the background. Shortcuts were working.

For example the cupsd (common unix printing system daemon) must run on a system in the background in order to be able to print. cupsd looks for local printers and listens for network printers.

You'd only need to do that if you're compiling it from source, which isn't necessary for ordinary use.\nIn fact, unless you removed the gcc package (which would break most of your Ubuntu installation), there's unlikely to be any need to update gcc beyond using the version that comes preinstalled in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: What is the default password for the `tomcat7` user on my system? I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 and I installed Apache Tomcat 7 via\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7\n\nand without editing any configuration I can start and stop the service tomcat7 successfully (localhost:8080 shows me the \"It works!\" page).\nThe installation seems to have created a user tomcat7 under which Tomcat runs. I would like to log in as that user (rather, switch to it using su tomcat7) but I don't know the password -- yet I never configured one.\nWhat is the password for user tomcat7?\n\nA: Firstly, there should be zero reason to login as the tomcat7 user.  There's no logical use case for this, so therefore I'm not sure why you'd try and use it.\n\nYou state in your question you want to set up a virtual X server for a webapp - you don't need to login as tomcat7 to do this, though your question isn't \"How can I launch a virtual X server for my web app as tomcat7 without logging in\", so don't expect help here with that in this question.\n\nHaving said this, it's likely that this is a System User Account and not an actual user; these users typically have no passwords associated with it, as it is designed to be used by system daemons and services, rather than users.  Therefore, you cannot login as that user as it isn't designed to be logged into by users - to use the user, you have to use su to switch user to it, and you have to do so as superuser or root or with sudo.  Also note that there's the option of setting a password, but it's ill-advised to do so, for that user.\n\nOption 1 (Recommended, and the Proper Way to do this): su as sudo or root/superuser\nYou will need to have sudo power, or access to the root user to get this working with these instructions.\nWith sudo:\nsudo su tomcat7\n\nAs root user:\nsu tomcat7\n\n\nOption 2 (NOT RECOMMENDED, because it introduces security concerns and other issues): Set a password\nYou will need to have sudo power, or access to the root user to get this working with these instructions, and it is VERY likely you will break things by doing this.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND not doing this!\nSet a password.\nWith sudo:\nsudo passwd tomcat7\n[set a password with the prompts]\n\nAs root:\npasswd tomcat7\n\nOnce the password is set, then you can just login to the user (either via SSH or the console directly).\nAgain, I strongly recommend that you do not do this method - this could break Tomcat7, and can actually put your system at  risk because someone can now brute-force the password and have access to the tomcat instance as the tomcat user itself.\n\nTo reiterate though: there is no logical reason to need to login as the tomcat7 user.  Do so at your own risk as you can affect evilness on your system if you're not careful.\n", "Q: why I cant delete any folder within /usr/local I try to delete the folder /usr/local, and I realized that I cant change the name of the folder nor I can move and now I cant delete, can someone explains me why??\n\nA: Do not remove or rename that directory!\nAnd unless you know what you're doing, don't mess with items inside it.\nIt is a core system directory, and should not be removed.  If it's empty, then don't worry because it's OK if it's empty - that empty directory isn't going to impinge on your disk space at all, so there is no reason to remove it.\nFolders inside that directory are locally-installed (compiled, or locally installed by hand) programs, libraries, and dependent files which you should not mess with without good reason.

Root and regular accounts are separated so that, apart from other things, malicious software can't run as root. Are users supposed to be careful what they execute before sudo times out?\n\nA: sudo settings by default have 15 minutes time out before reprompting for password, however one can change it to always ask for password every time you call something with sudo. The exact option is timestamp_timeout\n\ntimestamp_timeout\n                   Number of minutes that can elapse before sudo will ask\n                   for a passwd again.  The timeout may include a frac‐\n                   tional component if minute granularity is insufficient,\n                   for example 2.5.  The default is 15.

In most cases, this is not as 'insecure' as you think - many hardened servers have a far shorter timeout, or in my case on my servers I actually configure it for an instant timeout after sudo is executed, requiring the password for each sudo command made.\nTo this end, sudo is 'secure' because there's timeouts which expire, to make sure sudo can't be used infinitely and perpetually after one use.\nIt is not 'insecure' in this manner, though there are times where it appears that way - disabling the credential caching solves this, of course, and is very easy for system administrators to do.\nIn a default install, the default 15 minute caching would appear as the balance between 'security' and 'convenience', because we don't want new users to be having headaches by entering passwords for every time.  Having said this, where security is important we can lock down sudo by changing the configuration.\nTL;DR: No, sudo is not insecure at all. It's the default caching, and your hypothetical being called while sudo access is cached, that triggers your thought, but sudo is NOT actually insecure when configured with a short timeout, or with instant timeout, and that's done at the system administrator's decisions on those systems whether to change the default.\n\nA: \nIsn't this a big security hole?\n\nNo. But yes, it is lowering security a bit in favour for convenience. You can secure a system with a 128-bit password, throw it away and nobody is ever going to get access to the system ... Secure? Yes. Convenient? Hardly ;-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Leaving a system unattended where sudo is active is. \n\n*There is a solution to this: sudo -k cancels the current time-out. I execute this every time I leave my system and I believe the 15 minutes are active. \n\n\n\nAre users supposed to be careful what they execute before sudo times out?\n\nYes and no. An admin is supposed to be careful anytime they use \"sudo\". Not just when it is within the 15 minute time frame.  So the 2nd part of your question is not important ;)\nYou are an admin. You are responsible to keep your system safe. \n", "Q: batch \"convert\" into jpg with nice alpha flatten I would like to batch resize and convert to jpg a few png files.

I could access the dashboard at https://(ipaddress):1443 without issue.\nAfter moving the hard drive into a different machine and verifying network connectivity, I could no longer access the dashboard at all.

You don't say how you did this, so I can't say what your (presumed) mistake was, but chances are you accidentally operated on the wrong partition or even accidentally did much more extensive partitioning operations.\nI can't really be more specific without more specific information, such as a screen shot of GParted or the output of sudo parted -l. (You can do this from a boot of a live USB disk to minimize the risk of doing further damage.)\nIf I'm right, though, your best hope for full recovery is to restore files from a backup. If you don't have a backup, your best hope for partial recovery is to use a tool like PhotoRec to extract files from the disk onto a separate recovery medium. Some Windows-specific tools are said to do a better job recovering filenames than PhotoRec, but I don't have pointers to specific tools.

Assuming it conforms to typical Debian versioning and such, then...\nTake php7 you stated:\nPHP 7.0.0-2+deb.sury.org~trusty+1\n\nThis string is dissected as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*PHP = the software name\n\n*7.0.0 = the version of that software (from PHP's own versioning schemes)\n\n*-2 = the Package Revision number - that is, how many different packaging changes have been done - this would be the \"Second Package\" which means they made changes to the packaging or applied patches through quilt in the second version.\n\n*+deb.sury.org indicates the repository source - it's from deb.sury.org repos, which are actually PPAs running on Launchpad, with packages made by the one who runs the deb.sury.org website.\n\n*~trusty+1 - This indicates additional version specific changes done for the repository - this is an Ubuntu Trusty, package, and likely is either the first or second revision of the package (depending on if they ever had +0 or not) specific for Trusty.\n\n\nTL;DR: This is a PHP 7.0.0 package, but it has had a couple of revisions since the initial PHP 7.0.0 package.\n\nSecond part, how to get PHP 7.0.2.\nThe repository you are using is a PPA - likely this one.  \nIt was informed to me that 7.0.2 is available and you need to run apt-get update && apt-get upgrade.  That should put you on the right versions.  If it doesn't, then try using apt-get dist-upgrade as there may be other dependencies that need added and the upgrade was held back because of that.\n", "Q: Triple boot, customize grub (Windows 8.1, Ubuntu, Zorin) I have a Win8.1 laptop.

I'm pretty experienced with Ubuntu, so I might be able to make myself useful here :-)\nThanks a lot for your help!\nEdit: I successfully uninstalled Windows 10 and installed Ubuntu. I deleted every partition except the first two (the WINRE and EFI partitions). I used efibootmgr to set Ubuntu to boot by default.\n\nA: My first suggestion would be to disable Secure Boot from BIOS Setup. Then, boot from a bootable Ubuntu USB. Use GParted to delete the Windows partition (and any other Windows Recovery partitions). Install and run boot-repair. \n\nA: Use efibootmgr.  EFI boot works through a small configuration file that states which boot options are there.  efibootmgr allows you to tinker with those, delete unnecessary ones, and change the boot order.\n\nA: did you happen to check out the documentation here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nI was in your boat and I disabled UEFI, but that was years ago (6) on my laptop and I just never wanted to go back. That was in the early days though with many improvements since then.\n\nA: I realize you've already done what you wanted, but to directly answer your question, yes, you can safely delete all the partitions and re-install Ubuntu. The installer will create a new ESP (or you should create one yourself, either using the installer's partitioner or before you launch the installer). The ESP is simply a FAT partition with a particular type code (EF00 in gdisk or the \"boot flag\" set in libparted-based tools). I recommend a size of 550MiB, simply because that's an easy-to-remember value that's larger than various problem points a little below that value.\nWith all Windows partitions gone, the firmware won't have any Windows recovery tools to launch, so there'll be no chance of it doing so. The greatest risk in this approach is that the firmware might still refuse to launch GRUB by default -- some EFIs are just plain broken and won't launch anything but the Windows boot loader, or at least what they think is the Windows boot loader, based on its filename or the description in the NVRAM. This problem is rarer today than it was a few years ago, but it still sometimes crops up.\n", "Q: can kubuntu and edubuntu desktop both be installed? well, the title says it all...\nI´ve heard of edubuntu desktop, and I think it´ll be very usefull for my child, so the point is can both desktops live together?\nthanks in advance\n\nA: If you can install it like @Daniel\n recommends, \"Try \nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends kubuntu-desktop edubuntu-desktop\n\nThen it should be available to be selected on your login screen where you can choose between Kubuntu and Edubuntu; by selecting the wheel next to the password box. \n", "Q: Can't mount internal hard drive? I'm having some trouble with my internal hard drive and was hoping you smart people could help me. So, here's all that has happened so far:\nThursday of last week, my Acer Win 7 (updated to Win 10) computer began an update. I thought it was business as usual, but I was wrong. First, it was stuck on a page that just said \"restarting\", after applying the update. I waited quite a while, but nothing happened. The only thing I thought I could do was a hard shutdown (since it was going to restart anyway). It started to boot like normal (showed the Acer logo and blinking cursor for a second), but then it went to a black screen. I waited hours and nothing happened.\nSo, the first thing I decided to do was make a Win 10 iso bootable USB drive. After an hour of looking at the Windows logo, with its swirling loading symbol, a menu finally came up! I've tried a few different things (restore, reset, etc), but I got errors on all of them. Each time I selected an option on the Windows 10 menu, it took a good 30-45 minutes for it to go to a different page (system restore, image, etc).\nSince this didn't seem to be working, I decided I'd use my trusty Ubuntu Live USB that I made; I've owned my PC quite a while and I've had to do this one other time. I knew it'd be a simple procedure: get my data off the hard drive and do a clean Win 10 reset, but I was wrong. When I clicked my ACER hard drive on the menu, I received this error:\nError mounting /dev/sda3 at /media/ubuntu/ACER: Command-line `mount    -t       \n\"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=999,gid=999\" \"/dev/sda3\"     \n\"/media/ubuntu/ACER\"' exited with non-zero exit status 13:     \nntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: Input/output error\nFailed to read of MFT, mft=155471 count=1 br=-1: Input/output error\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda3': Input/output error\nNTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a\nSoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware.

Will I run into issues with the proprietary driver when I install the new xserver stuff?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: When the system is set up properly and you follow exactly the instructions :  \nUbuntu 14.04.3 Trusty Tahr Release Notes LTS Hardware Enablement Stack \n... there should nothing go wrong with the proprietary NVIDIA drivers 352.\nAfter the upgrade you shouldn't notice any different graphics experience.\nYou don't have to uninstall or reinstall any graphics drivers software at all.  \nTo opt into the Trusty hardware enablement stack - open a terminal and execute this command :  \nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-core-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-vivid xserver-xorg-input-all-lts-vivid libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-vivid\n\nIf you have Ubuntu (as 64 bit edition) installed in UEFI mode, additionally execute this command :  \nsudo apt-get install linux-signed-generic-lts-vivid  \n\nAfter rebooting the system you are using kernel 3.19 with the NVIDIA drivers remain unchanged.\n", "Q: How to install the new GNOME Software app on 16.04 for testing purposes?

Has anyone had any success with installing ubuntu on an Asus K501U?  \n\nA: There's only one way of knowing: Testing.\nUbuntu uses the Linux kernel. Unlike Windows' NT kernel, Linux comes with most drivers built-in, so in 99% of the cases every piece of hardware will be \"plug-and-play\": you insert it, it works. No need to install anything.\nBut sometimes you may have some trouble, specially with extremely new hardware, since Linux may not have its drivers yet. But, again, in 99% of the cases you can solve the problems with no headache.\nSo there's a rule of thumb: if you have very new hardware, stick with the latest Ubuntu release (currently 15.10 Wily Werewolf). It ships with a new kernel version and has a bigger driver collection. In the rest of the cases, get the latest LTS (Long Term Support) release (currently 14.04 Trusty Tahr), which has extended support and more stability.\nA great way of knowing if Ubuntu (and virtually any Linux system) will work well with your machine is using a Live media (the same you'll use to install the OS). Boot from it and test everything, like internet connection (wired/wireless), sound, performance, support to your devices, etc. Once you're sure that it's running fine you can proceed to the installation.\n", "Q: Windows doesn't boot after restoring grub I've been trying to solve the problem on my own using this forum and others but I can't fix it.\nI had ubuntu and windows 10 installed and both worked fine.

I want to create a new user for my friend and let him access to my raspberry pi remotely from another city using SSH. I want to let him do what ever he wants except accessing respi-config other users files, managing users or and shutting down my pi. And as I mentioned before I want him to be able to do anything else like a sudo user.\nWhat should I do? Is there anyway to do that?\nSorry I ask this question here, but I asked in raspberrypi.stackexchange.com but they couldn't answer that and suggested me to ask it here.\nRegards,\n\nA: You can run sudo visudo to edit the /etc/sudoers file. There, or can specify which users will be allowed to do which sudo commands. It is recommended to view the man page before (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man5/sudoers.5.html) \nThe deny special things write an ! in front of it. \nYourFriend = ALL=ALL, !*raspi.conf*\n\n", "Q: convert txt file to csv seperated with tabs Sorry people I'm new to Linux, and while I looked through the list of answered questions, I don't know enough to recognize if my question was answered.  Or if I can adapt one of the answer to my particular little problem.  \nI get a text file of data from my boss, who learned to use computers one way; and he won't change.  The data is almost a csv file, except the fields are all separated by a space characters rather then a comma or tab character.  And the text fields of data include embedded spaces also.\nEach field is either a number or is numbers and text, all fields are of varying lengths, and none are off-set with single or double quotes.  The number fields predominate, and no text field is adjacent to any other text field.  Rarely is an embedded number in a text field preceded or followed by a [space] character.\nUnfortunately not every [space] character can just be replaced.  Instead because, generally, field breaks come in the form of either [space][0-9] or [0-9][space], this is how I determine if a [space] character should be converted to a [tab] character or not.  If the [space] character is beside a digit its to be converted to a [tab] character.\nSo using the Find/Replace function in Notepad for Windows, I search for a digit-space or a space-digit combination, converting that [space] character to a [tab] character.  I have to do this ten times [0-9][space] and then ten more times [space][0-9].\n  I'm looking for a script to do this automatically.  \nHere is an example of the file I get.  It contains four fields separated by [space] characters (first line).  Each following line is one record, so the second line is the first record.  Account is 2281, Units are 19, Description is Toshiba PX-1982GRSUB{, and finally the Delta field contains the 0:\nAccount Units Description Delta  \n2281 19 Toshiba PX-1982GRSUB 0  \n9618 200 HP MX19942-228b -25  \n19246 4 CompuCom HD300g Hard Drive 4\n\nSo what I'm looking for is a script that will read the original file, convert the [space] characters that are field separators into  characters and write it all to a new file.  And I want the explanation -- so I don't keep asking the same questions over and over again.\n\nA: Ok, so you need to replace the first two and the last space in every line with a comma. You can't just replace every space, because the 3rd field may contain spaces itself. You can do this with regular expression replacement. Here's a sed script/command, that works:\nsed -re 's/^(\\S*) (\\S*) (.*) (\\S+)\\s*$/\\1,\\2,\\3,\\4/' in.txt > out.csv\n\nWith the above example this returns:\nAccount,Units,Description,Delta\n2281,19,Toshiba PX-1982GRSUB,0\n9618,200,HP MX19942-228b,-25\n19246,4,CompuCom HD300g Hard Drive,4\n\nThis is still quite fragile with handling empty fields and breaks entirely, if columns other than the 3rd contain spaces. It's very easy to introduce such malformed data if it is formatted manually as done by your boss. You should suggest to him to switch to a more robust table format (e. g. proper CSV & Co.) and editor (common spread sheet tools can manipulate CSV quite well and flexibly, e. g. LibreOffice/OpenOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel and Google Docs).\n\nA: A web search for \"replace space with comma\" was very fruitful, didn't that work out for you first? Would've found lots of answers like this:\ntr ' ' ',' < input > output\n\nor for tabs:\ntr '\\t' ',' < input > output\n\nand \nsed 's/\\s\\+/,/g' input > output\n\n\\s is the space class (like [:space:]) and should replace any runs (+ (escaped) = one or more of the preceding character) of spaces or tabs or newlines too. This next one would only replace each single space or tab with a single comma (like running both above tr's) :\nsed 's/[ \\t]/,/g' input > output\n\nAnd -i edits the file in-place (directly edits the file) in sed\nHere's a sed that will match a space-number or a number-space, and replace them with a comma, using the OR command/symbol | escaped as \\| below:\nsed 's/ [0-9]\\|[0-9] /,/g'\n\n", "Q: Bluefish Turns Belly-Up Earlier this afternoon I was using Bluefish Editor on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with no problem.

[Gmail]/All Mail shows all of your\n  messages, whether or not they have labels attached to them. If you\n  want to delete a message from all folders, move it to the\n  [Gmail]/Trash folder.\n\nAccordingly, Evolution tries to fetch a message which actually does not exist in the specified location/folder, thus receiving an unexpected server response from the server.\nAnyway, the problem was solved by deleting the file \n/home/<user>/.cache/evolution/mail/<profile>/folders.db\n\nwhich in essence should be the same as DELETING THE EMAIL ACCOUNT.\nI'd strongly suggest to do that after backing everything up.

I have created my bootable USB drive using Rufus (GPT for EFI). I have disabled Secure Boot mode and Fast Startup, as described on many websites. As I boot on the drive, I have the choice between Try or Install Ubuntu. When I pick install, I go trough the language selection and the next screen (asking if I have any space, internet...). So far so good. But after that, nothing. Under the windows Installation type, the screen is blank. No drive appears. I don't even get to choose th installation option for Ubuntu to dual-boot alongside Windows Boot Manager as seen on other thread. If anyone could help with that, I have been struggling for hours now.\n\nA: Try dropping to a shell or launching the \"try before installing\" option and opening a Terminal. Type ls /dev/sd? to see what disks are available. You should see at least two -- /dev/sda and /dev/sdb. One of these (typically /dev/sda) is your hard disk and the other (usually /dev/sdb) is the installation medium. (Unless you're booting from a CD, in which case you may see just /dev/sda.) From your description, I suspect that you'll see just /dev/sda, and that it will be your USB flash drive installation medium.\nIf I'm right, then the problem is that Ubuntu does not yet have drivers for your computer's disk controller -- or maybe your disk is unplugged or malfunctioning, but that should show up as an inability to boot Windows. I was under the impression that the Dell XPS 13 was supported, so this is surprising, if it's what you see. The solution to such problems is usually to use a more recent version of Ubuntu. You imply that you've tried both 14.04 and 15.10, and the latter is the most recent released version. You might try the Xenial alpha, though.\nIf you see both /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, then something else is going on. Posting a screen shot of the screen where you run into the problem may be informative. The output of dmesg may be helpful, too. (Type dmesg > foo.txt, post foo.txt to a pastebin site, and post the URL to the document here.)\n", "Q: Mouse cursor leaving \"trails\" / artifacts On Ubuntu Gnome 15.10, my mouse cursor leaves strange \"trails\" all around the screen. This happens when the cursor moves over or leaves a dynamic screen element (anything that changes on hover) such as a link or a toolbar button.\nHere's a quick screencast showing what it looks like (posted on YouTube)\nAny help to fix this quirk would be appreciated.\n\nA: I had the same problem in Kubuntu 16.04 and got rid of the trails by turning the Tearing / VSync to always redraw everything (System Settings > Display > Compositor).\nYou get also rid of the trails by turning off OpenGL (also found in the Compositor settings), but then you lose hardware acceleration.\n\nA: If you have Universal Access > Zoom enabled on Ubuntu then in my experience you will get a square artifact that follows your cursor and leaves a trail (but only on the desktop, not over application windows).  Turning off the Zoom feature (and enabling only when I need it) solves this artifact issue for me on Ubuntu (18,19 and now 20LTS).\n\nA: Thanks to Mark's answer which led me to look for ways to configure Gnome to redraw everything on vsync, I finally found a fix for this in Gnome. Just add this line to your /etc/environment file:\nCLUTTER_PAINT=disable-clipped-redraws:disable-culling\n\nI am finally free of cursor trails and screen tearing in Ubuntu 16.04 with Gnome 3.18.2.\n\nA: Same problem with Ubuntu 18.04LTS that installed KiCad 4.0.7. Fixed with installing KiCad 5 from http://kicad-pcb.org/download/ubuntu/ .\nNB: you don't really download from the KiCad home site, but using the instructions for Ubuntu, you add a download site to your software downloader with a PPA. Then use 'apt' to install KiCad 5. Pretty simple procedure with simple instructions. This way, you will automatically upgrade to new versions like any other Ubuntu packages.\n\nA: I had a problem with screen tearing just after upgrading Kubuntu 16.10 to 17.04. Answers from Joseph and comment from MariusMatutiae (under Mark's answer) helped me but I had to use both solutions together. To sum up I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Went to System settings > Display and Monitor > Compositor\n\n*Set Rendering backend to OpenGL 3.1\n\n*Set Tearing prevention (\"vsync\") to Full screen repaints\n\n*Added CLUTTER_PAINT=disable-clipped-redraws:disable-culling in /etc/environment\n\n*Logged out and logged back in\n\n\nA: I just had this problem with Linux Mint 18.2 (based on Ubuntu 16.04) freshly installed and running Cinnamon. One monitor is plugged to my i7 Sky lake and one is on a Radeon R7. I updated the kernel to the new 4.13 released yesterday but it didn't changed anything. I tried to switch the main monitor, no result. I don't have a the compositor setting in Cinnamon, but I know this was a GPU driver problem, to repaint everything everytime didn't look like a nice solution. So I updated Mesa from 17.0.2 to 17.1.2 (even if it's still OpenGL 3) and then activated DRI3 instead of DRI2 (following this wiki page) and TADA!

Sudo has a configuration option that allows to keep given environmental variables from the user issuing the sudo command. The options is called env_keep and can be configured by changing the settings in /etc/sudoers files as follows (always use visudo to edit the file):\nvisudo\n\nDefaults    env_reset\nDefaults>root    env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK\n\nIn other words,  add the line keeping the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable below the Defaults     env_reset line. Then save the file and run\nssh-agent bash\nssh-add\n\nand you should be able to execute a sudo command that accesses your server using the non-sudo user’s key without being asked for the key passphrase.\n\nA: Unfortunately I can't find the original source of this suggestion but this did the trick for me. Essentially it uses the current users's ssh environment variables when running the command with sudo. \nsudo sh -c 'export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=\"'\"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\"'\"; export SSH_AGENT_PID=\"'\"$SSH_AGENT_PID\"'\"; ssh-add /root/.ssh/id_rsa'\n\n", "Q: how to install devstack on ubuntu 14.04 I am new to ubuntu and i have to install devstack when I am trying to install it gives the following error message.\n[ERROR] /home/tcs2/devstack/functions-common:607 git call failed:\n[git clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack/requirements.git /opt/stack/requirements]\nError on exit\nWorld dumping... see /opt/stack/logs/worlddump-2016-01-21-082913.txt for details\n/bin/sh: 1: brctl: not found\nsudo: ebtables: command not found\nsudo: ebtables: command not found    \nsudo: ebtables: command not found\n\n\nA: Does this command work in your machine?\ngit clone git://git.openstack.org/openstack/requirements.git /opt/stack/requirements\n\nIf you have new (relatively fast) machine, you could try with BOMSI.

My issue is that on my first connection to ssh, it will ask me for a password, but additional sessions on top of that will not ask for a password.  \nI've already checked my sshd_config to make sure that it contains:\nRSAAuthentication yes\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\nAuthorizedKeysFile  %h/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nPretty sure my permissions are right, because if they weren't then passwordless ssh wouldn't be working at all.\nTo add more \"fun\" to this problem, I noticed that when I restart my computer (either the client computer or the ssh server computer), sometimes it will work.  Then when I shut down the computer and try it again the next day, it doesn't work anymore.  Maybe this is completely random, but it's something I've noticed.\n\nA: This is common issue with encrypted home, and was answered many times, for example on Unix, but is covered even in official Ubuntu documentation.\n\nThis is probably caused by the fact, that your home directory (and therefore the key) is not accessible during the login time. This can be caused by the fact, that your home is mounted from network drive (on shared system) after login or your home directory is encrypted (usually installs of workstations).\nSolving this is complicated, but I will have a look for some discussion. Solution is to move the AuthorizedKeysFile to some other place, that will be accessible or us global store for keys (/etc/security/authorized_keys), or some kind of SSO management system (IPA, LDAP), which will get your key from directory server (yes, can be local). Depends on how much control of the target system you have.\nProbably best solution is to store your keys in other place, changing the value in sshd_config:\nAuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/%u/authorized_keys\n\n\nAnyway, if you will move your authorized_keys, make sure they have proper permissions and count with the fact, that if you log in using public key, you will not be able to access your home directory (it is encrypted by your password!), unless you change the way how it is encrytpted.\n\nA: If certificate copied correctly, then it should work with the connection formated like this:\nssh hostname\\ip -l username\n\nWhere username is the user, who have you certificate in .ssh/authorized_keys\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't boot and I can't load HD I've been the happy user of Ubuntu 14.04 for the past year. However, a few days ago my laptop stopped booting, when I turned it on.

Failed to create dual-booting. Is my data on another partition permanently lost? I installed Ubuntu on a machine with Windows 8.1. And I think I screwed up big time while trying to figure out how to make the system a dual-booting one (the Ubuntu installer didn't detect that a Windows operating system was present on the computer. I assume it had to do with the way my USB-bootable drive was originally configured, but I'm not sure though). So, I believe I have installed Ubuntu over the Windows and the Windows, I think, has pretty much been wiped out. There were two partitions there: C, with the Windows itself and another one, D, with all my data.\nHere are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you think I have permanently lost all my data that was stored on disk D?\n\n*If not, is there any possibility that the data could be recovered?\n\n\nA: If you let the Ubuntu installer use the entire disk, then at least your bootloader is messed up with the Linux GRUB best case scenario, however your files may be gone. The easiest way to know for sure would be to use your Ubuntu USB drive and run in live mode, do not attempt to install, then search your HDD for leftover windows directories. If they are there, you can backup important files to the USB, an external drive, or upload them to cloud storage. \nThere should be a volume option on the under the basic directories in the file navigator (assuming you are using desktop ubuntu, if not, Id recommend to get desktop ubuntu for easier searching of your drive) that will give you root to any leftover data that may be intact. \n\nA: Actually what happens is this, when ever you load new operating system or a file in any memory drive (Hard disk,floppy disk,etc...). \nYour data will never be deleted(formated), It will be just over-written.\nIt means that the data was replaced with the existing one.\nEven if you delete your file from recycle-bin, it isn't deleted permanently. Your operating system just ignores it as a file and it(os) was ready to manage data on those particular addresses of drive to be replaced with new data.\nSo if you have installed Ubuntu on 'C' or 'D' drive that memory (around 3 to 4Gb) which will be used by the operating system on your hard disk(over-written)\nSo there was no need to worry at all.\nI recommend you to download a 'Do Your Data Recovery' application for windows and recover all the data.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your data isn't permanently deleted. (you can recover them.)\n\n*You can recover them by the above mentioned method.\nThere were some great options available in Linux, but they were not user-friendly for a beginner.\nIf you don't have windows operating system right now, I prefer to install it (In case if you are a beginner).\nOf-course there was another way that is through terminal,\nCommand:\n    ntfsundelete\n\nfor the above command to work the drive which you were referring is supposed to be of 'ntfs-filesystem' and another condition is that should be a separate drive.\n", "Q: How to debug keyboard shortcuts not working?

Trying to use your integrated graphics will only complicate things further. You may want to try a headless linux / server edition and just forget about the integrated graphics if mining is really your main goal. Unity is known to take its toll on light weight gpus, if you want a desktop you might try Lubuntu then driver install, or start with server linux, install gfx driver, then install a desktop.\nMaking a backup of xorg.conf before this is done can save a little trouble in some cases. Check out section 4.2 in this link below for a step by step. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/AMD \nEdit- even though your computer did not need a xorg.conf on basic install, you often need to add one to gain more control over gpus. \nThese examples are using an Nvidia gpu to generate a xorg.conf, however I see nothing that would stop it from working with AMD/ATI (except for the one answer that calls for nvidia-xconfig)\nInstead \"sudo amdconfig --adapter=all --initial\" can be used as a replacement for that command to generate a xorg.conf for multiple gpus. \nHow to make an xorg.conf file\nFull documentation can be found here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config\nThis includes some docs on dual gpu systems with hybrid graphics like yours. \nThere are no cryptocurrencies left that will generate anything but a loss in electrical usage when mined with a gpu though due to asics being the large part of the scene, if it is merely for testing and curiosity of how it works by all means plug away, you may want to visit the bitcoin.stackexchange for some further advice. \n", "Q: Acer - Win10 & Ubuntu dual booting I have also an Acer Aspire VN7-592 G with Windows 10 pre-installed.\nI am trying to install Ubuntu alongside Win 10 in dual boot, but no matter what version I put 14, 15, 16 at boot I have no option of booting Ubuntu in the boot menu in UEFI mode.\nSecure boot is disabled as well.\nIf I try to boot it in Legacy mode, and choose Ubuntu the PC is freezing.\nI have no idea how can I fix this so that I can have Ubuntu and Win 10 alongside in dual boot.\nAny help would be apreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nA: Try disabling Windows fast startup under Power options and reboot in UEFI mode.\n\nA: There were some ways to deal with this:\nFirst of all if at all you have installed it under 'UEFI'.

Then go to 'Boot options'.\nThere you should see 'EFI' option.\nThen select Ubuntu from it. (I think you will be met with several options please check them one after other)\nIf you don't like this, I think under 'EFI' in boot-menu you have one option to sign the keys.

For example if your username is \"father\" and your son's primary group is \"son\" (i.e. by default files are created as belonging to group \"son\"), then just do this to add yourself to that group:\nsudo gpasswd -a father son\n\nYou will have to log out and back in for the change to take effect.\n[However, your son will still be able to easily hide a folder by setting 700 permissions on it.\nBut if he does that, you can always look into it as root or maybe even add a cronjob which would find such folders and change their permissions.\nAlternatively, he could encrypt his files and preventing that would be quite difficult, or just save them on a USB stick. In any case, in the long term it's a loosing battle.]\nAs for umask, as suggested by dadexix86, the default umask of 0022 already makes it so that files and folders are readable by members of the primary group.\nBut it does not prevent your son from using \"chmod go-rwx\" to change that, unless you prevent him from using \"/bin/chmod\".\nSome possible advanced alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*ACLs: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/232527/how-to-prevent-a-user-from-changing-his-home-directory-permissions\n\n*Concerning being able to admin your son, without being root, an interesting solution would be to log in as him using a different password or other authentication method.

Check with:\nps -ef | grep panel\n\nand you can see its process ID in second column.  For instance, a running panel for me shows like:\njohn      2324  2191  0 07:09 ?        00:01:11 /usr/lib/unity/unity-panel-service\njohn     15587 15557  0 14:18 pts/25   00:00:00 gnome-panel\njohn     15607 15557  0 14:20 pts/25   00:00:00 grep panel\n\nYou'll want to keep unit-panel-service.

For me it goes away with:\nkill -9 15587\n\nWhere the -9 forces the kill, but is maybe not necessary for this case.\n", "Q: Add a multi-line text with one variable to multiple files using bash I want to create a script that puts a multi-line text as a header in multiple files with txt extension.

Beyond removing old kernel images (as is the first step when it comes to cleaning /boot out) I had to also remove a .old-dkms-backup file (which a first made sure to backup), which thankfully freed up enough space.  However, the fact that these newer kernel images (for 4.2. at least) are nearly twice the size (35 MB compared to 20 MB) of their 3.13 counterparts means that for those installing newer Linux kernels (4.2 and onward) may want to set aside ~ 500 MB for their /boot partitions to avoid this problem. \n", "Q: No wireless Ubuntu 15.10 for Lenovo Yoga 3 11 I got a Lenovo Yoga 3 11 and installed Ubuntu 15.10 trouble is\n\n*\n\n*no wifi\n\n*no ethernet (computer is too thin)\n\nI've heard this is a very specific bug.

However you can alter that using the dotglob setting e.g.\n$ mkdir dir\n$ touch dir/.hidden dir/visible\n\n$ echo dir/*\ndir/visible\n\n$ shopt -s dotglob\n$ echo dir/*\ndir/.hidden dir/visible\n\nYou can unset the option afterwards with shopt -u dotglob\n\nA: Use find command with logical OR flag (-o )  and -exec . . .\\+ flag\n find . -maxdepth 1 \\( -iname \"*.*\" -o -iname \".*\"   \\) -exec grep \"MySearchTerm\" {} \\+ \n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*find is a recursive command that searches files in specified directory. In this case , it is . the current working directory.\n\n*-maxdepth flag tells us to stay only in current directory. If you want to go recursivelly or specify how many subdirectories to descent, change 1 to number of levels you wanna go.\n\n*\\( . . .\\) part prevents shell of treating that as subshell, rather treating it as grouping of arguments to find.\n\n*-iname flags allow specifying for which filenames to search.\n\n*-o flag will tell find to search for files *.* or files that start with leading dot , the hidden files.\n\n*-exec . . .{} structure allows running specific command to operate on files found. \\+ will tell find to take all the files as arguments for the command you want to run, in this case grep.\n\n\nHere's a small example, where you can see SEARCHFILE.txt and .SEARCHFILE.txt are both found:\nDIR:/xieerqi\nskolodya@ubuntu:$ find . -maxdepth 1 \\( -iname \"*.*\" -o -iname \".*\"   \\) -exec grep \"HelloWorld\" {} \\+ 2>/dev/null           \n./SEARCHFILE.txt:HelloWorld !

In GUIs applications these files are usually not shown, whence their name.\nYou can use shell globbing:\ncat {*,.*} | grep blabla\n\nThe previous command include all files with no dot (*) and all files that start with a dot (.*).\nBy the way, this is an useless use of cat, and you should instead write your command as:\ngrep blabla {*,.*} \n\n", "Q: User home folder size limit I am trying to find anything on the web no success.\nIs there any way to limit size of home directory for user ? \nOr any directory ? \nThe best would be by percentage for two users 45% and 45%. \nBut by gigabytes will be fine as well. \nThank you so much. \n\nA: *\n\n*Open /etc/fstab with a commandline editor (vi, sed, nano) to add the usrquota and/or grpquota to the partition (depending on your needs: pick one or both)(and yes, it assumes you use a partition for  it and in this case that would be /home/):\n\n\n*\n\n*userquota is for users\n\n*grpquouta is for groups\n\n\n*Create a file for user and/or group: \ntouch /home/aquota.user\ntouch /home/aquota.group\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The files need to be owned by root and have 600 as permissions\nsudo chown root:root /home/aquota.user\nsudo chown root:root /home/aquota.group\nsudo chmod 600 /home/aquota.user\nsudo chmod 600 /home/aquota.group\n\n\n*reboot or remount the partition. \n\n*command quotaon -av will enable quota\n\n*command edquota -u {user_id} will let you edit them where {user_id} is the id of the user.

All this runs on ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS, kernel 3.13.0-36 (in a VirtualBox, if you ask)\nI have an issue with volume control: as the playlist goes to a new song, the global volume (master and pcm) is boosted up, but as the playlist progress to another ogg/mp3 track, the volume is not restored and the playout is now too loud. xmms2 is configured with output.plugin = pulse.\nThe curious thing is that if I use e.g. alsamixer to move volume by e.g. -5% then +5%, i'm back to a global volume that is much lower than what was playing, as if actual volume setting and mixer volume were no longer in sync.\nWhat coud explain this behaviour? Where should I start investigating ? \n\nA: I still cannot comment on how xmms2 handles the situation, but switching back to \"Analog Output / No Amplifier\" in gnome-control-center fixed the issue and there are no longer hard bumps in volume when switching to the next song. The volume controls of e.g. alsamixer also behave as expected.\n", "Q: Mounting Error at bootup How do I solve \n\nAn error occurred while mounting /mnt/AA99-3674\n  keys:Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery\"\n\nNote: I have had this message at boot up for a while and I have not had any problems but now when I try to login my screen messes up and goes back to the login screen for every user account\nThe last 2 lines of the /etc/fstab is\n\nUUID=5400a303-8697-4819-8395-e93a4970ed6c none    swap sw   0    0\n  /dev/disk/by-uuid/AA99-3674, auto nosuid, nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0\n\n\nA: sudo nano /etc/fstab\nlocate the line relative to your AA99-3674 drive and remove it.

A recent change I did make was trying to change my default file browser from Nautilus to Krusader using the top answer in this post.

So it's not a bug, it's accidentally for example hitting the shortcut key to enable the High Contrast mode.\nIt's made more confusing by the fact/bug that it's not really well working as a high contrast mode since the mode does not fit well to the Ubuntu's / unity-greeter's default background. Another confusing element is the disappearance of the user background, which feels like a bug while actually it's probably designed to force correct high contrast text if some original Lightdm default background would be used instead of the Ubuntu background.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS on Sony Vaio SVS1513C5E I decided to clean up my 3y old Windows HDD and install Ubuntu again but I'm out of practice and have forgotten most of things I did last time I installed.\nI do remember having issues with cooling fan being loud last time I had Ubuntu installed. \nAny idea how to fix it?

You can reinstall Ubuntu on your computer (over your previous install, which you are suggesting isn't working).\nWhen you install Ubuntu, the install process automatically installs a working Grub boot manager.  During this install (of Grub) it will automatically detect all installed versions of Linux and Windows and add them to your boot menu.\nAfter you complete the install you'll have a menu option of booting either to Windows or Linux.\nBy the way, since you said you previously had Ubuntu installed, when you perform your new Ubuntu install if you choose the option not to reformat your install partition, it will preserve the personal data you had from your previous Linux install.\nAfter your new install of Ubuntu you can configure grub to default to booting to your preferred OS (Windows or Linux).  This can be done via the configuration files that resides on your Linux installed partition.\nYou can do this by editing /etc/default/grub... then running sudo update-grub.\n\nA: Please review Ubuntu - How to reinstall GRUB2. Please be sure to have a backup of your data! Reinstalling grub on a dualboot system might cause loss of data. So be sure what commands you execute and think about possible consequences.\n", "Q: Optimal version of Linux for T61 laptops I have some Lenovo T61 laptops, which I want to convert to Linux (from WinXP or Win7).

That laptop comes standard with anywhere between 512mb - 2gb of RAM. If you are on the lower end I would recommend Lubuntu, or possibly Xubuntu. If that is the t61-P version it will have double the standard video 128mb RAM making it 256 with a slightly faster gpu core. If you have the P version and want regular Ubuntu desktop I think its a safe try. If it is not the P version you might want to start off with Lubu or Xubu. The latest 15.xx versions should work just fine any way your go. \nThere should be no need to change the bios or bios settings on that specific laptop to run Linux. \n\nA: I'm using Xubuntu 15.10 on my T61 with 3GB of memory. It works just fine. But I installed the Middleton-BIOS and inserted a SATAII-harddrive which made it a little more responsive. \nAfter much hassle I managed to install thinkfan so that the fan is quieter.\nSo, I think most distros with a lightweight DE will work.\n", "Q: Merge partial mirror into reprepro distribution I'm looking to include a few packages from an ubuntu mirror into my own custom apt repository.\nContext:\nUsing Reprepro, I currently have the following distribution:\nOrigin: Private Repository\nLabel: Private Repository\nDescription: Private Repository\nSuite: production\nCodename: trusty\nComponents: main\nArchitectures: amd64\nSignWith: A1AAA1A\n\nOur custom package gets included with:\nreprepro -b . includedeb trusty <packagename>\n\nProblem:\nWhat I'm looking to do is to add the libre2-1 packages from http://eu-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/vivid/universe/ into the same distribution, but I can't figure out how to do this.

I am currently running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, and although those who maintain GNOME for Ubuntu claim that they do update the wallpapers every new release, either it's not updating, or it just looks so similar it is almost unnoticeable. So I am wondering if there is any easy way for me to install the current Ubuntu (with Unity) wallpapers on Ubuntu GNOME so that they will also show up in the Backgrounds section in the gnome-control-center along with the other wallpaper that comes with Ubuntu GNOME? Is there like a package or something that comes with them in it? Or how can I do it without just install the normal Ubuntu and copying them over from there?\n\nA: In order to get the wallpaper used in Ubuntu (with Unity) run (replacing <release> with the appropriate release name, for instance, you could replace it with wily or trusty to get the wallpaper loaded with 14.04 or 15.10):\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-wallpapers-<release>\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 : wifi, change DHCP to static I'm trying to install a mail server (using Postfix) on an Ubuntu VM.

My apologies if there's too much code, I'm just not sure where the problem lies;\nThe headers for the request are;\nRequest URL:http://server-01.jjnetwork/\nRequest Method:GET\nStatus Code:403 Forbidden\nRemote Address:127.0.0.1:80\n\nThis seems odd, I'm not sure why it's getting the remote address as 127.0.1.1 This makes me think it may be a dns problem.\nHowever, from my local terminal, I can ping the server thus;\njoemiller@joemiller:/ > ping server-01.jjnetwork\nPING server-01.jjnetwork (192.168.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from server-01.jjnetwork (192.168.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.53 ms\n64 bytes from server-01.jjnetwork (192.168.0.2): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=2.02 ms\n64 bytes from server-01.jjnetwork (192.168.0.2): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.49 ms\n64 bytes from server-01.jjnetwork (192.168.0.2): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=2.02 ms\n^C\n--- server-01.jjnetwork ping statistics ---\n4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3004ms\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.496/1.767/2.020/0.254 ms\n\nSo I assume the domain name is being correctly resolved. I've checked this via a dig query, directed at the server;\njoemiller@joemiller:/ > nslookup server-01.jjnetwork 192.168.0.2\nServer:         192.168.0.2\nAddress:        192.168.0.2#53\n\nName:   server-01.jjnetwork\nAddress: 192.168.0.2\nName:   server-01.jjnetwork\nAddress: 127.0.1.1\nName:   server-01.jjnetwork\nAddress: 127.0.0.1\n\nMy hosts file contains this;\nroot@server-01:/home/joemiller# grep -o '^[^#]*' /etc/hosts\n127.0.0.1       localhost server-01\n127.0.1.1       server-01\n192.168.0.2       server-01\n::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\nHere is my dnsmasq configuration;\nroot@server-01:/home/joemiller# grep -o '^[^#]*' /etc/dnsmasq.conf\ndomain-needed\nbogus-priv\nresolv-file=/etc/resolv.dnsmasq.conf\nlocal=/jjnetwork/\ninterface=eth0\nlisten-address=127.0.0.1\nlisten-address=192.168.0.2\nbind-interfaces\nexpand-hosts\ndomain=jjnetwork\ndhcp-range=192.168.0.10,192.168.0.150,120h\ndhcp-authoritative\nlog-dhcp\n\nThe server 192.168.0.2 is getting its ip address statically, which I think may be part of the problem. My interfaces file looks like this;\nroot@server-01:/home/joemiller# grep -o '^[^#]*' /etc/network/interfaces\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto ppp0\niface ppp0 inet wvdial\n        provider Defaults\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 192.168.0.2\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        network 192.168.0.0\n        broadcast 192.168.0.255\n\nCan anyone shed any light on what the problem might be, and what I can do to fix it?\n\nA: I found the solution to this. The problem lies in my /etc/hosts file on the server. I've changed it to this, and everything now works fine.\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n127.0.1.1       localhost\n192.168.0.2       server-01.jjnetwork       server-01\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\ndnsmasq seems to have been returning the first record it finds as the result of a dns query. In my case, it was 127.0.1.1 which the local box seems to have been re-routing to 127.0.0.1, hence the error.\n", "Q: Email sent out from server is just me@servername, not me@domain.com I'm successfully sending out email from a server using Postfix smtpd, but on the receiving end, the emails are just coming from dan@emerson (emerson is the name of the originating host), and not dan@mydomain.com. Thus they get put in spam. In main.cf I've set mydomain and myorigin to \"mydomain.com\" (the real domain withheld).

What does \"owned by OS\" mean?  How can I make it so pip can work on these packages?\n\nA: I don't know what the problem might be with django, but you can't remove pip with itself, like you can with apt. \nYou'll need to run sudo apt-get remove pip pip3 or, if you want to purge system configurations, sudo apt-get purge pip pip3 (if you have pip3 installed).\nAs for django, for which you didn't provide the output, it's possible it's also installable by apt, and you can use the method above.\nIf that's not sufficient for you, you can do something like sudo find . -name '*django*' -exec rm -rf {} \\+, or so, which will remove permanently all files which have django anywhere in their name.\n", "Q: How to remove Kali Linux base from Ubuntu I have mistakenly installed Katoolin in my Ubuntu 15.10.

Next, insert an Ubuntu DVD/USB into your computer and boot to it. Finally, go through the installation process and you should be good.\n", "Q: Properly set up java development environment I am a java developer mainly coding on win environment. I am planning to move to Ubuntu and I would like to know what is the best way to setup my jave, ide, maven and others.\nUnder Windows I would typically have a D:\\dev dir (note D:\\ is an SSD drive) in which I put apache-tomcat, apache-maven jdk and so on, but under linux (ubuntu) the directory hierarchy seems to be very important.\nIf I correctly understand I should install my eclipse and servers under /opt and maybe /usr/local.

I plan to use it as a headless web server. How can I install Ubuntu server on the sd card? \n\nA: Currently Ubuntu server exists only for AMD64 architecture. Raspberry however is an ARM device, and for that purpose exits snappy. It is however somewhat different, it doesn't use apt but rather uses snappy, the new transactional package management. According to Mark Shuttleworth with 16.04 however there should be apt and dpkg available for snappy available. Personally, I've been using it with docker. But as of now there is lack of packages for ARM architecture. You can try Arch linux for raspberry but as of now, Ubuntu Snappy and Mate are two best choices the Ubuntu community can offer\n\nA: I'd look into Raspbian Jessie Lite, which is a no-GUI version of Raspbian. Being based on Debian, it is pretty close to Ubuntu and APT is ready to go. Also, Raspbian is the best supported OS for the Pi, so there's no shortage of help on how to optimize it for server usage.\n", "Q: Can't boot on Win 8 after installing Ubuntu : \"A required device isn’t connected or can’t be accessed\" I have a lot of troubles setting up a dual boot on my new computer.\nAfter I set up and wired up the hardware I installed W8 as I guessed it would be harder to install with Ubuntu already installed.\nI created 2 partitions 15GB for Ubuntu and 95GB for W8.\nThen I installed Ubuntu 14.04, carrebully following the dual boot installation guide from french Ubuntu site\nGrub was showing up with 5 entries, Ubuntu, Memory test x2, W8 loader, W8 recovery. I'm able to boot smoothly on Ubuntu but not on W8 : I get a \"A required device isn’t connected or can’t be accessed.\" error.\n--\nI googled a lot of stuff and tried differents ways to fix it but I still can't make it :(\n\n\n*\n\n*I ran boot-repair (here's the report)\n\n*I disabled FastBoot / SecureBoot in my BIOS\n\n*I changed my BIOS to Legacy mode\n\n*I tried to repair W8 with Windows Recovery tools : nothing working, I can't even start the repair process\n\n*I ran chkdsk, it reported no error\n\n\n--\nOther informations that might help : \n\n\n*\n\n*os-prober returns / detects nothing \n\n*os detection from Windows Recovery tools detects nothing\n\n*\n*\n\n*not 100% sure : I might forgot to turn off W8 hibernate feature before installing Ubuntu\n\n\n*Here are my full hardware details\n\nA: Your configuration is strange, and that strangeness may hide a problem. You have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two hard disks (no problem there).\n\n*It appears that /dev/sdc is a Windows installation disk that you haven't unplugged. This also is not a real problem.\n\n*/dev/sda is partitioned with MBR and seems to hold Windows. This implies that Windows is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode; however, the MBR of the disk holds SYSLINUX, not the Windows boot loader.\n\n*/dev/sdb is partitioned using GPT and seems to hold Ubuntu. It has a BIOS Boot Partition, which also implies a BIOS-mode installation of Ubuntu.\n\n\nAlthough it's legal to mix MBR and GPT, and to use GPT on a disk that boots Linux in EFI mode, this setup is unconventional. The fact that SYSLINUX is on the MBR of /dev/sda may be an issue, although IIRC, SYSLINUX can chainload to a Windows boot loader located elsewhere.\nIt's possible that your Windows recovery tools are being thrown by the GPT /dev/sdb. If so, unplugging it and attempting a recovery may work. You could also try asking about this on a Windows forum, since the Windows boot failure is basically a Windows issue. (Although the presence of SYSLINUX might be part of the problem, the solution if this is the case will be to re-install the Windows boot loader on /dev/sda, which is a Windows-specific solution.)\nIf you can't get that to work, you could switch your approach radically and re-install both Windows and Ubuntu in EFI mode: Disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in the firmware, wipe both disks clean, and re-install both OSes. (It is possible to convert both from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode booting, but that will likely take more effort than re-installing.) See my page on the subject for why the CSM can create problems. I don't think the CSM is fundamentally the issue for you, but switching to an EFI-mode boot will likely bypass whatever the issue actually is, so it's worth trying if you can't find another solution.\n", "Q: Postfix / Dovecot configure email for non-existing user My postfix / dovecot installation is already configured to accept mail for me@A.com.

After using my pc, my eyes feel really tired. The problem? I have an LED monitor so it's not the technology that's the problem, ubuntu is the problem. Xorg to be more specific.\nThis actually only happens in linux.\nIn windows 7 I don't have any problem with this.\nIt is very strange and I don't know what to do.\nPlease help I want to use ubuntu again... without my eyes burning D:\nThe only thing that I know is this:\nhttps://veuwer.com/i/3kgn\nBut this seems specialized. Is a 59 framerate normal?\nIs my monitor incompatible?\nThanks for your help.\nMy monitor is a samsung s19d300\n\nA: 59.79 is really 60. Sometimes refresh rates are off of 60 by a tiny bit, but it shouldn't matter. Any visual fatigue you're experiencing could be fixed by using a different desktop environment, such as GNOME, MATE, KDE, or LXDE. You could also try using a background with slightly dimmer colors.\nHowever, I feel that eye fatigue is somewhat subjective. If you experience it while using your computer, I recommend maybe seeing an eye doctor or taking a break from the screen for a while. There really isn't a catchall fix (and I've honestly never heard of anyone complain of this before), but here are some more things you can try:\nF.lux -- Puts a yellow tint over whatever the computer is displaying - good at night.\nLower your screen brightness -- Ubuntu might actually make your screen brighter than Windows or something weird like that.  \nSuggestion from hbdgaf: If you have a webcam, you can try this program, which adjusts your screen brightness automatically based on the amount of light your webcam sees. For people that have a problem focusing on two different lighting conditions, this problem would happen mostly at night/in dark surroundings.  Darker colors do the same thing.  Dull the differential between your screen and the background.  \nI said it before, but a different desktop environment really might help. GNOME and MATE both use darker colors than Unity.\nIncrease your font size. Maybe your computer's font is too small. Refer here for more info.\n\nHopefully one of those helps. Since it's really a problem with your eyes or configuration, we can't provide a definitive answer.\n", "Q: Audacity Keeps Crashing I'm running the latest version of audacity and the playback keeps crashing when I try to pause it.

I'm running Ubuntu 15.04 with the Hauppauge 2250 TV tuner. Unfortunately, the driver/module for the 2250, \"saa7164\", is not compatible with suspend/resume so live TV will not work after resuming. So I'm using the following file to stop/resume tvheadend and saa7164:\nsudo gedit /lib/systemd/system-sleep/50_tvheadend\n\nWhich contains the following scipt:\n#!/bin/sh\ncase \"$1\" in\n  pre/*)\n    echo \"Entering sleep...\" >  /tmp/sleep.log\n    echo \"Entering sleep\"\n    cat /proc/acpi/wakeup >> /tmp/sleep.log\n    service tvheadend stop\n    sleep 1\n    modprobe -r tveeprom\n    modprobe -r dvb_core\n    modprobe -r v4l2_common\n    modprobe -r videodev\n    modprobe -r saa7164\n    sleep 3\n    echo \"After modprobe...\"  >> /tmp/sleep.log\n    cat /proc/acpi/wakeup >> /tmp/sleep.log\n    ;;\n  post/*)\n    echo \"Awaking from sleep...\" >>  /tmp/sleep.log\n    echo \"Waking up\"\n    modprobe saa7164\n    modprobe videodev\n    modprobe v4l2_common\n    modprobe dvb_core\n    modprobe tveeprom\n    sleep 3\n    echo \"After modprobe...\"  >> /tmp/sleep.log\n    service tvheadend start\n    sleep 1\n        \\cat /proc/acpi/wakeup >> /tmp/sleep.log\n    ;;\nesac\n\nFor good measure, I made the file executable by everyone:\nsudo chmod 755 /lib/systemd/system-sleep/50_tvheadend\n\nBut this didn't work. So I ran the commands to start and stop tvheadend in terminal, which worked. But when I tried to stop the saa7164 driver in terminal using \"modprobe -r saa7164\", it errored. So I followed these instructions on how to unload a kernel module which is in use, but my script attempted to unload all the modules listed in \"lsmod | grep saa7164\" and failed. So I attempted to run the commands in terminal, as follows: \nhtpc@htpc-desktop:~$ sudo modprobe -r saa7164\nmodprobe: FATAL: Module saa7164 is in use\n\nhtpc@htpc-desktop:~$ lsmod | grep saa7164\nsaa7164               131072  -1\ntveeprom               24576  1 saa7164\ndvb_core              126976  1 saa7164\nv4l2_common            16384  1 saa7164\nvideodev              159744  2 saa7164,v4l2_common\n\nhtpc@htpc-desktop:~$ sudo modprobe -r tveeprom\nmodprobe: FATAL: Module tveeprom is in use.\n\nhtpc@htpc-desktop:~$ lsmod | grep tveeprom\ntveeprom               24576  1 saa7164\n\nHow do I unload the saa7164 driver/module?\n\nA: I think you also need to stop any program that is using the module, before you remove it. You aren't running MythTV by any chance?\n\nA: You can try to unload the driver by stopping the service that is using it, or by disabling the use of the driver in the system settings. To do this, try running the following commands:\nsudo rmmod saa7164\nsudo rmmod tveeprom\n\nIf the above command fails, try using the force option:\nsudo rmmod -f saa7164\nsudo rmmod -f tveeprom\n\nf the above command also fails, you can try to blacklist the driver from being loaded at boot time. You can do this by adding the following lines to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:\nblacklist saa7164\nblacklist tveeprom\n\nSave and close the file, then restart your system. The driver should not load at boot time, and you should be able to unload it.\n", "Q: Lenovo ThinkPad E550 Touchpad Not Working After Forced Shutdown (Ubuntu 14.04) I am having issues with my touchpad in Ubuntu 14.04. I was running a simulation which caused my computer to slow down too much to even be able to abort the code, so I was forced to use the power button to shutdown my laptop. Ubuntu had asked me to restart my computer to finish updating, but I decided to restart later (I feel like this may be related, but I really don't know). Ever since I started up my computer after this event, I have been unable to use my trackpad. My left, middle, and right mouse buttons work, but the trackpad does not register any movement (it also cannot zoom, scroll, etc.) When I use xinput in the terminal, it still reads \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS DualPoint TouchPad\" (other things I've seen apparently recognize the touchpad as a PS/2 generic mouse, but that is not the case for me). I've been searching around the internet and trying a slew of different proposed solutions, but none of them have helped at all.  Does anyone know how I might be able to fix this? Thank you!\nEdit: I'm dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, and on Windows the touchpad works perfectly fine. There has been no physical damage done to my touchpad and the laptop is only a couple months old.\n\nA: After much struggling, I found a solution that worked for me, and will hopefully work for others who run into a similar issue. Following the instructions here, I removed all my alps folders in /usr/src/ and finished the instructions to no avail (I did install everything like they said and it's still in /usr/src/, so it may've helped). After deleting the folders, neither my trackpad nor the pointing stick nub on my keyboard would work (an external USB mouse still worked). I then ran sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics-dev as described here. I rebooted my computer, and both my touchpad and the pointing stick nub work again! I didn't even need to do anything else described in the second link. I hope that someone, somewhere may find this helpful one day!\n", "Q: How can I convert a .jpg or .png image to .raw format?

Edit: This is different from the suggested duplicate. The suggested duplicate is about viruses and antivirus in general. This question is specifically about encryption ransomware, how it can run, and whether it will affect encrypted folders.\nThese days, malicious software seems to be infecting Windows computers, encrypting their data against their will, and asking for a Bitcoin ransom in exchange for the encryption key.\nI suppose it may be unlikely that anyone would code ransomware for Linux, but let's say someone did:\nIn order for such a software to run \"successfully\" on an Ubuntu machine, would the user first have to run it and give the sudo password? Is such a threat conceivable on Ubuntu without the user doing this?\nIf the users files were already encrypted, would that protect against this? Could a ransomware program, if unwittingly installed by a user (who also confirmed with the sudo password), take even your pre-encrypted data hostage?\nIn general, how (in)vulnerable is Ubuntu to encryption ransomware, and how careless/unsavvy do the actions of a user have to be in order to actually have his or hers data taken hostage?\n\nA: \nIn order for such a software to run \"successfully\" on an Ubuntu machine, would the user first have to run it and give the sudo password?\n\nRun it, yes, of course. Give the sudo password, no. The sudo password is needed in order to modify system files or settings. However, ransomware encrypts the user's personal files, which are fully accessible by the user without a password. The sudo password would be needed to encrypt files of other users, however.\n\nIf the users files were already encrypted, would that protect against this?\n\nNo. The ransomware would encrypt the encrypted files, so that when you try to decrypt them with your original key, decryption would not work. Pictorially, you lock your files inside a box (of which you have the key), and the ransomware locks your box inside a larger box, of which you do not have the key.\n\nA: \nIn order for such a software to run \"successfully\" on an Ubuntu machine, would the user first have to run it and give the sudo password? \n\nNo, I would assume the data is your personal data and \"sudo\" is needed for system files. \n\nIf the users files were already encrypted, would that protect against this? \n\nNo. Data is data. Encryption plays no part: the ransomware will lock the data itself\n\nCould a ransomware program, if unwittingly installed by a user (who also confirmed with the sudo password), take even your pre-encrypted data hostage?\n\nYes. They would not be able to VIEW the data but that was not their intention.  Nor is encryption in any way important: they lock your \"container\". \n\nIn general, how (in)vulnerable is Ubuntu to encryption ransomware, and how careless/unsavvy do the actions of a user have to be in order to actually have his or hers data taken hostage?\n\nSomeone first has to create a situation where you and many others are willing to download and install their software. That is a hurdle even virus software writers have not been able to take.\nThe whole idea of ransomware is to target as many users as possible in the shortest time frame possible. \nAs soon as 1 Linux user gets targeted and they actually get his/her data tainted all hell would break loose and within minutes all of us will get informed in some sort of way. Look at what happened when the OpenSSL bug appeared. In a matter of minutes all the IT websites had a story to tell. Same with the kernel bug that appeared 2 days ago. Everyone jumped on it. If it happens I do not see this happening to more than a few users. By then all of us got informed or if possible there will be a fix for the method they used (like a hole in the kernel or in a browser that they exploited). \nMost of us use Ubuntu Software Center. How likely is it that this malware ends up in Ubuntu Software Center? Next we use PPAs. The information for those PPAs we get from sites like omg.ubuntu.co.uk or webupd8 or from trusted Ubuntu channels. \nThat is also the difference between Linux/Ubuntu and Windows: Windows users are told to download and install software from any website they can find it. We mostly do not do that. So the amount of crap you can download for Windows is several times higher than for any other operating system. Makes Windows an easier target.\n", "Q: Apache2 change localhost directory on Ubuntu 14.04 After a fresh install of Ubuntu, I am trying to change the localhost directory of Apache2 (2.4.7).

That is the best solution currently available for Linux, but it introduces multiple bugs (across the board, not just in the window manager) whenever your arrangement does not fill up the desktop with actual screen space. I have used multiple monitors on Linux for about 6 years now, and the only good workaround I have found is to use the same resolution on all my monitors (in your case 1920x1080 is the recommended resolution for both monitors).\n", "Q: How to launch a Chromium app from the terminal?

It was running Windows 10. It had a 1TB hard drive, and in Windows 10 the C: drive had 892 GB and the D: drive had 25GB. I decided to install Ubuntu. I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit. In the installation wizard, when it detected Windows Boot Manager, I chose to boot alongside Windows. It showed me a 957GB partition, and I allocated 351 GB to Windows and 606GB to Ubuntu. The installation worked fine. Ubuntu was running smoothly for about a week and a half, after which I experienced some problems. I messed around with some things, and I eventually caused Ubuntu to become unusable. I booted into Windows and tried to delete Ubuntu and return my laptop to the state it was in pre-installation. I went to computer management and deleted the Ubuntu partitions, and the C: drive returned to 892GB. However, in the UEFI settings \"ubuntu\" still existed, and booting into it showed a weird GRUB BASH command line. On entering \"exit\" pressing enter I was given a menu that looked like the UEFI boot menu, where I was given a choice of booting into Windows Boot Manager, which I did. I tried installing Ubuntu again, but this time when I chose to boot alongside the Windows Boot Manager, it showed me a partition where 18.7GB was allocated to Ubuntu and about 8GB was allocated to something called \"Files\". I went back and chose \"Something Else\". I saw my 1TB hard drive, which had 957 GB, and chose ext2 and mounted \"/\". \"Format drive\" was selected. On clicking \"Install now\", a warning was given that there was no swap space. I decided against installation. My question is, is there anyway to bring back the first partition, where it was Windows against Ubuntu in the 957 GB hard drive?\nAlso, is there anyway to permanently remove the first Ubuntu installation?\n\nA: There was a way to permanently delete Ubuntu Partition by clicking on 'something else' in Ubuntu installation option. Now you select 'Manual partition' see carefully all the partitions on your drive.\nand then you will find the Ubuntu partition and then you format it by selecting the Ubuntu partition and then you will met some options then you click on 'format this volume'. Now you have deleted it permanently. If you want to install Ubuntu manually you need to create a swap area, which should be a size of your Ram (approximately).  \nIf you get grub when you power-on your laptop, Then it is suggested that you don't delete Ubuntu rather install on the existing one itself.\nI hope this was helpful.\n", "Q: Is There any Problems with installing vlc in laptop causing damage for laptop speakers Is there any problem with installing vlc in laptops there is a hipe that installing vlc in laptops will cause a severe damage to speakers of laptop\n\nA: It looks like this belief is due to stupid customer support using it as an excuse to make a laptop's warranty void, and charge the customer. \nYou can safely install VLC, it won't harm your speakers. Aside from the fact that VLC developers are not fools, speakers' power output is set in the firmware, and can't be arbitrarily changed to an excessive value by a program so to damage them. \n\nA: Maybe this might be due to the fact that VLC actually allows you to \"boost\" the volume to 200%, although I don't think anybody actually pushes it to the limit as the quality decreases. Anyway, I think that might be the reason why VLC has been pointed out (same goes to GOM player anyway).
